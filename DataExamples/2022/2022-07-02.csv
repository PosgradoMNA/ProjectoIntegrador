The standings at the end of each round featured several three- and four-way ties. But Chen Yiwen led after each of the five rounds to amass 366.9 points and capture China’s 11th world title in 11 events so far in Budapest.

Fifty-nine of the 60 dives in the 12-woman final carried a DD of 3.0 or 3.1. The only athlete who dared to add risk was Sayaka Mikami of Japan whose final dive a 5154B (double twisting 2½) would have multiplied her score by 3.4. Mikami was in second place after four dives but the risk was costly. As she entered the water she was bent at the waist and still twisting. She earned 20.40 points and placed 7th.

Instead Canada’s Mia Vallee claimed the silver (to accompany the bronze medal she earned in the 1-meter event). She finished 37.9 points behind Chen.

“I can’t say I ever would have imagined coming to these world championships to have these results” Vallee said. “My goals were to make finals in both events. And here we stand two medals later.

After earning the 1-meter bronze Vallee said “I was a lot more calm and a lot more centered. Going into the final round [of the 3-meter] I just wanted to be proud of my diving. I was extremely confused when I came out of the water and everybody was cheering so hard especially when my scores came up. Then it hit me when somebody said ‘You’ve got to get changed for medals.’”

Chang Yani added a bronze for China jumping from fifth place to third on her final dive – matching the 72.00 points awarded to her winning teammate Chen for the same final dive. In fact both Chinese divers performed an identical dive list in identical order. So did American Sarah Bacon who was trying to win the first medal in the event since 1982. (Bacon placed fifth hurt by her second and third dive.)

Chen’s victory was the eleventh consecutive victory for China in the women’s 3-meter event. It should be noted that Guo Jingjing won the first five titles in a row (2001-2009) and Shi Tingmao contributed the last three (2015-2019).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHA6Ly9lbi5wZW9wbGUuY24vbjMvMjAyMi8wNzAyL2M5MDAwMC0xMDExODEzMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Highlights of women's 3m springboard semifinal of diving at FINA Worlds,"Highlights of women's 3m springboard semifinal of diving at FINA Worlds

It was another winning day for the Chinese diving team at the FINA world championships as Chen Yiwen sailed to the women's 3m springboard gold on Saturday.

The 23-year-old led throughout the final hitting 366.90 points to win the 11th diving gold for China at the worlds.

""It was the penultimate day of the tournament and all of my teammates had won the golds in the previous events so it gave me some pressure going into the final today"" said Chen who won her first worlds gold in 1m springboard three years ago in Gwangju South Korea.

Another Chinese diver Chang Yani moved up from fifth place to win the bronze with a flawless last dive which earned her 72 points and a total of 325.85 from five rounds. Canada's Mia Vallee took the silver with 329 points.

""I'm not satisfied with my performance today it was not the normal level of my dives. I was so nervous in the competition and I should improve my mentality when facing such big tournaments"" said the 20-year-old. ""In the second and fourth rounds I made some errors.""

The United States won the gold medal of women's water polo after beating hosts Hungary 9-7.

The Hungarian team played nervously and made too many errors for a final but the 6000 mostly Hungarian fans at the Hajos swimming arena did not seem to mind and cheered the silver medalists as real heroes.

In the bronze game the Dutch women beat their Italian opponents 7-5.

Sunday will be the last day of the Budapest swimming worlds. The event will bid farewell with two finals in diving: the women's 3m springboard synchronized and the men's 10m platform. Also on Sunday Italy will meet Spain in the men's water polo final.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9zcG9ydC8xOTA3NjQ2OC9ibGFja2J1cm4tam9uLWRhaGwtdG9tYXNzb24tM20tbWFsbW8tYW5lbC1haG1lZGhvZHppYy_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvc3BvcnQvMTkwNzY0NjgvYmxhY2tidXJuLWpvbi1kYWhsLXRvbWFzc29uLTNtLW1hbG1vLWFuZWwtYWhtZWRob2R6aWMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Blackburn boss Jon Dahl Tomasson ready to splash £3m on Malmo centre-half Anel Ahmedhodzic from...,"ZIC OF IT New Blackburn boss Jon Dahl Tomasson ready to splash £3m on Malmo centre-half Anel Ahmedhodzic from promotion bid

Greg Abbott: Texas' public high school graduation rate is at 90% overall

PolitiFact Texas ruling: True

Here's why: Gov. Greg Abbott's reelection campaign lauded education in Texas with a May 15 video touting Blue Ribbon public schools U.S. News ranking four Texas high schools among the top 50 STEM high schools and the Texas public high school graduation rate.

""Governor @GregAbbott_TX has lead education to a brighter future"" Abbott's campaign Twitter account @TexansforAbbott's tweeted ""That's why Texas' public high school graduation rate is at 90% overall.""

Does Texas have a 90% high school graduation rate? State data supports the Abbott campaign's statistic.

Texas data on high school graduation rates

PolitiFact Texas reached out to Abbott's campaign but did not hear back. However the video credited the Texas Education Agency for the graduation rate statistic.

Of the students who started ninth grade in 2016-2017 scheduled to graduate in 2020 90.3% graduated within four years according to a 2019-2020 report by the agency. This percentage is called the four-year longitudinal graduation rate because it measures how much of a starting ninth grade class completes high school within four years.

The remaining 10% might have continued school received a high school equivalency certificate or dropped out. Abbott's statistic checks out.

Some demographic groups have better graduation rates than others. Economically disadvantaged students graduated 6 percentage points lower (87.5%) than those who were not (93.5%). Compared to state averages there were lower graduation rates and higher dropout rates for students in special education programs and students identified as learning English as a second language.

Graduation rates as a campaign point

Abbott and his predecessor Rick Perry have long rallied around their work on education and touted Texas' high school graduation rate.

In 2018 Abbott said Texas ranked among the nation's top five states for its high school graduation rate. PolitiFact Texas found that to be True. In 2015 and 2013 PolitiFact rated statements by Perry to be Mostly True that Texas' high school graduation rates were third-highest in the nation. In 2011 Texas tied with five states for that title of No. 3.

Texas was ahead of the national average graduation rate at 86% in 2018-2019 according to the National Center for Education Statistics. It was among eight states with a 90% or higher graduation rate.

In the mid-2000s Texas took an aggressive approach to turning around high schools that were not graduating at least 60% of its senior class said Jacob Kirksey assistant professor of educational psychology leadership and counseling at Texas Tech University. Many states including Texas saw gains around this time because of the No Child Left Behind Act. High schools later also adopted career- and college-readiness models. The state education system under Abbott continued this effort that began during Perry's leadership.

""Compared to other states I think Texas is not afraid to make changes and to try things out which I think is a really important and powerful perspective to have in policy"" Kirksey said. ""At the end of the day Texas is improving on all metrics with respect to graduation rates and attrition rates.""

Our ruling

Gov. Greg Abbott's campaign tweeted ""That's why Texas' public high school graduation rate is at 90% overall"" accompanying a video touting K-12 and higher education wins.

That matches data from the Texas Education Agency so we rate this as True.

Greg Abbott must still be smarting from that moment at the Republican leadership’s infamous May 25 press conference in Uvalde when Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke approached the stage and interrupted the carefully scripted event to tell the governor “The time to stop the next shooting is right now and you are doing nothing. … It’s on you!”

O’Rourke was escorted out of the room by law enforcement officers paralyzed the previous day when faced with an active shooter while Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick shouted down and Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin cursed O’Rourke for his unscheduled appearance and blunt remarks.

Never mind that Abbott has had to eat most of his words from that press conference as one assertion after another about the school shooting that left 19 young children and two of their teachers dead at Robb Elementary School later proved false or inaccurate.

Fast forward to June 27 when authorities in San Antonio discovered an abandoned tractor-trailer near Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland full of dead Mexican and Central American migrants with the death toll now standing at 53.

The news had hardly broken that Monday night when Abbott tweeted: “These deaths are on Biden. They are the result of his deadly open border policies. They show the deadly consequences of his refusal to enforce the law.”

Hmm. O’Rourke was somehow disrespectful in his Uvalde response but Abbott was justified to engage in his own finger-pointing?

I’ve been working on living near or visiting the Texas-Mexico border since first moving to Brownsville in 1975. The border has never had a greater federal law enforcement presence than now. It’s never been harder to gain entry legally or illegally. Open borders governor?

Amid such partisan hypocrisy the least Abbott could have done is thank Beto for copying his bull’s eye J’accuse.

Meanwhile amid his tweets the governor somehow forgot to mention the billions of dollars he has ordered spent on his own failed militarization of the border. The centerpiece of that failure was the April debacle when Abbott ordered all trucks crossing the border into Texas from the south to be stopped and searched for drugs and migrants. Commerce ground to a halt for days on end as traffic on international bridges was frozen for hours.

Zero drug or contraband seizures. No truckloads of migrants. Nothing to justify the economic and social damage. Yet now Abbott has ordered even more money spent on mobile state inspection units that will soon be cruising roadways north of the border randomly stopping vehicles in search of migrants.

We know Abbott harbors ambitions to be the next Republican president. Can’t he at least wait before he drains the state treasury pretending to be responsible for border security?

If only those billions had been spent on public schools mental health services and other critical needs in the state. Unfortunately kids don’t vote. Neither do most people living in poverty. As Abbott continues his campaign of demonizing migrants and by extension people from south of the border he is placing a sure bet on the white voters in Texas who have kept him in office and on the state payroll 26 years and counting.

His campaign fodder is piling up right on schedule.

The violence poverty and corruption gripping Mexico and Central America that have sent hundreds of thousands of desperate families and individuals to the United States seeking refuge know no political party. San Antonio saw thousands of Central American migrants released along the U.S.-Mexico border stream into the city during the years Donald Trump served as president.

Abbott somehow neglected to take to Twitter to blame Trump at the time. Yes the crisis continues under Biden although the U.S. Supreme Court’s Thursday ruling affirming the president’s right to cancel Trump’s “remain in Mexico” policy should eventually ease the pileup along the border as asylum-seekers are once again processed by federal courts.

Comprehensive immigration reform has eluded the two political parties for decades and particularly since the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks upended efforts by President George W. Bush to push through meaningful reforms. No one has an answer to address conditions in Central America still reeling from the Cold War militarization of corrupt repressive regimes by the United States in the 1980s.

American voters would surely welcome an honest effort by the two political parties to work together to explore humane and effective responses to the current crisis. It isn’t going away especially in San Antonio and all the public monies and all the partisan rhetoric by state leaders in Texas will not change that reality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkd2Vlay5vcmcvdGVhY2hpbmctbGVhcm5pbmcvdGVhY2hpbmctaXMtaGFyZC10YWtlLWEtYnJlYWstYWJib3R0LWVsZW1lbnRhcnktc3RhcnMtdXJnZS10ZWFjaGVycy8yMDIyLzA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teaching Is Hard. Take a Break 'Abbott Elementary' Stars Urge Teachers,"Teachers do vital work under difficult conditions—and they must take better care of themselves two of the stars on ABC’s hit workplace comedy “Abbott Elementary” told thousands of teacher leaders and educators on Sunday.

On the first day of the National Education Association’s representative assembly union delegates heard from Tyler James Williams who plays substitute teacher Gregory Eddie and Sheryl Lee Ralph who plays the no-nonsense kindergarten teacher Barbara Howard. “Abbott Elementary” which follows a group of teachers and their principal at a Philadelphia public school has connected with educators across the country who say the sitcom is funny relatable and encouraging .

“When given impossible situations with limited resources and time in every walk of life educators get the job done” Williams said. “Teachers are the most versatile and heroic workforce on the planet. Every functioning member of society owes a debt to you.”

He asked the crowd: “Were you a perfect student? Of course not. You were a gross walking petri dish with the attention span of a goldfish. But against all odds an educator taught you.”

Williams and Ralph both thanked teachers for their work. Playing educators on TV they said has been an honor.

“I don’t need to tell you how strong you’ve got to be to lift your students spiritually mentally and physically on your shoulders” Ralph said. “I don’t need to tell you how outstanding you must be to worry about other people’s children more than you worry about your own at times. I don’t need to tell you about the miracles that you have made happen in your classrooms under sometimes some very stressful situations.”

But educators need to take better care of themselves too Ralph said. (She has some personal experience with teaching beyond the show: Many of her family members are educators including her father who was the first Black male music teacher in Connecticut.)

“Even Superwoman needs to send her cape to the dry cleaner” Ralph said. “Some of you need to take a moment to literally breathe. ... Too many of you are waiting to exhale. You need to take a vacation sometimes. Some of you need to take a break and get out of the classroom.”

Teacher stress has risen over the past few years and job satisfaction has declined  survey results show. Nearly three-fourths of teachers are experiencing frequent job-related stress and 59 percent say they’re burned out according to a recent national survey from the RAND Corporation .

“Remember that none of this really happens the way it should if you don’t feel good about you” Ralph told teachers at the union conference.

“Be good to you” she continued. “The better you are to yourself the better you can be to everybody else.”

“Abbott Elementary” creator Quinta Brunson (who also stars in the show as 2nd grade teacher Janine Teagues) told Education Week in January that her inspiration for the show came from her mother a longtime Philadelphia kindergarten teacher. She said she wanted to honor teachers while also finding the humor in their experiences.

“Schools really represent a moral compass for so many kids. ... These people are like second parents to them and without good teachers who lead many children to healthier lives and give them someone to look up to I think that a lot of kids would struggle” Brunson told EdWeek. ""[T]hat’s the significance of schools like Abbott where you have teachers like a Barbara and a Janine even though she’s annoying to watch on screen. Teachers like Janine mean everything to kids. They change their worlds and change what they think the world can be and what life can be for them.”

The second season of “Abbott Elementary” will premiere Sept. 21.

The actors’ speech was a moment of levity before the delegates began their business which takes place July 3-6 in Chicago.

TEXAS MIGRANT DEATHS: RADIO CHATTER SHOWS OFFICER CALLING FOR HELP WITH ‘TOO MANY BODIES’

GOV. GREG ABBOTT: [It] has never been worse. And it's never been worse because the numbers are higher than they've ever been the problems and challenges are mounting on the other side of the border. But worst of all we are not seeing the president lift a finger to do anything about it… the president has abandoned many of the states all the border states of the United States of America. It's reprehensible.

…

The first reaction is shock. I mean you can't be anything but shocked and stunned whenever you hear anything like that. And it is a horrific tragedy but it also is a byproduct of Biden's border policies. When you don't have a president who's actually enforcing the immigration laws it attracts the cartels and smugglers to do exactly what they did that led to this disaster. And that's why we're calling upon the president to finally finally step up and do your job and secure the border and enforce the immigration laws.

Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection on July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001.

In a letter sent Wednesday Gonzales’ lawyers Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.”

His attorneys have made a separate request to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for a 180-day reprieve related to the kidney donation.

In their request to Abbott Gonzales’ attorneys included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales.

“There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God” Zoosman wrote.

Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined to be an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. The evaluation found Gonzales has a rare blood type meaning his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.

“Virtually all that remains is the surgery to remove Ramiro’s kidney. UTMB has confirmed that the procedure could be completed within a month” Posel and Schonemann wrote to Abbott.

Texas Department of Criminal Justice policies allow inmates to make organ and tissue donations. Agency spokeswoman Amanda Hernandez said Gonzales was deemed ineligible after making a request to be a donor earlier this year. She did not give a reason but Gonzales' lawyers said in their letter that the agency objected because of the pending execution date.

Abbott’s office did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is set to vote July 11 on Gonzales’ request to that agency.

Gonzales’ attorneys have made a separate request asking the board to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.

They also asked that his execution not proceed if his spiritual adviser isn’t allowed to both hold his hand and place another hand on his heart during his execution. A two-day federal trial on this request was set to begin Tuesday in Houston.

Gonzales’ request to delay his execution for an organ donation is rare among death row inmates in the U.S. Robert Dunham executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center said Friday.

In 1995 condemned murderer Steven Shelton in Delaware donated a kidney to his mother.

In 2013 Ronald Phillips’ execution in Ohio was delayed so his request to donate a kidney to his mother could be reviewed. Phillips’ request was later denied and he was executed in 2017.

“Skeptics will think this is simply an attempt to delay the execution. But if that were the case I think you’d be seeing many requests” said Dunham whose group takes no position on capital punishment but has criticized the way states carry out executions. “The history of executions in the United States shows that people don’t make offers of organ donations for the purpose of delaying an execution that will still take place.”

In a report the United Network for Organ Sharing a nonprofit that serves as the nation’s transplant system under contract with the federal government listed various ethical concerns about organ donations from condemned prisoners. They include whether such donations could be tied to prisoners receiving preferential treatment or that such organs could be morally compromised because of their ties to the death penalty.

For the second time in a decade Deloitte has acquired Integrated Enterprise Solutions a Hong Kong-based specialist provider of IT consulting services and solutions.

The global accounting and consulting giant had previously acquired Integrated Enterprise Solutions in 2012 but after five years under Deloitte’s mantle the Hong Kong-based firm returned to independence.

Five years on and Deloitte’s dealmakers have struck again welcoming Integrated Enterprise Solutions’ twelve employees to its technology consulting business.

Established in 1992 Integrated Enterprise Solutions provides services such as business process re-engineering custom systems development and IT infrastructure design and implementation and technology integration. The firm specialises in the public sector with Hong Kong government bureaus and departments its largest clients.

“This acquisition is a powerful match for our existing professional services to government and public services” said David Wu Chief Operating Officer of Deloitte Consulting in China. Integrated Enterprise Solutions has vast experience in systems integration using digital and analytics technologies.”

Edward Au Southern Region Managing Partner at Deloitte in China added: “We look forward to leverage the expertise and experience of their team including their proven track record with the Hong Kong government since 2000 to deliver large scale system transformation projects.”

Earlier this year Deloitte acquired two creative boutiques in Southeast Asia (Pixel People and The Union) and Carbon Care Asia a sustainability consultancy based in Hong Kong.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtdHJhdmVsLzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvYW1leC1nYnQtYW5kLXNoZWxsLWNhbGwtZm9yLWNvbXBhbmllcy10by1idXktc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtYXZpYXRpb24tZnVlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amex GBT and Shell call for companies to buy sustainable aviation fuel – Business Traveller,"Amex GBT and Shell Aviation says that “Once book-and-claim is approved by industry bodies as an acceptable form of emissions reduction Avelia could enable airlines and companies who choose SAF to authenticate record and report the associated emissions reduction benefits of SAF towards their voluntary ESG reporting regardless of where in the world the SAF is used to fuel a flight.”

Currently SAF is two as much as eight times more expensive than jet fuel. To help reduce the price differential many airlines have made commitments to purchase SAF sometimes many years in advance to encourage the development of facilities that can supply the fuel. David Reimer Executive Vice President Global and Multinational clients and Managing Director for the Americas Amex GBT said that there was a need for companies to get involved to drive decarbonisation of the industry and reach ambitious net-zero targets: “If it’s left to individual consumers nothing is going to happen” he said adding that since three per cent of carbon emission are from aviation and of that 25 per cent is business travel “To sit down and do nothing is really not acceptable”.

Airlines are already directly supporting the production of SAF by making commitments to buy SAF and to support these off-take agreements they are also signing up corporate customers directly:

Cathay Pacific launches Asia’s first major corporate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) programme

All Nippon Airways expands sustainable aviation fuel option to corporate travel

Air France and KLM launch Sustainable Aviation Fuel option for corporate customers

Amex GBT and Shell Aviation say the new initiative is “intended to complement and work alongside airlines’ current corporate SAF programmes”.

In this scenario instead of an airline contracting with a corporate the airline would join the alliance and “gain access to the buying capacity of businesses [and] drawing from Amex GBT’s 19000 customers from 140 countries including thousands of small to medium sized businesses and 40 of the top 100 companies by travel spend.”

AmexGBT and Shell Aviation believe that the book and claim mechanism is required to structurally scale up SAF supply. If it becomes the industry-accepted carbon accounting mechanism then it will allow both corporations and airlines to claim emission reduction from the use of SAF.

Recent Science Based Target (SBTi) Aviation Sectors guidance has supported this hope and AmexGBT and Shell Aviation say that by participating in Avelia partner airlines will become the early adopters of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Carbon Accounting and Insetting Guidelines published by the Smart Freight Centre and MIT.

At present there are currently numerous carbon accounting standards in existence and a number of diverging models. The concept of using a book and claim mechanism to scale SAF demand is very new and although bodies such as SBTi have indicated that book and claim is a viable solution there is not yet a particular set of principles in place leaving the aviation industry still able to determine what is acceptable and which principles should be followed.

Amex GBT CEO Paul Abbott said: “This pilot is an important foundational step on our journey towards a net-zero world by 2050. As more businesses and organizations like Aon join this SAF pilot program market signals will grow stronger making SAF more cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel.”

Jan Toschka President Shell Aviation said: “SAF is the only viable option for reducing aviation emissions in the near-to medium-term. Lower or zero carbon technologies such as hydrogen and electric flight are decades away from having impact at scale while SAF can be used immediately without the need for a fundamental change in infrastructure or aircraft design.”

James Platt Aon’s Chief Operating Officer said: “We believe there is an opportunity to chart a better path for both our firm and society to become more resilient and sustainable. As we help our clients make better decisions as they navigate the volatility and risk in managing climate transition we are also making bold moves to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. We are proud to be among the first to join this initiative in piloting a solution for SAF that will help Aon and others meet their emissions reduction targets and sustainability commitments.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2luZGlhLWJ1c2luZXNzL2ZvY3VzLW9uLWFuYWx5dGljcy1haS10cmFuc2Zvcm1zLWluZGlhLWJwbS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjYyNzgzMy5jbXPSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kaWEtYnVzaW5lc3MvZm9jdXMtb24tYW5hbHl0aWNzLWFpLXRyYW5zZm9ybXMtaW5kaWEtYnBtL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjYyNzgzMy5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Focus on analytics AI transforms India BPM,Two Indian business process management (BPM) companies – WNS and EXL – crossed $1 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal both growing at 16-17%. With this they have joined Genpact  TCS Infosys Wipro and Cognizant each of which has over $1 billion in BPM revenue. For WNS this was the highest rate of growth since becoming a public company in 2006.EXL says there’s been a clear step up in average growth rates since the pandemic and these higher rates will continue into the foreseeable future.The biggest reason for this is that enterprises around the world need data analytics and insights more than ever before and these companies have transformed themselves over the past five years to deliver precisely that. They have moved very far from the call centre business they were known for two decades ago and they are today at the heart of helping companies digitally transform to enrich customer experiences.KS Viswanathan VP of industry initiatives at Nasscom says such is the confidence in Indian BPM that global enterprises are today outsourcing to them sensitive areas that they would not think of doing so earlier. “Indian BPM operators were never in the business of revenue operations but now they are impacting the topline impacting customer experience asset utilisation” he says.Voice-based customer interactions he says may come from the Philippines finance & accounting (F&A) from Poland but analytics and digital experience will come from India. “The new normal is for delivery of business outcomes to be done by India” he says. Over a third of India BPM’s revenue he says comes from AI operations analytics and advanced intelligence systems.Rohit Kapoor  vice chairman & CEO of EXL says the biggest pivot the company made was to shift its focus to becoming a data-led company. “When we adopt a dataled approach it provides very clear visibility to our customers in terms of the change that we are driving why we are driving that change and what impact it has – because ultimately our customers are looking for business outcomes to be delivered to them and for them to have higher-end customer satisfaction and customer engagement” he says.Keshav Murugesh  group CEO of WNS notes that uncertainty and volatility has increased markedly making analytics services and solutions critical. Covid brought extreme uncertainties. Then came record levels of inflation and a major war. Todaythere’s talk of a potential global recession. On top of this there are new-age customers who are used to far more automation than ever before. So enterprises Murugesh says are looking for a service delivery model that provides predictable outcomes in a very unpredictable business environment. And that he says is what companies like WNS provide with technologies like AI data analytics and robotic process automation (RPA). “Our revenue from digital disruptors (those in the forefront of digital transformation) grew 29% year-over-year and now represents close to 20% of the total company revenue” he says.Yusuf Tayob group chief executive of Accenture Operations the BPM arm that accounts for $8 billion of Accenture’s $50-billion revenue says with the power of data and technology they are changing multiple parts of the customer organisation at the same time and at speed and enabling innovation-led growth. And India he says remains the strategic pillar for Accenture’s business.All of the companies have interesting case studies of the analytics work they have done for clients. WNS says they implemented a proprietary solution driven by AI and ML to engineer a digital trans- formation for a leading shipping company – enabling the customer to realise $3 million in annual savings 35% productivity benefits 75% automation and 50% improvement in data quality. “Enterprisewide assessments across multiple countries and vendors helped in identifying automation opportunities and creating an automation roadmap. The RPA infrastructure for scale was designed and provisioned in the cloud” the company says.EXL created data loops for an insurance company that connected the underwriting finance and claims functions – which normally tend to be independent silos – enabling lessons from one to be applied to the other. So if the company is seeing heavy claims being paid out to a particular customer they can use that information in real time to apply that to underwriting and pricing decisions.Kapoor says not only do they use data analytics to help clients create insights out of data and make better business decisions they also then take the intelligence and the insight from the data and apply it into core operating processes and make these processes digital operations. That’s when a truly digital transformation happens.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIxMTU3NTYvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Al-Dhaher appointed SAMA's deputy governor for control and technology,"RIYADH: The Saudi Central Bank has appointed Khaled Al-Dhaher as deputy governor for control and technology at the excellent rank according to the Saudi Press Agency.







Khaled Al-Dhaher



Al-Dhaher has vast experience spanning nearly 30 years in technology and banking solutions industries. He also served as the country managing director for Saudi Arabia at the IT company Accenture.

He held a number of senior positions in global technology companies such as being the General Manager for Business Solutions Systems in Microsoft Middle East and Africa leading a team in over 70 countries.

Al-Dhaher did a Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlubm92YXRpb25hdXMuY29tL2RpZ2l0YWwtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWNhcmQtc2hlbHZlZC1hZnRlci1zY2F0aGluZy1yZXZpZXdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital passenger card shelved after scathing reviews,"The Digital Passenger Declaration has been shelved with new Home Affairs minister Clare O’Neil acknowledging it “needs a lot more work” even after more than $60 million has been poured into the outsourced development of the underlying platform which had been slated to eventually be used across government.

On Sunday Ms O’Neil issued a statement saying ​people travelling to Australia will no longer have to complete a Digital Passenger Declaration (DPD) to declare their COVID-19 vaccination status from Thursday.

The DPD launched in March replacing the Australia Travel Declaration. The smartphone app collects contact information vaccination status passport information and travel history from people arriving in Australia by air.

The DPD was the first test of the Home Affairs ‘permissions capability’ project which is intended to one day be used across government for permission-based services.

The federal government last year selected tech consulting giant Accenture to deliver a permissions capability and set the DPD as its first use case.

But the launch was delayed and the DPD received scathing reviews from passengers while the public sector union criticised the “error riddled” app and the outsourcing of the critical government technology.

Ms O’Neil acknowledged the backlash and the DPD contributing to delays at airports around the country when announcing the decision to remove it.

The adjustments come into effect from midnight on Wednesday July 6 2022 after changes to the Biosecurity Act which also mean that all visa holders can travel to Australia without needing a travel exemption.

“Removing these requirements will not only reduce delays in our airports but will encourage more visitors and skilled workers to choose Australia as a destination” Ms O’Neil said.

“And for Australian citizens with the removal of these requirements returning home will be much easier.

“I know anyone who has travelled internationally since the borders have opened will find this as one less thing to worry about – especially as more Australians get back to travelling overseas.

“We’ve also listened to feedback about the DPD. While in time it will replace the paper based incoming passenger card it needs a lot more work to make it user friendly”

The issues with the DPD and the underlying permissions capability come after large parts of the project were outsourced through a procurement process now being examined by the audit office.

The Digital Transformation Agency issued a tender for the permissions capability in late 2020. Nearly a year later it was announced that Irish-domiciled tech giant Accenture had been selected to deliver the permissions capability.

Accenture was awarded a standing offer notice for the work and a number of contracts related to it have since been made public.

Accenture has been awarded contracts worth more than $60 million for work on the permissions capability and its first function the DPD.

The 2020-21 budget allocated $74.9 million for the project but more than this has already been handed out through the contracts. Further funding was allocated in last year’s MYEFO but was kept secret due to “commercial in confidence sensitivities”.

It’s not the first time the federal government has attempted to go to the market for this project with a previous attempt scrapped in early 2020 after more than $90 million had already been spent.

The procurement process for that attempt became mired in conflict of interest concerns with no successful bidder selected before it was canned.

World Flour Day was initiated by the FlourWorld Museum to honor flour as one of the most important staple foods. The FlourWorld Museum in Wittenburg near Hamburg Germany holds the world’s largest collection of flour sacks with more than 3700 sacks from 140 countries. Flour.Power.Life is the guiding principle under which the sacks tell about the traditions history and myths of flour.

As part of World Flour Day the museum will unveil the Flour Sack of the Year celebrating a flour sack design that best illustrates this year’s motto. Winners are displayed in the museum an initiative of Mühlenchemie a member of the Stern-Wywiol Gruppe.

The semiconductor industry is being hit hard. Proof is piling up that consumers are slowing their spend on electronics (after two years of a spending spree on work-from-home updates). A possible recession is also weighing on investor sentiment casting doubt on the sustainability of business spending on tech hardware. High-flyers Nvidia (NVDA -1.72%) and AMD (AMD -0.87%) are being hit particularly hard with each down 51% and 49% respectively through the first half of 2022.

Such cycles are the norm for chip stocks though and incredible value can be found. That's why three Fool.com contributors think chip fab equipment leader Applied Materials (AMAT -0.74%) automotive chip design and manufacturer NXP Semiconductor (NXPI -0.38%) and display materials and tech licensor Universal Display (OLED -0.63%) are a great way to supplement existing chip stock positions.

Help wanted: New chip manufacturing capacity

Nicholas Rossolillo (Applied Materials): Shares of Applied Materials were sinking like a stone in sympathy with Nvidia and other chip stocks to kick off the month of July. Why? Thank Micron Technology (MU -0.77%) manufacturer of basic commodity memory chips that are used in everything from graphics cards to tablets to cloud-computing servers. Micron cited slowing consumer demand for some devices when it issued weaker-than-expected guidance for its summer quarter.

Applied Materials is a top provider of equipment to the memory chip industry so it's been particularly sensitive to all the talk about economic slowdown and possible recession. Nevertheless this flies in the face of Applied and its peers who have been saying there's strong demand for fab equipment well into 2023 and beyond. The global chip shortage has exposed inadequate capacity to manufacture basic tech components and Applied should be able to steadily grow for the next few years as it supplies the heavy equipment needed to produce memory and other pieces of circuitry.

Granted supply chain issues have put limits on how much equipment can be assembled and shipped in recent quarters. During its fiscal 2022 second quarter (the three months ended May 1 2022) Applied reported year-over-year sales growth of just 12%. However since help in increasing manufacturing capacity isn't going away any delayed shipments would just be pushed back into 2023. Either way Applied has a big backlog of demand for its products and services.

That's why I think Applied Materials is an awesome deal at less than 15 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. It's a dividend stock and the company also repurchases lots of shares during periods of decline like right now to boost returns. If you ask me this is a top way to supplement any existing chip stocks in your portfolio with a long-term market outperformer.

This auto and industrial chip designer is an acquisition target and supercheap

Billy Duberstein (NXP Semiconductors): Semiconductor downturns are usually scary as chips are known to be economically sensitive and prone to booms and busts. While we were in a boom to start 2022 it looks as though we are about to go through a downturn of some kind.

However over the long term investors get rewarded for that volatility. Over the past 10 years which encompassed about five different semiconductor busts (including the current downturn) the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH -0.87%) has nearly tripled the returns of the broader market -- and this is after the crash in the sector this year. One would think investors would stick with a sector that has proven itself over the long term and yet so many traders still play the cycle.

The reason for this outperformance is that the semiconductor industry is a long-term growth industry and it will continue to be in the 2020s even if we are about to have a soft year. Moreover many chip companies still usually generate cash flow in downturns and repurchase a fair amount of stock when that happens.

One area that should grow even faster than the overall semi market and which should outperform the sector this year is automotive chips. Due to increasing chip content in cars advanced driver-assisted systems (ADAS) electrification and autonomy the auto chip sector is forecast to grow in the low double digits annually through 2028 according to Market Research Future projections. Moreover even though auto chips have been strong they should remain resilient since there was a downturn in 2019 and another weak year in 2020 due to Covid lockdowns. So there is still likely some catching up to do.

NXP Semiconductors has among the highest exposure to the auto sector with about 50% of its revenues coming from auto chips. Another 22% comes from industrial and Internet of Things chips which also appear to be in for a strong year as companies look to automate their factories and reduce labor costs. NXP makes a variety of auto chips including advanced radar systems electrification chips zonal processors and a variety of microcontrollers from the powertrain to comfort control. It also has a leadership position in a majority of the chips it sells to the auto industry.

If that's not enough to convince you it was recently reported that Korean chip giant Samsung wants to acquire NXP or at least another auto chip maker. When one of the largest chip-related conglomerates in the world is specifically targeting auto and industrial chips it's probably a good sign for the long-term growth of the sub-sector. Trading at just 10.5 this year's earnings estimates NXP looks awfully attractive at these levels

Catch this cyclical tech stock while the downswing lasts

Anders Bylund (Universal Display): Cyclical stocks can be beautiful. The trick is to identify the cyclical pattern buy some shares on the downswing and hold on for dear life across the inevitable bumps in the road.

Digital display technologist Universal Display is a very cyclical stock and the current downturn brought back share prices not seen since 2018. This may not be the exact bottom of the negative market action but Universal Display stands in a potentially profitable position right now.

Here's the thing: The organic light-emitting diode (OLED) researcher's stock prices have tended to mirror the company's revenue line quite closely in recent years:

However that pattern broke down in 2021. Universal Display kept delivering stronger and stronger top-line results but share prices fell dramatically anyhow. Trailing sales are up by 27% year over year but the stock is trading 55% lower.

Universal Display's OLED technology is finding its way into larger target markets these days such as mid-range smartphones in-dash car screens and large-screen TV sets. The power-sipping nature of OLED screens is a big selling point alongside display-quality benefits like perfectly black blacks incredible contrast ratios and stellar color reproduction.

As the market grows -- even in an era of constrained consumer spending and global manufacturing slowdowns -- Universal Display is also bringing new products to market that promise to expand its revenue take per square inch of OLED screen productions. The company's business prospects are as healthy as ever and you get to pick up shares at a massive discount.

The stock falls 5% and the sector slumps. While battered chip stocks may look cheap to investors is another leg down coming?

Shares of Micron Technology (MU) and other semiconductor stocks are losing ground today after the semiconductor maker warned that demand is falling and sales will be lower in the current quarter.

The industry weathered a shortage coming out of the Covid pandemic as demand outstripped supplies. But a slowing economy that may be headed to recession has flipped the story.

While Micron reported a strong growth in revenue at $8.64 billion up from $7.42 billion a year ago it forecast revenue in the current quarter of just $7.2 billion. Analysts had been targeting over $9.1 billion according to Bloomberg.

Micron stock was down about 5% for the day bringing its losses to about 40% this year. S&P 500 semiconductor stocks were all down at midday with Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also down nearly 5%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index shed almost 5% and is now down nearly 40% year to date.

With the sector deep into bear market territory and long-term forecasts strong there’s an argument for bargain-hunting at these prices. But if the industry is now facing a glut there could be another leg down ahead and even lower entry points.

What Micron said

Micron’s third-quarter numbers were strong with net income and operating income up and diluted earnings per share at $2.34 up from $2 last quarter and $1.52 a year ago.

The outlook is what has investors worried. The lower revenue guidance was substantially below analyst forecasts and the company’s guidance is now for earnings at $1.52 per share while analysts had been looking for $2.60.

Micron pegged falling demand across the industry a concern backed by recent reports of lower phone shipments to China slower sales of electric vehicles and slowing computer sales.

“Micron delivered record revenue in the fiscal third quarter driven by our team’s excellent execution across technology products and manufacturing” said Micron Technology President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in a statement. “Recently the industry demand environment has weakened and we are taking action to moderate our supply growth in fiscal 2023.”

The 44-year-old singer came out to his bandmates in 2012 before publicly discussing his sexuality in 2014.

In a new interview James said he used to “feel relieved” when rumours circulated about him dating his female friends including Geri Halliwell Martine McCutcheon and Tara Palmer-Tompkinson.

It was not until he met his partner Rodrigo Reis that he “really felt comfortable about my sexuality” he said.

James who will be performing at Pride events across the UK while wearing drag ensembles told The Mirror that he used to feel like “such a hypocrite” when performing at Pride with Blue.

“I remember when I was in Blue the first time around there were all these rumours I was dating my friends Geri Martine and Tara and I used to feel relieved.

“I was playing Pride with Blue and feeling such a hypocrite because everyone was celebrating their sexuality and I was still in the closet.

“Now I’m performing Blue hits and songs from musical theatre in full drag. I love it” he added.

James described performing in drag as “liberating” and “like wearing a very camp Superman costume – you feel so empowered”.

The “All Rise” singer will be performing alongside Blue bandmates Lee Ryan 39 Simon Webbe 43 and Antony Costa 41 as they promote their new album.

Praising his partner Reis for being “so unapologetic” about being gay James said: “He was the first partner I had who wasn’t ashamed to hold my hand.

“Other boyfriends didn’t want to show any public displays of affection in case they were pictured.”

But although the couple who have been together since 2019 have talked about marriage and children James’s priority is his career. He said they will get married and have kids “when the time is right”.

James is father to 17-year-old Tianie-Finn who he shares with his former girlfriend Claire Grainger who he dated from 2002 to 2005.

In February James said in an appearance on Rylan Clark’s podcast Ry-Union that Blue’s mostly-female fanbase made it harder for him to come out.

“I think being in such a public boy band with the majority of fans being female it was really hard for me to actually have the courage to come out” he said “because I was scared on so many different levels on so many different things.

“And to be honest I didn’t quite understand too much about my own sexuality at that time I was just really confused.”"

The last thing he said following three nights sleeping in a walk-in cooler converted to a small cozy living space — and several enlightened conversations with the proprietor — was “I need to get Karen’s number in case I come back here.”

Karenville is sprung from the imagination of Karen Thurnheer who grew up on the 200-acre farm now home to a magical tiny town with three siblings.

All four still live on the property. Their father passed away a year ago and their mother now resides in Florida where Karen winters.

Her grandparents immigrated from Switzerland and bought the farm in 1943 when Karen’s father was 16 after both working many years on Long Island. The place came with some horse-drawn farm implements and exactly one-half of a team of horses — Eleanor.

“They weren’t sure how they were going to make money with the farm initially but they had to borrow money to get another horse” Karen said settling into a chair in “The Pavilion” with a cup of her favorite beverage water. “They went down to the Farm Bureau and the guy down there said ‘Why don’t you get some cows too and you could start making some money right away?’”

Half a dozen cows multiplied and “When they got to 16 they could no longer milk by hand so they had to get milking machines. My father said ‘Then the money was really coming in’ Karen said laughing.

At its apex when Karen was a little girl the dairy had 32 stanchions and was milking 30 to 31 cows. When “get big or get out” became the mantra of dairy farming she said her family reluctantly chose the latter.

“It was the only thing we knew” she said. “We loved our cows and it was a sad day to see the cows go.”

One brother started a sawmill on the farm at age 16 and operates it to this day. Another brother drives truck for Frankie Valli (lead singer of the Four Seasons who is still touring at 88) and when not traveling helps maintain the property (including cutting hay with an old sickle-bar mower a relic of the working farm). A sister manages the original farmhouse and hired-hand quarters now both rented out and farm finances.

Karen — who has taught survival and wilderness skills driven a tow truck and worked as a sign-language interpreter — keeps both busy and entertained with Karenville which started out as kind of a joke when she listed one of her whimsical huts on Airbnb at the suggestion of a friend. Nine years later the guest list to her Victorianesque tiny wonderland is approaching 4000.

“It kind of was given to me by the universe I think” she said. “I just started building one building that little Gothic revival over there. And that was fun. Then I built another one and then another one and pretty soon I realized it was like a town.”

A town needs a name she said and so she settled on “Karenville.”

“This was all just for fun” she said “so that I could sleep in these buildings and build them and enjoy them.”

Then also just for fun she took up her friend’s suggestion.

“I of course knew nobody would come because there was no electric or running water and I thought everybody wanted a hotel.”

Having never heard of the popular online marketplace for lodging she did a bit of research as a distraction from the long winter and put together a listing.

“As a joke I put it on Airbnb and I said ‘There’s no electric no running water no shopping no street lights no sidewalks no WiFi no TV no anything’ and all the ‘noes’ I could think of.”

When winter turned to spring Karen’s life changed as well.

“Somebody booked and I was at my daughter’s and it came over my phone” she said.

After the two shared a good laugh Karen messaged the prospective guest just to be clear there were really no amenities. “He said ‘Yeah I think that will be just fine’ and I’m like “Wow alright.”

That first guest visiting a daughter attending nearby Cornell University showed up with a shiny new car and even shinier shoes she recalled.

“I knew that car did not belong on this road” she said. “And then when I found out he was some sort of corporate traveling something ... I just couldn't imagine why he was here. He could afford to be anyplace he wanted to be. And now that I’ve had close to 4000 people I realize people are just looking for something different.”

And they’ve come to the right place.

Karen explained “This is like sleeping inside my art” and at every turn in Karenville there is something to be discovered.

A mammoth barn cupola bought at a roadside sale and painted pink now graces the rooftop of the indoor showers — “indoor plumbing” consisting of plastic buckets with spigots attached. Guests heat water in stainless-steel buckets on one of two gas stoves — one outside and one inside “Karen’s Café” — to their desired temperature.

Other talismans and trinkets from Karen’s travels and keen eye adorn each nook and cranny and there seems to be a colorful story attached to each origin query. Attention to detail is a frequent guest comment she said.

“That's probably because you know I kind of like sleep in all of them and I kind of enjoy all of them. I built it and I enjoyed it and I still enjoy it. So sometimes I find or see something that I'm interested in and ... ‘Where can I put it?’ It’s sort of like my fun place.”

It’s also a learning place.

Next to a board announcing which guests reside where and their length of stay hangs a small plastic pail and a wooden bowl both scorched from being placed atop lit gas burners. A message gently encourages the rotating community “Karenville is a place for learning” and asks guests to help out if they see others having difficulty. Someone once asked Karen if bubbles meant that the water is boiling she recalled.

Self-taught except for sign-language skills learned in college Karen picked up her carpentry skills from watching her father on the farm and building tree forts with her brother.

“I had a job that I thought took care of me but having enough money to be taken care of and more allows me to do stuff that I wouldn’t have been able to do otherwise” she said. “Like I bought a fixer-upper house. It takes pretty much everything we all have to just maintain the farm and pay the taxes.”

Karen quipped that she gets in her yoga while contorting to hammer and nail under one of her structures which typically start with a 4x8 floor plan and that her meditation practice consists of frequent perches on tiny rooftops.

She said that while it’s been a main goal “to introduce people to new or different ways of doing something” Karenville is also a reciprocal arrangement.

“I have a lot of people who are just blown away by the fireflies” she said. “A good thing for me is that you know I lived here all my life and well of course there's fireflies. I mean I just don't hardly even think anything about it. But then people come and they say ‘Wow the fireflies are so amazing.’ Then I have to stop and I look and I'm like ‘You know what? They are amazing. They are really amazing.’ That makes me realize that I do live in a very special place.

“A lot of people are trying to make a connection to the earth that we live on just something meaningful. We've lost connection to where we live and people are looking for an alternative lifestyle. It's kind of sad actually isn't it? People come here and over and over again you can read the reviews. People talk about how magical it is and how wonderful. And I guess life is magical if you can stop and look at it you know but a lot of people are so busy living on the fast lane or whatever it is that they call it.”

Karenville accommodations range from $50 to $125 and can be booked through Airbnb. Karen said the man with the shiny shoes will be returning in September.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnM4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYWlyYm5iLWNyYWNrcy1kb3duLW9uLXN1bW1lci1wYXJ0aWVzLXdpdGgtcGFydHktYmFuLzUwOS1lYTJiZmQ1YS1lZGI2LTRhZTAtYTlkMC1kMDYwZWIzM2JlYmLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb cracks down on summer parties with permanent party ban,"Just in time for the holiday weekend Airbnb extends its party ban on all its listings worldwide. The company first cracked down on loud house parties in 2020.

SAN DIEGO — The party is still over for Airbnb properties worldwide. The home rental company is cracking down on its hosts and guests who don't abide by it global party ban policy.

""We have taken down a number of party houses in San Diego and will continue to do so” said Airbnb Director of Trust and Safety Communications Ben Breit.

'Party ban' is a policy that works

Breit says since the company started its party ban in 2020 they noticed it worked and saw a 62% year-over-year drop in party reports in California.

""That is a really positive trend and one that we want to see continue so that is why we decided the time is right to codify the ban” Breit said.

Making the party ban official policy means any Airbnb guests who do not have positive reviews would be unable to make a one- or even two-night booking based on each case.

""I was young once. I get that people want to come out and have a good time but I do think that there should be some limitations” said Mission Beach Vacation renter Candy Sinquimani from Santee.

Sinquimani agrees with the Airbnb policy after witnessing constant noisy parties in previous years while with her young children.

""Last year we were here and it was pretty crazy it's like my kids cannot even sleep last year because we always try to get as close to the boardwalk as possible but there’s a lot of foot traffic and a lot of loud noise that is passing by the different Airbnb‘s all day” Sinquimani said.

Violation enforcement

Those who violate the party ban can have their account suspended up to full removal from the platform.

""There have even been circumstances for particularly disruptive parties where we have brought affirmative legal action against guests who have thrown unauthorized parties” Breit said.

Some San Diego property owners are also on board with Airbnb's party ban.

""I've seen properties being destroyed from parties just walking around the neighborhood” said real estate broker Rob Brown who's owned a vacation rental on the ocean front of Mission Beach since 2005.

Brown says he uses a strict property manager and has never had a party in one of his rentals. He feels banning parties is a step in the right direction.

""I'm just hopefully optimistic that Airbnb making this a global policy along with the city's new regulation of vacation rentals will just improve the vibes of Mission Beach where neighbors are not going to be so frustrated by the quality of life and that really give a whole industry of a bad rap” said Brown who also serves on the Mission Beach Town council.

This new policy comes just as San Diego continues to be a top Fourth of July destination.

According to Airbnb from February to March searches for stays over the July 4th weekend increased by nearly 50%. Last year San Diego hosts earned over $7.5 million between July 1st and 5th with the typical host making about $1300 per night.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL21leGljby1hdXRob3JpdGllcy1wYXJ0bmVyLXdpdGgtYWlyYm5iLXRvLXByb3ZpZGUtc2FmZXItdmFjYXRpb24tcmVudGFscy1mb3ItdG91cmlzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mexico Authorities Partner With AirBnB To Provide Safer Vacation Rentals For Tourists,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

Last Updated 2 years ago

Airbnb—the American vacation rental company— and the Secretariat of Comprehensive Risk Management and Civil Protection of Mexico City have been working together on safety strategies to provide citizens and tourists with a better and safer travel experience.

This partnership has made Airbnb and Mexican institutions work together to provide solutions to different risk situations that travelers and hosts might be exposed to from natural disasters to crime and robbery. On Wednesday they announced their alliance and a new information campaign called “Verano Seguro” (safe summer) addressed to hosts and developed to promote safe environments for travelers and improve safety measures.

“This alliance that we ratify today with Airbnb allows us to reinforce actions that guarantee the security of the spaces and of the people who offer their spaces and make reservations through the platform” said Myriam Urzúa Secretary of Integral Risk Management and Civil Protection of Mexico City.

And added: “With this type of alliance we demonstrate that we have managed to change the paradigm of the emergency reaction; today we are a more prepared preventive and resilient society”.

A Security Resource Center will also be created to provide local safety measures and risk prevention in emergency situations. The idea is to work along —Airbnb local police hosts neighbors and authorities— to improve safety for tourists in Mexico.

This is great news especially for American visitors considering that the State Department in the United States recently updated Mexico’s travel advisories and has made state-specific warnings considering criminal activity and violence and made safety warnings for very touristic destinations like Cancun.

Traveler’s Safety Concerns

A recent study performed by the marketing research company IPSOS and commissioned by Airbnb in May 2022 showed that security is an essential component when it comes to planning travel to Mexico and 92% assured that they would cancel a trip if they felt insecure.

IPSOS highlighted tourists' main concerns when traveling by air: theft (62%) accidents (60%) lost luggage (45%) and transportation failures (40%). Regarding accommodation over 80% of travelers declared that security measures were highly important and mentioned the need for first aid kits (83%) extinguishers (75%) burglar alarms (73%) insurance (71%) smoke detectors (68%) and Gas & Carbon Monoxide Detectors (63%).

This information has been gathered and was considered by Airbnb and Mexican authorities to improve safety measures and guarantee tourists a pleasant stay. As part of the Verano Seguro campaign hosts have been receiving tools and information regarding security practices and safety measures along with the local community.

Building Safer Vacation Rentals For Travelers In Mexico

Starting this month in July Airbnb and Mexican Civil Prevention will provide hosts in Mexico with free Smoke Detectors and Carbon Monoxide Detectors. A logistic process has been created exclusively for Mexico for the delivery of the detectors and the implementation of the new measures.

Airbnb also formally introduced the new AirCover insurance —one of Airbnb’s major updates this year— in the country a brand new insurance service that offers booking protection helps travelers find similar homes in the neighborhood alternative check-in solutions a 24 hours safety line and more.

The home rental company also recommended tourists stay on the platform when booking a vacation rental: “It is important to always make reservations within the Airbnb platform and never move the conversation outside or make the reservation payment through a channel other than the one enabled by the platform”.

The platform as Airbnb states remains the safest space to communicate and hosts should never ask for an external wire transfer or cash payment if this happens users should report and warn through the platform.

Regarding all safety improvements and Airbnb’s new alliance with Mexican authorities Ángel Terral Director of Airbnb for Mexico Central America and the Caribbean stated: “​​Security is a priority for Airbnb and the company is constantly working to develop new solutions that help guests travel with confidence and peace of mind.”

They will talk about the girl who constantly giggles and always has a smile on her face. They will talk about the leader who is the first at practice and last to leave.

“She loves life” former Sumner-Fredericksburg volleyball coach Tori Sorenson said. “She is one of those kids that is always smiling. It is a rarity to see her frustrated or upset. Morgan just enjoys life.”

“I don’t think you will find a better person than Morgan” added Kevin Bergman who has had the honor of coaching her in both basketball and softball.

Eventually each coach will get around to Brandt the athlete. And she is a darn good one.

The list of her accomplishments in four years at Sumner-Fredericksburg is impressive. Elite all-state in volleyball. An all-state basketball player who scored more than 1000 points in her career. She was the No. 2 player on the Cougars’ Class 2A state championship golf team this spring.

And to cap it all off Brandt has been a four-year starter on the softball team where -- you guessed it -- she has earned all-state honors.

For those reasons the future Iowa State volleyball player has been named the 2022 Courier Female Athlete of the Year.

Brandt was chosen by a group of area sports media from an impressive list of six finalists including Annika Behrends of Waverly-Shell Rock Reese Johnson of Denver Amanda Treptow of Jesup Sophia Hoffman of Dike-New Hartford and Grace Frericks of Cedar Falls.

“I haven’t thought anything of it” says Brandt when asked if will it be weird when her prep athletic career finishes later this month at the conclusion of the softball season. “It’s never been which sport I’m playing. I’m just out there having fun with my friends.

“I don’t think of the accolades that have come along with it. They are just there. It is more of the memories I’ve made and having my friends around. I couldn’t imagine what it will be like not going to the gym after school with my friends. That will be weird not to have any more.

“... Without athletics none of those memories would’ve been created and then what would life have been like? It would’ve been boring. So thank you to all my teammates coaches for all the memories you have given me the opportunities you have presented to me.”

But as gracious as Brandt is both Sorenson and Bergman say don’t be fooled by the smiley persona she presents.

“She likes to have fun but is serious about what she is doing” Bergman said. “She is going to do all the little things right.”

“I’ve never coached another athlete that has had a motor like hers” Sorenson adds. “She goes 100% all the time every time.

“She might be the most competitive athlete I’ve coached. She can’t stand to lose but at the same time she is able to handle the loss look at the positives and figure out a way to get a better outcome the next time out. And she draws that out of her teammates too.”

Volleyball and Iowa State are two primary loves for Brandt who grew up in a volleyball family. She is the third Brandt girl to serve as setter for the Cougars. In fact a Brandt has been Sumner-Fredericksburg’s setter all but one year since 2009.

Kaylyn eight years older went on to play at University of Missouri-Kansas City where she ranks third all-time in assists with more than 3000. Jenna four years older played at both Iowa State and Northern Iowa where she racked up more than 1000 assists.

Morgan grew up setting volleyballs back and forth with her older sisters and traveled many miles to club tournaments throughout the Midwest. While close to all of her siblings including older brother Isiah Morgan the youngest most wanted to grow up like Jenna although both her sisters have influenced her.

“Growing up I always had a ball in my hands lived in the gym” Morgan said. “I saw them be role models to other kids how everybody looked up to them and I thought that was so cool. So when I was that player I knew I wanted to be like them.

“They were the ones who gave me the drive. They were the ones who started it all.

“But I did grow up wanting to be just like Jenna” continued Morgan. “She tore her ACL this December and now she is running miles running half-marathons. She has always had the ambition to be the best. I feel that is why I wanted to be just like her wanted to work just as hard as her.”

There is one thing Morgan does hold over Jenna -- she is three inches taller.

""Yeah she doesn't like to talk about it"" laughed Morgan.

Brandt stepped into Sorenson’s lineup as a freshman starting setter but over the years her role evolved out of necessity into playing one of the pin positions for the Cougars. At 6-feet tall Brandt had a powerful swing once she was trained up a bit.

“Because I came from a family of setters no one trained me to hit” Brandt said. “

“We kind of started working with her as a sophomore the basics but it wasn’t until she was a junior that we really started to break down her approach and swing” Sorenson said. “Not a lot of kids could step into that role and play at the level she did but she embraced the challenge loved it.”

Over her final three seasons Brandt was part of a 5-2 offense as she finished with more than 1600 career assists and nearly 900 kills.

Although primarily a setter for her Six Pack Club team that included Avery Beckett of Waverly-Shell Rock Alivia Bronner of Cedar Falls Lydia Imbrogno of Wapsie Valley and Kassidy Mohwinkle of Aplington-Parkersburg Brandt spent some time at the pin position this past club season.

Major colleges were in on Brandt early but her love of Iowa State University made her choice easy. Brandt committed to the Cyclones her freshman season at Sumner-Fredericksburg.

“She never waivered from that decision” Sorenson said.

“I’ve wanted to go to Iowa State for as long as I can remember” Morgan said. “I remember pushing Jenna to go to Iowa State during her recruiting process. I like the campus I like the coaching staff and the girls on the team.”

While volleyball is the sport Brandt is most known for Bergman says she had other options had she chosen to pursue them.

“I think she could’ve went Division I in every sport she participated in” Bergman said.

As a post player Brandt averaged 21.1 points a game during a winning basketball season. She led the Cougar softball squad in RBIs a year ago with 43 in a season. She batted .441 with 23 extra base hits in 102 at bats.

Bergman says Brandt who has leads S-F with 30 RBIs this season is a dangerous hitter every time she steps into the box.

“With the success of the golf team she didn’t practice with us so her hitting hasn’t been as good as it was last year. But she is still a threat every time she takes a swing” Bergman said.

Golf. That is an interesting story.

Brandt ran track as a freshmen but COVID wiped out her sophomore season. With nothing to do and the Meadowbrook County Club a mile from her house Brandt went to the golf course and began hitting balls.

“I never expected to join the team but I picked it up pretty easy” said Brandt who shot an 85 during state tournament play at Pheasant Ridge last month. “I met this guy at the course he just turned 84 Ron Kuethe is his name. He taught me everything.”

With her softball season winding down Brandt is excited for her future. She’s been taking a class in Ames once a week and says she will move there as soon as the softball season is over.

And that brings Brandt to reminiscing about Sumner and trips to J&C Grocery.

“I’m excited to venture out to a bigger city go to college” Brandt said. “It will be different. I’m from a tight-knit school community. But I remember at orientation (at Iowa State) I realized people don’t know me here.

“In Sumner you walk into the grocery store and people know you. You walk anywhere in town and everybody knows you. So it is going to be weird not to know anyone like look in the crowd and say 'where are my people?'”

However it feels as soon as the smiley energetic full-of-life driven-to-succeed Brandt unleashes her persona in Ames she won’t be able to walk unrecognized for long.

Former Georgia Bulldog basketball standout Nic Claxton is returning to the Brooklyn Nets. Claxton entered the 2022 NBA offseason as a restricted free agent.

The Nets are in the middle of a tumultuous offseason. Brooklyn’s superstar forward Kevin Durant requested a trade on the eve of NBA free agency. The Nets will likely look like an entirely different team to start next season.

Nic Claxton will have an excellent chance to have a large role with the Nets in the upcoming years. Claxton signed a two-year $20 million deal to return to Brooklyn.

The Nets have numerous questions this offseason. What will Brooklyn do with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving?

Nic Claxton is not one of Brooklyn’s questions. Claxton averaged 20.7 minutes per game in 47 games last season. The former Georgia basketball star is a versatile defender and averaged 8.7 points and 5.6 rebounds per game throughout the 2021-2022 season.

The persistent problem of veteran suicide has provided big firms with an opportunity to demonstrate their concern about the health and well-being of former military personnel including those they employ. Unfortunately at companies like Amazon this performative patriotism does not involve improving working conditions or changing any management practices that might actually make them better employers even while they pledge to hire more employees with military backgrounds.

A recent report by Brown University’s Costs of War project found that “four times as many men and women who have served in the U.S. military have died by suicide than were killed in post 9/11 wars.” Cost of War researchers estimate that the total suicide toll among veterans and service members during the past two decades is more than 30000. According to a study by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) veterans are 1.5 times more likely to die by suicide than nonveterans while female veterans are 2.2 times more likely to die by suicide than civilian women.

When soldiers leave active duty their employment status and job conditions — pay benefits and treatment by supervisors — can have a major impact on their emotional and financial stability. With this in mind the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation joined forces with the Trump administration two years ago to promote a suicide reduction initiative called PREVENTS. Its objective was building “a public-private partnership to strengthen emotional well-being in the workplace.”

Major corporations were solicited to sign a “Hiring Our Heroes Challenge Pledge” and make a related commitment to “best practices for strengthening mental wellness and preventing suicide.” The latter pledge notes that their “employee populations” including veterans may have certain risk factors such as “financial stress emotional stress and substance use and abuse.” To reduce these risk factors the signatory firms agreed to “promote a safe inclusive work environment and leverage employee resource groups” to “create communities of support.”

Among the first twenty-five “forward-looking employers” to sign up was Amazon along with equally anti-union firms like Walmart Starbucks Comcast Sprint and T-Mobile. The company founded by Jeff Bezos the world’s second-richest man pledged to hire 25000 more veterans and military spouses by 2021. Last year that goal became 100000 by 2024. These new hires would then be encouraged to join the company’s officially approved workplace-based “affinity group” known as Warriors@Amazon. (Among this influx of veterans is retired general Keith Alexander a multimillionaire former director of the National Security Agency who has become a well-compensated “warrior” on the Amazon board of directors.)

As coronavirus-related stay-at-home orders generated a huge increase in Amazon’s online order flow shareholder value increased by nearly $500 billion to more than $1.4 trillion. By mid-2020 Bezos’s personal net worth rose to nearly $190 billion. This enabled the Amazon founder to become an even bigger patron of a super PAC called the With Honor Fund. Its wealthy donors seek out centrist Democrats and conservative Republicans who served in the military and promise if elected to Congress to join “a cross-partisan veterans caucus.” During the 2018 election cycle Bezos gave $10 million to With Honor — during the same week that super PAC critic Bernie Sanders introduced a bill in the Senate called the Stop Bezos Act.

The goal of Sanders’s legislation was to force Amazon to reimburse the federal government for the cost of public benefits like Medicaid or food stamps that thousands of its workers are eligible to collect because their pay is so low. Sanders’s attempt to hold the company accountable was not successful in part because Congress already has too many members like the ones Bezos helps finance via With Honor.

At a town hall meeting hosted by Sanders navy veteran Seth King who quit Amazon after three months on the job publicly questioned his former employer’s commitment to providing fair wages and “workplace wellness.” He described Amazon’s employment model as “a revolving door of just bodies that they’re throwing at the floor.”

Telling a now familiar warehouse worker story he recalled working long hours under the pressure of demanding productivity standards with few chances to sit down or take a bathroom break. As King drove to work every day it “was exhausting just thinking about having to come in and start another ten-hour shift being on my feet the whole time.”

At a company supposedly sensitive to risk factors for suicide King felt like he “didn’t want to be alive anymore if that was the future that I had to look forward to. I was in the navy for eight years and there wasn’t a single day that I felt as miserable or isolated as I did at Amazon.”

Other veterans hired to be warehouse managers have made similar unfavorable comparisons. One an officer still active in the reserves reported that his warehouse was understaffed and overheated due to insufficient air-conditioning. When mistakes occurred he said he’d usually get chewed out by one of his bosses.

“I didn’t get treated as bad in the [military] in basic training” he said. “You screw up — it’s a screaming cussing yelling tirade on the floor.”

Like several other warehouse supervisors interviewed by CNET this veteran faced pressure to leave the military because he was told a “manager wouldn’t be able to advance at the company if he continued to serve both the military and Amazon.” When queried about these alleged violations of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act which protects service members from job discrimination or denial of promotions due to their absence from work for military commitments Amazon proclaimed its commitment “to supporting our military and veteran employees and providing opportunities for their long-term career growth and success.”

An exposé in the New York Times documented the degree to which Amazon actually “intentionally limits upward mobility for hourly workers.” One top executive torpedoed a proposal from Human Resources to “create more leadership roles for hourly employees similar to non-commissioned officers in the military.” Instead “guaranteed wage increases stopped after three years and Amazon provided incentives for low-skilled employees to leave.”

Such policies reflected Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s belief that hourly workers who stayed too long at the company would become lazy disgruntled and entrenched putting Amazon on what he called “a march to mediocrity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWF6b24tY2FuY2Vscy1vci1kZWxheXMtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWF0LWxlYXN0LTE2LXdhcmVob3VzZXMtdGhpcy15ZWFy0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnJlaWdodHdhdmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtYXpvbi1jYW5jZWxzLW9yLWRlbGF5cy1wbGFucy1mb3ItYXQtbGVhc3QtMTYtd2FyZWhvdXNlcy10aGlzLXllYXIvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon cancels or delays plans for at least 16 warehouses this year,"After spending billions doubling the size of its fulfillment network during the pandemic Amazon finds itself in a perilous position.

In the first quarter of 2022 the e-commerce giant reported a $3.8 billion net loss after raking in an $8.1 billion profit in Q1 2021. That includes $6 billion in added costs — the bulk of which can be traced back to that same fulfillment network.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company chose to expand its warehouse network based on “the high end of a very volatile demand outlook.” So far this year though it has shut down or delayed plans for at least 16 scheduled facilities.

“We currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into” Olsavsky told investors on Amazon’s Q1 2022 earnings call. “So we’ve brought down our build expectations. Note again that many of the build decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago so there are limitations on what we can adjust midyear.”

Below are the 16 planned warehouses Amazon has canceled or delayed in 2022:

What it all means

Evidently demand came in near the lower end of Amazon’s outlook.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau American retail e-commerce sales in Q1 2022 grew 2.4% adjusted for seasonal variation compared to the final quarter of 2021. But e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales actually declined slightly on an adjusted quarter-over-quarter (q/q) basis.

In March e-commerce sales declined from the same period last year while in-person sales rose according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. That hasn’t happened since the pandemic began and it marked the first year-over-year (y/y) decline in online spending since 2013.





The slowdown can be attributed to a few different factors. Many point to inflation as the main culprit — with less disposable income shoppers are trying to save by spending less online putting their money into things like travel and fuel. Subsiding pandemic fears are also driving a departure from e-commerce and a return to in-person shopping.

Even with the pullback on new warehouse plans Amazon boasts a fulfillment footprint no other company can rival. According to data from supply chain consulting firm MWPVL International it boasts almost 1200 active distribution centers covering 376 million square feet. For comparison Walmart operates close to 200 active facilities with less than half the square footage.

The scale of Amazon’s network isn’t the issue as it would still have more warehouses than any company in America even if it halved its footprint. The real problem is what’s happening in those warehouses.

Known for its worker-productivity quotas Amazon isn’t happy with the efficiency of its facilities. According to CFO Olsavsky the massive marketplace overcorrected for its labor issues going from understaffed to overstaffed in a matter of months. That reportedly tanked productivity.

“We hired more people and then found ourselves overstaffed when the omicron variant subsided rather quickly at least from our standpoint in warehouses” Olsavsky said. “So the issue has switched from disruption to productivity losses to overcapacity on labor.”

Marc Wulfraat president and founder of MWPVL estimated reduced productivity due to overstaffing accounted for about a third of Amazon’s $6 billion worth of added costs in Q1. But that could be the least of the company’s problems. A leaked company memo viewed by Recode in June revealed the e-commerce giant could dry up its warehouse labor force by 2024.

Watch: Supply Chain Disruption with Amazon Freight

“If we continue business as usual Amazon will deplete the available labor supply in the U.S. network by 2024” the memo warned.

If you’re wondering how that’s possible consider Amazon’s unmatched turnover rate. A New York Times investigation uncovered that even before the pandemic it was as high as 150%. That means there are more employees leaving Amazon warehouses each year than there are being hired.





In fact there has been so much turnover that Amazon began tracking it weekly and found it loses an estimated 3% of its warehouse workers every seven days. That means the e-commerce powerhouse sifts through its entire supply of warehouse labor every eight months on average.

Simply put the strategy isn’t sustainable long term. Still Wulfraat believes Amazon can weather the storm.

“It will take some time to iron out the wrinkles but they will get through it” he told Supply Chain Dive.

Amazon is dealing with some pretty massive wrinkles so it will need to use an industrial-sized iron. Already the company is shaking up its workforce with the addition of fully autonomous warehouse robots the first of six “levers” it said it could pull to get it through a rough stretch per the leaked memo. Scaling back warehouse production may be the second.

The policy shift comes amid a feud with unions who have criticized the policy as potentially hindering their ability to hold union drives and meetings.

Employees are also barred from accessing the buildings before or after their shift under the new policy.

""There’s nothing more important than the safety of our employees and the physical security of our buildings"" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said. ""This policy regarding building access applies to building interiors and working areas.""

The spokesperson said off-duty employees are not prohibited from meeting with co-workers in ""non-working areas"" away from the company’s facilities.

Amazon said the new off-duty policy ""will not be enforced discriminatorily"" to punish union efforts.

The move comes on the heels of a vote by Amazon workers at a warehouse on Staten Island New York to unionize in April.

The new policy enacted Thursday could hinder union organizers’ efforts to meet with co-workers they said.

Rev. Ryan Brown an Amazon warehouse worker in Garner North Carolina who is trying to get his warehouse to follow Staten Island’s vote called the new policy ""a direct response"" to unions.

This assumption was based on the simple fact that the land surrounding the basin experiences severe flooding during rainy seasons making permanent settlement without the aid of advanced technology all but impossible.

One of the few skeptics was Heiko Prümers an archaeologist with a focus on Latin America who teaches at the University of Bonn. Over 20 years ago he set out with his colleague Carla Jaimes Betancourt — then a student studying in La Paz — to investigate two mounds located near the village of Casarabe in northern Bolivia. The mounds a university press release recalls “turned out to be eroded pyramid stumps and platform buildings.” In other words: evidence of settlement.

Subsequent studies confirmed Prümers’ suspicion. Bioarchaeological analysis showed that these buildings were not unoccupied ceremonial sites. Instead they were used year-round by a community that farmed fished and hunted for food. These agriculturalists named the Casarabe culture could be found throughout northern Bolivia during the Late Holocene epoch. Their home turf was the Llanos de Mojos a tropical savannah that spans more than 4500 square km.

Lidar doesn’t lie

Over the years we have learned a lot about the Casarabe culture. We know they engaged in agriculture as well as aquaculture and used water-control systems to protect themselves from the Amazon basin. We also know that their society had a surprisingly complex sociopolitical organization with trade flowing back and forth between economic bases. They not only made mounds but also dug canals ditches and causeways.

This information was gathered from dozens of archaeological sites many of which were separated by more than 1000 kilometers. When studying an ancient civilization as dispersed as the Casarabe culture it can be difficult to visualize how individual settlements are related to each other in three-dimensional space — and that’s especially true for a landscape as untamed and inaccessible as the Amazon river basin.

Lacking the logistical resources necessary to traverse the Llanos de Mojos on foot Prümers and Betancourt decided they would try to create a map of the Casarabe culture using light detection and ranging technology. This technology better known as lidar previously helped archaeologists get a clearer picture of Olmec and Mayan urban planning in Mesoamerica. Prümers’ team surveyed an area of 204 square km concentrating on major excavation sites.

Cotoca and Landíva: urban centers

The lidar scans mapped out a total of 26 Casarabe settlements 15 of which were already known to exist. The researchers then organized the settlements into five distinct categories based on the dimensions of their architecture the scale of water management infrastructure and the number of causeways leading to and from the sites among other factors.

Two settlements were considerably larger than the others and likely acted as both cultural and economic centers. Named Cotoca and Landíva they span more than 100 hectares and are surrounded by moats and ramparts. “At the Cotoca site” Prümers’ research paper reports “the inner defensive structures are only preserved in some sections which may suggest that when the site grew ramparts were adapted accordingly.”

Both Cotoca and Landíva were constructed around large complexes of civic and ceremonial architecture. Lidar scans revealed that these complexes were built to face north-northwest. This according to the paper probably reflects an as of yet unknown cosmological view that might also be present in the uniform orientation of the Casarabe culture’s burial mounds. Certainly this practice would be consistent with other pre-Columbian civilizations including the Mayans and Olmecs.

Mapping the Amazon wetlands

Settlements in the second category were significantly smaller in size with areas ranging between 21 and 41 hectares. These so-called secondary sites also feature civic-ceremonial architecture built upon base platforms. Settlements belonging to the third and fourth categories are smaller still spanning 2.5 and 0.34 hectares respectively. The fifth category is a hypothetical one containing settlements without mounded architecture that could not be detected by lidar.

As expected lidar revealed a lot about Casarabe urban planning. Most settlements seem to have been built within 10 km of each other. The eastern region of the Llanos de Mojos is significantly denser than the other regions with the average distance between settlements dropping to between roughly 1.8 and 4.0 km. Most settlements were organized in clusters of 100-500 square km and connected via causeways and canals.

Unsurprisingly the highest number of waterworks are found around Cotoca and Landíva. From Cotoca specifically canals radiate “in all of the cardinal connections connecting with lower-tier sites the Ibare River to the south and lakes to the east.” One of these canals which leads to Laguna San José is more than 7 km in length. This impressive feat of engineering underscores the importance of Cotoca which served as the center of an area of 500 square km.

A fresh perspective

More than 20 years following their initial investigations Prümers and Betancourt have challenged everything the academic community thought it knew about pre-Columbian life in the Amazon river basin. “At the regional level” their study published in May concludes “the lidar data combined with previous archaeological-reconnaissance and remote-sensing data show that the Casarabe culture has a highly integrated continuous and dense settlement system.”

The Casarabe culture occupies a special place in the history of archaeological excavations in Latin America. While major pre-Columbian settlements like Cotoca and Landíva are not unique the same cannot be said for the many smaller settlements the lidar scans brought into view. According to Prümers and Betancourt’s study these places represent “the first known case [of low-density urbanization] for the entire tropical lowlands of South America.”

The largest Amazon settlements also compare favorably to other ancient cities found in South America. That is to say they are of a much larger scale than the settlements built along the Andes mountains as well as southern Amazonia in general. Indeed the architecture found in both Cotoca and Landíva may well have required the greatest amount of skilled labor of any construction from the same time period in the entire continent."

CEO Robert Isom said Thursday that the proposal would boost pilot wages at American to the levels detailed in a tentative agreement between United Airlines and its pilots. Isom said in a video sent to pilots that the airline’s workers “will be paid well and paid competitively no matter what.”

Isom said the captain of a Boeing 737 at the top of the proposed pay scale would earn a base salary of about $340000 a year by the end of 2024. Senior captains of bigger planes such as Boeing 777s would earn about $425000 a year. He said the company is also offering a premium for reassignments a better profit-sharing program and other add-ons.

American which is based in Fort Worth Texas lost $2 billion last year but is seeing stronger revenue this year as travel continues to recover from the worst of the pandemic.

The Allied Pilots Association which represents the airline’s roughly 13000 pilots did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

United pilots who currently earn more than counterparts at American are voting through July 15 on a deal that would give them raises of about 14% through 2024.

People across the U.S. are expected to fly in the highest numbers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic for the July 4 holiday weekend stressing a beleaguered transportation system experiencing tens of thousands of cancellations and delays.

Nearly 8000 flights within into or out of the U.S. were delayed on Friday and 587 were canceled. Another 2100 were delayed and 523 canceled as of around 11:20 a.m. in New York on Saturday according to FlightAware.com.

July 4 travelers might also have to contend with bad weather. Thunderstorms are on tap for a stretch of the East Coast from Washington to Boston on Saturday. Further south Tropical Storm Colin formed “unexpectedly” off the coast of South Carolina according to the National Hurricane Center.

The Transportation Security Administration said it screened about 2.5 million passengers at U.S. airports on Friday in what it expects to be the year’s busiest travel weekend yet.

As many as 12.3 million people are expected to pass through airport security between June 30 and July 4 according to the Chaddick Air Travel Bulletin by DePaul University — about 8% more than on Memorial Day weekend in May the traditional kickoff of the summer travel season.

Passengers are being asked to shell out hefty prices for tickets despite the increasing likelihood of hassles as airlines try to wring out profits amid surging costs. Domestic fares are expected to average $437 round-trip the highest in five years according to travel app Hopper Inc.

“Unfortunately the summer of 2022 is going to be a very unpleasant one for far too many airline passengers” said Henry Harteveldt founder and travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group.

U.S. carriers are eager to show that they can be reliable during times of heavy demand but have struggled to cope with travelers returning to the skies after two years of COVID-19 foiling summer plans. Airlines huddled with Biden administration officials this week to game plan for the days ahead.

From May 27 through June 30 the seven largest U.S. airlines scratched 2.7% of flights or 13783 according to FlightAware.com. Another 25.3% or 126620 were delayed for an average 50 minutes. Using a conservative estimate of 100 passengers per flight that means at least 14 million travelers have been affected over the past five weeks.

By comparison in the same period in 2019 1.7% of flights were canceled and 19.4% delayed.

Mounting frustration

Delta Air Lines Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian apologized Thursday to customers for an “unacceptable” level of flight disruptions this summer an unusual step that reflects mounting frustration among waylaid travelers.

In a letter to members of Delta’s frequent flier program Bastian warned that “things won’t change overnight” despite the airline’s efforts to improve. The apology followed Delta’s unusual offer to let passengers change travel plans across its network during the “potentially challenging” holiday without paying a fare difference or change fee.

On a recent flight from Michigan to Minnesota Delta said it would give $10000 to eight passengers who would give up their seats on the oversold plane and offered immediate payment for those with Apple Pay according to a magazine writer who said he was on the plane. (He didn’t take the offer.)

Offering passengers money to give up a seat on an overbooked flight is one of the tools gate agents have to take care of customers and get aircraft out on time a Delta spokesman said. He wouldn’t confirm the $10000 offer.

After a 15% increase in passenger complaints this spring Transportation Department Secretary Pete Buttigieg has pressed carriers to adopt more reasonable summer schedules. Airlines and regulators have been at odds over who is most to blame for the recent disarray with carriers pointing in part to air-traffic-control staffing shortages.

The Federal Aviation Administration held a call with airlines Thursday to discuss minimizing disruptions.

“We look forward to continuing to work closely and collaboratively with the federal government to address a range of shared challenges including inclement weather not only over the holiday weekend but year-round” Airlines for America the lobbying group for major carriers said after the call.

The FAA didn’t immediately comment.

Despite the growing frustrations U.S. airline stocks haven’t done much worse than the broader market. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines Industry Index is down 24% this year compared with a 21% drop in the S&P 500 Index. But as concerns about the economy deepen investors and analysts are wary.

“Airlines have a pretty poor track record during recessions and I would not recommend the group at this point” said Rob Anderson investment research analyst at Ned Davis Research.

Limited alternatives

About 74% of leisure passengers who took or planned a flight from May 20 through Sept. 12 said they regret their choice to fly according to Atmosphere Research’s second-quarter U.S. Travel Survey. But there are limited alternatives in the U.S. for medium- to long-distance trips Harteveldt said.

On top of higher demand a persistent pilot shortage at regional carriers has led to flight reductions and cancellations. Weather a deficit of airport workers and employees out sick with COVID have also snarled traffic. Delta American Airlines Group Inc. United Airlines Holdings Inc. Southwest Airlines Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. have pared their summer schedules to try to smooth out bumps.

Airline seat capacity remains about 7% below 2019 while demand this weekend will reach 93% of pre-pandemic levels according Cirium data cited in the DePaul report. With planes packed that means travelers on canceled flights could have trouble securing another seat.

“The difference with this holiday lies in the sheer magnitude of the travel volumes” said Joseph Schwieterman who authored the DePaul report. “If cancellation rates hit 6% industrywide as they did on certain days in the recent past the problem would likely reach crisis proportions with tens of thousands of passengers being stranded for a day or more.”

A glitch in American Airlines' staffing systems left 12000 flights without pilots between July 3 and the end of the month - as fed-up travelers face mounting flight cancelations and delays across the globe.

According to the Allied Pilots Association over 12000 flights were scheduled with nobody to fly them after staff ditched their flights en masse due to the operational error in the system.

An American Airlines spokesperson told DailyMail.com in a statement that the airline does not expect any 'operational impact' because of the glitch.

It claimed most of the affected flights have now been staffed - but did not give an exact number as to how many remain pilot-less.

In a leaked APA message to Los Angeles' based crew members union officials told pilots that the airline was just putting pilot's back on their original schedules after management noticed the error.

Although message notes: 'Management has no contractual mechanism to just add flying to your schedules.'

The union says that it has the data on which pilots were contractually allowed to drop flights from the schedule and will be ensuring that those changes are honored.

Through an internal platform American staff can request changes to their schedules to time off although time off requests are rarely granted during the holidays or in the summer months reports CNBC.

The network's report also says that American's 3000 scheduled flights on July 2nd were 93% staffed.

The full statement from the airline read: 'Our pilot trip trading system experienced a technical issue. As a result of this technical glitch certain trip trading transactions were able to be processed when it shouldn’t have been permitted. We already have restored the vast majority of the affected trips and do not anticipate any operational impact because of this issue.'

At the time of writing the platform allowing American pilots to change their schedules has been taken offline.

Just this week it was announced that American pilots were getting a 17% raise in pay.

Long lines were also seen at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Saturday afternoon. American Airlines said that the glitch should not have an impact on flight schedules

DailyMail.com has reached out to the Allied Pilots Association for comment on the crew scheduling glitch.

In 2017 American experienced a similar glitch in their system. It resulted in pilots being offered 150% pay in exchange for staffing the abandoned flights.

Union spokesman Dennis Tajer told CNBC in 2017: 'The airline is a 24/7 op. The system went from responsibly scheduling everybody to becoming Santa Claus to everyone. The computer said 'Hey ya'll. You want the days off? You got it.''

That outage left flights unstaffed around Christmas and New Years one of the busiest times for air travel.

Low-cost European airline Ryanair suffered a similar snafu in 2017 that resulted in too many pilots being assigned vacation time which lead to cancelations. Bloomberg estimated that those cancelations cost Ryanair $30 million.

According to the airline blog View from the Wing: 'Scheduling at American Airlines is so complex that many pilots even use a subscription-based third party app to manage the process.' The blog says that the main system for scheduling is named the Preferential Bidding System or PBS.

Pilots typically go by month-to-month schedules on the Preferential Bidding System. In most cases staff with seniority and override more junior staff's requests for certain routes or days off.

Across the country airlines have cancelled and delayed hundreds of flights in the U.S. sparking travel chaos during the busiest Fourth of July weekend since the pandemic which has been dubbed 'Airmageddon.'

Around 48 million people are expected to travel this weekend with AAA estimating 3.5million would take to the air. But the actual number of passengers flying may be dramatically higher as the Transportation Security Administration screened more than 2.4 million travelers at airports on Thursday alone - up 17 percent from the Fourth of July Friday in 2019.

Many fliers will be facing disappointment with 604 flights canceled by 2:30pm and 2879 have been delayed according to Flight Aware which reported that by the end of Friday 586 U.S. flights were called off and 7773 were rescheduled.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg who previously called on airlines to get in shape before the weekend appeared to give up on getting things under control as he told Americans to follow his lead and claim compensation over the canceled flights.

'Airlines offer miles as compensation for some travel issues and you can often negotiate on this' tweeted Buttigieg who said he got back $112.07 over his canceled flight on Friday after he was initially offered about $30 back.

'Sometimes an airline will offer you points or miles as compensation but you are entitled to a cash refund when your flight is canceled.'

Leading major U.S. airlines in cancellations on Saturday was American Airlines which canceled 96 flights and delayed 421 flights. Delta followed behind canceling 63 flights and delaying 322.

United Airlines has canceled 42 flights and delayed 185 and Southwest has called off 22 flights and has delayed 507 flights so far.

Since the hectic Juneteenth travel weekend the U.S. has seen more than 12000 flights cancelled according to Flight Aware.

In addition to airport chaos and heavy traffic holiday travelers will have to contend with higher prices. Average gas prices have soared 56 percent from a year ago mid-range hotel prices have increased 23 percent and average lowest airfares are up 14 percent.

In total AAA projects that 47.9 million Americans will travel for the Fourth this year up 3.7 percent from last year and close to the historic peak reached in 2019 before the pandemic struck.

Chaos continues to swamp U.S. airports amid the busiest travel weekend since the pandemic with more than 600 flights canceled and nearly 2900 delayed as of Saturday morning. Pictured: Travelers waiting at check-in at Miami airport today

In addition the Biden administration is blaming the airlines saying it received billions in stimulus money to keep afloat during the pandemic and should stick to the schedule it publishes.

Buttigieg said earlier this month that airlines had until July 4 to figure out the issues and work out the kinks so travelers can have a smooth summer holiday.

Buttigieg pushed back earlier this week when the head of the trade group Airlines for America blamed the FAA for delays.

'The majority of cancellations and the majority of delays have nothing to do with air traffic control staffing' Buttigieg told NBC Nightly News.

Amid the Fourth of July travel chaos many are calling on Buttigieg to act rather than give out advice on how to get compensation like he did.

One Twitter user with the handle The Dude wrote: 'Hey Pete … maybe as Secretary of Transportation you should be meeting with FAA major airlines and other key folk involved - slamming your fist on the table and demanding they work out these issues and a plan to address the problems … not update us on frequent flyer miles.

Another Twitter user with the handle Limstone Caulk added: 'How about people just want to go somewhere when they actually paid to go?'

Brian Jackson another Twitter user said he too wanted Buttigieg to be proactive in the situation.

'You know [as] the Secretary of Transportation you could maybe I don’t know fix the root cause of the delays so no one would need a refund and would actually get to their destination?'

Another Twitter user with the handle Pantazopopulos wrote: 'How bout you actually find out the reasons the airlines are having issues and see if there is a way to help I mean if you're not busy since you are Transportation Secretary.'

Sen. Bernie Sanders demanded Washington fine airlines $55000 per passenger for every flight cancellation they know can't be fully staffed. He also demanded that the DOT impose a $15000 fine per passengers facing extended delays on domestic and international flights.

'The American people are sick of airlines ripping them off canceling flights at the last minute and delaying flights for hours on end' he said.

'Given all of the generous taxpayer support that has been provided to the airline industry all of us have a responsibility to make sure that passengers and crew members are treated with respect not contempt.'

Sens. Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked 10 airline CEOs this week to 'take immediate action' to reduce travel disruptions. The senators demanded information about how each airline decides which flights to cancel and the number of consumer refunds requested and granted.

Many on Twitter demanded action from Buttigieg to curb the cancellations and delays at airports

As Delta Air Lines led cancellations yesterday CEO Ed Bastian wrote an apology letter to customers and vowed to make major changes including adding extra boarding times improving crew scheduling and bringing on more workers to aid busy travel periods.

'We've spent years establishing Delta as the industry leader in reliability and though the majority of our flights continue to operate on time this level of disruption and uncertainty is unacceptable' Bastian wrote in a letter to frequent flier clients.

'Things won't change overnight but we're on a path towards a steady recovery.'

Since the start of the summer travel season Delta has canceled more than 3600 flights and delayed 20 percent of its total flights since the Memorial Day weekend.

Travel through Delta is likely to be further complicated after its pilots started picketing on Thursday at several major airports including LAX JFK and Atlanta demanding better contracts as crews are allegedly overworked during the holiday rush.

The proposal includes an initial 6 percent raise at signing for about 15000 pilots with a 5 percent raise at the star of 2023 and then another in 2024.

The deal comes less than a week after United Airlines and its pilot's union reached an agreement to raise wages by 14 percent within 18 months.

United's pilot's union said it hold a special meeting next week to evaluate the airlines offer and see how it stacks with American's offer.

'We will not rush to a decision and will work as a unified body to find the best course of action for the entire pilot group' the United union said in a statement.

A record 42 million people around the United States are expected to hit the road for trips over the Fourth of July holiday weekend despite average gas price surging close to $5 per gallon.

The average U.S. retail price of gasoline recently broke through $5 per gallon for the first time in history. It has gone down slightly and averaged $4.86 on Wednesday.

While the $5 price is not record from an inflation-adjusted basis it still represents an increase of nearly $2 per gallon from a year earlier.

Despite the higher cost gasoline demand is only 1 percent below the average for this time of year in the United States and a record number of people are expected to travel by car for the holiday weekend.

Patrick De Haan GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis told the Houston Chronicle 'The high prices don't seem to be holding many Americans back from hitting the road with the economy fully reopen.'

The 42 million figure should it pan out would surpass 2019's peak when 41.5 million people traveled by vehicle on Independence Day according to the American Automobile Association.

Including air travel 47.9 million people are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home during the holiday period just 2 percent less than 2019's 49 million but surpassing 2021's levels the travel membership organization said.

'The volume of travelers we expect to see over Independence Day is a definite sign that summer travel is kicking into high gear' said Paula Twidale senior vice president of AAA Travel. 'Earlier this year we started seeing the demand for travel increase and it´s not tapering off.'

Among the biggest boost in travel includes those going by train and bus which is estimated to be about 2.42 million people a dramatic increase from the 900000 last year.

Through April 2022 1.017 trillion vehicle miles were reported a rate that trails only 2019 and 2018 in terms of pace according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhZGRsZXlvdXJvd25rYW5vby5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMi9hbGwtbWFqb3ItdS1zLWFpcmxpbmVzLXdpbGwtb2ZmZXItbm9uLWJpbmFyeS1ib29raW5nLW9wdGlvbnMtYnktdGhlLWVuZC1vZi0yMDI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All Major U.S. Airlines Will Offer Non-Binary Booking Options By The End of 2024,"All major U.S. airlines have confirmed that they will offer non-binary booking options for passengers who don’t identify as either male or female but updates to computer reservation systems might not be completed until the end of 2024.

In addition to the traditional gender identifiers of ‘male’ and ‘female’ some airlines have started to include ‘X’ which shows that the passenger is either non-binary intersex or gender non-conforming. Some airlines also include a fourth ‘U’ gender marker for undisclosed.

Airlines for America a trade group that represents some of the biggest U.S. airlines including American Delta and United Airlines says its members have agreed to update their IT systems within the next two years.

In the meantime the lobby group says its airlines will provide information on their websites on how non-binary passengers can ask for their tickets to be manually altered to show an X gender marker.

Delta Air Lines has been promising to update its reservation system since 2018 to show an X gender marker but the Atlanta-based carrier now believes the change won’t be made until the end of this year at the earliest.

The first U.S. airline to add both an X and U gender identifier to its booking system back in 2019 was United Airlines following approval by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

American Airlines has also added X and U gender identifiers but Alaska and Hawaiian still only offer Male and Female gender options. Spirit Airlines does not ask passengers to choose a gender but they must choose from traditional gender-based titles – either Mr Miss or Mrs.

Americans in 20 States can now obtain driving licenses with an X gender marker after Oregon became the first state to provide the option in 2017. Earlier this year the U.S. State Department confirmed it had issued its first-ever passport with an X gender marker."

Problems with power grids are a potential catalyst for chaos in energy markets that are underappreciated Kelly says.

Electricity grid problems in the US are a potential ""black swan"" that could wreak havoc in energy markets according to Cornerstone Futures research director Brynne Kelly.

In an analyst note the energy trader argues that failing power grids and electricity shortages could be the next vulnerability in the supply chain for oil and its products such as gasoline.

Those under-the-surface risks are being overlooked and that makes them a possible ""black swan"" — an unpredicted event with a severe impact. While crude oil isn't much used to generate electricity power itself is needed to make oil Kelly noted.

""Said another way a failing power grid COULD BE the next oil chain supply problem"" she said.

""Problems with power grids across the US and other countries are a potential catalyst for chaos in energy markets that are underappreciated.""

The reliability of the US electricity grid is being taken for granted Kelly said. But it's under pressure as the industry goes through a mandated shift from fossil fuels to clean energy sources and with the peak summer demand ahead.

She pointed to the impact of a rare 2021 winter storm in Uri Texas to show how disruption in electricity supply can spread to other sectors. Failures in the state's ERCOT power grid proved catastrophic for operations there as the domino effect hit energy producers as transportation water and telecoms.

Texas is one of the largest oil-producing states in the US accounting for 42.7% of crude oil production according to the US Energy Information Administration.

""A power grid failure on any scale larger than a local one like we saw in Texas would be and could be potentially catastrophic"" Kelly said.

""If the fallout from Uri in Texas ... were any indication natural gas and oil pricing could be affected by power failures due to heat storms or some other unplanned event"" she added.

""We are not predicting or sounding alarms but the risk is poorly quantified. It won't matter until it matters unfortunately.""

Concerns are mounting about US power grids ability to cope with peak summer demand as the clean energy shift moves forward without necessarily having the technology in place to keep them resilient.

In a recent assessment of the US electricity grid's reliability the North American Electric Reliability Corp. warned about capacity shortfalls and high risk of energy emergencies due to heatwaves droughts and wildfires among other factors.

""Russian attackers may be planning or attempting malicious cyber activity to gain access and disrupt the electric grid in North America in retaliation for support to Ukraine"" the report's authors said.

Electrical grids in the west and most of central US including Texas have an high risk of insufficient operating reserves the NERC found.

But in a recent note S&P Global noted an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season is predicted for the US this year which could dampen power demand in Texas. When storms hit in 2021 daily power burn in the region dropped 25% it noted.

The most important thing according to Kelly is that the markets for oil gasoline and natural gas are already squeezed on the supply side given the Ukraine war and sanctions. A break in the reliability of electricity is a potential risk that should be acknowledged.

""So far there have not been problems at the last stop on the chain power generation and transmission. Regardless the supply chain is vulnerable"" Kelly said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9zcGFjZS13ZWF0aGVyLWltcGFjdHMtZWxlY3RyaWMtZ3JpZC1wcmVwYXJhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the electric grid ready for extreme space weather?,"The sun unleashed a major X1.1 class solar flare from an active sunspot cluster on its eastern limb on April 17 2022 GMT. This view was taken by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory.

In the early hours of March 13 1989 the public utility Hydro-Québec went out of service. The entire province of Québec lost power for nine hours interrupting many aspects of public life for the entire day.

Space weather — the conditions in outer space near Earth  which are heavily influenced by the sun — was quickly identified as the cause of the blackout.

""The initial story was 'OK there had been a lot of activity on the sun and then a big magnetic storm and a number of power systems had problems' but there wasn't a lot of detail there"" said David Boteler a scientist with the Canadian Hazards Information Service at the government's National Resources Canada. ""Trying to do a hindsight investigation we're very conscious of that lack of data and there's been quite a bit of work done trying to fill in the gaps.""

Boteler spoke about the 1989 blackout as part of a June 8 panel presentation at a joint meeting of two groups within the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine: the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board and the Space Studies Board.

Looking at solar data collected around the world in the week leading up to the blackout Boteler and colleagues realized there had been not one but two large coronal mass ejections (CMEs) clouds of electrically charged particles unleashed from the sun's outer atmosphere.

""It's not just any old magnetic storm"" Boteler said. ""We think it was actually the shock of that second CME arrival that caused the Hydro-Québec blackout.""

The Hydro-Québec blackout is now a go-to example of how solar activity can disrupt life on Earth and a cautionary tale that we may still not know enough about space weather to predict preempt or at least swiftly recover from a similar geomagnetic storm.

And with the solar activity ramping up as the sun enters solar cycle 25 in earnest the story of Hydro-Québec is particularly powerful.

During the June 8 virtual meeting experts gave the overall impression of a specialized community — spanning governmental research agencies administrators and industry — very concerned about the potential impacts of space weather on the electrical grid. And although awareness of the issue is growing they said there is a need to understand it better.

Experts are in the process of designing and deploying instruments to better assess the threat and they are still navigating the collaborations among research institutions governmental entities and private industry that will likely be required to tackle an issue with highly technical scientific and engineering problems as well as practical and social hurdles.

Since the 1989 blackout ""The community has learned a great deal; there's still more work to be done"" said Bill Radasky president and managing engineer of Metatech an electromagnetic engineering consultancy.

Space weather monitoring and detection

Space weather is strongly influenced by the sun. It encompasses the interaction of solar radiation and solar wind with Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere including the high-speed charged particles that generate auroras .

Extreme space weather can knock out satellites  disrupt communications or severely damage electrical grids and other critical infrastructure. In the worst-case scenario for power grids the exact extent of damage and the knock-on effects are very difficult to project experts said. Solar activity is itself a challenge to monitor and understand while location-specific factors such as local geology and grid configuration affect the short- and long-term costs of power loss and infrastructure damage.

""In the U.K. at least space weather investment is very much driven by understanding the socioeconomic impact"" said Jonathan Eastwood a researcher at Imperial College London. ""There are a lot of questions about what is reasonable to invest to defend against space weather based on what the likely impact is going to be."" That is before governments utilities and other stakeholders undertake expensive options such as retrofitting entire power networks there's still a lot about space weather left to be studied.

Eastwood has been part of a U.K. program called SWIMMR which is involved in developing sensitive hardy instrumentation; performing forecast modeling; and ultimately assessing risk.

The European Space Agency has its own initiatives to collect solar data. For example the planned Vigil mission will send a range of instruments to stable orbit at Lagrange Point 5 and closer to Earth a fleet of specialized satellites could form the Distributed Space Weather Sensor System (D3S) Eastwood said.

An advanced warning system could allow power grid operators to minimize the effects of a storm and prepare to restore service as quickly as possible panel members said. Such technology would require the sort of improved data collection that is already in motion along with models that predict the possibility of a complete or partial grid failure and some validation that those models and responses work.

A matter of policy

There have been improvements in solar data collection since the 1989 blackout and many are ongoing or began recently. But experts still describe challenges in funding data collection and encouraging data sharing as well as overall collaborative hurdles.

""It's a bit of a Tower of Babel situation"" Anna Kelbert a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's geomagnetism program. ""The problem is so complex and spans so many disciplines.""

Kelbert would like to see data from electric grids shared in real time allowing researchers to compare changes on the grid with their forecast models built on improved solar and geological data. However ""there's very little incentive for the power grid industry to share the power grid system configurations"" she said.

Although space weather researchers may like to see more changes to U.S. policies in the past decade the federal government has taken notice of the threat of extreme space weather and the need to understand it much better. Notably the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order 779 in 2013 which directed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. a nonprofit intermediary that issues standards to power companies to develop plans to mitigate the effects of a ""geomagnetic disturbance"" and create benchmarks to describe the severity of any such event.

This step was a ""game changer"" said Bill Murtagh director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center. This was the first federal regulation to recognize the potential impact of space weather on the electrical grid Murtagh said.

In addition a 2019 FEMA document identified the most concerning possible natural disasters and space weather was on the list.

Whether the increased attention is enough to prevent a worst-case scenario in the event of a major solar storm over the coming years remains to be seen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhaXJvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vcG9saXRpY3Mvd2h5LWpvZS1iaWRlbnMtZ3JlZW4tZW5lcmd5LXBvbGljeS1pcy1kZWFkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Joe Biden's Green Energy Policy is Dead,"Fair Observer’s new feature FO° Insights makes sense of issues in the news.

US President Joe Biden and many Democrats have argued for a Green New Deal. They seem to emulate Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal that pulled the US out of the Great Depression. They believe that public investment in green energy and new technologies will fight climate change create high-paying jobs in the US and boost the American economy.

We spoke to Contributing Editor Christopher Roper Schell a Capitol Hill veteran who has also worked on the Pentagon to make sense of the Green New Deal in the context of soaring oil and gas prices and the prospect of blackouts.

Christopher Roper Schell on Joe Biden’s Energy Policy

(We have edited this transcript lightly for clarity.)

Is clean energy a mirage?

Christopher Roper Schell: It depends on what you mean by clean energy.

If you think windmills and solar panels are going to run the US electric grid that’s not going to happen.

What we need is baseload power and baseload power is going offline primarily because of the economic incentives behind green energy in the United States. Interestingly CO 2 has been declining substantially primarily because natural gas is simply cheaper.

What we’ll have to concern ourselves with is to ensure that we do not have the blackouts we’re being warned against. A semi-regulatory body has issued a warning that up to 2/3 of America could experience blackouts this summer. That is simply unacceptable to Americans and a green energy future that eventually has blackouts is not going to transpire.

What is the significance of high gas and nickel prices?

Christopher Roper Schell: For the Greens high gas prices are the point: they actually want gasoline prices to go up. However Americans have rejected this.

They’re getting a look at what a potential carbon tax would look like and they don’t like it. The Biden administration has tried to suffocate traditional energy sources such as natural gas and oil. In fact the Chevron CEO said last week that he didn’t envision another refinery ever in the United States.

There’s clearly a rebellion against high gas prices and also against nickel prices. Nickel goes into almost everything that’s green and the US doesn’t produce that much of it. There is one single nickel mine in the US.

And we’re seeing nickel prices that are at peaks that we have not seen for the last 30 years. America cannot go green without producing a lot of nickel cheaply and that’s not happening.

Watch the full video here

Is there a supply-side threat from China?

Christopher Roper Schell: Yes there is. China produces four times more rare earths than America does. China has six rare earths mining companies. America has one mine.

In terms of solar panels most of the US solar panels that are installed come from foreign shores; about 90% in fact.

Interesting story — Auxin Solar is this little bitty US domestic solar panel producer and they have filed a complaint with the Commerce Department. The Commerce Department began investigating and the installation of solar panels completely froze in this country. Ultimately the Biden administration stepped in and declared that there would be no new tariffs on imported solar panels to prevent the market from collapsing.

So in this rush to green utopia the administration decided that it’s OK to support China and to essentially leave their own domestic suppliers out to dry.

Is the Keystone XL pipeline the answer?

Christopher Roper Schell: No one disputes that Keystone XL would have produced 830000 barrels of oil a day. That’s a drop in the bucket in terms of global consumption.

The big problem today is that we just need to produce more oil and currently producers are not responding to price signals. Why? Because they’ve been punished.

Last week Biden said of Exxon pay your taxes. I didn’t know that oil producers had ever stopped paying taxes but the president is using all sorts of regulatory methods to disincentivize the production of oil and gas. Amongst other things as I mentioned earlier he’s not holding lease sales. I know he will say that there are already loads of outstanding leases but that also means that they need permits. And oftentimes the Biden administration has not allowed permits.

Either way it’s better to get oil from places like the US and Canada via Keystone vis-à-vis places like Iran and Venezuela.

Is the Green New Deal now dead?

Christopher Roper Schell: Let me put it this way no politician right now is saying if you like your new high gas prices you can keep your new high gas prices.

[There is now no appetite for] a carbon tax. The Green Deal is dead if it ever was alive. While people may virtue signal with their post-consumer cup or rich people may drive around feeling very fancy in their electric cars the fact is that most people aren’t willing to make the major compromises they will have to make for a Green New Deal type future.

A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear.”

He promised an intense focus on the climate crisis at home but also abroad. As the world’s greatest historic emitter of the pollution that is dangerously warming the Earth the United States would cut its emissions and lead the way to a safer future he said.

But 18 months into his administration Mr. Biden’s domestic climate agenda is hobbled.

Per Page Six the star was over come with emotion during the two-hour set and held back tears as she addressed the audience saying during her first song ""My God I’m back at home.""

The long-sleeved dress included a cold shoulder-style neckline with a halter neck giving way to bare shoulders and was cinched at the waist with a gold belt over a shimmering skirt.

Per The Guardian the ""Someone Like You"" singer sang several new tracks from her album 30 as well as her biggest hits. She chatted with the crowd between songs on subjects including ""Billie Eilish Stranger Things sciatica and forgetting lyrics.""

The star also reportedly paused the concert several times to wave security over to members of the crowd needing medical assistance due to the day's heat.

While the weekends' performances mark the first time the ""Rolling in the Deep"" singer performs a public concert after her long hiatus the star did perform in front of star-studded crowds for two televised shows around the release of 30. For her Adele: One Night Only special she wore a similar sculptural Schiaparelli gown paired with large Saturn earrings and another lovely updo.

“My God I’m back at home” Adele told the sold-out hometown crowd after her show-opening performance of “Hello.” “It’s so strange to be in front of a crowd again. I get so nervous before each show but I love being up here.”

The singer who last performed at the Brit Awards in Feb. delivered an 18-song setlist filled with hits from all four of her studio LPs plus “Skyfall” and her rendition of Bob Dylan’s “Make You Feel My Love.”

In addition to the first performance of 21 songs like “Rumour Has It” and “I’ll Be Waiting” for the first time in five years the Hyde Park gig also featured the debut live performance of 30’s “Oh My God.”

The Hyde Park shows — Adele will return to the British Summer Time event Saturday night as well — marked her first concerts in public in five years when she played London’s Wembley Stadium in June 2017; Adele hosted a pair of pre-30 performances in the lead-up to that LP but those gigs were private televised events.

Adele had previously planned on returning to the stage for her Weekends With Adele residency in Las Vegas from January to April but those shows were postponed the day before opening night due to “delivery delays” that made the shows seem “really half-assed” she said.

“Listen I’m so sorry but my show ain’t ready. We’ve tried absolutely everything that we can to put it together in time and for it to be good enough for you but we’ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid” an emotional Adele said at the time. “Half my crew half my team are down with Covid — they still are and it’s been impossible to finish the show and I can’t give you what I have right now and I’m gutted.”

As of now the Vegas residency has still not been rescheduled and Saturday night’s Hyde Park gig is the only show remaining on Adele’s 2022 live itinerary."

The I.R.S. Approved Them All. (Published 2022),"The “American Cancer Society of Michigan” state authorities say was a fake charity. And not even a good fake.

It was not in Michigan for one thing. When the group applied to the Internal Revenue Service to become a tax-exempt nonprofit in 2020 it listed its address as a rented mailbox on Staten Island. It was not the American Cancer Society either: In fact the real American Cancer Society had already warned the I.R.S. that the leader of the sound-alike group Ian Hosang was running a fraud.

The I.R.S. approved the group anyway. Soon after it also approved another operation run by Mr. Hosang: “the United Way of Ohio” which was also registered to the Staten Island address.

Mr. Hosang 63 is now accused by prosecutors in New York of operating a long-running charity fraud that has astounded nonprofit regulators and watchdogs — and raised concerns about the I.R.S.’s ability to serve as gatekeeper for the American charity system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZ2F0b3VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbmVlZHRva25vdy8yMDIyLzA3LzAzL2ZpdmUtdGhpbmdzLXRvLWtub3ctdGhlLXJlbmFpc3NhbmNlLWNsdWItZ2VuZXNpcy1zY290dGlzaC1vcGVuLWRwLXdvcmxkLXRvdXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five things to know: The Renaissance Club - PGA TOUR,“Padraig has been great both as a sounding board for my ideas on changes and as a source of ideas himself” Doak says. “I was always taught not to take the driver out of players’ hands but it’s a new era and he has underscored that we needed to tighten the landing areas of the longer holes or the game is too easy for these guys.

Each of its members holds a vertical mirrored panel. Together on cue they place the panels horizontally over their heads reflective side skyward and begin a procession. At first it’s loose and tidally pooling and eddying. Then it tightens into a stream of light gains velocity and spirals like a whirlpool.

The landscape is a stretch of prairie on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation spanning the border between North and South Dakota. The time of the filming was December 2016. The procession conceived by two Native American artists Cannupa Hanska Luger and Rory Wakemup was a combined act of protest and preservation.

It was performed by some of the many hundreds of demonstrators who had come as “water protectors” intent on halting the United States government’s plan to install a major oil pipeline near Black Rock a move that could potentially poison the reservation’s water supply and would certainly desecrate its ancestral cemeteries. The mirrored panels were shields designed to protect the protectors from resistance they’d meet and make their assaulters look hard at themselves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVobi5vcmcvaW52YXNpdmUtc3BlY2llcy0yNjU3NTk4MzA4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Dykstra: American Invasive Species Hall of Fame part 2,"Sequels are rarely as good as the original. But here are five more invasive species for the American Invasive Species Hall of Fame.

You can see last week’s first five here.

Burmese Python (Python bivittatus) A native of Southeast Asia and one of the world’s largest snake species the pythons became a hot (and legal) item in the pet trade in the mid-1990’s. When South Florida snake lovers realized their fully sized python could be 12 feet long and 200 pounds or more pet owners took what they thought was the merciful course of releasing the snakes to the friendly habitat of the Everglades. With no predators and a ready diet of rodents livestock birds and possibly even a rare Florida panther the Burmese python installed itself at the top of the Everglades food chain. The U.S. finally outlawed import of the pythons in 2012. Record-setting Everglades pythons have topped 18 feet and 400 pounds. They’ve been found well north of the Glades and along the Florida Panhandle. Despite well-organized python “roundups” the snakes are probably permanent residents of Florida.

Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) First detected in North America in Michigan’s Lake St.Clair in 1988 the thumbnail-sized shellfish is presumed to have hitched a ride in a ship’s ballast from its Caspian Sea home. Zebra mussels prefer fast-moving water and often cluster at intake pipes for factories power plants or municipal water works. Once established zebra mussels are tough to remove. Constant inspections are needed to avoid water intake shutdowns due to clogged pipes. Thoroughly established in the Great Lakes region zebra mussels are pushing westward in rivers and streams. They’ve also conquered portions of the Ohio and Tennessee river systems.

Asian carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and several other subspecies) Juvenile Asian carp are sensitive to loud noises. An outboard engine will send the fish into a frenzy breaching as much as 10 feet out of the water. Credit: Invasive Carp Regional Coordinating Committee In the generally un-funny world of invasives Asian carp can provide a little comic relief. Mainstays in some home aquaria Asian carp can outgrow their welcome with a maximum of almost 20 pounds. Released by aquarium owners into rivers and streams the carp quickly rose to the top of the food chains in sections of the Mississippi and Illinois river systems where they quickly outcompeted native species for grasses and plankton. Also an Arkansas fish farm brought in carp during the 1970’s to help clean algae from their tanks. When the job was done the carp were released to the wild. Did I say they were funny? Funny how? Juvenile carp are sensitive to loud noises. An outboard engine will send the fish into a frenzy breaching as much as 10 feet out of the water. The longtime anglers’ prayer that fish will literally jump into your boat can come true with Asian carp. There’s a concerted effort to keep the carp from overtaking the Great Lakes' sizable commercial fishery.

Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae) First noticed near Richmond Virginia in the 1950’s this tiny ball of white fur has a ravenous appetite for the sap of the Eastern Hemlock. Over the next few decades the adelgid’s range reached the hemlock stands of the Appalachians. Stately trees died from the crowns on down with understories taking the hit as well. Streams once kept cool by the shade of the giant trees now cooked. Eastern hemlocks range from Georgia to Maine and Nova Scotia and west to Wisconsin. The adelgid hasn’t quite caught up yet but with no practical defenses natural or manmade they’re on the way.

Brown Tree Snake (Boiga irregularis) Amid the death and sorrow of World War II there was a constant commerce of just about everything to just about every corner of the Pacific. It’s probably how the brown tree snake hitched a ride on cargo ships from its home in Indonesia to Guam. Related: American Invasive Species Hall of Fame part 1 With no natural predators brown tree snakes had a field day. Even iconic species like the flightless Guam rail disappeared. When the last eggs were gone the snakes had little trouble finding more food. They covered the island. Their four-foot bodies stretched from one powerline to the next. The island’s power grid ran on a World War II surplus generator. Every couple of weeks brown tree snakes shorted out Guam’s power. In addition to overrunning Guam brown tree snakes are semi-aquatic and mildly venomous. There are a few reported cases of snakebites on the toilet.

Ashish Bhatia with Prateek Pardeshi looks at the advances in air-cooled systems led by fins.

Heat dissipation is crucial to the efficiency of an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). Especially since temperatures are known to breach the ~2300-2500 degrees Centigrade mark. Here the role of air fins is crucial. The fin as an extended surface is used to direct the heat away from the engine back into the atmosphere. Failing which in an uncontrolled environment one risks burning the oil film between the moving parts. It may result in seizing the engine forcing the vehicle to enter the limp mode. With efficient cooling the temperature can be brought down by up to 150-200 degrees Centigrade. Forming an essential component of air-cooled systems fins can be spotted easily in two-wheelers in close proximity to the engine heads and the engine blocks.

According to a Lap Lambert Academic Publishing a paper authored by Sathishkumar Kuppuraj of Elgi Equipment Ltd. from the technology department writes on the engine high temperature and how its subjected to high-degree thermal stress. He cites fins as the only component used to dissipate the engine heat. “Fins are generally used to increase the heat transfer rate from the system to the surroundings” he explains. In his study he further cites how computational flow analysis on the engine cooling fins helps determine the heat dissipation rate and the principle implemented to increase the heat transfer rate. In a noteworthy modification carried out fins were modified using different notch types and made up of the same material. Kuppuraj stresses on the need for knowing the efficiency and effectiveness beforehand to be able to ensure a proper design. The analysis was conducted using the ANSYS – CFD Fluent software in this case (read the detailed cover story on ANSYS with an exclusive upfront interaction in our upcoming issue to learn more about the advancements in simulation). The study is known to have made use of fins with holes fins with a V-shaped notch and fins with a rectangular notch.

In another interesting case study experts have argued over the architecture of single-cylinder engines being more efficient than multi- cylinder engines. In the case of the former for instance the airflow is directed all around the sides of the cylinder making cooling far more effective. The drawback is that most single-cylinder engines are petrol engines and do not fit the requirements of diesel heavy-duty vehicles. Especially since diesel has a newfound identity as “clean diesel”. These are however extended to three-wheeler duty cycles. The amount of heat dissipation however depends on two crucial factors: the amount of airflow through the fins and the fin surface area.

Fins are known to have a high thermal conductivity. It is this conductivity that allows it to conduct the excess heat through the fin wall. It provides the added capability of an increase in the convective and radiative heat exchange. The cool air is forced through the fins by the fans and in air planes and automotive this is determined and often made possible by the speed of the vehicle. Be it on the radiator the engine block or the engine head they primarily help increase the surface area known to be in direct contact with the ambient air. Simply put when cast or bolted to the flywheel it acts as a fan blade for enhanced air circulation.

Indian suppliers like Delhi-based KBA Metal Products Pvt. Ltd. and Chintamani Thermal Technologies Pvt. Ltd. from Chakan operate in the domain. They encompass different types of fins spanning straight fins of uniform cross-section and a non-uniform cross-section annular fins cylindrical fins and pin fins. The straight fins have an extended fin attached to a wall. The annular fin is attached circumferential to the cylinder head. The cross-section is known to vary from the centre line of the cylinder. It is further divided into rectangular and conical profiles. The pin fin is a cross-sectional profile wherein the diameter is known to be smaller compared to its length. It may be of both uniform and nonuniform cross-sections. The material used for the pin plays a significant role here and aluminium continues to be a choice with a growing interest owing to its chemistry. Low density and the ability to resist corrosion are the prime factors for its consideration. It also scores high on electrical and thermal conductivity. As a ductile metal it has a low melting point and density. Notably the study concludes with the consideration that fins with rectangular notches are far more efficient compared to V-shaped fins and fins without notches. We spotted a Royal Enfield Classic 500 fitted with rubber spacers on cylinder fins. As per riders while it is a good sound damper there are critics questioning the heat dissipation transfer leaving scope for further evolution.

Fins in EVs

Fins are not restricted to ICE only. These are also used in industrial engines and motors. In the case of Electric Vehicles (EVs) two-wheelers these can be found on the motors. For instance Ather uses a 6 kW permanent magnet synchronous motor designed to deliver 26 Nm of torque. To ensure heat is dissipated the two-wheeler deploys annular fins. An annular fin transfers more heat than a similar pin fin at any given length because of the increased surface area increasing the distance to the object. Annular fins are frequently used in liquid-gas heat exchanger systems to increase the heat transfer rate. It is noteworthy that an increase in the per centage of wetness on the fin area has an inverse correlation to the fin efficiency given that the temperature gradient increases.",,,,,,,,,,,,

THUNDER BAY – Jamie DePiero was four shots back after eight holes on Sunday.

Six holes later he was tied for the lead.

By the time he hit the 18th tee the Thunder Bay golfer was two shots in front of playing partner Evan DeGrazia looking like a sure bet to finally have his name etched on the AON District Open trophy.

Eventually he did but it took DePiero an extra playoff hole to capture his first local major title after an errant second shot found the woods on the final hole at Whitewater Golf Club leading to a bogey and a 36-hole tie with DeGrazia.

Regrouping for the playoff DePiero the runner-up a year ago found the fairway on the 10th while DeGrazia hit a low hook that bounded far off the playing surface leaving him little choice but to punch out and hope to get up and down to extend the match.

Instead he two-putted for bogey while DePiero reached in regulation and made his par to claim the championship.

“It’s pretty amazing” said the 32-year-old DePiero. “There’s a lot of history (on this trophy) in Thunder Bay so to have your name on it is pretty special. It’s awesome it feels really good.”

DePiero who spent time last summer on the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada said it was disappointing not to get it done in regulation but a win’s a win.

“I probably should have laid back (on 18). I tried to get it close to the green and it was kind of a dumb decision. But I was pretty quick to switch the focus and focus on what I needed to do coming up on 10” he said.

It was all DeGrazia in the early going.

After entering the day tied with DePiero after the two golfers fired identical 71s in Saturday’s opening round at Fort William Country Club he built a four-shot lead through eight holes.

However a bogey at No. 9 the toughest hole on the course cut his lead to three just the opening DePiero was looking for.

DePiero saved par on the 12th while DeGrazia missed his par putt and settled for bogey.

Down two on No. 14 DePiero launched a tee shot that fell short of the bunker to the right of the reachable green and delicately dropped his second to within striking distance and drained the birdie putt.

Meanwhile DeGrazia uncharacteristically needed to shots to get out of the green-side bunker and missed a short par putt leading to a two-shot swing that evened the match with four holes left to play.

“I’ve hit that shot probably 100 times in my life. To have that happen – I put a good swing on it my club just didn’t want to go through which sucks. I missed the putt for par. You just waste shots waste shots waste shots so you can’t expect too much from yourself after that” DeGrazia said.

The two-time District Open champion found more trouble on 17 pulling out his driver on the short par 4 after DePiero chose iron and landed it in the fairway. DeGrazia’s shot found the forest and he was forced to play his provisional missing a short bogey putt for a double DePiero’s par giving him a two-shot lead heading home.

DePiero found the woods to the left of the 18th green staked as a hazard and ultimately bogeyed the hole DeGrazia’s two-putt birdie from the lower level sending the tournament to a playoff.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtdHJhdmVsLzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvYW1leC1nYnQtYW5kLXNoZWxsLWNhbGwtZm9yLWNvbXBhbmllcy10by1idXktc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtYXZpYXRpb24tZnVlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amex GBT and Shell call for companies to buy sustainable aviation fuel – Business Traveller,"Amex GBT and Shell Aviation says that “Once book-and-claim is approved by industry bodies as an acceptable form of emissions reduction Avelia could enable airlines and companies who choose SAF to authenticate record and report the associated emissions reduction benefits of SAF towards their voluntary ESG reporting regardless of where in the world the SAF is used to fuel a flight.”

Currently SAF is two as much as eight times more expensive than jet fuel. To help reduce the price differential many airlines have made commitments to purchase SAF sometimes many years in advance to encourage the development of facilities that can supply the fuel. David Reimer Executive Vice President Global and Multinational clients and Managing Director for the Americas Amex GBT said that there was a need for companies to get involved to drive decarbonisation of the industry and reach ambitious net-zero targets: “If it’s left to individual consumers nothing is going to happen” he said adding that since three per cent of carbon emission are from aviation and of that 25 per cent is business travel “To sit down and do nothing is really not acceptable”.

Airlines are already directly supporting the production of SAF by making commitments to buy SAF and to support these off-take agreements they are also signing up corporate customers directly:

Cathay Pacific launches Asia’s first major corporate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) programme

All Nippon Airways expands sustainable aviation fuel option to corporate travel

Air France and KLM launch Sustainable Aviation Fuel option for corporate customers

Amex GBT and Shell Aviation say the new initiative is “intended to complement and work alongside airlines’ current corporate SAF programmes”.

In this scenario instead of an airline contracting with a corporate the airline would join the alliance and “gain access to the buying capacity of businesses [and] drawing from Amex GBT’s 19000 customers from 140 countries including thousands of small to medium sized businesses and 40 of the top 100 companies by travel spend.”

AmexGBT and Shell Aviation believe that the book and claim mechanism is required to structurally scale up SAF supply. If it becomes the industry-accepted carbon accounting mechanism then it will allow both corporations and airlines to claim emission reduction from the use of SAF.

Recent Science Based Target (SBTi) Aviation Sectors guidance has supported this hope and AmexGBT and Shell Aviation say that by participating in Avelia partner airlines will become the early adopters of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Carbon Accounting and Insetting Guidelines published by the Smart Freight Centre and MIT.

At present there are currently numerous carbon accounting standards in existence and a number of diverging models. The concept of using a book and claim mechanism to scale SAF demand is very new and although bodies such as SBTi have indicated that book and claim is a viable solution there is not yet a particular set of principles in place leaving the aviation industry still able to determine what is acceptable and which principles should be followed.

Amex GBT CEO Paul Abbott said: “This pilot is an important foundational step on our journey towards a net-zero world by 2050. As more businesses and organizations like Aon join this SAF pilot program market signals will grow stronger making SAF more cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel.”

Jan Toschka President Shell Aviation said: “SAF is the only viable option for reducing aviation emissions in the near-to medium-term. Lower or zero carbon technologies such as hydrogen and electric flight are decades away from having impact at scale while SAF can be used immediately without the need for a fundamental change in infrastructure or aircraft design.”

James Platt Aon’s Chief Operating Officer said: “We believe there is an opportunity to chart a better path for both our firm and society to become more resilient and sustainable. As we help our clients make better decisions as they navigate the volatility and risk in managing climate transition we are also making bold moves to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. We are proud to be among the first to join this initiative in piloting a solution for SAF that will help Aon and others meet their emissions reduction targets and sustainability commitments.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2RyZXR1cm5zLmNvLm56L2FydGljbGUvOTc2NTIwNDU5L2Zpc2hlci1zZWxscy1tYXN0ZXItdHJ1c3QtYnVzaW5lc3MtdG8tbGlmZXRpbWUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fisher sells Master Trust business to Lifetime,"Latest Headlines

The new XGS-PON standard will enable symmetric shared internet access rates up to 10Gbps (gigabits per second or Gbit/s). By symmetric it means it can deliver the same data transfer rate in both directions i.e. same download and upload rates.

The existing asymmetric GPON technology Worldlink is using is only capable of transferring up to 2.4Gbps download and 1.25Gbps upload speed.

What are PON GPON and XGS-PON?

ISPs in Nepal today use fibre optic technology to provide internet access to users replacing copper-based connections like ADSL. The network that uses fibre optic cables is known as FTTH short for fibre-to-the-home.

To deliver internet access to end-users in an FTTH network a point-to-multipoint fibre-optic communication system is used called the passive optical network (PON).

Unlike the active optical network (AON) which uses electrically powered devices PON uses unpowered passive optical splitters to distribute the signal across the endpoints.

There are different PON standards. The most popular is the GPON or Gigabit-capable PON which can deliver data rates of up to 2.5Gbps down and up to 1.25Gbps up. This is the current PON standard that Worldlink is using.

In response to the increased demand for higher bandwidth a new upgraded version of GPON XG-PON was introduced by ITU-T the International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication Standardization Sector.

The XG-PON (10G-PON) where the initial letter “X” represents the number 10 has a downstream capacity of 10Gbps and an upstream capacity of 2.5Gbps which is asymmetric.

The XGS-PON is an improved 10G-PON standard that can provide 10/10Gbps symmetric bandwidth. Thus after “XG” the letter “S” which stands for symmetrical was added.

What does this mean for Worldlink and its users?

Worldlink said that it has successfully completed testing to upgrade its GPON to XGS-PON technology. The ISP says that it will gradually upgrade its current GPON network to XGS-PON to meet the current bandwidth demand. This makes it the first company in Nepal to upgrade its network to XGS-PON.

The upgrade will enable the ISP to provide symmetric download and upload speeds to its customers. Due to the limitations of GPON technology the upload speed is currently slower than the download speed.

Compared to current GPON technology the new 10Gbps XGS-PON has up to eight times more upload bandwidth and four times more download bandwidth capabilities.

The XGS-PON system also has a greater split ratio of up to 1:256 meaning a single XGS-PON OLT port can provide an internet connection to up to 256 users. This is twice as many as the GPON OLT port can support according to Worldlink.

With the use of this technology Worldlink will be able to provide faster than 1Gbps internet connections to its customers in the coming days. Additionally the company plans to use this new technology to offer a variety of services to corporate customers.

Worldlink mentioned that it is also planning to test 25G-PON in collaboration with its infrastructure company Nokia.

Given its name Apple really couldn’t have picked anything else to slap on its laptops phones and tablets.

Yet people still have questions about the branding. Most notably why does the Apple have a bite taken out of it.

There are plenty of theories including one linked to the British mathematician Alan Turing who played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat Nazi forces in a number of key battles.

However like so many of the best theories it is completely false.

Here’s the real story behind the Apple logo.

Why does the Apple logo have a bite out of it?

There are plenty of theories. Some believe it is a reference to the computing term byte some see it as a nod to the biblical story in which Eve took a bite from the forbidden fruit others have proposed that it references Sir Isaac Newton and the apple that fell and helped him discover gravity while sat under a tree.

The reality is unfortunately less exciting.

During an interview with Creative Bits the designer of the logo Rob Janoff explained: “They are really interesting but I’m afraid it didn’t have a thing to do with it.

“From a designer’s point of view one of the big phenomena is having the experience of designing a logo for whatever reasons you design it and years later you find out supposedly why you did certain things. And they are all BS. It’s a wonderful urban legend. Somebody starts it and then people go ‘Oh yeah that must be it’.

“I designed it with a bite for scale so people get that it was an apple not a cherry. Also it was kind of iconic about taking a bite out of an apple. Something that everyone can experience. It goes across cultures. If anybody ever had an apple he has probably bitten into it and that’s what you get.

“It was after I designed it that my creative director told me: ‘Well you know there is a computer term called byte’. And I was like ‘You’re kidding!’ So it was like perfect but it was coincidental that it was also a computer term.”

Why was the Apple logo multicoloured?

When it was first designed in 1977 the Apple logo boasted six horizontal multicoloured stripes. These have since been replaced by a cleaner look but people have wondered whether the initial design might be linked to LGBT+ pride.

In reality founder Steve Jobs simply liked that the colours made the logo stand out. But a theory about the bite and stripes relating to Alan Turing has sprung up and grown in popularity.

How would a strong US dollar eat into the profits of US multinational companies such as Apple and Microsoft? This should be fully taken into consideration when the US Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rates.Facing the highest levels of inflation in over 40 years the Fed in June raised its benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points the biggest increase since 1994. US' interest rate hikes have generated a spillover effect in the foreign exchange market resulting in a relentless rally in the US dollar and devaluation of many Asian currencies including the Japanese yen.In Japan Apple has raised prices for its major products such as iPhones and iPads. The iPhone 13 previously priced at 98800 yen ($730) now costs 117800 yen an increase of 19 percent according to media reports. Analysts believe one reason behind the uncommon price adjustment is that Apple has to reset its prices in response to yen's precipitous drop in value.Some are concerned that price adjustment will reduce the competitiveness of Apple products in the Japanese market. What's worse the impact won't be limited to only the Japanese market. Luca Maestri chief financial officer at Apple was quoted as saying in a New York Times report in May that the rising dollar is hurting Apple's revenue. ""With respect to foreign exchange"" he said ""we expect it to be a nearly 300-basis-point headwind to our year-over-year growth rate.""Apple is not the only one that has been hit by strong dollar. Microsoft has reportedly cut its revenue and profit outlook for its fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30 citing currency fluctuations. The strength of the US dollar is denting the value of overseas earnings by American multinational firms making some American products less competitive in economies whose currencies have weakened.While a strong dollar may help the Fed tame inflation rate hikes impact American multinational firms in largely negative ways. Many companies in industries that the US leads in such as consumer goods manufacturing and the high-tech manufacturing sectors generate roughly half or more than half of their sales overseas. In this increasingly globalized era big US companies are less dependent on US domestic market than many Fed economists might think.Strong foreign demand for goods made by US firms is a key reason why large American firms are thriving even at a time when the US economy remains weak and why the US can maintain its influence and hegemony on the world economy with a trade deficit and sluggish export sector. However the Fed's aggressive interest rate increases are undermining the viability of big US companies which are the backbone of US economic hegemony.US President Joe Biden whose popularity has taken a hit as US inflation accelerated to a fresh 40-year high has made fighting inflation his top domestic priority as the crucial midterm elections approach. With concerns over inflation mounting it's understandable that the Fed is under pressure to act decisively and affirmatively to get inflation under control. However the Fed's tightening is having a clear negative impact on American companies. If US policymakers cannot resolve the root cause of inflation but instead simply focuses on aggressive interest rate increases which have impacts on the determinants of long-term economic growth it will be like drinking poison to quench a thirst.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY3J1bW9ycy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMy90aW0tY29vay0yMDIyLXN1bi12YWxsZXktY29uZmVyZW5jZS1ndWVzdC1saXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple CEO Tim Cook Among Tech and Media Elite Invited to Sun Valley Conference Later This Week,"Apple CEO Tim Cook is on the guest list for this year's Sun Valley Conference which begins Wednesday in the resort town of Sun Valley Idaho according to Deadline.

AMAT,Applied Materials,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzAzLzMtdG9wLWNoaXAtc3RvY2tzLXRvLXN1cHBsZW1lbnQteW91ci1udmlkaWEtYW5kLWFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Top Chip Stocks to Supplement Your Nvidia and AMD Position,"The semiconductor industry is seemingly in a tailspin but there's extreme value to be had out there.

The semiconductor industry is being hit hard. Proof is piling up that consumers are slowing their spend on electronics (after two years of a spending spree on work-from-home updates). A possible recession is also weighing on investor sentiment casting doubt on the sustainability of business spending on tech hardware. High-flyers Nvidia (NVDA -1.72%) and AMD (AMD -0.87%) are being hit particularly hard with each down 51% and 49% respectively through the first half of 2022.

Such cycles are the norm for chip stocks though and incredible value can be found. That's why three Fool.com contributors think chip fab equipment leader Applied Materials (AMAT -0.74%) automotive chip design and manufacturer NXP Semiconductor (NXPI -0.38%) and display materials and tech licensor Universal Display (OLED -0.63%) are a great way to supplement existing chip stock positions.

Help wanted: New chip manufacturing capacity

Nicholas Rossolillo (Applied Materials): Shares of Applied Materials were sinking like a stone in sympathy with Nvidia and other chip stocks to kick off the month of July. Why? Thank Micron Technology (MU -0.77%) manufacturer of basic commodity memory chips that are used in everything from graphics cards to tablets to cloud-computing servers. Micron cited slowing consumer demand for some devices when it issued weaker-than-expected guidance for its summer quarter.

Applied Materials is a top provider of equipment to the memory chip industry so it's been particularly sensitive to all the talk about economic slowdown and possible recession. Nevertheless this flies in the face of Applied and its peers who have been saying there's strong demand for fab equipment well into 2023 and beyond. The global chip shortage has exposed inadequate capacity to manufacture basic tech components and Applied should be able to steadily grow for the next few years as it supplies the heavy equipment needed to produce memory and other pieces of circuitry.

Granted supply chain issues have put limits on how much equipment can be assembled and shipped in recent quarters. During its fiscal 2022 second quarter (the three months ended May 1 2022) Applied reported year-over-year sales growth of just 12%. However since help in increasing manufacturing capacity isn't going away any delayed shipments would just be pushed back into 2023. Either way Applied has a big backlog of demand for its products and services.

That's why I think Applied Materials is an awesome deal at less than 15 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. It's a dividend stock and the company also repurchases lots of shares during periods of decline like right now to boost returns. If you ask me this is a top way to supplement any existing chip stocks in your portfolio with a long-term market outperformer.

This auto and industrial chip designer is an acquisition target and supercheap

Billy Duberstein (NXP Semiconductors): Semiconductor downturns are usually scary as chips are known to be economically sensitive and prone to booms and busts. While we were in a boom to start 2022 it looks as though we are about to go through a downturn of some kind.

However over the long term investors get rewarded for that volatility. Over the past 10 years which encompassed about five different semiconductor busts (including the current downturn) the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH -0.87%) has nearly tripled the returns of the broader market -- and this is after the crash in the sector this year. One would think investors would stick with a sector that has proven itself over the long term and yet so many traders still play the cycle.

The reason for this outperformance is that the semiconductor industry is a long-term growth industry and it will continue to be in the 2020s even if we are about to have a soft year. Moreover many chip companies still usually generate cash flow in downturns and repurchase a fair amount of stock when that happens.

One area that should grow even faster than the overall semi market and which should outperform the sector this year is automotive chips. Due to increasing chip content in cars advanced driver-assisted systems (ADAS) electrification and autonomy the auto chip sector is forecast to grow in the low double digits annually through 2028 according to Market Research Future projections. Moreover even though auto chips have been strong they should remain resilient since there was a downturn in 2019 and another weak year in 2020 due to Covid lockdowns. So there is still likely some catching up to do.

NXP Semiconductors has among the highest exposure to the auto sector with about 50% of its revenues coming from auto chips. Another 22% comes from industrial and Internet of Things chips which also appear to be in for a strong year as companies look to automate their factories and reduce labor costs. NXP makes a variety of auto chips including advanced radar systems electrification chips zonal processors and a variety of microcontrollers from the powertrain to comfort control. It also has a leadership position in a majority of the chips it sells to the auto industry.

If that's not enough to convince you it was recently reported that Korean chip giant Samsung wants to acquire NXP or at least another auto chip maker. When one of the largest chip-related conglomerates in the world is specifically targeting auto and industrial chips it's probably a good sign for the long-term growth of the sub-sector. Trading at just 10.5 this year's earnings estimates NXP looks awfully attractive at these levels

Catch this cyclical tech stock while the downswing lasts

Anders Bylund (Universal Display): Cyclical stocks can be beautiful. The trick is to identify the cyclical pattern buy some shares on the downswing and hold on for dear life across the inevitable bumps in the road.

Digital display technologist Universal Display is a very cyclical stock and the current downturn brought back share prices not seen since 2018. This may not be the exact bottom of the negative market action but Universal Display stands in a potentially profitable position right now.

Here's the thing: The organic light-emitting diode (OLED) researcher's stock prices have tended to mirror the company's revenue line quite closely in recent years:

However that pattern broke down in 2021. Universal Display kept delivering stronger and stronger top-line results but share prices fell dramatically anyhow. Trailing sales are up by 27% year over year but the stock is trading 55% lower.

Universal Display's OLED technology is finding its way into larger target markets these days such as mid-range smartphones in-dash car screens and large-screen TV sets. The power-sipping nature of OLED screens is a big selling point alongside display-quality benefits like perfectly black blacks incredible contrast ratios and stellar color reproduction.

As the market grows -- even in an era of constrained consumer spending and global manufacturing slowdowns -- Universal Display is also bringing new products to market that promise to expand its revenue take per square inch of OLED screen productions. The company's business prospects are as healthy as ever and you get to pick up shares at a massive discount. On top of all that Universal Display's formerly forgettable dividend policy is nothing to laugh at anymore offering a healthy 1.1% yield and an unbroken history of annual payout boosts since 2018.

That's why I'm still on the sidelines of AMD and Nvidia's overheated stock charts preferring to own Universal Display's healthy combination of stellar growth modest prices and robust dividends. This mid-cap growth stock is simply a great buy right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

The Met Gala Vogue's annual celebration of fearless fashion was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on Monday night. It's a big night for fashion and celebrities which include a number of athletes. Tom Brady Steph Curry Russell Westbrook Simone Biles Carmelo Anthony and other major sports stars have been invited in the past.

The theme for 2024 was ""Garden of Time"" to celebrate the opening of the ""Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion"" exhibit at the Met. Let's see how this year's chosen athlete-stars (the gala is by invitation only) interpreted that theme.

It seems fitting to start with Angel Reese the college basketball star who was drafted by the Chicago Sky in late April and is currently one of the biggest stars on the planet. She celebrated her 22nd birthday on Monday by making her Met Gala debut in a stunning low-cut seafoam green gown adorned with an ostrich feather tutu and embroidered tulle.

The most talked-about look of the night came from Ben Simmons. He's still playing for the Brooklyn Nets (though you're forgiven if you hadn't noticed) but since they're not in the playoffs he was free to attend. He came solo wearing a black suit and black coat with panels of plaid fabric at the top and a vine down the side. The outfit wasn't bad but his literal interpretation of the ""Garden of Time"" theme involved a clock briefcase.

Are We Not Aroused?,"Watching the red carpet at Monday night’s Met Gala I couldn’t help but recall a prediction I’d heard from Emily Kirkpatrick who writes the Substack newsletter “I <3 Mess.” She’d told me recently that before the end of 2024 it’s possible that “someone is going to show up fully nude on a red carpet.”

That didn’t happen at this year’s gala but it got very close as Doja Cat — who appeared earlier this year at the Grammy Awards in what was called “the most naked dress ever” — presented at the Met Gala in a long clinging soaking wet transparent and entirely revealing white T-shirt by the label Vetements.

Near-nudity is everywhere at least on celebrities and the celebrity adjacent.

But only a sliver of students are participating or view it as a top issue according to a new Generation Lab survey shared exclusively with Axios. Why it matters: The poll hints that the war — and the accompanying protests — might not hurt President Biden's election prospects among young voters as much as previously thought.

By the numbers: Only a small minority (8%) of college students have participated in either side of the protests the survey of 1250 college students found.

Students ranked the conflict in the Middle East as the least important issue facing them out of nine options.

It landed behind health care reform racial justice and civil rights economic fairness and opportunity education funding and access and climate change.

What they found: The survey found that three times as many college students blame Hamas for the current situation in Gaza than they do President Biden.

Some 34% blame Hamas while 19% blame Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 12% blame the Israeli people and 12% blame Biden.

Zoom in: A large majority (81%) of students support holding protesters accountable agreeing with the notion that those who destroyed property or vandalized or illegally occupied buildings should be held responsible by their university per the survey.

A majority also said they oppose the protest tactics: 67% say occupying campus buildings is unacceptable and 58% say it's not acceptable to refuse a university's order to disperse.

Another 90% said blocking pro-Israel students from parts of campus is unacceptable.

The other side: Students were still more likely to say they support the pro-Palestininan encampments than oppose them.

45% said they support them either strongly or a little bit. 30% were neutral and 24% were strongly or a bit opposed.

Zoom out: More than 2000 people have been arrested on campuses across the U.S.

Worth noting: A majority of people (58%) who participated in or favored protests against Israel said they would not consider being friends with someone who has marched for Israel.

Meanwhile 64% of those who participated in a pro-Israel protest said they would still be friends with someone who has marched against Israel.

Methodology: This study was conducted May 3-6 from a representative sample of n=1250 students nationwide from 2-year and 4-year schools. The margin of error is +/- 2.7 percentage points. The Generation Lab conducts polling using a demographically representative sample frame of college students at community colleges technical colleges trade schools and public and private four-year institutions.

Digitalization—replacing manual records with digital ones and using data in a variety of digital tools and connected systems—works synergistically with automated processes. Data collected from equipment that is connected via the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) and analyzed with artificial intelligence (AI) for example allow the control system to know when a process is trending out of specification or when a piece of equipment needs maintenance. The digital or “intelligent” plant makes use of both automation and digitalization.

“With the advance of data science enabling factors such as easy access to scalable memory and computing resources; our growing competence in collecting storing and contextualizing data; advances in robotics; [and] the quickly evolving method landscape driven by the open-source community the benefits of automation and simulation are becoming accessible in the notoriously complicated realm of biopharma manufacturing” says Marcel von der Haar head of product strategy data analytics at Sartorius.

Business benefits of the digital plant include getting new products to market faster; faster changeover of products which enables flexible and multi-product manufacturing; improved operational integrity which includes predicting and correcting potential problems before they occur; and real-time release which makes production faster and minimizes inventory says Nathan Pettus president of process systems and solutions at Emerson. Digital tools accelerate the pipeline and help commercialize products faster by easing technology transfer. “For example cloud-enabled knowledge management software that manages product and process specifications through the entire drug development lifecycle is enabling biopharma manufacturers to minimize errors in the tech transfer process” says Pettus.

Automation leads to improved product quality and compliance reduced risk and improved productivity says Heather Coglaiti global industry strategy and marketing lead for life sciences Rockwell Automation. An increase in right-first-time occurrences leads to fewer deviations and investigations. Predictive or adaptive mechanisms to prevent equipment failure as well as real-time asset management help reduce operational risk she explains.

“Automation even partially digitized reduces the human errors associated with batch-to-batch variability” adds Dennis Brandl BRL Consulting. For example automated dispensing systems have less variability than manual dispensing. Automation also eliminates human error associated with manual data entry.

Automation provides consistency in performance quality and process agrees Dushyant Arora life sciences industry manager for Siemens Pharma USA. He explains that automation and digitalization enable online quality testing and review-by-exception which can enable real-time release.

Automating flexible and intensified processes

Adoption of these technologies in biopharma is driven in part by the ongoing push for speed-to-market and the trend to flexible and multi-product manufacturing. Digital technologies are also a crucial part of continuous processing.

“As life sciences plants have moved away from manufacturing a single product and are focused more on developing a wider range of specialized treatments the importance of flexible manufacturing has taken center stage” explains Pettus. “Plug-and-play” capabilities of automation systems which enable flexible manufacturing and faster technology transfer are more important than ever he says.

For scaled-down and distributed systems that use multiple identical manufacturing lines located in one facility or at multiple sites the ability to collect and share information across the enterprise is crucial adds Pettus. “Today’s automation platforms leverage scalable ‘data aggregators’ often based on software-as-a-service models and cloud-architectures. [This ability to scale allows] companies to use automation from the beginning develop the right process and then scale the solution as they build their business and infrastructure globally” he explains. Pettus concludes “At any scale there is too much at stake to dismiss automation and digitalization as they are truly critical pieces of the quality puzzle.”

Intensified and continuous processes rely on real-time testing for process control. “We are focusing our efforts for the ‘factory of the future’ on process intensification and connecting unit operations together which is enabled by single-use technology automation and process analytical technology (PAT)” says Darren Verlenden head of bioprocessing at MilliporeSigma the US and Canada life science business of Merck KGaA.

MilliporeSigma’s good manufacturing practice (GMP) PAT platform for bioprocessing includes a Raman spectroscopy analyzer and software that can achieve in-line real-time monitoring of process parameters and quality attributes. These data can be used to automate control of the bioreactor. In April 2022 the company acquired Lonza’s MAST platform an automated sterile bioreactor sampling system; upon closing it will become part of MilliporeSigma’s BioContinuum platform. The GMP MAST system will help processors evolve from manual sampling to automated sampling says Verlenden.

Digital transformation is an ongoing journey says Verlenden. He adds that some customers may want to run a fully continuous automated process while others want to intensify and automate certain unit operations.

Future facilities

The digital biopharmaceutical manufacturing plant is the “facility of the future” but it is also a reality today. Sanofi’s digital and paperless facility in Framingham Mass. for example won the 2020 overall Facility of the Year Award (FOYA) from the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE). The company says that the manufacturing facility is 80 times more productive than a traditional facility and has a smaller environmental footprint (1). ISPE’s 2022 FOYA category award for innovation went to another digital plant located in Framingham Mass.: CRISPR Therapeutics’ facility which uses digital systems and automation for production and filling operations (2). Digital tools allow this facility to manage multiple production suites and products at different stages of development (2). Takeda Pharmaceuticals International’s vaccine facility in Singen Germany won ISPE’s 2022 Pharma 4.0 category award for its use of digital technologies which include an electronic batch record system an embedded warehouse management system and autonomous mobile robots to transport materials (3). ISPE’s Honorable Mention-award winner Iovance Biotherapeutics’ autologous cell therapy facility in Philadelphia uses digital tools including electronic batch records and centralized equipment monitoring (4).

Walvax Biotech’s new COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine plant in China is another example of an intelligent and digital plant; it uses Honeywell’s batch process control building and energy management solution systems and digital twins to monitor assets (5).

“As the need for speed and agility increases biopharma production facilities need some way to better visualize and integrate batch processing across various equipment and systems” says Shawn Opatka vice-president and general manager life sciences at Honeywell. He explains that the data capture recording and reporting systems used by Walvax will help maintain auditability as well as optimize production. Opatka says that data from the live process will be sent to the digital twin where operators can proactively watch for problems and fix them before they occur.

“The application of AI is paramount and will continue to grow as many organizations progress in their digitalization journey” says Opatka. “We see more biopharma customers interested in having plants with planning and production executed automatically and using advanced analytics.”

Digital twins and AI

Using AI in predictive analytics to anticipate manufacturing problems—the predictive plant—is the next level of digital maturity after a connected plant says Yvonne Duckworth Industry 4.0 specialist director of digital technology and senior automation engineer at CRB. “Predictive analytics can reduce downtime and promote quality” says Duckworth. She points to a real-life example of a vibrating agitator that unthreaded itself before the operators noticed; if a vibration sensor had been attached to the agitator the control system would have flagged the vibration as a concern before it could have been seen by a human eye. “Some equipment vendors don’t yet offer this capability; some have vibration or temperature sensors available as options and others offer a fully integrated predictive analytics platform” says Duckworth. “Vendors have been challenged over the past year to have an answer to the question of predictive analytics capability.”

Another step forward on the digital journey is the use of digital twins which are digital models of a physical system. Brandl says that digital twins have been used for the past 30 years in process industries where the chemistry of the processes is well understood. Only recently however enabled by AI and data availability have digital twins been developed for biological processes where there is no ‘first principle’ development possible he says. “Automation brings in the data for machine learning to model the dynamic processes of cell growth and map it against the multiple dimensions provided by advanced sensors” explains Brandl.

Digital twins are being used today in biopharma process development to optimize the process in a simulated environment. They can also be used for collaborating in real-time across the value chain and validating new lines and processes virtually says Coglaiti.

“We will likely see biopharma manufacturers moving from using the digital twin primarily as a simulation and training component to making it a key part of the overall dynamic control of the process” suggests Pettus. “Manufacturing models are becoming more well defined and well understood and measurements that were virtually impossible to understand in the past are now enabled with various technologies such as spectral-based techniques. As the industry becomes more comfortable with this more complex closed-loop control and includes the digital process response predictions with advanced control techniques we will see the digital twin become even more relevant than it already is today.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhbC1hbS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYS1nYW1lLW9mLWhpZGUtYW5kLXNlZWstd2l0aC1yZW5pc2hhdy1hbmQtYWx0YWlyLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLXBvd2VyZWQtcXVhbGl0eS1hc3N1cmFuY2Utb24tdGhlLWZseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renishaw and Altair's metal 3D printing and AI experiment,"Share to your network:

Quality management in metal Additive Manufacturing is one of the biggest challenges faced by today’s producers on their way to mass production – potentially requiring extensive process monitoring and the physical testing of every single part produced. In an effort to improve process monitoring and reduce the extent of non-destructive testing from for example a 100% CT scanning-based qualification processes Renishaw and Altair set out to explore new possibilities using artificial intelligence (AI). The focus of the project was to develop a methodology to analyse the incredibly large quantities of manufacturing data generated. Putting artificial intelligence to the test the two companies sought a novel way to simplify quality control and potentially accelerate the qualification process paving the way toward Artificial Intelligence-powered real-time meltpool analytics.

Laser Beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB) is the most well-established metal Additive Manufacturing process using 3D model data and a laser (or increasingly multiple lasers) to selectively melt and fuse powder layer after layer enabling the production of complex parts and structures. While metal Additive Manufacturing offers many benefits for innovative industry verticals such as aerospace and medical device production (for example the use of difficult to work materials mass reduction and the reduction of material waste) manufacturing defects must still be avoided and the highest quality standards adhered to.

In addition to conventional geometric dimensional and surface quality requirements the characteristics of the metal material itself are under incredible scrutiny. Factors such as density stiffness strength fatigue resistance and increasingly conductivity are subject to unprecedented analysis.

Many of the most critical applications for additively manufactured parts demand stringent quality checks after production. Typically these inspection processes are time consuming and expensive. To reduce this effort engineers are constantly seeking ways to detect manufacturing defects on the fly which means while the production process is still running. To do so engineering teams need to establish a monitoring process for equipment to ensure stability and productivity throughout the entire operation.

Scan to find scrap

Physically inspecting the entire production output of a metal AM machine is an incredibly inefficient way to work and indeed is widely seen as one of the biggest hurdles to the widespread adoption of the technology in production scenarios. In many other production processes a subset of manufactured parts is inspected in numbers that provide a statistically derived confidence in the stability of the process. However given the relative newness of metal AM there is not the same wealth of experience and data against which production engineers can compare output. This is particularly true in cases of brand new products – which many AM parts are.

Renishaw and Altair’s experiment therefore set out to see if their existing AM and Artificial Intelligence expertise could be brought to bear in simplifying the quality control process for end-users. As well as being a manufacturer of PBF-LB AM machines Renishaw is a leader in the fields of process control and automation. In the 1970s Renishaw gave the world the touch-trigger probe device found in machine tools and CMMs across the globe to this day. In the intervening years Renishaw has become a market leader in the fields of machine calibration positional encoders and healthcare device production. Altair is a global leader in computational science and artificial intelligence that provides software and cloud solutions in simulation high-performance computing (HPC) data analytics and Artificial Intelligence. In an experimental setting the two companies brought this expertise together to put artificial intelligence to the test with the aim of answering two questions:

Can Artificial Intelligence find anomalies in a single sample hidden among many without knowing what or where the anomaly is?

Is it possible to use inline machine learning routines to find an automated gauging process and reduce the burden of non-destructive testing?

The starting point: It’s all in the data!

Renishaw’s flagship Additive Manufacturing machine the RenAM 500Q has four 500 W lasers and a build volume of 250 x 250 x 350 mm. The machine offers automatic powder and waste handling alongside one of the most innovative precise and repeatable digital optical platforms on the market from proof of concept to volume production. Rather than sourcing a third party process monitoring solution Renishaw developed its own solution for in-situ monitoring of the meltpool at the powder bed. By doing this it has the capability to ‘lift the curtain’ on the data to a greater extent than is the case in many other similar PBF-LB systems.

Fig. 4 Schematic illustration of meltpool monitoring (Courtesy Renishaw)

During the build process light is emitted from the meltpool in various forms. Of particular interest are the wavelengths corresponding to plasma (visible) light and infra-red (invisible) light. In addition it is beneficial to monitor the wavelength corresponding to the laser itself. By steering these spectral emissions through the optical head and onto a bank of photodiodes it is possible to sample the intensity of emissions relative to their corresponding 3D position in space. The sample rates in use are extraordinary: typically in the order of 100 kHz or about 20000 samples in the time it takes to blink. Such incredible rates of data capture lead to a significant data storage demand.

To help in using the data Renishaw’s software solution InfiniAM Spectral filters and renders a graphical representation of the data in a conventional Windows environment. From here it is an intuitive process for an engineer to browse through the 2D layers of data or indeed view a 3D representation of the additively manufactured part coloured according to the intensity of the signals received.

While intuitive to view there is still a degree of experience required on the part of the engineer viewing the data. There can be so much data available that it is sometimes difficult to interpret in an effective manner. To that end automating the process – especially in real-time – could be a real boon to the end-user. Given the sheer volume of data involved machine learning makes logical sense to implement. This is where Altair’s Artificial Intelligence technology comes to the forefront.

Finding the odd one out: Flying blind

As machine learning (ML) algorithms have become more accurate with increased computation power engineers can now depend on ML technology to make decisions from data without compromising floor efficiency. To leverage this technology Renishaw asked Altair to dive deep into the data in a special test. Renishaw wanted to use Altair’s Artificial Intelligence technology to flag anomalous builds and regions within those builds by analysing spectral data in real time enabling quality assessent on the fly without the need to wait until production ends.

Fig. 6 Hide and seek test setup: three builds with ten probes (Courtesy Renishaw)

The task for Altair was to set up a data model for the automatic detection of nonconformities and in effect create an in-situ decision making toolset. The test consisted of three physical cobalt chromium builds on the Renishaw machine: each build containing ten standard 10 mm density coupons so thirty coupons in total. In one of these thirty blocks there would be a deliberately induced non-conformity. Altair was provided no information as to what had been done and where. Moreover Altair was not provided with any baseline for what ‘good’ even looked like. Altair was more or less ‘flying blind’ only able to see what the quality assurance model was able to identify. The task was split into two levels:

Build: Detect the non-conforming print

Detect the non-conforming print Region: Detect the 3D region or volume of interest within the non-conforming build.

From data to insight

To turn the data into useful insights four major steps are required:

Data acquisition Preparation Anomaly detection Visualisation or real-time monitoring

As the spectral data are captured with a very high sampling rate the initial step for Altair is data pre-processing. In a function referred to as ‘feature engineering’ five time domain statistical features are extracted per layer. This reduces the noise in the raw data and accelerates the training process of the downstream anomaly detection models. Another positive effect of this pre-processing is a reduction in the sheer size of the raw data.

Fig. 7 Data reduction to statistical features in time-domain (Courtesy Altair)

To identify anomalies Altair uses three different approaches: hyperplane density and tree-based algorithms. The extracted features from the data preparation process are fed into SignalAI to identify the algorithm best suited to distinguishing the outliers. After applying various options a tree-based method proved best for the application. When comparing the algorithms two factors stand out. Analysing each spectral parameter independently the tree-based algorithm flagged Build 3 as the anomaly unanimously. So it is very consistent in its prediction. On top of this the tree-based algorithm also has higher confidence scores for its predictions. Once the third build was identified the same process was repeated and an anomaly corresponding to the fourth block of that build was successfully detected.

Renishaw confirmed the automated prediction when they revealed that the fourth block in the third build was indeed anomalous. In this case the laser power used for hatching the block was dramatically reduced from standard processing conditions. The effects were also borne out in the Archimedes density measurements reflecting one of the many various inspection techniques in use today. Note the very subtle difference in Archimedes measurement for a 50% reduction in laser power.

This data-driven model can detect anomalies and assign them to a corresponding area of a build job. From the implementation perspective within Altair’s product line data analytics was successfully performed using in Altair Knowledge Studio® as well as in Altair Compose®. Expanding on this adding Altair® Panopticon™ dashboards can be used to visualise and monitor the final results in real time if continuous remote monitoring is required.

Reducing the burden of non-destructive testing

The Altair tool was used to successfully detect anomalous builds during the metal Additive Manufacturing process. Without any prior knowledge of previous build characteristics the software was able to successfully determine a non-conforming build and region of interest within that build. The potential of machine learning capability to actively monitor data from manufacturing runs immediately became apparent to the teams at Renishaw and Altair. The opportunity for manufacturing teams to reduce or eradicate physical comparison and detailed inspection of datasets and parts should not be underestimated; the potential time and cost savings could be a leap forward in enabling rapid certification of additively manufactured products.

Making way for the future: metal AM goes Artificial Intelligence

For manufacturers using metal AM technologies these tests suggest that Artificial Intelligence could enable them to reduce the burden of non-destructive testing by sorting out the candidates where anomalies occurred. Instead of scanning every single part with a CT scanner the software can tell them which component will not pass the quality check. This method allows a faster and more precise pre-qualification of parts. In the future this could save up to 90% of inspection efforts resulting in an enormous increase in efficiency. Another benefit is that this methodology can be added to an existing quality assurance system hence using existing resources. As quality assurance happens during the production process this is a closed process an in-situ quality assurance paving the way to short-term and long-term advantages.

Implementing data-driven decision making from the ground up allows design and manufacturing teams to holistically analyse processes to improve an organisation’s smart factory practices. Looking forward an Artificial Intelligence-driven manufacturing approach offers endless possibilities for machine improvement such as identifying the best sensor type and location for an application and shared learning to improve processes within an enterprise with a hybrid cloud approach.

Reducing the number of non-destructive tests – particularly for safety-relevant components in aerospace or healthcare – can help manufacturers worldwide to cut down on quality assurance effort and cost and take another big step towards lean manufacturing. As quality management in metal AM has always been a major bottleneck for mass production looking for ways to reduce or perhaps even eliminate this obstacle might be the biggest advantage manufacturers can now look forward to. This novel method of in-situ quality assurance could pave the way for a whole new manufacturing world.

Altair’s signalAI

Data pre-processing and modelling in Altair Knowledge Studio using the signalAI tools (Courtesy Altair)

Altair signalAI is a versatile tool which augments the power of signal processing with machine learning to perform sensor signal-based predictive analytics. It is designed to address various types of use cases under the predictive maintenance umbrella with a special focus on anomaly detection fault classification and root cause analysis. In terms of capabilities on the data preprocessing front signalAI offers both time and frequency domain feature analysis and on the analytics front currently it supports several state-of-the-art anomaly detection models off the shelf.

Within Altair’s product line signalAI is available with Altair Knowledge Studio® as well as in Altair Compose®. Following the broader Altair theme of ‘low code/no code’ environment signalAI is also designed by keeping ease of use for the users as the primary focus and hence can be controlled via drag and drop with minimal effort from the user. On top of this for the purpose of end-to-end deployment signalAI can be hooked up with Altair SmartWorks IoT if there is a need for real-time data stream monitoring and Altair Panopticon for end-point inference and result visualisation and dashboarding.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xNTI1Mi0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Automated methodology for optimal selection of minimum electrode subsets for accurate EEG source estimation based ...,"Methodology for channel selection based on genetic algorithm multi-objective optimization

EEG source reconstruction refers to the estimation of the properties of the source activity (source location direction and waveform) from the information registered by the electrodes on the scalp. To estimate this the EEG inverse problem must be solved (the inverse problem is presented in more detail in “EEG forward and inverse problems” section). The proposed methodology combines a source reconstruction algorithm and the NSGA-II16 where the algorithm objective is to find electrode subsets with the minimum number of channels that retain the highest possible source localization accuracy (the accuracy of the reference HD-EEG). For the optimization process several inputs are required: The EEG or the event related potentials (ERPs) of the source(s) to analyze the head model (this is required for source reconstruction see “EEG forward and inverse problems” section) and the ground-truth location of the source activity to calculate the localization errors. The general structure of the automated methodology is presented in Fig. 1. The process can be summarized by a loop of four blocks: NSGA-II Weighting Source Reconstruction and Performance indexes where the outputs of NSGA-II are a set of best channel combinations and a set of all candidates.

An optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a function by systematically choosing input values from a valid set and computing the value of the function which can be limited to one or more constraints or can have no restrictions. In an optimization problem the model is feasible if it satisfies all the restrictions and it is optimal if it also produces the best value for the objective function. In the case of a Multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) it has two or more objective functions which are to be either minimized or maximized. As in a single-objective optimization problem a MOOP may contain a set of constraints which any feasible solution must satisfy26. In a multi-objective optimization problem there is a set of solutions that is superior to the others in the search space when all the objectives are considered but inferior to the other solutions for one or more objectives. Such solutions are known as Pareto-optimal solutions or non-dominated solutions and the rest as dominated solutions. The non-dominated sorting ranking selection method is used to emphasize good candidates and a niche method is used to maintain stable sub-populations of good points. NSGAs were created based on this concept27.

The central block of NSGA-II consists of several stages: Population initialization Fitness calculation Crossover Mutation Survivor selection and Termination criteria to return the best solutions. The population consists of a set of chromosomes which are possible solutions to the problem and each chromosome can have as many genes as variables in the problem. In this case each gene represents an EEG channel and the chromosome contains as many genes as the number of EEG channels in the registered EEG represented by \({{\varvec{y}}}\). A chromosome structure representing the electrode combination is presented at the bottom-left of Fig. 1. The NSGA-II initializes with a population of P chromosomes with random binary values. Then in the weighting block the gene values are used to weight the EEG by a dot multiplication between the EEG and the chromosome to compute the weighted EEG \({{\varvec{y_{w}}}} = {{\varvec{y}}} \cdot chromosome\). As a result of this mathematical operation the channels with a gene value of one keep their value while information of the channels with a gene value of zero is discarded.

The algorithm is defined to minimize the number of EEG channels used to localize single or multiple sources as a fixed objective. Minimizing the localization error of a number s of desired sources to localize is defined as a subsequent separate objective one per each source. Therefore the number of objectives O is defined as \(O=s+1\). NSGA uses a non-dominated sorting ranking selection method to emphasize good candidates and a niche method to maintain stable sub-populations of good points (Pareto-front) where a non-dominated solution is a solution that is not dominated by any other solution27.

The weighted EEG \({{\varvec{y_{w}}}}\) is used in the source reconstruction block for calculating the source activity and estimating the location of each source. In each weighted EEG \({{\varvec{y_{w}}}}\) the non-selected channels are converted to a temporal data series with zero value. Therefore the inverse solution is calculated using all the electrodes available in the head conduction model but the information contained in the non-used electrodes is discarded during source estimation. The use of all electrodes is preferred to avoid increasing the ill-posedness of the inverse problem when using a subset of the volume conduction matrix and to avoid using computational resources for re-calculating the volume conduction for each candidate combination.

In the performance indexes block the number of channels extracted from each chromosome and the localization errors per each source are computed by comparing the estimated position with the ground-truth. The performance indexes return to the NSGA-II block that applies the non-dominated sorting and half of the population with better performance is used to create the next generation using crossover and mutation procedures. For this NSGA-II uses Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) and Polynomial mutation with crossover probability as 0.9 and mutation probability 1/n where n is the number of decision variables2728. The actual generation finishes when a new population is created and the process is repeated with the next generation until the termination criterion is reached. We used a maximum number of generations as criterion to stop the algorithm.

Finally from the all set of chromosomes the best combination per each number of channels is extracted to create a pseudo-Pareto front. In the case of the multiple sources the pseudo-Pareto front is generated from the mean of the localization errors of all the sources.

EEG forward and inverse problems

The electrical activity recorded by the electrodes and its relation with the sources at cortical areas can be represented by the following equation known as forward problem equation29:

$${{\varvec{y}}}={{\varvec{M}}}{{\varvec{x}}}+\varepsilon$$ (1)

The forward problem allows us to compute the potentials registered by the electrodes in the scalp that were produced by current sources in the brain cortical areas. In the forward problem equation \({{\varvec{y}}}\in \mathbb {R}^{d\times K}\) represents the signals recorded by d number of electrodes in K time samples; and \({{\varvec{x}}}\in \mathbb {R}^{n\times K}\) represents the time course activity of n sources at the cerebral cortex. The forward model \({{\varvec{M}}}\in \mathbb {R}^{d\times n}\) represents the relationship of the cortical source activity \({{\varvec{x}}}\) with the electrode measurements \({{\varvec{y}}}\). This matrix is also known as lead field matrix or volume conductor model. In the EEG case \({{\varvec{M}}}\) represents how the electrical field propagates from the current sources in the brain to the scalp where the voltages are registered by the electrodes. The variable \(\varepsilon\) represents the noise in the measurements. It is assumed to follow a normal distribution with zero mean.

The inverse problem is the estimation of the current sources in the brain from the electrical potential registered by the electrodes. Computing the sources from the electrode information is an ill-posed problem due to the fact that the number of sources to estimate are much higher than the number of electrodes. An infinite number of combinations of sources could lead to the same recordings obtained by the electrodes. In addition the problem is also ill-conditioned because the solutions are very sensitive to noise and low perturbations on the channels can highly distort the source estimation30.

Source reconstruction algorithms

One of the factors that influences the accuracy of source localization is the inverse algorithm used. For this reason and to consider this influence we have selected three widely used algorithms to solve the inverse problem: wMNE3132 sLORETA13 and MSP33.

wMNE is a variant of the original minimum norm estimation (MNE) based on Tikhonov regularization313435. wMNE involves a weighting matrix to compensate for the distance of the deep sources to the electrodes1336. sLORETA is a well-known method recognized by its zero localization error in the absence of noise3738. This method is based on minimum norm and introduces an improvement by standardizing the solution using the variance of the estimated activity13. MSP is based on a Bayesian approach and utilizes a set of priors over the cortical sheet to optimize hyper-parameters related to the covariance of the source activity3339. This method offers a focalized (less blurry) estimation of the source activity.

Source reconstruction error measurements

The localization error is defined as the euclidean distance between the position of the ground-truth source \(P_x\) in a 3D coordinated space and the estimated source position \(P_{\hat{x}}\) by:

$$\begin{aligned} LocE = ||P_x-P_{\hat{x}}||_2 \end{aligned}$$ (2)

To estimate the source position \(P_{\hat{x}}\) first the element-wise power \({{\varvec{\hat{x}}}}^{\cdot 2} = {{\varvec{\hat{x}}}}\cdot {{\varvec{\hat{x}}}}\) is computed from the estimated activity (where A\(\cdot\)B represents the dot product between A and B). Then the estimated power is averaged over a defined time-of-interest (TOI). Finally the position of the source with the highest average power is selected as the estimated location \(P_{\hat{x}}\).

This error was used in the proposed methodology as an objective to minimize. Relative error and Pearson Correlation Coefficient were used as additional error measurements to compare the time courses between reconstructions done with different numbers of electrodes. Consider \(x_{1i}\) and \(x_{2j}\) as the time courses of two reconstructions in the vertices i and j were the source with highest amplitudes were found being \(x_{1i}\) the time course of the reconstruction computed with the highest number of electrodes. These metrics can be computed by using the following equations:

$$\begin{aligned} RelE = \frac{||x_{1i} - x_{2j}||_2}{||x_{1i}||_2} \end{aligned}$$ (3)

and

$$\begin{aligned} r = \frac{\sum (x_{1i}-\overline{x}_{1i})(x_{2j}-\overline{x}_{2j})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_{1i}-\overline{x}_{1i})^2\sum (x_{2j}-\overline{x}_{2j})^2}} \end{aligned}$$ (4)

where \(\overline{x}\) represents the mean of the values of x.

Evaluation framework

We evaluated the proposed methodology over synthetic and real EEG signals. In the section below we present the synthetic EEG dataset with multiple-source activity and its simulation framework that can be used for evaluating inversion algorithms. We have tested the automated methodology for channel selection over this dataset under single- and multiple-source cases. Furthermore we have applied the methodology on real EEG signals by using the dataset “Localize-MI” by Mikulan et al.25. HD-EEG was recorded during intracerebral stimulation and the ground-truth activity location is therefore available. Multiple tests of the methodology have been performed and they are presented and described in “Test structure” section.

Synthetic EEG dataset

The synthetic EEG dataset consists of 150 trials of multiple source activity. We used the forward equation 1 to simulate the EEG data. Per each trial the sources were distributed over several regions of the brain. The time courses of the sources were generated using a Gaussian windowed sinusoidal23 defined by the following equation:

$$\begin{aligned} x_i(t_k)=e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{t_k-c_i}{\sigma }\right) ^2}sin(2\pi f_it_k) \end{aligned}$$ (5)

where i represents the source number \(c_i\) the time center of the source activity in seconds \(\sigma _i\) determines the shape of the Gaussian window by adjusting its width and \(f_i\) is the frequency of the sinusoidal activity. The first source \(s_1\) was simulated in the occipital lobe. The activity was centered at \(c_1=0.5\) s and the frequency of the activity set at \(f_1=19\) Hz in the range of beta rhythm. The second source \(s_2\) was located in the sensory-motor cortex with a time center of \(c_2=1\) s and a frequency of \(f_2=10\) Hz in the range of the mu rhythm. The third source \(s_3\) was simulated with a frequency of \(f_3=7\) Hz in the range of theta rhythm. It was centered in time at \(c_3=1.5\) s and located in the frontal lobe. Additional three sources \(s_4\) \(s_5\) and \(s_6\) were generated with similar parameters (location and frequency) as sources \(s_1\) \(s_2\) and \(s_3\) respectively but centered at times \(c_4=2\) s \(c_4=2.5\) s and \(c_6=3\) s. To maintain the evaluations introduced in “Test structure” section within reasonable limits of computational complexity only the first three sources of the dataset were considered for testing in this study. An example of the time course of the simulated sources and their location is shown in Fig. 2. For all the sources the parameter window width was set at \(\sigma =0.12\). This value combined with the center of each source allowed for temporal mixing between sources represented by the light gray areas in Fig. 2. Notice that source \(s_1\) only has temporal mixing in the transition to the next source but \(s_2\) and \(s_3\) have temporal mixing in both sections of the waveform where around 40% of the source activity is overlapped.

Figure 2 Example of simulated source activity. Source \(s_1\) time course is depicted in color blue source \(s_2\) in orange source \(s_3\) in yellow and the remaining activity from \(s_4\) in purple. The locations of the first three sources are depicted on top where the time was chosen where the maximum amplitude value for each source took place. The light gray areas depict the time sections where there are temporal mixing between sources. Full size image

The sources were distributed over the brain in three main areas occipital lobe sensory-motor cortex and frontal lobe. Per each area a set of twelve positions (six per hemisphere) was predefined and during the simulation procedure the position was randomly selected from the pre-defined sets (the information of the 3D location of the sources the vertex index in the head model the number of times the source was selected in the dataset and the brain area are presented in the “Supplementary information” Table 4). This made it possible to create trials with different combinations of sources. Figure 3 shows the locations of the pre-defined sources (represented by the blue circles) and the number of times they were selected in the dataset (represented by the diameter of the circles).

Figure 3 Repetition by source position. Blue circles represent where the simulated activity was located and their diameter represents the number of times that position was selected in the 150 EEG trials. It can be seen that each area (occipital lobe sensory-motor cortex and frontal lobe) has six locations per hemisphere. Full size image

The lead-field matrix for solving the forward problem was taken from a FEM forward model called the “New York head” model40. The model is available at https://www.parralab.org/nyhead/. It was computed by modeling the scalp skull air cavities CSF gray matter and white matter. In FEM models the influence of including the CSF and the white matter during modeling has been found significant for solving the inverse problem41. The New York head model was proposed as a standard model to be used in EEG studies and it is based on a non-linear average of the MRI of 152 adult human brains. The forward model includes a high-resolution lead field matrix relating 75000 sources with 231 channels. It also includes additional versions with a reduced number of sources of 10000 5000 and 200 sources. The model considers 231 electrodes from which 161 are located in the scalp (based on the 10–10 and 10–5 systems) 2 in the left/right preauricular point (LPA/RPA) 4 in the neck and 64 distributed around the face and in the back of the head below Iz channel. Figure 4 presents a lateral and top view of the channel and source locations using the model with 10000 sources.

Figure 4 New York head model with 10000 sources and 231 channels40. Lateral view (left) and top view (right). The blue circles represent the location of the EEG channels over the scalp face and neck while the red circles represent the location of the distributed sources on the brain’s cortical areas. Full size image

The model of 10000 sources was used for forward computations to generate the EEG signals (see “Synthetic EEG dataset” section) and the model of 5000 sources to calculate the inverse solutions. This allows us to avoid the effects of the so-called inverse crime42. The use of the New York head model40 in our experiments is based on several reasons: one reason is that the model was computed using FEM including six tissues and using a more detailed model can yield to more accurate source reconstruction results. Another reason was the number of electrodes available in the model. It considers 231 channels located as per the 10–20 and 10–10 standards and the extended 10–5 system. It is well known that more channels lead to a better reconstruction1115 therefore for a better comparison between the proposed methodology (that identifies an optimized subset of channels) and the full set of electrodes using the maximum possible number of electrodes is desirable.

After calculating the EEG using Eq. 1 the signals of the channels were corrupted with noise with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 dB (signal and noise with the same power). Each trial had a duration of 3.5 s with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz. The dataset with the 150 trials and ground-truth information is available at https://github.com/anfesogu/Ground-Truth-EEG-Dataset to facilitate replication of the results in this paper. It can also be used in future studies where a ground-truth for source localization is required.

Real EEG dataset

We used the dataset “Localize-MI”25 to test the methodology over real EEG signals. The dataset consists of HD-EEG recordings and anonymized MRIs of seven participants that were stimulated with single-pulse biphasic currents by implanted electrodes. The stimulation position is known and the dataset serves as ground-truth for evaluating inverse solutions. The EEG signals were recorded with a 256 geodesic electrode system (Geodesic Sensor Net; HydroCel CleanLeads) where the electrode positions were digitized to allow for co-registration with the MRI. Referring to the original dataset publication: “All of the participants provided their Informed Consent before participating the study was approved by the local Ethical Committee (protocol number: 463-092018 Niguarda Hospital Milan Italy) and it was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.”25

The dataset contains a set of pre-processed epochs from − 300 to 50 ms around the stimulation artifact. They were filtered with a high-pass filter at 0.1 Hz and notch filter at 50 100 150 and 200 Hz (only subjects 5 and 7). Baseline correction was applied between − 300 to − 50 ms. Finally the epochs were averaged and cropped 20 ms around the stimulation artifact. In total the dataset consists of 61 sessions all of which were further used for testing the methodology. Please refer to the original dataset publication for more detailed information25.

A head model of each participant was created to be used during source reconstruction. The models were created by processing the individual MRI using Freesurfer43 (Martinos Imaging Centre Boston MA) and MNE-python44. The number of sources was defined as 4098 per hemisphere and the lead field matrix was computed using BEM considering the conductivities of scalp skull and brain as 0.3 0.006 and 0.3 S/m respectively (MNE-python default values).

Test structure

In this study we proposed multiple tests to investigate the extent to which the quality of the HD-EEG source reconstruction measured in terms of source location error can be retained while using a set of reduced number of channels that were selected by the proposed methodology. The first test was based on source reconstruction for one source. We refer to this as the “single-source test”. This test was performed by setting two minimizing objectives for the optimization: the localization error of the single source and the number of channels. We considered the first source \(s_1\) of the synthetic dataset the epoch was set between 250 to 750 ms including an overlapping section with the next source \(s_2\). In this test the whole epoch was used as TOI to estimate the source location.

A second test was done considering the first three sources of the synthetic dataset \(s_1\) \(s_2\) and \(s_3\). We refer to this as the “multiple-source test”. In this test the epoch definition was set between 250 to 1750 ms and four minimization objectives were set for the optimization algorithm: the individual localization error of each source and the number of channels. The TOIs to estimate the location of the sources were set between 250 to 750 ms 750 to 1250 ms and 1250 to 1750 ms for sources \(s_1\) \(s_2\) and \(s_3\) respectively. To evaluate the approach over different numbers of electrodes we performed three different sub-tests: a first multiple-source sub-test is referred to as “multiple-source test 231e” which considers the full set of 231 electrodes. From those 161 were located at scalp and from those 161 electrodes 73 were located in positions of the standard 10–10 system and 88 were located in positions of the 10–5 system while the other electrodes were placed in the neck and face areas (Fig. 4). A second multiple-source sub-test referred to as “multiple-source test 128e” constrained the search space of the optimization algorithm to 128 scalp electrodes. From those 64 electrodes belong to the standard 10–10 and 64 electrodes from the 10–5 system. A third multiple-source sub-test referred to as “multiple-source test 60e” constrained the search space of the NSGA-II to 60 electrodes all of them located according to the 10–10 standard positions. Figure 5 presents the 161 positions of the scalp electrodes of the New York head model and the subsets configuration for 128 and 60 electrodes.

The third test was done using the Localize-MI dataset. During each session the stimulation took place in the same electrode position therefore we treated the data as single source case and we set two minimizing objectives for the optimization algorithm: the localization error of the artifact source and the number of channels. We refer to this test as the “Localize-MI test”. In this test the whole epoch was used as TOI to estimate the source location.

The procedure during all tests started by defining the electrodes to be considered. Only in the multiple-source tests did the electrode number vary according to the test (when constraining the search space to 128 or 60 electrode positions). In the single-source test all the electrodes were considered. In the case of the Localize-MI test the electrodes that were marked as bad were removed when calculating the forward model and no attempt to clean or interpolate channels was carried out. The number of electrodes used defines the length of the chromosome for the optimization. After setting the number of electrodes the number of objectives was defined and the EEG of each trial (in the case of the synthetic data) or the ERP of the session (in the case of the Localize-MI dataset) was transferred to the algorithm. In the next step the population size and the maximum number of generations were set. Their values were determined experimentally and set as 100 and 400 respectively. Finally the algorithm for source reconstruction was defined and the algorithm could start processing data by combining the NSGA-II with sLORETA wMNE and MSP in separated runs respectively.

Each trial or ERP was processed by the algorithm at least three times each time with a different source reconstruction algorithm. During a run the algorithm evaluated 40000 combinations of electrodes while trying to minimize the objectives. When the run ended an output file with the combinations and performance indexes of all generations and chromosomes was generated. From this the performance of the best combination per each number of channels was extracted to create the pseudo-Pareto front. Finally an accuracy index was computed for comparing the reconstructions from the optimized set of channels versus all the channels available. The accuracy index represents the percentage of trials or ERPs that obtained equal or lower localization error with a given number of electrodes when compared to the accuracy when using all the electrodes for the same trial or ERP.

The proposed methodology was implemented and executed in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc.) version 2016b (www.mathworks.com). The source reconstruction algorithms wMNE and sLORETA were implemented as custom functions in Matlab. To run the MSP method we used the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM; Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging London UK) software for Matlab. The NSGA-II solver by28 was adapted to include source reconstruction. The tests were carried out using the IDUN computing cluster45 of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU. Parts of Figs. 1 2 3 4 8 9 and 10 were generated using Matlab 2016b.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Researchers from Tohoku University in Japan have Developed a Lightweight Deep Learning Model for Automatic Segmentation and Analysis of Ophthalmic Images,"The human eye is said to act as a window for assessing general health. Similar to cerebral and coronary microcirculation in terms of anatomy and physiology is the retinal microvasculature. Therefore knowledge of retinal microvascular structure and changes through time can help doctors identify and treat ocular cardiovascular and brain diseases.

Researchers from Tohoku University in Japan have developed a lightweight deep learning model (LWBNA_Unet) for automatic segmentation and analysis of ophthalmic images. The so-called “lightweight” deep learning (DL) model is 10 times lighter than the most popular model (Unet) in biomedical image segmentation and may be applied to mobile devices and trained using just a few photos even ones with a lot of noise.

Accurately assessing tumors tissue volume or other types of anomalies is necessary for diagnosing disorders. To do this a model must examine distinct pictures and segment them by drawing lines along edges. Since accurate prediction requires more processing power it is challenging to implement them on mobile devices.

The researchers claim that while tele-screening for illnesses and self-monitoring based on DL models are becoming more commonplace deep learning algorithms are often task-specific recognizing or detecting broad objects like people animals or traffic signs.

Regarding deep learning DL models accuracy speed and processing resources are always trade-offs. The proposed model is more effective and lightweight when compared to other commercial software since it has improved segmentation accuracy and model training repeatability even with fewer parameters. The” model is also capable of detecting/segmenting optic discs and hemorrhages in fundus pictures with great precision.” Without the requirement for a bigger training dataset the model may be taught to accurately segment a range of ophthalmic pictures as well as to classify illnesses.

To improve glaucoma screening scientists took measurements of the foveal avascular zone—an area containing the fovea centralis at the retina’s center—using low-resource instruments.

The team intends to use the portable model in the future to check for various illnesses and other common eye conditions."

The Western Nevada College Tech Express Mobile Training Lab provides industry-specific training for Northern Nevada manufacturers and businesses bringing state-of-the-art training and equipment to students and employers in rural areas.

That’s been the case in the latter half of spring semester with WNC providing its custom course Special Topics in Electrical Fundamentals to Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada employees.

Teaching materials were customized in partnership with operational leaders at Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada providing their workers with a solid foundation on electrical circuits and systems.

""This program is one way we are working closely with WNC to develop our employees and keep them up to speed on current technologies. Improving their skills through training is important for our employees as they solidify and grow their careers at Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada” said John Sanchez global supply chain executive.

A third WNC community partner Carson Valley Inn made it easier for the students to access their training by permitting WNC to park its grant-funded Tech Express mobile lab in its parking lot in Minden.

“When WNC asked if we could stage the lab at Carson Valley Inn and explained this incredible resource and how it contributes to workforce development we were pleased to host the lab here” said Maggi Vandenburg sales director for Carson Valley Inn.

WNC's Tech Express Mobile Manufacturing Training Laboratory was created so the college could share its programs with students in rural areas as well as provide important resources that develop a skilled workforce for employers. The project was funded through grants from the Governor’s Office of Economic Development as part of the Workforce Innovations for a New Nevada program the William N. Pennington Foundation Tesla and Wells Fargo.

Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada has hired WNC students previously who have trained in the college’s Automation and Industrial Technology program establishing a pipeline for specific needs they have on their teams.

“This Douglas County employer has been a long-term partner of our programs at the Automation and Industrial Technology Center and we have several previous students working on their teams so when we talk about the details of technical training needed it is easy to find alignment with our classes and available content” said Emily Howarth WNC’s professor of Electronics and Industrial Technology Automation and Industrial Technology Center.

The current students all work in the fields of manufacturing and electrical assembly so the focus was on ensuring a solid foundation of both theory and practice.

“The students have all performed with great professionalism as we have worked together to share space and timing in the mobile lab” Howarth said.

The Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada employees and WNC's Tech Express training lab were relocated to Carson Valley Inn for training because the Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada parking lot was being repaved.

As an added bonus because WNC has spearheaded the Smart Automation Certification Alliance partnership in Nevada Howarth was able to provide these students access to prepare for and earn a leading-edge industry certification — the SACA Electrical Specialist. This is a technical knowledge and skills test to gain silver and gold level certification with a nationally recognized credential.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their long history however the popularity of these loans has waxed and waned over the past several decades. They’ve also evolved over the years to meet the needs of consumers looking for more flexible ways to borrow against their homes.

Here’s a look at the history of home equity loans including their rise to mainstream use in the 1980s part in creating the Great Recession and sudden decline at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key Takeaways Home equity loans have been around since the Great Depression though they were originally used mainly as a last resort for low-income borrowers with few other alternatives.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 helped ignite home equity lending taking away the tax deduction for interest paid on non-mortgage debt.

Home equity loans continued to surge in the 1990s and early 2000s with major banks rolling out large marketing campaigns that touted them as an easy way to turn your equity into cash.

The Great Recession of 2008 put a damper on their use and the COVID-19 pandemic restricted access to them but they still remain popular.

Originally for the Less Creditworthy

Home equity loans which allow homeowners to turn their home equity into cash have been around since the Great Depression although they were relatively uncommon at first. Lenders were primarily consumer finance companies and specialized second mortgage companies with depository institutions accounting for only about two-fifths of loans issued. Economic conditions caused many property owners especially farmers to be at risk of foreclosure and with sources of credit difficult to find the loans began as a way to stave off disaster.

For example if an individual owned a home valued at $100000 and only owed $50000 on their first mortgage a lender might allow the individual to take out another $25000 in the form of a home equity loan. Alas this second mortgage rarely helped in the long run as the Depression deepened and many people lost their properties. As a result home equity loans were equated with poverty and carried a social stigma.

Becoming Mainstream in the 1970s and 1980s

This began to change in the 1970s and 1980s. A number of factors contributed to their explosion in those decades including the fact that more depository institutions—including big-name banks—decided to get into the market.

Banks had certain advantages over finance companies including the ability to offer home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that consumers could access by writing a check. Suddenly homeowners had the ability to borrow only the amount they needed when they needed it rather than taking out a lump-sum loan. Depository institutions also tended to have an older client base than finance companies did with more equity from which to draw.

The popularity of these loans only grew with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which removed the tax deduction for the interest paid on non-mortgage debt. This in conjunction with comparatively low interest rates made home equity loans much more attractive than unsecured loans which you could no longer write off on your tax return. As a result the sector grew at a staggering pace. The total value of outstanding equity loans jumped from $1 billion in 1982 to $188 billion in 1988.



Marketed to the Masses by Big Banks

The 1986 tax law wasn’t the only force driving the explosion of home equity lending however. Around the same time larger banks were undertaking a concerted effort to change the image of second mortgages once thought of as a last resort for the financially troubled.

One of the first things banks did was to change their advertising terminology. Pei-Yuan Chia a former vice chairman at Citicorp who oversaw the bank’s consumer business in the 1980s and 1990s told The New York Times in a 2008 interview: ""Calling it a 'second mortgage' that's like hocking your house but call it 'equity access' and it sounds more innocent."" Citigroup introduced a campaign in the early 2000s urging homeowners to “live richly.” Banco Popular had a “Make Dreams Happen” ad campaign that used the slogan “Need Cash? Use Your Home.”

“Banking started using consumer advertising techniques more like a department store than like a bank” Barbara Lippert of Adweek told The New York Times in 2008. “It was a real change in direction.” What these marketing campaigns usually left out were the dangers that come with these loans including the risk of foreclosure for borrowers who couldn’t pay them back.

Playing a Part in the Great Recession

The market for home equity loans continued to grow through 2005 when the value of new HELOCs reached nearly $364 billion. At that point the growth of the market was fueled in large part by a lowering of credit standards which meant even customers with weaker FICO scores or high debt-to-income (DTI) ratios could often get approved.

This all changed over the next couple of years which saw a dramatic decline in home values and a corresponding surge in defaults engendering the Great Recession. As a result loan originations dropped off dramatically while banks tightened their lending guidelines. As the housing market slowly recovered equity-based lending began picking up though not at the pace experienced during the 2005 peak.

COVID-19 Slows Recovery

Home equity lending dipped again early in the COVID-19 pandemic with banks such as JPMorgan Chase suspending HELOC originations on April 16 2020 based on economic uncertainty and the tumultuous job market. Citigroup followed suit nearly a year later on March 3 2021.

Even with the job market’s recovery and Americans sitting on a record amount of home equity—$9.9 trillion at the end of 2021 according to the data firm Black Knight—both of these major banks have yet to resume new equity loans. Bank of America however has continued to offer HELOCs including a hybrid model with a fixed interest rate that can mimic a home equity loan. According to reportage by The Wall Street Journal it initially implemented tighter lending standards to mitigate credit risk but has since reverted to its previous underwriting policies.



The absence of multiple large banks from the market hasn’t prevented home equity loans from making a comeback in 2021 however. The prospect of continued interest rate increases has made lower-cost home loans more attractive leading to substantial growth in home equity loan originations and new HELOCs.



How Long Have Home Equity Loans Been Around? Advertisements for home equity loans date back to at least the Great Depression. Back then they were relatively rare and usually used by homeowners with no other way to pay off their debts. Their popularity surged in the 1970s and 1980s when larger banks began to offer them and Congress passed legislation that phased out the tax deduction for other types of interest payments.

What Were the First Companies to Offer Home Equity Loans? For much of the 20th century most home equity loans were primarily originated by consumer finance companies companies specializing in second mortgages and even individuals. By the 1970s however more-traditional banks were starting to add these products. As depository institutions they could offer equity-based lines of credit that consumers could access by writing a check.

How Did the Tax Reform Act of 1986 Affect Home Equity Loans? Among other provisions the Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed the tax deduction for interest paid on non-mortgage debt. This made home equity loans a more attractive alternative to other loans.

The Bottom Line

Home equity lending has been around for nearly a century although the industry didn’t really come into its own until banks started reshaping the image of these loans in the 1980s followed by Congress passing legislation that made them more attractive than other forms of borrowing. The Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic both put a damper on their use but as of today home equity loans remain a tremendously popular vessel for borrowing money.

They entered a Bank of America branch at 9:16 a.m. on Feb. 28 1997.

When news broke Tuesday of men in tactical gear with high-powered weapons calmly robbing a Saanich bank followed by a shootout outside retired Saanich detective Chris Horsley was struck by the similarities to the 1997 North Hollywood shootout that changed policing across North America.

“My mind immediately went to the Bank of America shooting — it’s the first thing that popped into my head because I just recognize some of the similarities between those two incidents” said Horsley who was asked to comment on the case.

The North Hollywood shootout involved two bank robbers wearing bulletproof vests and homemade body armour on their legs and carrying automatic rifles. They entered the Bank of America at 9:16 a.m. on Feb. 28 1997.

There was a shootout when they exited.

“They were incredibly casual but they were wearing body armour from head to toe and at the time had significant firepower — high-velocity military-grade sort of weapons” said Horsley.

The two perpetrators died and 12 police officers and eight civilians were injured. It’s estimated the robbers fired 1100 rounds and the police most of whom carried standard-issue pistols fired about 650.

“It was a landmark incident in policing for North America” said Horsley. “The Bank of America robbery was used for training police officers. We actually watched the video we listened to the radio transmission from the robbery … the whole purpose being to learn from the incident and to prepare in the event of something similar happening again.”

That level of firepower was new to police in the late 1990s “so those responding officers in North Hollywood had their handguns and their body armour but they were simply no match for this firepower and the suspects casually walked out of the bank and engaged multiple police — thankfully all of [the officers] survived.”

After the Bank of America robbery long guns were introduced in patrol cars in the United States and then Canada. “That permeated all the way to Saanich and Victoria police here” said Horsley.

“In recent years if there’s a call for service you’ll see a police officer carrying a long gun. That’s become the norm. At the time of the Bank of America robbery that was unheard of” said Horsley.

On Tuesday in Saanich two heavily armed suspects in protective gear were killed and six members of the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team were wounded in a shootout at the Bank of Montreal on Shelbourne Street in Saanich.

The suspects have been identified as twin brothers Issac and Mathew Auchterlonie of Duncan. Police said the brothers don’t have criminal records.

The RCMP bomb disposal unit removed “extremely dangerous” explosives from a suspect vehicle at the scene and transported them to Hartland Landfill for destruction.

Witness Shelli Fryer 59 told the Times Colonist she was in the manager’s office of the Bank of Montreal for an appointment when there was an “incredible explosion.” Then a man carrying an assault rifle and wearing a balaclava asked the manager for access to the vault. Fryer noted that during the ordeal the gunmen were quiet and calm. When they left the building however there was a massive shootout.

“As a retired officer on the sidelines having received that training there just appears to be so many similar parallels to this recent incident and that case from all those years ago including the demeanour of the suspects and the fact they appear to be wearing a lot of protective gear in anticipation potentially of an armed encounter” said Horsley.

Horsley said the weight of protective gear heavy weapons and ammunition can in part dictate the way a person moves and in the 1997 robbery the men might have had an air of invincibility because of their weapons.

According to the documentary North Hollywood Shootout — Situation Critical both men took the barbiturate phenobarbital prior to the robbery to calm their nerves. They allegedly filled a jam jar with gasoline and put it in the back seat of their vehicle to set it on fire and destroy the evidence.

Horsley said despite the time gap he wondered if it was a copycat case. “Bank robberies have almost become a thing of the past” said Horsley. “They don’t happen that often anymore because even if they do get some money by passing a note they get a minimal amount.” Bank-robbery perpetrators are also often career criminals.

Horsley said it struck him as strange that Tuesday’s bank robbery based on public reports started with an explosion. He said standard practice would be to enter the bank quietly and avoid a scene.

As for the bravery shown by officers Horsley said that reflects their training. “I know locally not just with the Saanich police but with other departments those officers will be the first to go into danger and put themselves at risk and we’ve had many incidents here in Greater Victoria where that’s exactly what has transpired.""

Horsley suspects there will be more accounts of heroism not only by police but by B.C. Ambulance personnel Saanich firefighters other first responders and hospital staff.

Horsley who retired while a detective staff sergeant in February said he felt helpless hearing the news and not being able to assist.

“There’s a feeling of helplessness that you can’t go to help people who are not just your former colleagues but a lot of them are your friends” said Horsley “but I also know that the level of training that police officers receive in this country is very high and at times like this you will always default back to your training and the skills that have been ingrained in you.”

Large companies are disappearing at a much younger age than they used to. According to a study by management consulting firm McKinsey the average lifespan of a company on the S&P 500 list of the publicly traded enterprises was 61 years in the late 1950s. In 2016 it had fallen to just 18 years. Today companies are merged bought-out or simply go belly up at a much faster pace than they used to.

The longevity of companies on another index the Fortune 500 which compiles the largest 500 U.S. publicly traded and private corporations based on revenue is comparable to S&P 500 corporations according to Mark Perry senior fellow of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Perry found that in 2019 only 52 companies have been on the Fortune 500 list since its inception in 1955.

Why only about one in 10 of these companies have lasted for at least 64 years is a matter of academic discussion. One popular explanation is the concept of creative destruction which says that in order to innovate we need to dismantle the old. Companies therefore cease to exist (at least in their original configurations) when they’re supplanted by companies involved in newer industries and innovations. (These are the most innovative companies in 2021.)

We live in a time of accelerated technological disruption and record-high merger and acquisition activity too which might help to explain why modern large companies have shorter lifespans than they used to.

So what about the stalwarts the oldest companies? Why is Bank of New York Mellon founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1784 still around? Part of the reason is that companies in certain industries benefit from their longevity. Fortune 500 companies involved in financial services (like Edward Jones) and energy (like Exxon) tend to have older foundation dates for example.

The largest newest companies (think Amazon Alphabet and Apple) tend to be involved in the latest innovations and newest industries. The youngest company on our list is over 150 years old. Apple is not even 50. (These are America’s most hated companies.)

To determine the oldest companies in the Fortune 500 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data on Fortune’s website. Companies in the 2021 Fortune 500 were ranked based on founding date. Data on annual revenue and number of employees also came from Fortune.

""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video . ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

It's no secret that celebrities spend a lot of time preparing for the Met Gala whether it's going through hair and makeup trials or eating a specialized diet . Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

A kangaroo spotted hopping loose Wednesday on the streets in Louisiana USA is said to have been released from his enclosure by a parrot.

Officials from the Zachary Police Department safely captured the marsupial wandering around the city and returned it to its home on Thursday.

However at the time the police did not say where the non-native animal had come from.

Now according to media reports the “owners” of the kangaroo named Baxter have said he was released from his enclosure by a mischievous parrot.

Rehabilitators at Bird Recovery International a non-profit working to return exotic birds to their natural habitat have the custody of Baxter. He shares his home with over a dozen parrots and one of the troublemakers named “Thor” recently figured out how to open the lock of the kangaroo’s enclosure.

People who saw the joey hopping along the streets were in disbelief.

Two brothers Ethan and Braden Nelson were driving down a road the morning Baxter was spotted and noticed something zoom past them in a drainage ditch.

""He said 'there's a kangaroo on the side of the road!' I was like what are you talking about? I turn around and sure enough there was a kangaroo"" Ethan told a news outlet.

Baxter’s owners who previously owned a zoo will have to hand him over to authorities since it’s illegal to keep a kangaroo defined as an exotic pet under Louisiana law.

Few of us have met Hannah Clarke but most will not forget her name.

Hannah and her three children – Aaliyah 6 Laianah 4 and Trey 3 – were burnt to death after Rowan Baxter ambushed their vehicle in Brisbane on February 19 2020.

Hannah and her children were staying with Hannah’s parents Sue and Lloyd fearful of the ex-husband who could not countenance a life without the woman he decided early on he owned.

Their death made international headlines and focused policy-makers’ deliberations around coercive control domestic violence funding and police training.

The prime minister premier police commissioner and a stack of other big wigs lined up in the front pew for a funeral that could not have been sadder.

More than two years later we now have the results of a coroner’s investigation – and its determination should be a big red alert in how we see domestic violence.

Coroner Jane Bentley’s voice broke as she handed down her findings which included a judgement that it was unlikely anyone could have stopped Baxter’s murderous path.

She’s right. As a journalist I’ve followed this story from a few moments after a plume of smoke and a symphony of sirens went off in a street only a few over from where I live.

Nothing could have stopped Rowan Baxter who the coroner also found to be a “master of manipulation’’.

A consummate manipulator

Baxter was able to borrow money from strangers have good people put their own reputation on the line to defend his and convince others over and over again that it was Hannah that was the bad one here not him.

Even after her death and the revelations of his violence were aired two of his colleagues continued to call me arguing that I had been ‘brainwashed’ by those on Hannah’s ‘side’.

Rowan Baxter was a consummate actor and his own son – by a previous relationship – says that.

Baxter twice said he’d murder his son too – once when he was about 10 and another when he was a couple of years older.

“I’m not sure if he was going to hang us (he and his mother) or choke us’’ he told me after Hannah’s murder.

Baxter confirmed that story to others. One of them a friend told me he asked if he could ever see himself planning to kill someone else again. His answer: “No. No. No. No way’’.

So would coercive control laws – now ready to be implemented in different jurisdictions in Australia – have worked with Rowan Baxter? It’s unlikely.

Would a domestic of apprehended violence order have stopped a monster who was seen on CCTV cameras buying zip ties fuel and three Kinder Surprise chocolates – presumably for his children – a few days before the killing? It didn’t.

Could Baxter’s friends who checked on him helped him back into businesses lent him money have seen this coming? None of them did.

Ms Bentley recommended a raft of changes particularly to police training – and that is welcome.

But she also said this: “I find it unlikely that any further actions taken by police officers service providers friends or family members could have stopped Baxter from ultimately executing his murderous plans.’’

That should be the line we focus on with a renewed effort going forward.

Spotting those sinister red flags

How do we pick up the little red flags decades before a problem?

Baxter had a violent childhood a dislike of new migrants and a willingness to engage in road rage. But none of those make him a killer.

And how do we teach our children what to look for in a partner? Hannah Clarke was savvy and ‘switched on’ and couldn’t really see Baxter’s manipulative control until she felt it was too late to leave.

Indeed Hannah had never heard the term ‘coercive control’ until a police officer explained it to her.

Addressing domestic violence during relationships is crucial but this tragic case – and the coroner’s finding – shows the focus has to start so much earlier.

We teach children about healthy eating and exercise from the time they understand what that means.

Surely this case highlights that need to teach children – with the same priority – about the attributes they should look for in a partner.

BRK-B,Berkshire Hathaway,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYWNxdWlyZXJzbXVsdGlwbGUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvY2hyaXMtYmxvb21zdHJhbi1iZXJrc2hpcmUtaGF0aGF3YXktaXMtYS1ib25kLXRoYXQteWllbGRzLTgtMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Bloomstran: Berkshire Hathaway Is A 'Bond' That Yields 8.3%,"In his recent interview on the Colossus Podcast Chris Bloomstran explained why Berkshire Hathaway is a ‘bond’ that yields 8.3%. Here’s an excerpt from the podcast:

Bloomstran: I look at Berkshire. If you’ve got $50 billion in economic earning power today on a business that now has a market cap of 600 billion let’s call it and trading at 12 times earnings. On 50 billion you’re trading at 600 you’re trading at 12 you’ve got an 8.3% earnings yield.

To me the best way to explain Berkshire and the advantage of it is it’s a bond where as an acquirer of Berkshire as a shareholder buying shares today at an 8.3% earnings yield when Berkshire’s buying stock back at today’s price they’re buying it at 8.3%. But the entirety of their profits that are retained after taxes are paid by Berkshire are being reinvested at 10 to 12%. That’s still the hurdle rate. That’s on the 30 year bond.

I did some math on the 30 year. I think I identified the worst performing bond in the history of the United States. Government bond. They issued a 2% in 2020 on 2/15/20. And it traded up as interest rates dropped during the pandemic to 120. That thing’s now in the low ’70s. It’s lost 40% of its price.

So you bought that thing at the peak you bought it at 120 you’re making two coupon. You’re going to lose 20 points to maturity. You’re going to mature at par but you’re investing at 2. But every time you get your coupon payments semi-annual coupons 1% every six months if you’re going back into the bond market you’re buying whatever the current yields are. So if interest rates average 2 or 3 or 4% you’re starting off at 2 and you’re buying at 2 and 3.

In Berkshire’s case you’re buying it at 8.3 they’re reinvesting it at 10 to 12. And they have a durable set of places to go invest the money and not blow it up. And nobody does that. Nobody does that. There’s just such a need to spend. The media and these boo birds that watch Berkshire and lament over this enormous cash balance. Why can’t they spend it? Why can’t they spend it?

They’ll spend it on their time and they’ll lay it out on very attractive terms. And they’re not going to put it in places that are going to blow it up.

But there's been one question floating around since the start of the Netflix original series: Who is Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown)'s biological father? Well it seems that season 4 left a massive trail of breadcrumbs and fans have picked up on it.

With Eleven returning to the Hawkins Lab to regain her powers and consequentially reliving her upbringing in the facility fans on TikTok pointed out Eleven's unmatched strength over all the other kids and that's because some believe that her dad is actually One. Honestly the math adds up.

Photo credit: Netflix

A video posted by Just The Nobodys podcast lays out a timeline of the MKUltra experiments (basically how all the kids got their powers) — starting with Eleven's mom Terry Ives (Aimee Mullins) who joined the project in 1969. We know Eleven was born in 1971 which means her mom got pregnant with her during the tests sometime in 1970. A 1959 flashback in the mid-season 4 finale reveals a 12-year-old One (Jamie Campbell Bower). That puts One a.k.a. Vecna as 24 when Eleven was born.

""The theory is that Brenner knew that none of the kids numbers Two through Ten were as strong as number One"" one of the podcast hosts said in the TikTok clip. ""So Dr. Brenner waited for One to get older to make him breed with Terry Ives to create Eleven — to make sure that she was the strongest and clearly she is.""

Stranger Things fans seem split as some commenters bought into it while others still held onto skepticism. ""Could explain why the mother has visions. It’s because the Vecna (001) is actually inside her just like Will 😳"" one person wrote in the comments section. ""I used to think Papa was her actual dad"" another added. ""That's what I thought but [One] looks wayyy younger than El's mom 💀💀"" a different fan said.

Like the TikTok points out One also knows exactly how to unlock Eleven's full powers unlike Brenner. It's because Eleven has the same exact powers that he does. He even says that she reminds him a lot of himself.

In ""Chapter Six: The Dive"" One tells Eleven that Brenner doesn't always tell the truth. Fans think that One hinted at her mother here but gets punished by Brenner because he doesn't want Eleven to know the truth about her parents.

We've certainly heard stranger things ... Let's hope all will be revealed in season 5!

White beaches and exotic cities are paradise for some. But my family and I enjoy the simple pleasures of serene lakes rustling prairie grass and peaceful woods.

In May my partner and I decided to take the plunge and acquire a small piece of recreational land in Pine County where our family could camp hunt and just relax.

Our dream was a common one. This year's sales of recreational land in Minnesota and a handful of other states will match or exceed last year's near-record level estimates PotlatchDeltic a timber company that stays on top of the market.

Brett Anderson an adviser at Brainerd real estate firm Close-Converse and LandRadar.com said demand for recreational land picked up including with first-time buyers from the Twin Cities as people sought an escape from lockdown conditions. ""To find a 40- or 80-acre property where they can take their masks off was a nice option"" he said.

Here are some things I learned during our land-buying process and tips I wish I had before we started:

Know what and why you want to use the land

The first step is to really think about what you will use the land for said Jim Nelson founder of family-run Timber Ghost Realty in North St. Paul. Is it for hunting? Fishing? Do you want to build a house on it someday? If you want to eventually build on the land you will need to explore things like zoning utilities and soil condition.

What times of the year would you like to use it? What sort of species of animal and trees would you like to see there? Would you consider a cheaper river property as opposed to being on a lake? How far can it be from home? The farther from the Twin Cities the cheaper the property is likely to be.

Look in winter

Many people make their land purchases in the spring or fall but winter can also be a good time to look Anderson said. With the trees bare and wetter areas frozen you can get a better visual of the landscape and it can be easier to walk around. Since there was still snow on the ground when we looked at our property we were able to see that the area got a lot of wildlife from all the tracks and scat on the ground.

Ask plenty of questions

In Minnesota sellers of recreational land don't have much obligation to disclose information about their properties so buyers should try to understand as many of the risks about a property as they possibly can by asking questions Anderson said. ""You don't have to purchase the land if you don't get a satisfactory answer prior to executing a purchase agreement"" he said.

We texted with the seller and his real estate agent pretty steadily about everything from problem wet areas to the fertilizer smell from a nearby farm. It never hurts to ask and I was grateful we were able to learn so much before we bought the property. Many counties have digital maps that can provide information on wetland areas soil types and other valuable data. Mobile apps like onX Hunt are also helpful and show property lines.

Don't forget to ask questions as you go through different parts of the paperwork process. A day before we closed we raised questions about a mistake in the closing documents a move that saved us $1000.

Use a real estate agent with land experience

We didn't use a separate real estate agent to represent us and ended up having the seller's agent be a facilitator for the deal. Our own agent would likely have saved us money. It helps to use an agent with actual experience in land sales since the process can be so different from residential. Anderson's LandRadar.com has a helpful toolbox of resources including a checklist for land buyers.

Make sure details are spelled out

Our deal almost fell through because of a disagreement over a deer stand. The seller said the shed and a deer stand were to go with the property. Late in the process we learned that he was referring to a second deer stand on the property and not the larger more expensive one that was prominently on the land. Make sure you and the seller spell out exactly what items and tools are going to stay on the property. Negotiate for things like chain saws lawn mowers wheelbarrows and utility carts. It can end up saving you a lot of money and time in the end.

Determine accessibility before you finalize

Our land is on a minimally maintained dirt township road. Accessibility determines usability how many seasons you will be able to enjoy your property what you can bring there and how easy it would be to add utilities.

For us we knew we wanted to put a camper on the land so the road needed to be good enough to haul our trailer. We also checked with a portable toilet company before we closed the deal to make sure it could get a truck up the road. If we couldn't get the toilet serviced we wouldn't have bought the property.

Explore different financing options

Seasonal cabins and recreational land don't qualify for conventional mortgage programs according to Finlayson Minn.-based Northview Bank branch manager and Vice President Tom Willie. A recreational land loan is a product that banks are able to keep in their own loan portfolio instead of being sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac which often happens to home mortgages Willie said.

Banks that finance land purchases have different rates and terms. Some banks won't finance land at all or will only do it within a certain area. Some lenders also offer land or lot loans for vacant land buyers who want to eventually build new homes. Down payments are typically going to be a little higher as much as 35% of the overall price. But Northview has some financing for as little as 10% down Willie said. Good credit is important of course.

Get a survey and/or appraisal

A certified land survey will yield the most information on restrictions easements covenants drive-through rights and property lines Anderson said.

If you pay for land with cash you don't have to get a land appraisal. But I found our land appraisal to be really helpful in assuring us that we were making a good financial decision. The appraiser reviews the land purchase analyzes the market conditions and walks the property to identify adverse conditions. Our appraiser's analysis of comparable land sales was also really helpful.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvdGhpcmQtZXllLWNvbWljcy1vcGVucy1zZXZlbnRoLXN0b3JlLWluLWNvbGxlZ2UtcGFyay1tYXJ5bGFuZC10b2RheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Third Eye Comics Opens Seventh Store In College Park Maryland Today,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/comics/third-eye-comics-opens-seventh-store-in-college-park-maryland-today/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvdGhpcmQtZXllLWNvbWljcy1vcGVucy1zZXZlbnRoLXN0b3JlLWluLWNvbGxlZ2UtcGFyay1tYXJ5bGFuZC10b2RheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9vbmVwbHVzLW5vcmQtbjIwLTVn0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: The best phone under $300,"The OnePlus Nord N20 is a beautiful budget phone that looks like it costs hundreds more.

Fresh off the heels of the OnePlus 10 Pro  OnePlus has another phone targeting bargain hunters. The OnePlus Nord N20 is a $282 budget-friendly handset that has some features you usually see limited to more premium devices such as an AMOLED display and 33W fast charging. And after debuting as a T-Mobile exclusive the OnePlus Nord N20 is now available unlocked for those who want to use the phone with a carrier of their own choosing.

A beautiful housing wraps around all of that. Even though its body is plastic the Nord N20 looks like it should cost a whole lot more. The gold accents around the two big camera lenses the deep blue hue of the back and the flat sides all come together to make for something that immediately catches your eye.

In this OnePlus Nord N20 review I’ll walk you through why I think this is the best phone for those on a tight budget despite some limitations typical of cheap phones.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Price and availability

The OnePlus Nord N10 in 2020 clocked in at $299 while the OnePlus Nord N200 in 2021 came in at $239. The OnePlus Nord N20 sits right between them at $282. It comes with 128GB of storage (expandable up to 512GB) and 6GB of RAM. This is a lot of phone for less than $300.

When the Nord N20 first arrived in the U.S. You could only buy it through T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile. Availability has since expanded with the phone now available unlocked at Amazon Best Buy and the OnePlus online store. The device will be able to work with carriers who use T-Mobile's 5G network which includes Mint Mobile Google Fi Ultra Mobile and Simple Mobile.

In terms of price the OnePlus Nord compares favorably to the Moto G Stylus (2022)  which costs $299. That phone sports a stylus as the name implies but it is overall similar enough to the Nord N20 that you might consider it as an alternative.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Design

I love the OnePlus Nord N20’s design. The clean and dare I say professional aesthetic appeals to my sensibilities especially the deep blue colorway. The two large camera lenses surrounded in light gold accents draw your attention right out of the gate. The smooth plastic back has a sparkly effect to it that makes the phone almost glitter in the sun.

The flat edges also contribute to a premium look. At 2.9 inches wide the Nord N20 is easy to hold without those edges digging into your hand (unlike the iPhone 13 Pro Max that I use on a daily basis). One thing I like about plastic phones is the weight — the Nord N20 is just 6.1 ounces which feels positively light.

The OnePlus Nord N20 also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and an in-display fingerprint sensor which I love to see. The power and volume buttons all feel solid and clicky too. But this is a budget phone which means compromises. One of the most notable hardware trade-offs to me is the shoddy vibration motor which is noisy and feels cheap. You can’t have everything at this price.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Display

Measuring 6.43 inches the OnePlus Nord N20’s AMOLED display certainly impressed me even if it is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. With an FHD+ resolution content of all kinds looks great. Videos like Blade Runner 2049 and the Thor: Love and Thunder teaser trailer are vivid and vibrant even in the Nord N20’s Gentle color calibration.

Here’s what we measured for the OnePlus Nord N20’s display.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 OnePlus Nord N20 Moto G Stylus (2022) iPhone SE (2022) Display size 6.43 inches 6.8 inches 4.7 inches sRGB (%) 179 / 103 128 / 84 115 DCI-P3 (%) 127 / 73 90 / 60 81 Delta-E 0.34 / 0.3 0.27 / 0.31 0.21 Peak brightness 567 560 550

The Nord N20 easily beats the Moto G Stylus (2022) in color reproduction but both phones are right in line with each other when it comes to their max brightness. They are very visible in all but direct sunlight where it becomes extremely difficult to see them especially with sunglasses.

The Nord N20 had the lowest Delta-E color accuracy score (where 0 is perfect) compared to the Moto G Stylus (2022) and iPhone SE (2022). Both of those handsets use IPS LCDs but the Nord N20’s AMOLED panel achieves deeper blacks.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Cameras

With the OnePlus Nord N20 you get a triple rear camera setup. The 64MP main sensor does the heavy lifting but its 2MP monochrome and 2MP macro companions are dubious at best. Around front there’s a 16MP selfie shooter.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

To test the OnePlus Nord N20’s cameras I used the latest Moto G Stylus. Starting outside with this photo of some books you can see that both phones produced a presentable image. To my eye the Nord N20’s shot is a tad brighter than the Moto’s but that comes at the cost of approaching overexposure. The colors still look vibrant in either picture but I think I prefer the Moto G Stylus’ photo since it doesn’t appear to have as much of an overexposure near-issue as the Nord N20.

Heading inside to photograph the same set of books on their shelf I see problems in both shots. The Nord N20’s focus is extremely soft even blurry on some of the spines. The Moto G Stylus (2022) has brightness issues making for a dim picture. I don’t think either photo is good but at least the Moto offers stronger focus. On the spine of Where the Sidewalk Ends I see the Nord getting right up to the line of overexposure again.

I headed into my basement to test both handsets in a low-light environment without their night modes. In this shot of my Mass Effect helmet the clear winner is the Moto G Stylus (2022). You can see more details of the helmet whereas the Nord N20’s image is dark and almost grim. The carbon fiber effect is not as easy to see in the Nord’s picture. Both devices struggled here but the Moto came out on top.

For this portrait of me the Nord N20 won out slightly. The Moto G Stylus (2022) produced a softer image that I do not like despite its pleasant bokeh effect. The Nord N20 has a warmer and more inviting look to it even if I don’t care for the overall shot. You can still make out my ruddy complexion while the Moto applied too much face smoothing and beauty effects making me look unnatural.

Wrapping up with the rear cameras here’s how the two phones handled those books from before but this time at night. Unsurprisingly based on its earlier low light performance the Nord N20 fell flat on its face with only one of the books being legible and discernible. The Moto G Stylus (2022)’s image is brighter but the phone struggles with blurriness and noise. However I can make out that there are five books there and I can see the red towel I put down. Both photos are atrocious but the Moto wins out again.

Finally when it comes to selfies the Nord N20 once again falls behind the Moto G Stylus (2022). The former ironed out the lines and wrinkles in my face making me look unnaturally smooth. However you can more clearly see the blue of my eyes.

The Moto’s selfie meanwhile is much truer to life. It captured the ruddiness of my face and beard even if it has harsher shadows than the Nord. The background is also warmer like with the red car behind me.

Since the Nord N20 comes equipped with macro and monochrome sensors I captured a few samples. The macro shot is bad with terrible brightness and horrible focus. I attempted this image multiple times and this is the best the phone could do.

OnePlus Nord N20 monochrome sample (Image credit: Tom's Guide)

As for the monochrome sensor there isn’t a dedicated monochrome mode on the Nord N20 so I used the B&W filter. I suspect that the sensor is merely used for “details” to aid the main camera as we’ve seen on other phones in the last five or so years.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Performance

A Snapdragon 695 serves as the Nord N20’s brains. We hadn’t gotten a phone with the Snapdragon 695 in for testing before this one so I definitely wanted to see what this chip can do. This is an octa-core system-on-chip with a max frequency of 2.2GHz and equipped with a X51 5G modem which supports sub-6GHz and mmWave. You don't get Wi-Fi 6 on this chip so that's a connectivity standard still reserved for the more expensive phones.

Here’s how the Nord N20 fared in our benchmarks.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 OnePlus Nord N20 Moto G Stylus (2022) iPhone SE (2022) CPU Snapdragon 695 Helio G88 A15 Bionic Geekbench 5 (single-core / multicore) 696 / 1995 368 / 1324 1718 / 4482 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited (FPS) 7 4 50 3DMark Wild Life Extreme Unlimited (FPS) 2 1 12

The Nord N20 smokes the Moto G Stylus (2022). And in my experience the Snapdragon 695 has far fewer performance hiccups than the Moto’s Helio G88 making the Nord N20 much more pleasant to use. But I brought out the iPhone SE (2022) to show you what performance you can get if you can spend about $140 more.

As decent as the Nord N20’s performance is it still struggles with higher-end gaming. Not only did it stumble more than once on the 3DMark benchmarks but I had to lower the settings considerably in Genshin Impact and Call of Duty: Mobile to have a playable frame rate. Simpler games like Dead Cells weren’t as taxing.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

As the name suggests the OnePlus Nord N20 sports 5G connectivity but you just get sub-6GHz support. There’s no mmWave or C-band here. T-Mobile’s sub-6 network is pretty reliable (and C-Band is not really a part of T-Mobile’s 5G setup for now) so you’re not losing out on too much with the Nord N20.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Battery life and charging

With a 4500 mAh power pack the OnePlus Nord N20 stands to last a long while on a charge. OnePlus’ flagship the OnePlus 10 Pro is one of the longest-lasting Android flagships in our best phone battery life list so I went into this Nord N20 review with high expectations. And based on our testing I wasn’t disappointed.

Here’s how long the Nord N20 lasted.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 OnePlus Nord N20 Moto G Stylus (2022 iPhone SE (2022) Battery size 4500 mAh 5000 mAh 2018 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins) 11:20 12:30 7:38 Charging 33W 10W 20W Charging percentage (15 mins) 31 10 31 Charging percentage (30 mins) 56 21 61

We test phone battery life by setting the display to 150 nits and then tasking the device to endlessly reload web pages over a 5G connection. The Nord N20 turned in a respectable result though still about an hour shy of the Moto G Stylus (2022). But at a whopping four hours longer than the iPhone SE (2022) the Nord N20 wins a gold star. It misses a spot on our best phone battery life list by just 20 minutes.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

As for charging the OnePlus Nord N20 leads the best cheap phones at 33W. That blows the Moto G Stylus (2022) out of the water. Just look at how much battery percentage the Nord regained compared to the Moto — 56% versus 21% after 30 minutes. (The new Stylus charges at a measly 10W.)

A 33W charger comes included with the Nord N20 so you won’t spend any of the money you save buying a separate charger.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Software

Other than the cameras the Nord N20’s other major failing is the software. The phone comes equipped with Android 11 with Oxygen OS 11 on top. Android 11 is a great platform and Oxygen OS 11 was pretty stable in my experience but the problem here is one of timing.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Android 11 is more than a year and a half old and Android 12 has been out since last fall. I asked OnePlus to comment on its update policy for the Nord N20 and the company told me that the Nord N20 will only get to Android 12 with three years of security patches.

Phone makers had months of access to the betas in the months leading up to the Android 12’s launch. To that degree I think OnePlus should be ashamed. I didn’t think any company could do as bad with updates as Motorola but OnePlus sure tried. At least your Nord N20 will remain secure for three years.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

As for what the software can do Oxygen OS 11 sports some nice customization options and a clean look. The improvements in version 12 that we saw on the OnePlus 10 Pro will hopefully come in due time. For example I’d really like to see the Nord N20 get access to the three different dark mode options something I’m quite fond of on the 10 Pro.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Verdict

For $282 the OnePlus Nord N20 is definitely the best phone for the money. Even with lackluster cameras and the shamelessly bad software update policy this phone is still a good buy if your phone budget maxes out at $300 especially now that you can buy the Nord N20 unlocked.

The Nord N20 and Moto G Stylus (2022) trade blows pretty evenly. The Nord looks and feels better not to mention the stronger performance and better display. But the battery doesn’t last quite as long (a little more than an hour shy of the Moto) and the cameras are pretty bad — I didn’t think I could see cameras worse than the Moto in 2022.

And then there’s software support. Again I didn’t think a phone maker could do as bad as Motorola but OnePlus managed to. You’re only guaranteed to get a version of Android that’s already six months old. That’s pathetic.

However if you’re strapped for cash and need a new phone then the OnePlus Nord N20 should be at the top of your list. If you have more flexibility then I’d suggest checking out the $429 iPhone SE (2022) or $449 Galaxy A53 as more fully featured alternatives. Otherwise the OnePlus Nord N20 is the phone to get when money most definitely is an object.

Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

The Sony WH-XB910N serve as an affordable alternative to the flagship WH-1000XM4. This is evident from the near-identical design battery life and feature set which includes proprietary technologies like 360 Reality Audio Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) and Equalizer. Throw active noise cancellation and adjustable ambient listening into the mix and one would swear there was no difference between the WH-XB910N and Sony’s Mark 4 headphones but there are considerable differences when you dig a bit deeper.

These headphones lack big brother’s smarts and sonic precision. Weaker active noise cancellation (ANC) and call quality also distinguish the two models. The WH-CB910N won’t replace any of Sony’s top-of-the-line wireless headphones. However that isn’t the real question. It’s whether the WH-XB910N are good enough to replace your current mid-range ANC headphones.

Read our full review of the Sony WH-XB910N to get the full breakdown.

Sony WH-XB910N availability and price

The Sony WH-XB910N originally launched at $249 but they underwent a price drop and can be purchased for $150 at major online retailers (Amazon Best Buy) or directly from Sony. Three colors are available: Black Blue and Gray. Inside the box is a carrying case plug adapter USB-C charging cable operating instructions reference guide and a warranty card.

For comparison these headphones are less expensive than ANC heavyweights like the Bose 700 ($379) and Sony WH-1000XM4 ($349) but more expensive than our current mid-range favorite the Cleer Enduro ANC ($129).

Sony WH-XB910N design and comfort

The WH-XB910N successfully replicates the Mark series’ silhouette; it's chic and minimalist. They look sharp from afar and blend in with some of the market’s other premium selections. At the same time they feel flimsy and cheap due to the all-plastic construction. Something else these cans lack is detailing. Small details like slim buttons and rose-gold accents gave the WH-1000XM4 some finesse. The WH-XB910N underwhelms with large buttons and an embossed light gray logo.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Sony’s carrying case is also basic. Build quality is decent and the inside leaves enough room to store the headphones and all bundled accessories. It’s just that the WH-1000XM4 case has more space and comes with a mesh pocket on the back to transport other stuff.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

At 8.8 ounces the WH-XB910N weigh practically the same as the WH-1000XM4 (8.9 ounces) which is light. Wearing them around the neck or atop the head won’t weigh you down. The plush padding on both ear cups and the headband grants pleasant comfort. Fit isn’t an issue either since the headphones mold nicely around the skull and the extenders have multiple settings to accommodate different head sizes.

Sony WH-XB910N controls and digital assistant

Sony created a user-friendly control scheme that’s easy to remember and supports a full suite of media controls. The right ear cup accepts swipes and multi-tap gestures to enable playback call management and volume. To swipe left/right for track navigation or up/down for volume is super convenient especially when the touch panel registers input so accurately. On the left earcup are buttons for power/ pairing and listening mode activation. Each one produces solid tactility to ensure users commands are met.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

If only my voice assistant experience was as satisfying. To call it a nightmare would be an understatement. Even after I completed the setup processes for both Alexa and Google Assistant integration didn’t work. To use the digital assistant you must place the feature on the native setting in the companion app and manually activate it (tap and hold on the right ear cup). When the feature does work the mics do an OK job of interpreting voice commands that Google Assistant Alexa Siri and Bixby register.

Not having auto-detect to pause music when taking off the headphones is a bummer.

Furthermore there are some bugs that Sony forgot to flush out. One that stands out is the digital assistant not executing commands when using the Sony Headphones Connect app.

Sony WH-XB910N audio quality

The hallmark of Sony headphones is sound quality more specifically bass. Not only does it come in abundance on the WH-XB910N thanks to Extra Bass technology but Sony also added their spatial audio and upscaling features to make music livelier and more engrossing.

The emphasized low end is instantly felt on bass-heavy tracks like Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean.” It’s only natural to be pulled in by the infectious bassline and snare drums from the start. There was more to appreciate upon further listening specifically the clean-sounding adlibs and cymbals which were pronounced and blended well over the record’s funky production.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

I found the channel separation superb on instrumental recordings. A record like John Coltrane’s “A Love Supreme Pt. 1” captured the essence of a live performance at the Blue Note feeding my left ear soulful trumpet play and the right ear tingy hi-hats simultaneously.

Gaining a greater feel for bass I played Dr. Dre’s “Kush” but was taken aback by the diminished clarity. The booming effects and searing synths were overkill and bloated up the vocals. Thankfully Sony lets you personalize sound through its Equalizer feature that drastically improves quality. Switching to the Bright EQ provided the most well-rounded results and kept bass tight and punchy.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

You’re given eight other EQs to play with: Bass Boost Bright Excited Manual Mellow Relaxed Speech Treble Boost and Vocal. The option to create your own sound profile by manually adjusting the frequencies and bass is available as well. Unlike the Mark series these presets don’t perform so well on the WH-X910N. I advise sticking with Bright.

Enable DSEE to increase the fidelity on low-fi tracks and minimize background static. Sony’s 360 Reality Audio will also make select tracks from compatible hi-res streaming services (e.g. Tidal Deezer) sound more immersive though Apple’s Spatial Audio is the better solution for 3D listening.

Sony WH-XB910N active noise cancellation

This isn’t Sony’s finest ANC outing. The noise neutralization on these cans is inferior to the Mark series as well as top rivals like the Bose 700 and newcomers like the Shure Aonic 40. You’ll get some quiet time depending on the environment but don’t anticipate complete silence.

Working in my home office I could hear family chatter and my toddler’s tantrums from about 50 feet away. Other noises like doorbells and my mom-in-law’s iPhone speakerphone conversations were also audible at a high level confirming the WH-XB910N's struggle with mid and high frequencies.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

ANC fares better outdoors. I enjoyed interruption-free listening in the gazebo blocking out distractions like cars pulling into the driveway and planes flying over the house. Wind resistance might be the headphones’ best under-the-radar feature. You can enable the setting in the app to suppress whisking effects created by gusty conditions and speeding cars. It won’t completely cancel out these noises but the difference between having it on and off is huge.

Ambient Sound is the superior feature. You get 20 adjustable levels and full control over the amount of external sound that comes through the mics. I could hear everything around me clearly from construction work across the street to chats taking place across the house. The feature is strong enough that you don’t have to enable the Focus on Voice setting to amplify people’s vocals.

Sony WH-XB910N app and special features

Noise cancellation and Sony sound are two incredible selling points but so is access to the Sony Headphones Connect app. Receiving signature features like 360 Reality Audio ANC/Ambient Sound Equalizer and DSEE at the current price point of $150 is incredible.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

A few other settings you’ll find in the app are Automatic Power Off connected device management voice assistant selection and Bluetooth Connection Quality to prioritize sound quality or connectivity. The homescreen also greets you with a battery level indicator and music player.

Not all of Sony’s high-end features made the cut. Missing from the list are LDAC NC Optimizer NFC and smart controls like Quick Attention and Speak-to-Chat.

Sony WH-XB910N battery life

Inexpensive models with sufficient ANC playtime are hard to come by. The WH-XB910N don't cheat you of long battery life generating up to 30 hours with ANC on and 50 hours with ANC off. This crushes the 20 hours max offered by both the Bose 700 and AirPods Max and is slightly higher than the WH-100XM4 (the 30 hours Sony advertises falls short by 3 hours).

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

My testing saw the headphones tap out around the 29-hour mark with ANC on which was perfect for two weeks of entertainment. Any worries of low battery life disappeared once discovering a 10-minute quick charge could net 4.5 hours of extra play.

Sony WH-XB910N call quality and connectivity

The call quality on these cans is as poor as the WH-1000XM3. Muffling made it difficult for people to understand the context of convos and the mics let in more noise than they blocked out. My wife could barely hear anything I said while walking through the streets during rush hour. I thought taking her call indoors would improve things but there was still choppiness on my end.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

At least connectivity was reliable. Bluetooth 5.2 extended wireless range up to 50 feet without stuttering. Pairing was instantaneous on all platforms and single-click Google Fast Pair expedited the process on Android devices. Multipoint technology (connect to two devices simultaneously) also operated better than I thought it would.

Bottom line

Credit Sony for its generosity. It didn’t have to give us a lower-tier version of its flagship ANC headphones because the WH-1000XM4 is mostly flawless and worth every penny. Nonetheless we got the WH-XB910N a model possessing many of the brand’s top features and flaws.

The pros outweigh the cons and having this level of sound for just $150 is a bargain. If that isn’t satisfying enough then consider the lower-priced and more well-rounded Enduro ANC."

THE LÄND“ mit dieser Begrüßung wurden rund 15 Nobelpreisträgerinnen und - träger und rund 500 internationale Nachwuchswissenschaftlerinnen und -wissenschaftler am 1. Juli 2022 in Lindau auf der „MS Sonnenkönigin“ willkommen geheißen zur Nobelpreisträger-Schifffahrt 2022 auf dem Bodensee zu der sie das Land Baden-Württemberg zum Abschluss der 71. Nobelpreisträgertagung in Lindau eingeladen hatte.

Die 71. Nobelpreisträgertagung in Lindau hatte sich vom 26.06.2022.-01.07.2022 der Disziplin „Chemie“ gewidmet. Den Tagungsteilnehmerinnen und -teilnehmern aus aller Welt wurden auf der Überfahrt von Lindau zur Blumeninsel Mainau wo die offizielle Verabschiedung stattfand vielfältige Möglichkeiten geboten sich über den Wissenschaftsstandort Baden-Württemberg zu informieren. Vertreten waren baden-württembergische Hochschulen und Forschungseinrichtungen die aktuelle Arbeiten und Ergebnisse aus der Chemie präsentierten: Die Universitäten Freiburg Heidelberg Hohenheim Konstanz Stuttgart Tübingen und Ulm das Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) und Helmholtz Institut Ulm (HIU) das Fraunhofer Institut für Chemische Technologie (ICT) das Max-Planck-Institut für Festkörperforschung das Zentrum für Sonnenenergie- und Wasserstoff-Forschung (ZSW) sowie Baden-Württemberg International (bw-i).

„Wir sind stolz auf die Vielzahl an Hochschulen und Forschungseinrichtungen die unser Land zu bieten hat. Sie sind international anerkannt für ihre wissenschaftlichen Errungenschaften und die enge Verbindung und den Wissenstransfer zwischen Wissenschaft und Industrie zwischen Grundlagenforschung und angewandter Forschung” so Andrea Lindlohr Staatssekretärin im Ministerium für Landesentwicklung und Wohnen die die diesjährige Nobelpreisträger-Schifffahrt auf dem Bodensee am 1. Juli 2022 in Vertretung von Ministerpräsident Winfried Kretschmann begleitete. Ferner sagte sie: „Wir brauchen die Wissenschaft um die großen Herausforderungen unserer Zeit anzugehen: die Corona-Pandemie den Klimawandel aber auch wirtschaftliche und politische Krisen. Wir brauchen die Wissenschaft als Basis für die demokratische Diskussion und für evidenzbasierte Entscheidungen. Deshalb zählen wir auf Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler wie Sie – helle Köpfe die sich trauen in neuen Bahnen zu denken und unkonventionelle und manchmal auch provokative Ideen zu entwickeln” und weiter: „Die Bedeutung dieses Austauschs geht weit über die wissenschaftlichen Fragen hinaus” und „Die Tagung ist auch eine einzigartige Gelegenheit um gesellschaftliche und politische Themen zu diskutieren und die Rolle der Wissenschaft in unserer heutigen Gesellschaft zu reflektieren. Diesem regen Austausch an neuen Ideen zwischen jungen Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftlern beizuwohnen gibt einem das Gefühl dass unsere Zukunft in guten Händen ist.”

Die diesjährige 71. Nobelpreisträgertagung mit dem Schwerpunkt Chemie hatte sich intensiv mit dem Kernthema Katalyse und Synthese auseinandergesetzt insbesondere mit der Organokatalyse deren umweltfreundliche Verfahren sie besonders attraktiv machen und auch mit neuen funktionalen Molekülen und deren Design und Strukturvorhersage mittels Künstlicher Intelligenz. Ein wichtiges Anliegen war auch das Thema „Wissenschaft in der Gesellschaft” mit Schwerpunkten zu „Vertrauen in die Wissenschaft“ sowie zu „Diversität in der Forschung“.

Ein großer Tag war die Nobelpreisträgerschifffahrt auch für die Landessieger von „Jugend forscht“ die mit an Bord kommen durften und die Gelegenheit nutzen konnten mit den renommierten Forschenden

ins Gespräch zu kommen. Das Schülerforschungszentrum Südwürttemberg e. V. aus Tuttlingen präsentierte sich mit einem Beitrag zu algenbasierten Biopolymeren in der Ausstellung.

Auf der Insel Mainau wo sich der Sitz der Stiftung Lindauer Nobelpreisträgertagungen befindet fand neben dem Schloss die abschließende Podiumsdiskussion zum Thema „The Diversity Challenge” statt mit Aybeg Nafiz Günenç (Georg-August-Universität Göttingen / Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemnistry) Vanessa Restrepo Schild (Bio-Techne) Donna Strickland (University of Waterloo) und Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede (Chalmers University of Technolo-gy) sowie Paul Walton (University of Nottingham) der das Gespräch moderierte. Danach wurden die Tagungsteilnehmerinnen und teilnehmer die aus 90 Ländern angereist waren und die Tagung als „Lindau Almumni“ verlassen durch die Präsidentin des Kuratoriums für die Tagungen der Nobelpreisträger in Lindau Bettina Gräfin Bernadotte af Wisborg und Staatssekretärin Andrea Lindlohr verabschiedet. Dem folgte das „Science Picknick“ und danach die Rückfahrt mit dem Schiff nach Lindau.

For an importer the surge in the greenback against the euro yen or British pound is a plus because it makes the products they buy cheaper.

But for a U.S. export company products sold in dollars have become more expensive which increases the risk of losing clients and seeing sales decline.

And they also lose money when converting foreign revenue back into to dollars.

Many firms already revised their earnings forecasts for the year to account for the changing exchange rate including computing giant Microsoft which warned its quarterly sales will fall by $460 million and its net profit by $250 million due to the currency hit.

Adobe Salesforce Biogen and Pfizer have all warned that the dollar's rapid rise will have a greater impact on their accounts than expected.

$40 billion hit

Companies that generate most of their revenue outside of the United States are the most exposed starting with tech giants medical equipment makers and service companies according to Kyriba a corporate cash management platform.

Kyriba estimates the currency effects could mean a $40 billion hit to the earnings of S&P 500 firms in the first half of the year.

The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to aggressively hike interest rates to combat rampant inflation combined with an influx of funds into the country from investors looking for a safe haven in uncertain times have combined to boost the U.S. dollar.

The greenback has risen 13% compared to the euro over the last 12 months approaching parity and gained 22% against the yen.

“Short term that’s a good thing for the United States because it means all the imports are cheaper and it puts downward pressure on inflation” said Desmond Lachman of the American Enterprise Institute think tank.

But further out the effect on the U.S. economy is more nuanced because if exports fall “the United States trade deficit widens and then we get more external debt.”

But multinationals “don’t have control over these big items” he explained.

They can however mitigate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currencies in which they price and invoice goods by adopting hedging strategies – using financial instruments that provide a kind of insurance against losses caused by the changing exchange rate.

Most corporations already have hedging programs in place and they change their plans on a quarterly or even monthly basis sometimes trying to predict currency movements Kyriba’s Bob Stark said.

But it’s not an exact science he noted especially in a time of great uncertainty about the direction of inflation interest rates and the possibility of a recession.

Changing countries to cut costs

But “since the start of the pandemic CFOs have gotten very good at looking at multiple scenarios and building on them” Stark said.

Sporting goods giant Nike for instance warned Monday that currency effects would cut annual revenue by several percentage points. But the profit hit is much lower because of the hedging.

The current high volatility in foreign exchange markets also means it costs more to hedge so some firms are choosing not to use those instruments.

Among the other tools at their disposal multinationals can reduce their exposure with other techniques such as by paying their Japanese suppliers in dollars by renegotiating prices or even by buying their supplies from different countries.

Or they can simply wait for the U.S. currency to weaken before repatriating their profits.

However once the exchange rate has strengthened there is limited room to maneuver according to Nikolai Roussanov a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania – especially when prices are also rising because of supply chain issues and energy costs.

A 43-year-old man charged with attacking a woman in south Dublin and violent behaviour in a Garda station following arrest has been granted bail pending “possible further charges”.

David Harvey of Millfield Enniskerry Co. Wicklow appeared before Judge John Hughes at Dublin District Court on Saturday.

Gardai charged him with assault causing harm to a woman at a house at Kilcross Lawn Sandyford Dublin 18 and violent behaviour at Blackrock Garda station.

Garda Ian Cahill told the court the incident happened shortly before 3 am on Saturday.

He alleged that a male and a female were in an ""extremely agitated state"" and that the accused grabbed the injured party by the neck. It was alleged that when they fell ""the accused punched her in the eye"".

He made no reply when charged.

Defence counsel Kevin McCrave said his client had recently received hospital care and was not working in the past week.

Judge Hughes set bail in his bond of €200 and ordered the labourer to lodge €50.

The judge told him to sign on daily at his local Garda station stay away from the scene of the alleged assault carry a mobile phone and be contactable at all times.

Judge Hughes warned Mr Harvey he must remain sober and have no contact with the injured party.

He remanded him in custody with consent to bail pending directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions ""and possible further charges"".

Kingston had two different spells as manager 2016-17 and 2020-22 winning a Munster title in 2017 and steering Cork to last year’s All-Ireland final. Prior to that he was involved with Jimmy Barry-Murphy in the Cork management setup in selector and coaching roles.

The attention now turns to who will fill the vacancy and take charge for next year?

Here are some potential candidates that may figure in the race.

Pat Mulcahy

The Newtownshandrum man captained Cork as a player and has filled them position as selector this year under Kingston joining the setup last winter. He was an established boss at third level with Cork IT in the Fitzgibbon Cup and has also been involved with his club’s senior team in recent years.

Ben O’Connor

A celebrated figure in his playing days O’Connor was a star attacker and linked up to brilliant effect on Cork teams with his twin brother Jerry. Since retiring he has been cultivating a fine reputation as a coach. Took Charleville a neighbouring club in North Cork to his native Newtownshandrum up to the senior ranks with a county premier intermediate crown in Cork and they subsequently reached an All-Ireland final at that grade. Last year he impressed with his work with Midleton the East Cork side claiming a first senior hurling title in eight seasons. Currently in a position with Kerry side St Brendan’s from Ardfert.

Pat Ryan

The Sarsfields man is another figure with huge experience from his playing days and his club roles with the Glanmire-based outfit. Was the Cork coach alongside Kingston during that first spell the Tracton man had as manager. Ryan subsequently took over the county U20 team delivering two All-Ireland titles last summer. They won the delayed 2020 crown at the expense of Dublin and then sparkled in the 2021 final success over Galway. Former Cork defender Wayne Sherlock worked closely with him in that setup.

Noel Furlong

The Carrigtwohill man also joined the Cork senior hurling management team last year as Kingston sought to freshen things up. A former county underage player and a senior winner with his club in 2011 in Cork Furlong then had roles with UCC Fitzgibbon Cup outfits and junior side Russell Rovers steering the latter to county and provincial titles before they featured in an All-Ireland final. Last year he was at the helm as the Cork minor hurlers won the county’s first All-Ireland title at that grade in two decades.

Fergal Ryan

The Blackrock man is another with extensive playing experience successful with both club and county at senior hurling levels. On the managerial front he was in charge of the Blackrock hurlers in recent times. He helped them qualify for the Cork county final in 2017 losing out to divisional side Imokilly before then masterminding the club’s first title in 18 years when they won an epic encounter in October 2020.

Outside voice…

Cork’s established policy is to appoint managers from within the county and it is difficult to see that tradition being altered. There may be a clamour for an outside influence in some quarters. Clare’s Davy Fitzgerald is currently involved in Cork with the county senior camogie team in a coaching capacity Tipperary’s Liam Sheedy has recent success in steering his native county to All-Ireland wins.

Those would appear at this stage longshots with the sense that the next manager will be a local candidate."

Grilling caught fire amid the pandemic as stuck-at-home consumers searched for new ways to cook meals as well as entertain and host family and friends safely outdoors.

But while there are plenty of signs that the outdoor cooking craze is here to stay inflation market saturation and supply chain challenges are threatening to lower the heat.

Since July 2020 more than 21 million grills and smokers have been purchased by U.S. consumers according to data from NPD. The outdoor cooking industry's revenue grew to $6.1 billion in sales in 2021 a 14% year-over-year growth.

An estimated 70% of U.S. households now own at least one grill or smoker according to consumer research from the Hearth Patio & Barbecue Association (HPBA) the highest the industry group has ever seen according to its CEO and president Jack Goldman.

Nearly every type of grill has seen sales jump from traditional charcoal and gas grills from companies like Weber and Char-Griller to pellet grills and smokers from companies like Traeger and Masterbuilt. The embrace of outdoor cooking also further elevated products like Ooni outdoor pizza ovens and Blackstone gas griddles.

""People weren't taking vacations they were investing more in the home and in living outdoors and they were sort of tired of cooking indoors"" Goldman said of the trend.

That success led to a mini-grilling IPO boom with both Traeger and Weber going public last year. Plans for several SPAC deals were also announced ranging from griddle maker Blackstone to barbecue and outdoor living e-commerce platform BBQGuys.

But that also led to a market saturated with new grill owners less likely to look for upgrades or replacements. Roughly 38% of all grill owners purchased a new grill in the last two years HPBA data showed.

While the popularity of grilling continues to grow factors such as inflation freight raw material cost increases and supply chain disruptions are now eating into grill sales.

Weber reported that its 2022 second-quarter sales dropped 7% year-over-year to $607 million. On a May 15 earnings call with analysts CEO Chris Scherzinger said the industry ""has seen a significant drop off in year-over-year point of sale data with sharply reduced shopper traffic"" since March.

""It's been the puzzle for a couple of years now to figure out what 2020 and 2021 meant"" Scherzinger said on the call. ""We believe that the pandemic heightened consumer engagement in the category and it established a new base of operations.""

Scherzinger added that while many people who bought grills in 2020 pushed up plans to replace an old one given the surrounding circumstances the situation in 2022 is ""more around all of the macro pressures on consumers the inflation pressure on the prices of gas and groceries the pressure of the volatile stock market on things like 401(k) savings or just consumer confidence more broadly.""

Traeger Pellet Grills has similarly seen sluggish sales reporting a 5% year-over-year decline in its first quarter of 2022. Both company stocks have struggled as a result with Traeger down more than 60% and Weber down more than 40% year-to-date compared to a roughly 20% decline for the S&P 500.

BBQ Guys called off its $963 million SPAC in November while the SPAC that Blackstone Products was expected to merge with has pushed back plans three times since announcing the deal in December.

But Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus said he remains bullish though his big question is whether Americans will continue to embrace outdoor cooking as they emerge from the pandemic.

""You look across categories and it's very different"" he said. ""You look at health and fitness and Peloton for example – that gave rise to a category that is going to survive but it's also clear that when consumers had the ability to go back to a gym they did.""

The desire to cook more meals at home instead of eating out at restaurants Andrus said seems to be sticking. He cited research that suggested 35% of Americans said they discover a passion for cooking amid the pandemic with 75% saying they plan to cook as much if not more at home post-pandemic.

That's also intersecting with several other trends Andrus said including an increased desire to gather with friends and family and for food to be something you share whether that means a plate of pulled pork or a photo on Instagram.""

""People love food and now that restaurants have opened up we expect them to go out and eat"" he said. ""But we think they just love to cook at home now too.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NvbW11bml0eS9taWFtaS1kYWRlL2FydGljbGUyNjI3OTQ3ODguaHRtbNIBUWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NvbW11bml0eS9taWFtaS1kYWRlL2FydGljbGUyNjI3OTQ3ODguaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The future of Opa-locka Hialeah Flea Market site?

In it he discusses the theological context surrounding our Declaration of Independence’s famous phrase “the pursuit of happiness.” We wish you a joyful Independence Day and happy reading!

On the day C. S. Lewis died his last written work was already in press with the Saturday Evening Post. “We have no ‘right to happiness’” Lewis declared in the essay by which he meant that we have no moral right to trample the rules of justice to gratify our impulses.

Lewis did concede that the idea of a right to the pursuit of happiness is “cherished by all civilized men but especially by Americans.” However the authors of the American Declaration of Independence according to Lewis could only have meant that we have a right “‘to pursue happiness by all lawful means’: that is by all means which the Law of Nature eternally sanctions and which the laws of the nation shall sanction.”

In her new book The Pursuit of Happiness in the Founding Era: An Intellectual History Carli Conklin has assembled a wealth of evidence that supports Lewis’s basic insight.

Far from being a “glittering generality” or a euphemism for property the “pursuit of happiness” had a distinct and widely understood meaning in the eighteenth century. It “refers to man’s ability to know the law of nature as it pertains to man” Conklin concludes “and man’s unalienable right to then choose to pursue a life of virtue or in other words a life lived in harmony with those natural law principles.” This broadly Aristotelian understanding of the pursuit of happiness cut across the eclectic intellectual traditions that informed the American founding including the classical Greek and Roman traditions Christianity the English common law and Newtonian science.

It is telling Conklin notes that throughout the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and despite the numerous changes great and small that were made to the document no one ever disputed the initial inclusion of “the pursuit of happiness” as an inalienable right alongside the rights of life and liberty. “The lack of editing here” Conklin concludes

would suggest one of two things: either the phrase “pursuit of happiness” really was a glittering generality with a non-substantive meaning to which no one would object or it had a substantive meaning that was both understood by and agreeable to the wide variety of individuals involved in drafting and editing the Declaration.

Like Lewis Conklin thinks the writers of that declaration meant that we have a right to pursue happiness by all lawful means which are the only means by which we can attain happiness in the first place. Perhaps this is a tautology—we have a moral right to do only what is morally right—but it is nonetheless important for what it affirms (the reality of the natural law) and for what it denies (any right to pursue happiness independent of the natural law).

The shared background assumptions that made sense of the inalienable right to the “pursuit of happiness” in the Founding era included a belief that God created the universe and the natural laws that direct the universe to its ultimate end or perfection. These laws include the physical laws that govern the inanimate and non-rational parts of creation but also the moral law of human nature. The latter clarifies what constitutes genuine human well-being and thereby helps man to pursue his own happiness or flourishing by living a life of virtue.

The eighteenth-century English jurist William Blackstone even went so far as to reduce the natural law to “God’s one paternal precept: ‘that man should pursue his own true and substantial happiness’” (as opposed to that fleeting and temporal happiness that is unmoored from virtue). James Wilson—one of only six men to sign both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution—later echoed Blackstone when he summarized the natural law with “this one paternal command: Let man pursue his own happiness and perfection.”

All of this is hiding in plain sight. In his Commentaries on the Laws of England Blackstone wrote that “when the supreme being formed the universe and created matter out of nothing he impressed certain principles upon that matter from which it can never depart and without which it would cease to be.” He then went on to draw an analogy between the laws of physical nature and the moral law of human nature writing that

God when he created matter and endowed it with a principle of mobility established certain rules for the perpetual direction of that motion; so when he created man and endowed him with free will to conduct himself in all parts of life he laid down certain immutable laws of human nature whereby that free will is in some degree regulated and restrained and gave him also the faculty of reason to discover the purport of those laws.

As Conklin notes Blackstone was clear “that the immutable laws of nature that pertain to the physical world (inanimate or animate irrational creation) and the immutable law of nature that pertains to man (animate rational creation) are put in place by a Creator God to govern all creation.”

This same framework and distinction are preserved in the Declaration of Independence even in Jefferson’s original rough draft that declared the “sacred and undeniable” truth that “all men are created equal” and that “from that equal creation” men derive “inalienable” natural rights. The final document after extensive drafting and editing appeals to the “Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” and clearly identifies that God as the “Creator” of nature and the “Supreme Judge of the world” who governs his creation through an overarching “Divine Providence.”

The pursuit of happiness is embedded in the Declaration in a larger theological context just as it is in Blackstone’s Commentaries. Admittedly Jefferson was not an admirer of Blackstone (he called him a “honeyed Tory”) but Conklin makes a convincing argument that Jefferson tracked Blackstone closely in his treatment of the pursuit of happiness.

Yes Jefferson and some of the principal Founders―including the other members of the Committee of Five that wrote the Declaration especially Benjamin Franklin and John Adams—held unorthodox religious beliefs. Nonetheless all of these men publicly and privately affirmed a shared natural theology: that there is a Creator who has imbued the world with discernible natural laws both physical and moral and who governs the affairs of men with his sustaining and intervening providence. Michael Pakaluk following Avery Cardinal Dulles refers to this natural theology as the “deist minimum” that in late eighteenth-century America was combined with providentialism and was “held by Christians of all denominations (and also by Jews and philosophical theists) who nonetheless might differ on what additional doctrines were revealed.”

This combination of the deist minimum with providentialism served as a workable and stable public theology that made sense of the Declaration’s right to the pursuit of happiness: the latter is coherent only against this backdrop. The right was understood to be bounded by a God-given natural law that was affirmed by each of the various intellectual traditions that underpinned the American Founding.

If Conklin is right about all of this then we must consider the possibility that Lewis was right as well: that the privileging of individual will over and against the natural moral law is the outgrowth not of the acceptance of the inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness rightly understood but rather of its repudiation."

It's not China's fault: Global Times editorial,"A Boeing 737 Max jet Photo: IC

The US public opinion appeared sour after three major Chinese airlines announced on Friday they will buy a total of 292 planes from Airbus. The order valued at more than $37 billion is said to be one of the largest ever for Airbus. According to Bloomberg this is China ""sending a sign and it hurts Boeing terribly."" Boeing also expressed its ""disappointment"" complaining that ""geopolitical differences"" between the US and China were bruising the company's business prospects and urging dialogue between the governments.



If Washington thinks that every deal Chinese companies sign with foreign companies has ""political consideration"" behind it it can only show how serious Washington's practices of forcibly interfering in economy and trade with politics in recent years are and they have formed an atmosphere in the American business and public opinion circles who see ""every brush and tree as enemy soldiers.""



In fact aviation cooperation is among the three main planks of China-Europe economic and trade cooperation. Airbus also has an assembly plant in China. Given the steady and mature cooperation it is not surprising that they continue to advance cooperation. Some analysts said this mega deal is the result of ""long and arduous negotiation"" and a collective order by three major airlines could help obtain a good bargain. In addition the fuel efficiency of the Airbus planes and a weaker euro may also be factors that influence the price. In all it's a normal business transaction that is hard to find fault with and the result is also equal and mutually beneficial.



It is natural for the US side to feel sour after losing the competition to Airbus. Judging from the performance of these two companies in the global market since 2019 Airbus has been way ahead of Boeing in terms of competing for passenger plane orders and market share. On the one hand this is partly due to safety concerns as flights operated by Boeing 737 MAX aircraft have still largely not resumed in various countries. On the other the disruptions in the US supply chain have seriously affected Boeing's delivery capacity: The company had to pause the production of 737 MAX passenger planes in May. Sources said that China Southern Airlines canceled plans to purchase more than 100 aircraft from Boeing earlier this year because of ""uncertainty over deliveries.""



Against this backdrop instead of analyzing the ""motives"" of Chinese companies the US should reflect on its government's behavior. Who can feel rest assured engaging in large-scale trades with a country that talks about ""decoupling"" frequently wields the stick of sanctions and often introduces bills to restrict trade with others out of thin air? Not to mention products like planes that have long life cycles are made of complex components and require professional maintenance. Such concerns in many cases are not even an act of state. It is about the political risks various business entities would think about before doing business.



According to a previous assessment by the American Chamber of Commerce if the US engages in a comprehensive ""decoupling"" with China and completely cuts off sales to China in the field of civil aviation this would cause US output losses ranging from $38 billion to $51 billion and cause the US civil aviation manufacturing industry to shed 167000 to 225000 jobs. Boeing also said last year it expected that Chinese airlines will require 8700 new airplanes in the next 20 years valued at nearly $1.5 trillion. If the loss of a $37.2 billion order now has made Boeing feel pain then let some American politicians continue to advocate decoupling from and build a high wall against China. By then what American companies including Boeing will face will not be short-term but long-term pain.



Now Boeing has complained about ""geopolitical differences"" affecting its business but China is not the one to blame. If there is any political factor in this it can only be said that the US politicization of economic and trade issues has backfired. In 2021 the Biden administration agreed to put to rest a 17-year trade dispute over subsidiaries between Boeing and Airbus in order to win over European countries to ""jointly confront China."" Now after Airbus won orders from Chinese airlines US public opinion has been flooded with jealousy. This may also remind the Europe of what is behind various ""ideals"" that the US claims verbally and Washington of the fact that political manipulation cannot triumph over the law of the market after all.



As for Boeing the most important thing to do is not to express ""disappointment"" with China but reason with US government and Congress the laws of the market on the basis of enhancing competitiveness of its own product. Of course Boeing is not the only one that needs to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JvZWluZy1sYW1lbnRzLXRyYWRlLXJlc3RyaWN0aW9ucy1oaW5kZXItc2FsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BOEING LAMENTS TRADE RESTRICTIONS WHICH HINDER SALES,"Boeing is lamenting the trade restrictions which are hindering sales of new aircraft to one of its biggest customers – China.

This week Airbus was able to tout an order for 292 of its A320 family series in a major win.

In response Boeing said: “Today’s announcement is an example of how constructive dialogue between governments encourages job creation and the other benefits that result from open aerospace markets. As a top U.S. exporter with a 50-year relationship with China’s aviation industry it is disappointing that geopolitical differences continue to constrain U.S. aircraft exports.

“We continue to urge a productive dialogue between the governments given the mutual economic benefits of a thriving aviation industry. Boeing aircraft sales to China historically support tens of thousands of American jobs and we are hopeful orders and deliveries will resume promptly.”

Boeing has almost $10 billion worth of aircraft that have been produced and ready for delivery to airline customers in China which are expected to be delivered this year once COVID restrictions in China are lifted.

Traditionally China has split its business between the US and Europe but the trade war with the US has seen that severely disrupted.

Local media reported on Friday that Israel’s Privacy Protection Authority confirmed the incident saying that it occurred two weeks ago.

Iranian hacker group named Sharp Boys claimed responsibility saying in a photo posted on their Telegram channel that ""Wherever you go even on your trips you are under our control. Remember our name.""

The Privacy Protection Authority added following the hack it had immediately contacted the owner of Gol Tours LTD company that owns over 20 popular travel booking websites in an effort to address the security breach and make the necessary modifications but was met with a refusal to cooperate reportedly over the costs of the changes.

Authority officials raided the company’s offices on Thursday and seized its servers until the investigation over the cyberattack is complete.

The leaked data include telephone numbers addresses dates and locations of booked vacations and sensitive medical information the authority said in a statement.

Last week Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said a cyber unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard -- called “Shahid Kaveh” -- conducted research to damage ships gas stations and industrial plants in several countries including Britain the US France and Israel.

Gantz hinted that Israel -- which is widely believed to have waged cyber war against Iran's nuclear facilities and other infrastructure -- may retaliate physically against enemy hackers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvaW5yZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMy9oZWRnZS1mdW5kLW1hbmFnZXItbWljaGFlbC1idXJyeS13YXJucy1hYm91dC10aGUtbWFya2V0LWNyYXNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hedge fund manager Michael Burry warns about the market crash,"Hedge fund manager Michael Burry who correctly identified the housing market bubble in 2008 has issued a warning that the current stock and cryptocurrency market fall may worsen just as investors are seeking for a bottom.

He noted that if the estimate comes true earnings compressions may be the next to come and the market should prepare for further suffering.

Burry has raised the possibility of a market crash in recent months while also pointing out that stock values have gotten out of hand.

Projections of the market crash

The founder of Scion Asset Management stated through his Twitter account on June 30 that the significant decline in the values of the S&P 500 Nasdaq and Bitcoin signals numerous compressions.

The hedge fund manager has already expressed concern about how Americans’ reactions to the increasing inflation may have an adverse effect on profit compressions.

Burry observed that due to the present economic climate more Americans are spending more than they are saving and any savings would certainly be gone by Christmas.

Additionally he made his cryptocurrency prediction after Bitcoin saw its worst quarterly returns in more than a decade.

According to Finbold Bitcoin’s returns for the second quarter of 2022 fell by 56 percent.

Burry emphasized that there can still be a few equities that would be useful to investors despite anticipating additional market turbulence. He singled out Booking Holdings Alphabet Inc. Discovery Inc. and Cigna Corporation.

Although the asset is trading below the $20000 mark there are no signals that a rally is about to start.

Inflation and the Federal Reserve’s strict monetary policies will probably cause a drop in Bitcoin and stocks. Given that the CPI numbers will be released soon July will be critical for both markets that have demonstrated high connection.",,,,,,,,,

They occasionally release videos on YouTube of their life-like machines spinning somersaulting or sprinting which are greeted with fascination and fear. As we first told you last year we'd been trying without any luck to get into Boston Dynamics' workshop for years. In March of 2021 they finally agreed to let us in. So we went to Massachusetts to see how they make robots do the unimaginable.

From the outside Boston Dynamics headquarters looks pretty normal. Inside however it's anything but. If Willy Wonka made robots his workshop might look something like this. There are robots in corridors offices and kennels. They trot and dance and whirl. And the 250-or-so human roboticists who build and often break them barely bat an eye.

Atlas

That is Atlas the most human-looking robot they've ever made.

It's nearly 5 feet tall 175 pounds nd is programmed to run leap and spin like an automated acrobat.

Marc Raibert the founder and chairman of Boston Dynamics doesn't like to play favorites but definitely has a soft spot for Atlas.

Marc Raibert: So here's a little bit of a jump.

Anderson Cooper: I mean that's incredible. (LAUGH)

Atlas isn't doing all this on its own. Technician Bryan Hollingsworth is steering it with this remote control. But the robot's software allows it to make other key decisions autonomously.

Marc Raibert: So really the robot is

Anderson Cooper: That's incredible--

Marc Raibert: You know doing all its own balance all its own control. Bryan's just steering it telling it what speed and direction. Its computers are-- adjusting how the legs are placed and what forces it's applying--

Marc Raibert: In order to keep it-- balanced.

Atlas balances with the help of sensors as well as a gyroscope and three on-board computers. It was definitely built to be pushed around.

Marc Raibert: Good push it a little bit more. It's just trying to keep its balance. Just like you will if I push you. And you can push it in any direction you can push it from the side. (LAUGH)

Marc Raibert

Making machines that can stay upright on their own and move through the world with the ease of an animal or human has been an obsession of Marc Raiberts' for 40 years.

Anderson Cooper: The space of time you've been working in is nothing compared to the time it's taken for animals and humans to develop.

Marc Raibert: Some people look at me and say ""Oh Raibert you've been stuck on this problem for 40 years."" Animals are amazingly good and people at-- at what they do. You know we're so agile. We're so versatile. We really haven't achieved what humans can do yet. But I think-- I think we can.

Raibert isn't making it easy for himself he's given most of his robots legs.

Anderson Cooper: Why focus on on legs? I would think wheels would be easier.

Marc Raibert: Yeah wheels and tracks are great if you have a prepared surface like a road or even a dirt road. But people and animals can go anywhere on earth-- using their legs. And so that you know that was the inspiration.

Some of the first contraptions he built in the early 1980s bounced around on what looked like pogo sticks. They appeared in this documentary when Raibert was a pioneering professor of robotics and computer science at Carnegie Mellon. He founded Boston Dynamics in 1992 and with CEO Robert Playter has been working for decades to perfect how robots move.

Big Dog

They developed this robot called Big Dog for the military as well as a larger pack mule that could carry 400 pounds on its back. Experimenting with speed they got this cheetah-like robot to run nearly 30 miles an hour.

None of these made it out of the prototype phase. But they did lead to this. It's called Spot. Boston Dynamics made it not knowing exactly how it would be used.

But the inspiration for it isn't hard to figure out.

Hannah Rossi: So Spot is a omni-directional robot. So I can go forwards and backwards.

Anderson Cooper: This is crazy. (LAUGH)

Robert Playter: This is the real benefit of legs. Legs give you that capability.

That's Robert Playter the CEO and Hannah Rossi a technician who works on Spot.

Hannah Rossi: I'm not doing anything special to let it walk over those rocks. There you go.

The controls are easier to use than you might expect.

Anderson Cooper: Does it have to come in straight on?

Hannah Rossi: You don't have to be perfect about it drive it close to wherever you want to go and the robot will do the rest.

Anderson Cooper: Wow. In some ways it's like driving a very sophisticated remote control car. What makes it different?

Robert Playter: Spot is really smart about its own locomotion. It deals with all the details about how to place my feet what gait to use how to manage my body so that all you have to tell it is the direction they go to.

Robert Playter Hannah Rossi and Anderson Cooper check out Spot

And in some cases you don't even have to do that. When signaled Spot can take itself off its charging station and go for a walk on its own -- as long as it's pre-programmed with the route.

It uses five 3D cameras to map its surroundings and avoid obstacles.

Atlas has a similar technology while we were talking in front of Atlas this is how it saw us.

Marc Raibert: This is inside Atlas's brain. And it shows its perception system. So what looks like a flashlight is really the data that's coming back from its cameras. And it-- you see the white-- rectangles that means it's identifying a place that it could step. And then once it identifies it it attaches those footsteps to it and it says ""Okay I'm gonna try and step there."" And then it adjusts its mechanics so that it actually hits those places when it's-- running.

All of that happens in a matter of milliseconds.

Marc Raibert: And so it's gonna use that vision to adjust itself as it goes running over these blocks.

Atlas cost tens of millions of dollars to develop but it's not for sale. It's used purely for research and development.

But Spot is on the market. More than 800 are out in the world. They sell for about $75000 apiece accessories cost extra. Some spots work at utility companies using mounted cameras to check on equipment. Others monitor construction sites and several police departments have tried them out to assist with investigations.

Robert Playter

Anderson Cooper: Let's talk about the the fear factor When you post a video of Atlas or Spot doing something a ton of people are amazed by it and think it's great. And there's a lot of people who think this is terrifying.

Robert Playter: The rogue robot story is a powerful story. And it's been told for 100 years. But it's fiction. Robots don't have agency. They don't make up their own minds about what their tasks are. They operate within a narrow bound of their programming.

Anderson Cooper: It is easy to project human qualities onto these machines.

Robert Playter: I think people do attribute to our robots much more than they should. Because you know they haven't seen machines move like this before. And so they-- they want to project intelligence and emotion onto that in ways that are fiction.

In other words these robots still have a long way to go.

Anderson Cooper: I mean it's not C3PO. It-- it's not-- a thinking--

Marc Raibert: Yeah. So let me tell you--

Anderson Cooper: Okay.

Marc Raibert: About that. There's a cognitive intelligence and an athletic intelligence. You know cognitive intelligence is making plans making decisions-- reasoning and things like that.

Anderson Cooper: It's not doing that?

Marc Raibert: It's mostly doing athletic intelligence--

Anderson Cooper: Okay--

Marc Raibert: Which is managing its body its posture its energetics. If you told it to travel in a circle in the room it can go through the sequence of steps. But if you ask it to-- go find me a soda it's-- it's not doing anything like that.

Just picking an item off the floor can sometimes be a struggle for Spot. Enabling it to open a door has taken years of programming and practice and a human has to tell it where the hinges are.

Kevin Blankespoor: Each time we add some new capability-- and we feel like we've got it to a decent point that's when you push it to failure to figure out you know how good of a job you've really done.

Kevin Blankespoor is one of the lead engineers here but at times he prefers a very low-tech approach to testing robots.

Anderson Cooper: You're pretty tough on robots.

Kevin Blankespoor: We think of that as-- as just another way to push them out of the comfort zone.

Anderson Cooper and Kevin Blankespoor

Failure is a big part of the process. When trying something new robots like humans don't get it right every time. There might be dozens of crashes for every one success.

Anderson Cooper: How often do you break a robot? (LAUGH)

Marc Raibert: We break them all the time. I mean it's part of our culture. We have a motto ""Build it break it fix it.""

To do that Boston Dynamics has recruited roboticists with diverse backgrounds - there's plenty of Ph.D's but also bike builders and race car mechanics. Bill Washburn is part of that pit crew.

Anderson Cooper: They all look pretty dinged up.

Bill Washburn: Yeah.

Anderson Cooper: How often do these need to get repaired?

Bill Washburn: The biggest-- kinda failures for me are like the bottom part of the robot breaks off of the top part of the robot. (CHUCKLE) And it's like--

Anderson Cooper: That seems like a big-- big failure. (CHUCKLE)

Bill Washburn: And the hydraulic hoses are the only thing holding it together.

Recently Raibert and his team decided to push their robots in a way they never had before.

Marc Raibert: We spent at least six months maybe eight just preparing for what we were gonna do. And then we started to get the technical teams working on the behavior.

The behavior was dancing. All their robots got in on the act. The movements were cutting edge but the music and the Mashed Potato were definitely oldschool.

Anderson Cooper: There are some people who see that and say ""That can't be real.""

Marc Raibert: Nothing's more gratifying than hearing that.

Anderson Cooper: What's the point in proving that the robot can do the Mashed Potato?

Marc Raibert: This process of you know doing new things with the robots lets you generate new tools new approaches new understanding of the problem-- that takes you forward. But man isn't it just fun?

Anderson Cooper: But I mean it's-- it costs a lotta money. It took 18 months of your time.

Marc Raibert: I think it was worth it. (LAUGHTER)

Whether it'll be worth it to Boston Dynamics' latest owners is less clear

The South Korean carmaker Hyundai has purchased a majority stake for nearly a billion dollars. It's Boston Dynamics' third owner in nine years. There's pressure to turn their research into revenue.

And Boston Dynamics hopes this new robot will help. It's called Stretch and it went on sale earlier this year. This was the first time they'd shown it publically.

Kevin Blankespoor: Warehouses is really the next frontier for robotics.

Stretch may not be that exciting to look at but it's built with a definite purpose in mind. It's got a seven-foot arm and they say it can move 800 boxes an hour in a warehouse and work for up to 16 hours without a break. Unlike many industrial robots that sit in one place stretch is designed to move around.

Kevin Blankespoor: You can drive it around with a joystick. And at times that's the easiest way to get it set up. But once it's ready to go in a truck and unload it you hit go and from there on it's autonomous. And it'll keep finding boxes and moving 'em until it's all the way through.

Robert Playter: This generation of robots is gonna be different. They're gonna work amongst us. They're gonna work next to us-- in ways where we help them but they also take some of the burden from us.

Anderson Cooper: The more robots are integrated into the workforce the more jobs would be taken away.

Robert Playter: At the same time you're creating a new industry. We envision a job-- we-- we-- we like to call the robot wrangler. He'll launch and manage five to 10 robots at a time and sort of-- keep them all working.

Anderson Cooper: Is there a robot you've always dreamt of making (LAUGH) that you haven't been able to do yet?

Marc Raibert: A car with an active suspension essentially legs like w-- like a roller skating robot. And a robot like that you know could go anywhere on earth. That's one thing that maybe we'll do at some point. But you know really the sky's the limit. There's-- there's all kinds of things we can and will do.

As with so many things Boston Dynamics does. It's hard to imagine how that would work but then again who'd have thought a bunch of metal machines would one day show us all how to do the Mashed Potato.

He was the oldest of our country’s Founding Fathers and in my opinion the most interesting.

A successful printer publisher and investor Franklin retired at age 42. He devoted himself to public works politics and science for the remainder of his life. He founded the first library in the colonies and established the first mail delivery system.

Franklin was well-traveled. Besides his frequent trips throughout the colonies he made several sailing-ship journeys across the Atlantic. He was a respected businessman and statesman in England and France.

Franklin’s scientific exploits were as famous as his diplomatic prowess. As a young man he invented swimming fins because he wanted to swim faster. When his vision began faltering he disliked carrying two pair of glasses on his travels. He designed and built the first set of bifocals so he could see both near and far using the same pair.

Stormy weather

In the mid-1700s electricity was the newest scientific discovery and it fascinated Franklin. He conducted many experiments with static electricity. His most famous one involved flying a kite near a thunderstorm. He deduced correctly that a metal key tied to the kite would draw a current from the enhanced electrical field near a lightning storm.

Franklin’s main scientific gift was that he questioned things that didn’t seem to make sense and collected data to establish a new hypothesis. Several of his studies involved weather-related discoveries.

My favorite example occurred when he was studying an eclipse of the moon. He attempted to compare the differences in a lunar eclipse observed at his home in Philadelphia with that observed by his brother in Boston. Unfortunately weather got in the way.

A strong nor’easter storm blanketed Philadelphia with cloud cover and blocked the eclipse. Franklin assumed the Boston weather was similar and the eclipse would not be seen.

However correspondence from his brother indicated the eclipse was visible along the coast of Massachusetts. He mentioned that soon after the eclipse Boston weather turned stormy with strong northeast winds.

Collecting data

The experience intrigued the scientist. Boston is northeast of Philadelphia yet a storm featuring northeast winds struck the Liberty Bell city first. Franklin needed data in an era where routine weather observations were non-existent.

The brothers began documenting and comparing weather conditions in Philadelphia and Boston. In time Franklin correctly surmised that storm systems do not move in the direction of winds at the earth’s surface.

It was a first small step that led to the predictive weather models we use today.

The story begins on the movie set of the 1993 action thriller ""Rising Sun"" starring Connery and Snipes and based off the Crichton novel of the same name.

It was during a week of filming under the hot California sun that Marc Raibert then a professor at MIT realized there was more work to do.

""We were providing robots for the background of a scene in the movie"" said Raibert. ""And we were there for a week. And it was a week of hell.""

On set Raibert said the heat among other things was a variable not present in the controlled MIT lab and for a time ""nothing worked right."" It was around this time that Raibert decided create Boston Dynamics.

The reclusive company is known for their occasional viral videos most notably one where its robots danced the Mashed Potato to the song ""Do You Love Me?"" Last year they agreed to let 60 Minutes correspondent Anderson Cooper into their New England headquarters for a rare look at their nearly three-decade effort to advance robotic capabilities.

""I think there are three really key pieces in robotics"" said Kevin Blankespoor one of the lead engineers at Boston Dynamics. ""There is vision there is mobility and there is manipulation.""

Unlike many Hollywood films where robots are portrayed with advanced human-like artificial intelligence Boston Dynamics places a focus on what it calls ""athletic intelligence"" which is the ability of machines to control things like balance posture and the way they move.

Eric Kerchner/60 Minutes

The company's ""build it break it fix it"" approach means their machines are pushed sometimes literally in order to gather data and advance their capabilities.

""This generation of robots is going to be different"" said Robert Playter the CEO of Boston Dynamics. ""They're going to work amongst us. They're going to work next to us in ways where we help them but they also take some of the burden from us.""

Boston Dynamics hopes humans may soon work alongside robots in more ways. In March 2021 on 60 Minutes the company debuted one of its newest creations – a robot they call ""Stretch."" The company said it can move 800 boxes an hour in a warehouse and operate for up to 16 consecutive hours without changing its battery.

Boston Dynamics debuted ""Stretch"" last year on 60 Minutes Eric Kerchner/60 Minutes

Some have raised concerns about whether advancements in robotics could lead to more automation and job losses for humans. Robert Playter Boston Dynamics' CEO thinks these concerns are overblown.

""At the same time you're creating a new industry"" Playter told 60 Minutes. ""We envision a job we like to call the 'robot wrangler.' He'll launch and manage five to 10 robots at a time and sort of keep them all working.""

""Stretch"" went on sale earlier this year joining ""Spot"" Boston Dynamic's four-legged dog-like robot that starts at around $75000 apiece.

""Spot"" is an omnidirectional robot that uses five 3-D cameras to map its surroundings and avoid obstacles. Eric Kerchner/60 Minutes

""Spot"" can be found working in a variety of settings from construction sites to police investigations. The potential for its future use remains as grand as the imagination of those willing to buy one.

As for the future of Boston Dynamics Marc Raibert's brainchild has come a long way from those struggles on the Rising Sun set – his company is now building robots that would seem right at home in a high-budget sci-fi film.

New York CNN Business —

Forget about an apple (or Apple) a day. Healthcare stocks may help keep the investing doctor away.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) have plunged more than 20% this year. The FAANGs of Big Tech and other momentum stocks have been hit hard due to worries about slowing earnings growth and a weakening economy. But many blue chip healthcare stocks have been solid gainers in this bear market for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.

Merck (MRK) and biotech king Amgen (AMGN) are among the top performers in the Dow. Drug supplier McKesson (MCK) cystic fibrosis treatment maker Vertex (VRTX) Big Pharma leader Eli Lilly (LLY) and insurer Cigna (CI) are all winners in the S&P 500 too. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) Lilly and insurer Humana (HUM) are even near all-time highs.

It’s worth noting that these aren’t the big Covid vaccine stocks either. Pfizer (PFE) BioNTech (BNTX) Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) have all cooled off in 2022 after enjoying huge pops last year. Antiviral drug makers Gilead (GILD) and Regeneron (REGN) are in the red this year too.

The strong gains for other healthcare stocks are being driven more by the current economic cycle than the pandemic. Health care stocks often hold up well during tumultuous times. They are perceived to be stable companies that offer products and services people need even during a recession.

And many of the healthcare leaders also pay big dividends and are fairly cheap compared to the rest of the market.

Solita Marcelli chief investment officer of the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management noted in a recent report that healthcare is “trading at an appealing valuation for a late-cycle environment.”

She added that since 2003 global healthcare stocks have tended to outperform the broader market by more than 6% at times when the manufacturing sector is slumping. (The ISM Manufacturing Index reading for May was the second lowest since May 2020.)

Lauren Goodwin an economist and portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments added in a report that “as long as economic growth remains in flux” investors should stick with quality stocks with “a defensive bent.” She specifically cited healthcare as well as utilities and real estate two other sectors known for big dividends.

An uptick in mergers could also give the healthcare sector a further boost. Pfizer Bristol-Myers Squibb and GSK (GSK) (formerly GlaxoSmithKline) have all announced multi-billion dollar deals this year.

There are risks of course. Depending on the outcome of the midterm elections healthcare companies could come under more scrutiny from regulators and politicians. If Republicans win control of the House and Senate there could be questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and what that could mean for drug prices.

But as long as the Federal Reserve is aggressively raising interest rates and investors continue to fret about inflation healthcare stocks may hold up just fine no matter what happens on Capitol Hill.

“There has been a flight to quality in the stock market” said Edward Campbell co-head of the multi-asset team for PGIM Quantitative Solutions. “I’m not surprised to see more classically defensive sectors like healthcare continue to do well.”

All eyes on jobs

Recession fears are growing thanks to rate hikes surging oil and gas prices and concerns that the housing market will finally cool. But one of the most important parts of the US economy — the labor market — remains strong.

Workers are in the proverbial driver’s seat commanding healthy paychecks as many businesses find it difficult to hire workers in the midst of the Great Resignation. But could even the job market be poised to finally take a turn for the worse?

The government reports the June payroll figures Friday. The data will wrap up a busy week of jobs news including weekly unemployment numbers and monthly reports from payroll processor ADP about private sector jobs as well as the government’s job openings and labor turnover (JOLTS) survey.

Economists are forecasting that 295000 jobs were added in June. That’s still a healthy amount but lower than the 390000 jobs gained in May as well as the revised jump of 436000 jobs in April.

The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.6% but it is likely to eventually start creeping higher. According to projections taken at the Fed’s latest meeting earlier this month members of the central bank are predicting that the unemployment rate will end this year at 3.7% rise to 3.9% next year and hit 4.1% in 2024.

That’s still historically low of course. But there are concerns that American workers won’t be able to keep up with rampant inflation as wage gains start to slow. Average hourly earnings rose 5.2% year-over-year in May down from a 5.5% rate in April.

Economists investors and job seekers will be keeping a close eye on the figures for June to see if there is a further deterioration in wage growth.

SK Pharmteco a global contract development and manufacturing organization under South Korean conglomerate SK Group will invest an additional $30 million (39 billion won) for the second phase expansion of its subsidiary SK Biotek’s Irish pharmaceutical manufacturing plant an executive told The Korea Herald.



“The total funding over the two phases is expected to be $65 million -- $35 million for phase one and an additional $30 million planned for the second phase expansion” said Joyce Fitzharris president of SK Biotek Ireland said in an email interview.



“The reason why less (capital expenditure) for the second phase will be invested than in the first phase is that most supplementary facilities will be set up in the first phase expansion in order to maximize the utilization of the first expansion” she added.



Last month SK Pharmteco announced its $35 million investment plan for the initial phase of the new expansion at SK Biotek Ireland’s Swords Campus.



The Swords Campus facility is a CDMO known for custom chemical development advanced intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing.



The expansion project which is expected to be completed in 2024 will result in a 50 percent increase in the overall capacity at the Swords Campus with a new manufacturing building that has filtration and drying equipment as well as associated utilities.



According to the company the new plant will be located on the site of a decommissioned production building near other facilities there.



Fitzharris said the pharmaceutical manufacturer has seen significant growth in the past two years with its top line revenue growing by a compound annual growth rate of over 10 percent.



“SK Biotek Ireland is planning to execute the next five years plan to achieve a world-class (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization) margin with biz growth by 2026” she said.



The Dublin-based CDMO’s annual revenue is estimated at $35.6 million according to company tracker Growjo.



SK acquired the Swords Campus facility from Bristol Myers Squibb for an undisclosed price in 2017.



The business units of SK Pharmteco are SK Biotek Korea SK Biotek Ireland Ampac Fine Chemicals Ampac Analytical Laboratories Yposkseki and most recently the Center for Breakthrough Medicines. With them SK Pharmteco operates eight manufacturing facilities as well as five research and development centers in Asia Europe and the US.



SK Pharmteco laid out the goal of becoming a global top five CDMO business with annual sales of $2 billion by 2025 at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in January. Aslam Malik the company’s CEO said SK Pharmteco plans for a Nasdaq listing in 2023.

On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

Detailed view of the red line segment in the chart above “Average White-Black Segregation 1968-2022.” Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

Appearing on Jason Whitlock’s Fearless podcast Tuesday afternoon Brown reflected on what Tomlin meant to him on and off the field.

“Mike Tomlin…that dude was like my pops to be honest” an emotional Brown told Whitlock. “Ever since I met Mike Tomlin I always knew I’ll have success. I feel like when I went to the Steelers Mike Tomlin once I saw him and talked with him I knew I was going to the Steelers. Mike Tomlin was that father figure for me. Outside of coach. Obviously as a coach and the minutia as a coach he was always challenging me at the utmost to make sure I was better.”

Brown had a winding journey to the NFL. A Florida kid who played his college ball in the MAC at Central Michigan becoming a sixth round pick of the 2010 NFL Draft. Scouts questioned his level of competition his slight frame his 4.57 40-yard Combine time.

Pittsburgh took the chance on him late in the draft. He found the end zone on his first regular season touch taking a reverse for a touchdown on a kickoff against the Tennessee Titans. His role as a receiver was limited in the early goings but he made his name known in his debut playoff game. Tied 24-apiece against the Baltimore Ravens Brown made a 58-yard helmet catch down the right sideline on a 3rd and 19 heave from Ben Roethlisberger setting up the game-winning touchdown.

From there his career took off. He finished second on the team in receptions yards and touchdowns in 2011. His breakout year came in 2013 leading the team with 110 receptions for 1499 yards and eight touchdowns. His numbers became video-game like in 2014 leading the NFL in receptions (129) and yards (1698) and in his prime was essentially uncoverable. For six straight seasons he posted at least 100 receptions 1200 yards and eight touchdowns. In NFL history no one else has done it more than four times consecutive or not.

In his now famous interview with The Pivot in 2022 Mike Tomlin acknowledged Brown would never play for the Steelers again but spoke well of him.

“We had nine great years” Tomlin told Ryan Clark Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder. “I appreciate that dude in ways that I can’t explain to y’all that I won’t even bother to attempt to explain to y’all because it sounds like I’m defending him in some way…the nature of our relationship and what we all did together requires no defense.”

The feeling seems mutual.

“That guy Mike Tomlin always had my back always believed in me” Brown said. “So I’m always indebted to Mike Tomlin. He was one of those guys that’s stood in the foxhole for me. And that meant a lot to me.”

But Brown eventually felt like his time was up in Pittsburgh and he made a loud exit forcing the team to trade him. Brown hasn’t said he regrets the move telling Whitlock he was chasing a Super Bowl ring he eventually received with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But had Brown stayed with Tomlin he might’ve gone down as the greatest receiver in NFL history. Instead he’ll be remembered for as much what he did off the field than on it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS93ZXJlLW5vdC1nb25uYS1kby1hbnl0aGluZy1ncmVhdC1hbnRvbmlvLWJyb3duLWRpZG50LWJlbGlldmUtc3RlZWxlcnMtY291bGQtd2luLXN1cGVyLWJvd2wv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'We're Not Gonna Do Anything Great:' Antonio Brown Didn't Believe Steelers Could Win Super Bowl,"Antonio Brown requested – and received – a trade out of Pittsburgh for one reason. He says it wasn’t due to being snubbed of a Team MVP vote it didn’t have to do with playing time or production. He wanted to win. And the Steelers weren’t going to help him get a ring.

Brown appeared on Jason Whitlock’s Fearless podcast Tuesday and opened up as to why he left the team.

“I [wanted] to get out of Pittsburgh because I was realizing we’re not gonna win the Super Bowl” Brown told Whitlock. “We’re not gonna do anything great. How we gonna do anything great? You putting your top receiver against a kid he’s a rookie…you think a rookie receiver gonna be able to take two double teams and the best guy every week? He’s not even prepared.”

Brown’s referring to WR JuJu Smith-Schuster though his timeline is a little off. Smith-Schuster was part of a strong 2017 draft class one that produced T.J. Watt Cam Sutton James Conner and Smith-Schuster. Brown played through the 2018 season with the team and Smith-Schuster was an impact player in his rookie and sophomore seasons. Over that span he caught 169 passes for 2343 yards and 14 touchdowns. There’s no question Brown’s presence helped single up Smith-Schuster defenses rolling to AB’s side but Smith-Schuster made plays when left one-on-one.

Though Brown has been critical of Smith-Schuster in the past and has referenced his 2018 MVP snub that went to Smith-Schuster as an aggravating factor to why he wanted off the roster he now claims Smith-Schuster had nothing to do with Brown’s trade demand. He told Whitlock his goal was to “be a champion.”

“It wasn’t about who they’re promoting. It’s about the team being able to go to the next level and win the championship. Forget who you’re promoting. Are we gonna win 2018? I don’t even think we made the playoffs then. We made the playoffs against Cleveland. I didn’t play. They lost the first game at home.”

Pittsburgh went 9-6-1 in 2018 and failed to make the playoffs. Brown did not play in the regular season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals though the Steelers won anyway 16-13. Ben Roethlisberger completed passes to nine different eligibles that day spreading the ball around with Brown out as WRs James Washington Eli Rogers and Smith-Schuster led the charge.

Brown offered similar commentary in February but his interview with Whitlock was more coherent than his previous discussion. This time he was more clear and expansive as to the reasons why he was done with the Steelers though they’re still inconsistent with some of the explanations he’s offered in past years.

Perhaps most inconsistent of all was where he landed. Pittsburgh sent Brown to the Oakland Raiders ahead of the 2019 season a team who went 4-12 in 2018 and hadn’t won (and still haven’t) a playoff game since the 2002 season. Brown never played a down for the team antics forcing the Raiders to release him two days before the regular season began. He would play one game for the New England Patriots that season before again being cut. Eventually he’d reunite with Tom Brady in Tampa Bay and won a Super Bowl ring with the Bucs in 2020. In 2021 he stormed off the field mid-game was immediately cut and hasn’t played again.

With his career presumably over the only outstanding football question is whether or not the Hall of Fame inducts him someday. Brown will first become eligible in 2027.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9tYW5keS1tb29yZS1zdGVybGluZy1rLWJyb3duLWNocmlzLXN1bGxpdmFuLXRhbGstdGhpcy1pcy11cy1yZXdhdGNoLXBvZGNhc3QtdHJhaWxlci1leGNsdXNpdmUtODY0MzY4ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown Dish on This Is Us Podcast (Exclusive),"Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are teaming up to launch a This Is Us rewatch podcast titled That Was Us.

PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the podcast's new trailer which teases what fans can expect when That Was Us officially makes its debut on Tuesday May 14.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

Director of scouting Eliot Wolf has served as the de facto General Manager since Bill Belichick’s departure earlier this offseason and is expected to be a candidate for the role.

The Patriots though have to comply with the Rooney Rule by interviewing two external minority candidates.

Bengals senior personnel executive Trey Brown has declined an interview request from the Patriots Tom Pelissero of NFL Media reports. The reason is unknown though with Wolf seen as the leading contender for the job it might not be the last time the Patriots’ interview request is rejected.

Brown has interviewed for G.M. jobs three times — with the Bills in May 2017 with the Raiders in December 2018 and with the Raiders in January 2022.

He was the Eagles’ director of college scouting and worked for both the AAF and XFL before joining the Bengals in 2021."

Local 54 of the Unite Here union said it reached a tentative agreement avoiding a strike that had been threatened for 12:01 a.m. Sunday.

The union had reached tentative agreements on Thursday with the Borgata which is owned by MGM Resorts International and three Caesars Entertainment casinos: Caesars Harrah’s and the Tropicana.

Resorts and the Golden Nugget are two casinos still without a contract but the union said it expects both of them to agree to one in the coming days.

ATLANTIC CITY AVOIDS CASINO STRIKE WITH LAST-MINUTE DEAL

Bally's and the Ocean Casino Resort have signed so-called ""me-too"" agreements committing themselves to adopting the terms of contracts the union reaches with the larger casinos.

The deals still need to be ratified by the full union membership.

""We are extremely pleased that we were once again able to reach a successful settlement with Unite Here Local 54 to increase wages and benefits for our deserving team members"" said Jim Allen chairman of Hard Rock International. ""We look forward to further expanding this excellent relationship at both the national and local levels as we expand our iconic brand.""

The union had said it is seeking ""significant"" salary increases in new contracts to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline food rent and other expenses.

The deals not only avoid what would have been a costly and disruptive strike during one of the busiest weekends of the year for the casinos but it provides labor peace in the crucial third summer of the coronavirus pandemic as the casinos are struggling to return to the revenue and profit levels they enjoyed before it began.

The deals avoided what would have been the city’s first casino strike since 2016.

And that’s just a little taste of the many enhancements happening around the property some of which are already completed and others that will be ready by the end of the year.

Major improvements are also being made to the outside pool area as well as upgrades to the hotel rooms where 75 percent are now completed.

All this is part of the $400 million investment Caesars Entertainment is putting into its three properties across the city and of that $200 million specifically for the Caesars property. Improvements are ongoing at Harrah’s and Tropicana.

“They want Caesars Entertainment in Atlantic City to return to what it was and then some and that’s what we’re trying to do here and I think we’re going to deliver” said John Koster Eastern regional president of Caesars Entertainment.

Opening by the end of the summer will be Gordon Ramsay Hell’s Kitchen the second Ramsay restaurant on the property and then in early October the first part of the Nobu brand will open — the Nobu restaurant which will introduce visitors to its innovative Japanese cuisine from Chef Nobu Matsuhisa.

By the end of the year the three top floors of the Centurion Tower will be transformed into the Nobu Hotel which will include 82 standard rooms and three suites.

Caesars Atlantic City will have the first Nobu Hotel and restaurant combination in the Northeast said Joseph Lodise senior vice president and general manager at Caesars Atlantic City noting that Nobu has hotels and restaurants all throughout the world.

“We will really elevate the Caesars brand because that Nobu brand is world-renowned. It’s just a luxury lifestyle brand that we’re bringing to Atlantic City he said.

While standing in one of the newly renovated suites in the Ocean Tower Lodise talked about what guests will experience with Nobu Hospitality and his thoughts when he dined at Nobu in Las Vegas.

“It’s based on Japanese Peruvian culture and cuisine” he explained. “It’s about delivering a flawless experience getting to know your guests anticipating their needs and giving them a luxury vacation experience.”

“First and foremost the food is bar-none the best Japanese cuisine you’ll ever have. It is cooked to perfection. The quality of the product is just unmatched.”

“Your taste buds are just going to be elevated to a whole new level” said Lodise.

Inside the restaurant where the players’ lounge once was workers were busy framing out the bar the sushi bar and the kitchen. Sunlight from the oceanfront windows washed over the exposed concrete and steel giving a small hint of what the ambiance will be once the area is completed.

Seating or what Lodise called nesting areas will line the perimeter of the restaurant which will give a people on the casino floor a partial glimpse of the inside and will also allow people inside to see out.

The design is part of the Nobu mystique Lodise said.

The wall of windows in the dining room will offer guests views of the beach ocean and boardwalk.

Including the bar area the restaurant will seat approximately 200 people.

A very short walk across the casino floor will be Gordon Ramsay Hell’s Kitchen where a construction wall with a picture of Ramsay arms crossed with his customary stare is a tease to people curious about what to expect when it opens sometime around Labor Day week.

As the case with Nobu the framing of the restaurant is still ongoing but the design atmosphere and experience will be completely different.

Hell’s Kitchen will be three floors of pitchforks and fiery design and takes over the former Dusk nightclub space.

The top level is off the casino floor where there will be a bar and lounge area. A hole cut out in the floor will allow people to look down into the dining room and see the blue and red competition kitchen which represents the two teams in the reality cooking show.

The second level will be the dining area where feature tables will have the best views of the kitchen. A pitchfork chandelier will help light the tables.

The first level will be another bar area off the Boardwalk.

Lodise said that they are going to extend an offer to the winning chef from this upcoming Hell’s Kitchen competition which airs in September to become their celebrity chef.

And the buzz from guests around the property has been picking up as the summer rolls along.

“They’ve been clamoring for some new dining experiences and we’re bringing in two of the hottest names in the country here to Caesars so they’re very ready and very excited” said Bill Fritz director of food and beverage at Caesars.

Another experience that is not dining related and will be ready by mid-July is the revamped rooftop pool and bar area.

One of the major improvements was to take down the seven-foot high wall that blocked any views of the ocean and city and replace it with a smaller wall complete with a drink rail that will accommodate 30 seats.

“I think we’re going to have to be dragging people out of here at the end” said Koster as he and Lodise took in the now open views of the beach and boardwalk.

The pool will feature two levels of seating complete with cabanas. Lodise said that a Hell’s Kitchen and Nobu-themed cabana isn’t out of the question where food and drinks will be delivered from those outlets.

And the swimming and party won’t stop when the sun goes down as a never-before pool nightlife experience is planned.

Also included in the views from the pool and Nobu restaurant is the Caesars Playground Pier a once-popular destination for shoppers and foodies that has declined over the years.

Lodise said that they are looking to reinvent the pier and bring in more entertainment and non-traditional uses to the space.

“The plan is to have something very complementary to what we’re doing here at Caesars” explained Lodise.

Without getting into specifics he also said that it won’t be the typical retail storefront type of setup more like a virtual reality attraction for families and small entertainment venues.

“We’re bullish on the pier just got to think about it differently.”

Lodise said that the recent trend of family-friendly entertainment in Atlantic City is a good thing a “rising tide lifts all boats” and is excited that Caesars is expanding beyond its gaming and creating something for everyone.

Large companies are disappearing at a much younger age than they used to. According to a study by management consulting firm McKinsey the average lifespan of a company on the S&P 500 list of the publicly traded enterprises was 61 years in the late 1950s. In 2016 it had fallen to just 18 years. Today companies are merged bought-out or simply go belly up at a much faster pace than they used to.

The longevity of companies on another index the Fortune 500 which compiles the largest 500 U.S. publicly traded and private corporations based on revenue is comparable to S&P 500 corporations according to Mark Perry senior fellow of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Perry found that in 2019 only 52 companies have been on the Fortune 500 list since its inception in 1955.

Why only about one in 10 of these companies have lasted for at least 64 years is a matter of academic discussion. One popular explanation is the concept of creative destruction which says that in order to innovate we need to dismantle the old. Companies therefore cease to exist (at least in their original configurations) when they’re supplanted by companies involved in newer industries and innovations. (These are the most innovative companies in 2021.)

We live in a time of accelerated technological disruption and record-high merger and acquisition activity too which might help to explain why modern large companies have shorter lifespans than they used to.

So what about the stalwarts the oldest companies? Why is Bank of New York Mellon founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1784 still around? Part of the reason is that companies in certain industries benefit from their longevity. Fortune 500 companies involved in financial services (like Edward Jones) and energy (like Exxon) tend to have older foundation dates for example.

The largest newest companies (think Amazon Alphabet and Apple) tend to be involved in the latest innovations and newest industries. The youngest company on our list is over 150 years old. Apple is not even 50. (These are America’s most hated companies.)

To determine the oldest companies in the Fortune 500 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data on Fortune’s website. Companies in the 2021 Fortune 500 were ranked based on founding date. Data on annual revenue and number of employees also came from Fortune.

As Kellogg’s prepares to split its business in three could the glory days of the multi-category consumer mega-corps be behind them?

The cereals and snacks giant is spinning out its problematic North American cereals division and its nascent plant-based division to focus on its higher-growth global snacking arm. The plan marks a shift of strategy from its fellow consumer food and drink giants which have typically prioritised growth by selling off lower-growth or non-core divisions. Kellogg’s will create three distinct publicly listed companies by the end of 2023: Global Snacking Co containing 80% of its current business including its international cereals portfolio; North American Cereal Co; and Plant Co the latter anchored by its US MorningStar Farms brand. The rationale is similar to that behind Unilever’s sale of its spreads division and Nestlé’s sale of its US ice cream and waters business – to shift away from non-core lower-growth assets and invest in categories of higher growth. For Kellogg’s this means its snack brands such as Pringles Pop-Tarts Cheez-It Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats. Its traditional cereals have suffered from the structural decline in traditional breakfasts as consumer habits shift while the division has also suffered in recent times from strikes supply chain disruptions and mounting commodity price pressures. Kellogg’s CEO Steve Cahillane who will lead the main snacking business said the split means the cereal division “will not have to compete for resources against a high-growth snacking business”. Meanwhile the much smaller Plant Co division will be an innovation-driven pure-play plant-based player. With sales of $340m the North America-focused business remains in growth phase but crucially – unlike other listed players in the space such as Beyond Meat – it generates a profit. Notable consumer spin-offs Consumer health: Last year pharma giants GSK and Johnson & Johnson both pledged to spin off their consumer health arms to become separate standalone companies. GSK rebuffed a £50bn raid from Unilever to plough ahead with its plan to split out ‘Haleon’ and IPO it in July. Johnson & Johnson is hoping its offshoot will list by November 2023.

Kraft/Mondelez: Pre-Heinz merger Kraft Foods span off confectionery arm Mondelez including the Cadbury brand in 2012. The split followed Kraft’s controversial takeover of Cadbury in 2010. Separately Mondelez has thrived now boasting annual revenues of $26bn. Kraft’s more troubled path saw revenues shrink before its mega-merger with Heinz.

Cadbury Schweppes: Under the urging of activist investor Nelson Peltz the chocolate and drinks arms split in 2007. While the split was welcomed strategically it left Cadbury vulnerable to the Kraft takeover. Schweppes – which became Dr Pepper Snapple Group – was acquired in 2018 by Keurig Green Mountain to become Keurig Dr Pepper. Cahillane said the independent companies would be “better positioned to focus on their distinct strategic priorities”. In reality this is Kellogg’s grasping the nettle of the key issue many other consumer giants face: looking after the bottom line while prioritising growth. GlobalData’s Nidhi Chauhan suggests prevailing chaotic market conditions have intensified the need to address underperforming divisions. “With the snacks business growing at a faster rate than the cereal and plant-based product divisions these smaller companies may be able to move quicker and smarter than the heavy Kellogg brand” he says. While global giants have historically benefited from scale this restructure is driven by the belief that category focus outweighs back office synergies. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson notes: “Whilst there may be security in size and savings to be made by sharing back room operations strategically there’s a gulf between family favourites and pushing plant-based boundaries.”

Best of both worlds

A break-up rather than sell-off theoretically enables the company to benefit from the best of both worlds – reliable cash generation from its mature categories and the benefit of structural growth opportunities in more on-trend areas.

This isn’t a new approach just one rarely seen in food and drink in recent years which has focused on portfolio management through M&A and tended to retain relatively diverse product categories.

Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard notes the move could be seen as an “admission that turning around the US cereal business is proving tough” but it is also reminiscent of the Mondelez split from Kraft a decade ago.

Howard suggests shedding the problematic cereals business – as well as shedding debt on to it – could propel Kellogg’s to trade more in line with other snacking companies like Mondelez’s EBITDA multiples of 14-15 times compared with its current level of around 12 times.

How investors and customers will take to the split-off cereal business is less clear. But clean splits may become increasingly attractive to consumer giants.

The past decade has seen little such activity but in recent months GSK turned down Unilever’s mega-billions approach for its consumer health arm to instead spin it out via a London IPO next month. Johnson & Johnson announced a similar consumer split in November 2021. Bernstein’s Howard suggests Campbell Soup Co or Conagra Brands may also follow suit.

Of course it could still be that Kellogg’s announcement is precursor to a more traditional divestment.

OC&C managing partner Will Hayllar comments: “The debt markets are not as open for big ticket debt at the moment and therefore they may feel like public market rather than selling to a buyout group provides the cleaner path forward.

“I suspect this gives them certainty where they can lay out the future strategy of these divisions as separate companies and if someone wants to come in and make an offer they are still able to do so.”

In particular the plant-based division would seem to offer opportunities for an investor to scale up off-market. Notably Kellogg’s even floated that a sell-off of the division remained a possibility.

Even the cereals business could attract buyer attention now Kellogg’s has announced its intention to demerge it with its reliable cash generation and potential for margin-focused restructure appealing to buyout firms in particular.

Shareholders were broadly supportive last week with shares up around 6% and remaining up a week later.

It provides more evidence that the City has grown impatient with slow-growth mature businesses. The post-Covid period has already seen General Mills and Danone diversify their portfolios while Unilever is under pressure to move much faster with Nelson Peltz set to take his board seat in a few weeks.

Kellogg’s bold move is certainly unlikely to be the last consumer spin-out as unprecedented economic pressure puts more business models under the microscope."

If you're at a loss for which island to visit read TPG's article on how to decide which Canary Island is right for you highlighting the best of each island and what type of travelers should visit.

It's also worth noting that the Canary Islands include the tiny island of La Graciosa which you can visit on a day or overnight trip from Lanzarote. There are also a few islets scattered throughout the archipelago such as Isla de Lobos Roque del Oeste Alegranza Roque del Este and Montana Clara.

They're tacky

Just like any destination there may be parts of the Canary Islands that are indeed tacky. Certain resort towns on various islands are strewn with high-rise cookie-cutter resorts budget party hostels and all-inclusive resorts that attract foreign visitors who only want to party day in and day out.

However those are just a few specific areas. If you do your research you can easily visit more authentic parts of each island. There are also luxury resorts that don't have a cheesy feel. The Ritz-Carlton Abama on Tenerife is a good example.

Six out of the seven main Canary Islands produce wine and vino tourism is a sophisticated enjoyable way to experience the islands' culture and cuisine.

Speaking of cuisine the Canaries feature a number of distinct gastronomic offerings you simply can't get anywhere else. This includes the savory mojo picon sauce which you can find generously topping potatoes as well as popular cheeses cultivated on the islands.

In fact for those looking to include culture and gastronomy alongside beach days and hiking Lanzarote is slowly becoming a more upmarket island for those looking for an air of sophistication.

Lanzarote is the closest of the Canary Islands to Africa just over 80 miles away. With dreamy beaches and a distinct volcanic landscape the island also has a budding wine tourism scene as well as notable art and architecture from famous artist César Manrique.

They're just for ravers and retirees

Party animals will adore Tenerife's Playa de las Americas and Gran Canaria's Playa del Ingles. However even within each island there are many different regions to explore. Each one provides a different sort of vacation to a different sort of visitor including communities appropriate for more mature travelers. There's something for everyone.

LGBTQIA+ travelers will find a welcoming scene in regions of Gran Canaria and Tenerife while surfers and windsurfers will find their vibes on Fuerteventura. There are neighborhoods and regions on each of the islands best for solo travelers families and couples. Hikers should head to La Gomera and wine enthusiasts to Lanzarote.

The beaches are black sand and ugly

It's true: Some of the beaches on the Canary Islands are made from volcanic black sand.

However many beaches on the Canaries have golden or fine white sand. Beach lovers should consider Fuerteventura where beaches like El Cotillo Sotavento and Flag feature that Caribbean-esque white sand. Don't forget about one of Europe's wildest beaches El Cofete. Backed by crater-pocked volcanic peaks it's a real gem.

The golden sands of Papagayo Beach on Lanzarote and Las Teresitas on Tenerife are a welcome change from the black sand. For a one-of-a-kind golden sands experience head to the dunes of Maspalomas on Gran Canaria where you may mistake the rolling sandy hills for the Saharan desert until you spot the azure waters beyond.

They're touristy

Of course the Canary Islands are packed with visitors year-round — especially from other European countries that don't see quite as much sunshine.

In the heady pre-pandemic days of 2019 Tenerife welcomed more than 6 million visitors. Fuerteventura though only welcomed 2 million. Smaller islands like El Hierro La Palma or La Gomera may only see a few hundred thousand visitors each year. This doesn't take into consideration the dip in visitors in 2020 until now thanks to the effects of COVID-19 restrictions (now all but effectively dropped).

If you get off the traditional tourist track and visit islands that aren't Gran Canaria or Tenerife or head for different areas around the island that aren't the main resort areas you'll encounter spots even more secluded than normal. You may even stumble on a deserted beach or two.

Many Spanish people live on the Canary Islands and it's easy to enjoy Canarian food culture and more by simply staying or visiting more local neighborhoods on each island. You'll want to sample papas arrugadas (wrinkled potatoes in a delicious tangy Canarian sauce mojo picon) and ropa vieja a meat dish that's also popular in Cuba. Of course you can't go wrong with fresh seafood either.

The capitals of each island certainly aren't off the beaten path. They're excellent places to learn more about what the islands are really like escape the tourists and get to know more about the local culture and history.

They're really close to Spain's mainland

Although the Canary Islands belong to Spain they're actually located closer to Africa. It takes almost three hours to fly from Spain's capital city Madrid to the islands.

Despite the length of the flight though it's pretty affordable to get there especially if you have a stash of Avios which you can use to purchase reward flights to the islands on airlines like Iberia or British Airways.

They're always hot

One of the biggest calls of the Canary Islands is the weather. You can expect year-round sunshine and warm temperatures. There are few places in Europe you can suntan on the beach in January which is part of the Canary Islands' intrigue.

However be aware that winter evenings can get chilly. The islands are often windy too especially Fuerteventura. Pack layers and a jacket or jumper for chilly winter evenings. If you plan to hike especially the Teide volcano layers are a must as it gets colder the higher you go. You may even see snow toward the top of Teide.

That said take note: Vacationers heading to Spanish islands this summer have been warned about record temperatures.

There's nothing cultural to do

The capitals of islands like Tenerife (Santa Cruz) and Gran Canaria (Las Palmas) provide a variety of historical monuments and museums to explore. Lanzarote is known for its wineries and art from the aforementioned artist architect and sculptor César Manrique.

While festivals and local celebrations may have been temporarily suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions many villages towns and cities on each island are hosting events again. Some of the most exciting are the Carnival celebrations that occur each February.

Many visitors prefer to enjoy the daily sunshine the Canaries offer. However if you prefer spending a day at a museum shopping or checking out architectural or artistic wonders you can.

There are also numerous hiking cycling and rock climbing opportunities on each island. Additionally water sports like diving and surfing are ideal for those who want to be outdoors but get bored sunbathing.

It's all volcanic rock

The Canary Islands were formed by volcanoes. As a result expect to see craters black-sand beaches and even volcanoes themselves.

You can also explore many other unique landscapes on the islands. Other special natural spots to visit are:

Garajonay National Park's laurel tree forests on La Gomera.

The green hills of Barranco de los Hombres on La Palma.

Masca Valley's terraced mountaintop villages on Tenerife.

Gran Canaria's rolling sand dunes.

16 different miradores astronomicos (stargazing spots) on La Palma.

Anaga Natural Park a tropical microclimate forest on Tenerife.

The verdant hilly Parque Rural de Doramas on Gran Canaria.

They're only for package holidays

Many of the smaller islands have boutique hotels or bed-and-breakfast accommodations that offer a more serene and relaxed vacation stay. In addition renting a villa or apartment is an easy way to have a more off-the-beaten-path luxurious or simply more authentic Canary Islands vacation experience.

Family-friendly options complete with kids pools and activities adults-only wellness hotels quiet mountain or beach cove guesthouses – you'll find every sort of accommodation possible on the islands.

Bottom line

Yes parts of the Canaries can seem tacky and touristy and home to black-sand beaches and volcanoes. However the islands can also be incredibly charming enticing travelers with white-sand beaches lush forests jagged mountains unique local customs celebrations and cuisine.

Don't let these common misconceptions steer you away from these sunny Spanish islands. Instead find a way to have your ideal holiday there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR5bmFzdHluZXJkcy5jb20vYXBwbGVzLXRvLW9yYW5nZXMtY29tcGFyaW5nLXJvb2tpZXMtdG8tZGV2eS1hc3NldHMv0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZHluYXN0eW5lcmRzLmNvbS9hcHBsZXMtdG8tb3Jhbmdlcy1jb21wYXJpbmctcm9va2llcy10by1kZXZ5LWFzc2V0cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apples to Oranges: Comparing Rookies to Devy Assets,"Each spring and summer dynasty players are faced with a tough question do I draft a rookie at position X this year or wait for devy assets? Sometimes when your team is close the choice is simple.

What about when it isn’t? When your team isn’t looking like it will win this year you must decide what is worth drafting. That decision is never easy because everyone wants to win immediately but it may be worth waiting for. Trading back to get a pick in the future or a player and a pick later could be worth it.

What you need to be empowered with is knowledge. The knowledge of who is better the rookie this year or the devy assets of the future. This year’s rookie class wasn’t friendly to Superflex players needing a QB. As for the other positions you may be in luck. To know for sure though allow us to help.

Let us compare apples -rookie picks – to oranges – the devy assets – so you know which is more valuable.

(Disclaimer: I know everyone is quick to judge so this is the criteria for the rookies and devy assets. I am using the top player at each position from the Dynasty Nerds rankings.)

Quarterbacks: Any Rookie Quarterback vs. Bryce Young

Selection: Bryce Young

This 2022 rookie QB class can be best compared to a school lunch. You don’t really want to eat it but you will if it is all you have in front of you. No one should be excited to draft any of these rookies. Punting on that position this year should 100 percent be the call. Young is currently the top devy QB for our site and is leaps and bounds above all the rookies. The reigning Heisman winner may even see his stock grow more with the improvements coming to his offense. He may not be the first overall pick in 2023 but he should be a top-five pick and one of the best fantasy assets next year.

Running Backs: Breece Hall vs. Bijan Robinson

Selection: Bijan Robinson

If Bijan Robinson was in this running back class he would be the clear cut RB1 for me I’m only a couple games in and it’s the summer but I’m sold. #HookEm pic.twitter.com/S3mO2we9IX — Andrew Harbaugh (@AndrewHarbaugh_) April 7 2022

I love Hall as a prospect. That being said Robinson is in a special tier. He is without a doubt the best RB prospect since Saquon Barkley bar none. His unique and rare blend of vision power and burst make him a lethal weapon for the Longhorns’ offense. If you want to see why people are excited about him watch the Oklahoma game from this fall. Every aspect of his game is on display. The play in the tweet above is just a taste.

Wide Receivers: Garrett Wilson vs. Jaxon Smith-Njigba

Selection: Garrett Wilson

This was the most challenging decision of all the situations listed. I am a fan of both players. Both have NFL skillsets and should be great in the league. For the time being I am giving Wilson the nod because of the offense he is in with Zach Wilson. While Hall and Michael Carter will look to balance the offense the Jets want to air it out more. Corey Davis couldn’t mesh with Zach Wilson his first year but Garrett Wilson might be more friendly of a fit. His skill set and how the Jets may look to use him should allow him to fit in the offense better and produce.

Tight End: Trey McBride vs. Brock Bowers

Selection: Brock Bowers

Brock Bowers in 2021:



▫️888 receiving yards



Most by a P5 TE since 2018 🐶pic.twitter.com/JWLbHVe92O — PFF College (@PFF_College) April 11 2022



This TE class was sort of a stinker let’s be honest. This TE devy class though is something much better. This coming year we have Michael Mayer leading the class but in 2024 that has the white whale. Bowers will be the most exciting prospect since Kyle Pitts when he is eligible. He has the complete toolset and a chance to be the most complete TE prospect since T.J. Hockenson. Georgia always develops its talent. Bowers is like a fine wine while he sits down there and continues to get better.

By Salvatore Cernuzio – Kinshasa DRC

The Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of Congo will remember 2 July as “an historic day”.

As part of Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin’s visit to Kinshasa in Pope Francis’ name the Congolese Catholic Bishops’ Conference (CENCO) signed five agreements with the DRC government recognizing the official status of the Church which had previously been registered as a non-profit organization.

The ceremony took place on Saturday in the presence of Cardinal Parolin immediately after a private meeting of more than half an hour with Prime Minister Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde.

2016 Framework Agreement between Holy See and DRC

The agreements were signed by the ministers of Foreign Affairs Health Justice Finance Higher Education and Universities and Local Affairs and by CENCO president Archbishop Marcel Utembi Tapa putting into practice the Framework Agreement signed by the Holy See and the Democratic Republic of Congo on 20 May 2016 on matters of common interest.

The Framework was signed at the Vatican by Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher Secretary for Relations with States and the then Congolese foreign minister Raymond Tshibanda N'Tungamulongo.

Setting out the respective independence and autonomy of Church and State the Framework Agreement established the legal framework for mutual relations and in particular enshrined the legal position of the Catholic Church in the civil sphere and its freedom regarding apostolic activity and regulation of matters within its competence.

Prime Minister's decree

Ratified in 2019 and entered into force in 2020 the Framework Agreement has never been fully implemented. A decree last June by Prime Minister Sama Lukonde called for its implementation and thus recognition of the Church as a legal entity.

Following months of negotiations and considerable engagement by CENCO the Apostolic Nunciature and the relevant government ministries a Joint Commission then drew up five specific agreements governing the areas of religious instruction in schools Catholic educational institutions the Church's charitable-assistance activity pastoral care in penitentiary and hospital institutions and the Church’s patrimonial and fiscal regime.

Cardinal Parolin: ‘Beginning of more intense collaboration’

The signing of the five agreements took place at a well-attended ceremony at the Prime Minister’s office which was punctuated by applause and the exchange of gifts.

""This stage is the manifestation of the President's desire to express the honor of your visit"" the Prime Minister told Cardinal Parolin.

The Vatican Secretary of State stressed that ""the Agreement consolidates the partnership which has united the Catholic Church and the political authorities of this country for centuries at the service of the entire population.""

""The interest of the Church in these relations with the civil authorities is focused on working together for the integral human development of all people without ethnic or religious distinctions and especially the poorest and most needy"" the Cardinal said.

He also expressed his hopes that the Framework Agreement would not only represent ""the end of a long process but rather the cornerstone of a new more intense and orderly collaboration” which will lead to “the peaceful and fruitful collaboration of the Church with the civil authorities and the just recognition of its contribution to the common good.”

Cardinal Ambongo: ‘Everything will get easier for us’

The Archbishop of Kinshasa Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu echoed Cardinal Parolin’s words to Vatican News on the sidelines of the event.

He said this ""historic day for the Congolese Church"" has been awaited ""for over six years.""

""As of today everything will become easier for us in the field of education health and social work as well as in everything we do for the poor and all the work we have been doing for years.”

Cardinal Ambongo recalled that the Church in the Democratic Republic of Congo expends great effort for the country’s people running around 50 percent of schools and about 40 percent of health facilities despite having been registered with the State as an NGO.

""The agreements will therefore give us new impetus"" said the Cardinal. “Before we worked and no one—including diocesan bishops—knew what the Church’s rights and duties were with respect to the government; now things will be clearer. We will know that all the work we do is done within legislation recognized by the State.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2J1cmdlci1raW5nLXNlY3JldC1tZW51LWZyaW5nc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burger King Menu Has Some Secret Whoppers (and Frings),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/burger-king-secret-menu-frings on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2J1cmdlci1raW5nLXNlY3JldC1tZW51LWZyaW5nc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHluZXdzaHVuZ2FyeS5jb20vYS1odW5nYXJpYW4tcG9wZS1pcy1pdC1wb3NzaWJsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pope Francis to resign and Hungarian Cardinal Erdő to succeed?,"For months speculation has been rife as to whether the head of the Catholic Church would resign due to his deteriorating health. According to a prominent Catholic portal Pope Francis could well name Cardinal Péter Erdő as his successor. Continue reading below for more information.

The Archbishop of Esztergom and Budapest celebrated his 70th birthday last month reports Blikk. He could be one of the top contenders for the papacy according to the Christian Herald. However another candidate for the ailing Pope Francis Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle could be a better fit for the current Pope’s liberal views than the Christian conservative Péter Erdő.

Hungarian Cardinal Erdő

Péter Erdő Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest Primate of Hungary was born on 25 June 1952. His ordination took place in Budapest on 18 June 1975. Between 1975 and 1977 he served as chaplain in Dorog and in 1976 he received a doctorate in theology with summa cum laude at the Academy of Theology. From 1977 to 1980 he studied canon law at the Institute of Canon Law of the Pontificia Universitá Lateranense Utriusque Iuris in Rome on a scholarship from the Pontifical Hungarian Institute and completed his doctorate in canon law in 1980.

Cardinal Erdő is considered a traditionalist who respects the celebration of the Latin Mass. But Cardinal Erdő is also respected by liberals like the Pope suggesting he could be a unifying force within the Church. Pope Francis has already appointed Cardinal Erdő as the “relator general” of the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops. The Hungarian cardinal has also been vocal in his support for outreach to Orthodox Christians which may be significant given the huge numbers of Ukrainians currently in Hungary.

It is important to see what Cardinal Erdő would represent as Pope. Pope St. John Paul II was considered instrumental in the collapse of communism in central and eastern Europe. The Polish Pope’s election helped spark the peaceful end of communism in his native country. Cardinal Erdő has shown some sympathy towards Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Effects of a Hungarian Pope

It is clear that the election of Cardinal Erdő as Pope would help Orbán further his political agenda. During the height of the migrant crisis in the EU Cardinal Erdő was strongly siding with Hungarian conservative officials. Later in 2019 however Cardinal Erdő shared some of his thoughts with Válasz Online. During this interview he was showing a change of heart directly challenging the views of Viktor Orbán. The Hungarian Cardinal said “can a country a continent be called Christian?”

Seeing the above mentioned the relationship between the Hungarian Cardinal and the Prime Minister is difficult to define. What is probable is that Erdő’s appointment as Pope would likely lead to further religious divide within Europe.

Sellers of furniture coconut water even kids’ potties say the fees are inflating costs.

Here is the long story in full graphic detail.

by Michael Grabell (ProPublica) The story you’re about to read is bananas and it’s also about bananas.

Last fall a company called One Banana loaded 600000 pounds of the fruit from its plantations in Guatemala and Ecuador onto ships bound for the Port of Long Beach in California. Once they arrived the bananas packed in refrigerated containers were offloaded by cranes for trucking to a nearby warehouse where the fruit would be sent to supermarkets nationwide.

But in the midst of a global supply chain crisis none of the trucking companies the importer normally worked with were willing to come and get the containers.

As the bananas sat at the marine terminal a logistics specialist for One Banana scrambled contacting more than a dozen trucking firms.

With each passing hour the bananas grew closer to spoiling.

“We need to pull out 15 containers from Long Beach Port” the logistics specialist wrote in an email to one firm. “Please let me know if you could help me with this.”

A trucking company finally said it could — but only if One Banana first paid $12000 per container on top of already higher transportation costs.

This is where the plot ripens.

If One Banana were to accept that additional fee and pass the full cost along to consumers the bananas could go from 60 cents a pound to 90 cents a pound. That alone might not break your budget but rising prices of everyday items are adding up to the worst inflation in 40 years. Many of the causes may seem obvious. Massive consumer spending and pandemic shutdowns have strained supply chains. The war in Ukraine is driving up the price of gas. But the extra fees for transporting bananas — and countless other products — are a hidden and mind-boggling source of inflation controlled by ocean carriers.

Simply put as ballooning costs hit the wallets of American families the global ocean shipping industry is enjoying its most profitable period in recent history. In the first quarter of 2022 the biggest carriers’ operating margins hit 57% according to one industry research firm after hovering in the single digits before the pandemic.

The hauler that wanted $12000 per container to move the bananas told the One Banana logistics specialist that it needed the money to cover a slew of fees the ocean carriers were tacking onto freight bills. Hapag-Lloyd the German shipping giant that owned the containers the bananas were sitting in had become particularly notorious in the freight industry leading to multiple complaints to the Federal Maritime Commission.

In normal times the fees known as detention and demurrage make a lot of sense. Importers who don’t pick up their stuff on time get charged demurrage for storage at the marine terminals. Truckers who don’t return an empty container on time pay late fees or detention. The purpose of the penalties is to incentivize the various players in the supply chain to keep goods flowing.

But as supply chains snarled last year the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles ran out of room and became clogged with shipping containers that importers often big-box retailers and brands weren’t able to retrieve. Surrounding truckyards and streets were flooded with empty containers temporarily dumped there by trucking companies that couldn’t get appointments to return them to the ports.

Hapag had made it “extremely difficult” to return empty containers the trucking company said and it was often left holding them for a month all while Hapag continued to charge the firm $400 a day for each container that wasn’t returned on time. One trucking company that the importer contacted said it almost had to shut down temporarily because all the chassis — the steel frames with wheels that attach to trucks — that it needed to pull new loads from the ports were sitting under 70 empty containers that Hapag refused to take back.

Essentially One Banana and several trucking companies said Hapag had created the situation it was now profiting from.

“It’s like renting a car at the airport and when you try to return it they’re saying ‘No you have to hang on to it for us and we’re gonna continue to charge you’” said Fred Johring the CEO of one of the trucking firms Golden State Logistics.

Hapag declined to comment but in filings with the Maritime Commission it denied One Banana’s allegations that the fees were unfair.

The case is ongoing but on this late October day in the Port of Long Beach hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of bananas hung in the balance.

For more than a year retailers and brands have complained of crushing costs as the rate to ship a container from China to the West Coast skyrocketed from less than $2000 before the pandemic to over $20000 last year. Ninety percent of the stuff Americans buy from overseas arrives by ship and nearly all of it is carried by a small number of ocean carriers that work together in three alliances that dominate the trade.

The Federal Maritime Commission which regulates the ocean shipping industry recently concluded that the spike in freight rates was driven by the surge in spending and record congestion not monopoly power.

But the federal government said what’s happening with the additional detention and demurrage fees isn’t simple supply and demand. Instead it said ocean carriers have taken advantage of the crisis and “contributed to the pain” by imposing billions of dollars in “purposeless” and illegal fees that violate the Shipping Act.

Now the arcane matter of detention and demurrage has made its way into corporate earnings reports. Companies ranging from Bed Bath & Beyond and Havertys Furniture to Vita Coco beverages and Summer Infant which makes baby strollers and potties have blamed detention and demurrage fees for hurting their bottom lines or leading them to increase prices.

“Most people didn’t even know what those things were” Trevor Lang chief financial officer for Floor & Decor said in an earnings call in February.

In comments to federal regulators in April the Home Furnishings Association wrote “These demurrage and detention fees have become a significant part of furniture retail costs in the last 2+ years.”

The trade association representing toymakers like Hasbro and Mattel called the charges “unethical” while a group representing meatpackers like Tyson Foods and Cargill accused ocean carriers of “near-constant predatory and unreasonable behavior” and “a clear abuse of market power.”

One Banana called the fees “unjust and unreasonable” in a complaint to the Maritime Commission. But other fruit importers went further in agency comments.

“Demurrage charges are one way in which ocean carriers abuse their monopoly power over ocean transport” the fruit importer William H. Kopke Jr. Inc. wrote to the commission. “Particularly when the cargo is perishable it is as if the cargo is held hostage. If the receiver does not pay any charges demanded immediately not only does the cargo rot while the charges are under dispute but demurrage charges will continue to accrue.”

In an interview John Butler president of the World Shipping Council said the ocean carriers that the trade group represents have been dealing with historic demand and congestion and with the millions of boxes that they’re moving disputes are bound to erupt.

“In the eyes of their customers do they get it right all the time? Of course not” he said. “Does that make it unreasonable? Sometimes it might be. Sometimes it might not be. It really is case by case. So you can’t generalize about practices because it really does come down to the situation.”

In particular Butler said many big-box retailers and other importers have been using the ports as storage because their warehouses are full or they can’t get truckers to move their cargo.

The fee controversy is pitting the Maritime Commission with 128 employees and a $31 million annual budget against a global shipping industry that raked in $214 billion in profits last year.

In recent months the commission has been trying to crack down on the fees by inviting complaints like One Banana’s and proposing tougher rules on ocean carriers. And on Monday Congress approved the Ocean Shipping Reform Act giving the commission more teeth.

The Maritime Commission rebuked Hapag in one case involving Golden State Logistics proposing the biggest fine in the agency’s history: $16.5 million.

The proposed fine was still less than the profit Hapag made in a single day last year but the commission hoped it would send a message. In late April an administrative law judge agreed that Hapag had violated the Shipping Act and last week the company agreed to settle the case for $2 million — about what Hapag made in 98 minutes.

Hapag declined to comment on the commission’s case but told the judge that its practices were reasonable and that any fees were the trucking firm’s fault.

As U.S. regulators spar with the global behemoths who control the shipping trade the inefficiencies of a supply chain that once seemed blazingly efficient are becoming clear.

Kim Cruz an auditor for Golden State steered a Toyota pickup through the dusty potholed storage yard in Wilmington California craning her neck to read the numbers stamped on the backs of shipping containers parked in row upon row. It was April and she was looking for a container that the trucking company had been trying to return to the Chinese shipping titan COSCO since Jan. 26.

The light gray container had traveled the world according to customs records carrying suitcases from a Cambodian factory to a port in Vietnam where it was loaded onto a ship called the Marco Polo that is as long as the Empire State Building is tall. The container arrived in mid-January at the Port of Los Angeles where a trucker for Golden State picked it up and drove it to a warehouse for a major department store.

Now it sat empty hidden somewhere amid hundreds of blue green yellow pink and rust-colored containers lining the dirt lot squeezed between a rail line and a refinery.

“It’s insane — you have to search this whole yard” said Cruz who has brown curly hair and a tattoo of a sooty owl wrapped around her forearm.

Cruz knew the absurdities of the global supply chain intimately. She had helped Golden State and the Maritime Commission build the case against Hapag.

Overwhelmed by detention and demurrage bills in 2021 the midsize trucking firm based in Compton California had tasked Cruz with fighting back. She studied the law along with a decades-old industry code with a tongue-twisting name: the Uniform Intermodal Interchange and Facilities Access Agreement. It spells out the relationship between ocean carriers marine terminals equipment leasing companies and trucking firms as containers and chassis change custody along the supply chain.

Many people might assume that returning a shipping container is easy: Truckers pick up a load at the port take it to a warehouse and return with an empty container — back and forth throughout the day.

But the supply chain doesn’t work like that. Containers typically belong to the ocean carriers and different types of containers can only be returned to certain marine terminals at specific times. To manage the flow terminals usually require trucking companies to make appointments.

Cruz and Golden State’s dispatchers had been trying for months to schedule a time to return the COSCO container. But appointments to simply return a container are hard to come by as terminals try to free up space by requiring what’s known as a “dual transaction” meaning that for every container brought back a new load needs to be taken out of the port. If one of Golden State’s customers didn’t have a load at that terminal it couldn’t return the container. To make matters more difficult the container was sitting on a specialized chassis that couldn’t be reused and could only be returned to a specific terminal.

Each day that Golden State couldn’t return the container to COSCO it accrued another $180 in fees that would ultimately be passed on to the department store and most likely its shoppers. So far the container had racked up nearly $8000 in fees not including thousands more for the chassis and yard storage.

COSCO declined to comment.

As Cruz scanned the storage yard she repeated the first few letters of the container number.

“What’s that one?” she asked pointing to a gray container. “Oh no I don’t think it’s that one.”

Cruz studied social work and psychology and worked as a customer service representative for Harley-Davidson.

“I didn’t even know what a chassis was back then” she said. “But now I love it. It’s like trying to figure out lots of little puzzles.”

In the Hapag case Cruz provided screenshots from the terminal booking websites showing that no appointments were available. But each time a Hapag representative responded that the marine terminals manage the appointment systems not them and that Golden State still owed the fees. (The trade group for marine terminals said the availability of appointments is dictated by the ocean carriers.)

Frustrated by one of Hapag’s replies Cruz shot back over email: “We are not paying this invoice. There were no appointments available and the terminal appointment system is out of our control.” She explained that Golden State had contacted Hapag daily to ask for help or alternate return locations and had gotten nowhere.

“How does any of this make sense?” she asked. “These are unfair business practices that must be stopped immediately.”

As Cruz drove deeper into the container yard an early spring heat wave pushing temperatures past 90 degrees she squinted through the glare of the afternoon sun on the windshield.

“It’s got to be in here somewhere” she said.

If a container stays out too long and late fees aren’t paid trucking companies can be slapped with a shut-out notice barring them from picking up any of the ocean line’s containers. The notices are akin to a death sentence in the freight industry as trucking firms that can’t fulfill their customers’ orders will quickly lose business.

In the last year Cruz said Golden State had been threatened frequently with shut-outs. It’s a powerful scare tactic she said that often pressures trucking companies to pay invalid bills.

“Truckers usually pay it and just say be done with it” she said. “You know we’re gonna lose more money if we end up getting shut out. So that’s what happens.” She shook her head: “Dirty business.”

After searching through rows of containers Cruz finally approached the back of the yard.

“Maybe behind that container?” she said.

She got closer and read the letters.

“That’s it!” she shouted.

The light gray COSCO container was pocked with rust marks sitting between a lime-green container and one that was taxi yellow. Cruz stepped out of the pickup to look at the box that had been a line at the top of a spreadsheet and the object of so much agita.

But she still needed a trucker — and an appointment to return the container.

The impact of the fees has hit freight haulers big and small. And the circumstances causing them to pony up are often out of their control.

The IMC Companies one of the largest port trucking firms in the country said it paid well over $100 million in demurrage fees alone last year on behalf of its customers compared with a few million dollars before the pandemic. Jim Gillis president of the IMC subsidiary Pacific Drayage Services said at one point last fall one of his customers a large household goods retailer selling small appliances and candles had 350 containers that it couldn’t return.

“By the time you’re said and done instead of paying $10000 a container with all the fees racked up with storage fees at the port chassis fees per diem fees these guys are paying $60000 to $70000 a box” he said estimating the total might have reached $20 million. “If I’m an importer” he said “I’m adding that to the price of my products.”

The issue became so bad for Leslie Luna freight coordinator for Luna and Son’s Trucking that her family moved its small trucking firm out of Southern California to the less-congested Port of Houston in Texas.

“It got to a point where we were stressed with having to house all these containers and not getting much help” she said. “I was lucky if I got two to three hours of sleep because I was literally on that computer all night trying to get appointments.”

Ocean carriers and marine terminals typically don’t let truckers leave with a container until all late pickup fees have been paid. Businesses say that’s forced them to shell out even when the charges are disputed.

Sometimes containers are pulled aside for inspection by U.S. customs officials. J&K Fresh a customs broker for the fruit industry said Chilean grape importers are “facing a financial crisis” at the Port of Philadelphia as congestion delays are forcing them to pay thousands of dollars in fees per container while waiting for the grapes to be fumigated — a requirement of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Once containers are picked up another clock starts. Importers have a few days to take them to a warehouse unload them and return them empty.

Often retailers will hire freight brokers to act as travel agents to handle the whole trip.

Under some contracts the broker can be the ocean shipping line which arranges transportation of the container across the sea over rails and aboard trucks to its final destination. But sometimes the ocean carrier’s trucking company is backlogged for weeks. Both retailers and freight brokers said they’ve sometimes been stuck with late fees in these cases even when other trucking firms were available.

In addition to alerting importers that their goods have arrived ocean carriers also tell U.S. companies waiting to export products when their ship is about to dock. Those companies often farmers and manufacturers will then load their products into containers and take them to the port. But because of the congestion the companies complain the ocean carriers’ ships have been delayed forcing them to pay fees for port storage or extra container use.

Even when supply chains aren’t snarled fees can add up fast.

In one particularly pungent anecdote Brian Watt a logistics manager based in Florida described a container carrying plastic bins full of liquid yeast extract from Europe to New York. On its journey across the Atlantic he said one of the bins burst open coating the inside of the container with a slurry-like goo. The mess was discovered only after his trucker had delivered the container to a food industry and brewery supplier in upstate New York.

Watt had to send a trucker to pick the load back up hire a waste company to clean it out and wait for a permit to dump the yeast extract in a New Jersey landfill.

“You can imagine how it smelled. This is July. Do you know how hot it gets inside a container?” he said. “We had to send guys in suits to clean that thing up.”

The process took almost two months and in the end the ocean carrier sent Watt a late-return bill for $42150.

The front window of Golden State’s office glowed like a beacon among the low-slung warehouses of Compton. It was a few minutes past 4 a.m. and Lisandro Figueroa was at his cubicle scanning terminal websites for appointments to return empty containers — like the one his coworker Cruz was dealing with.

He stared at a blue-and-red grid on his computer screen jotting down abbreviations for ocean carriers on a piece of a paper as country music hummed in the background.

“This is COSCO. This is Evergreen. This is OOCL. This is ONE line. CU lines. BAL lines. Wan Hai lines. Yang Ming lines. As you can see” he said “everything mostly says no.”

The global supply chain has often been heralded as a high-tech wonder. The movement of containers at ports and through warehouses is a heavily automated ballet of advanced robots. But keeping it all together are people like Figueroa and Cruz.

Figueroa’s work as a dispatcher is kind of like a cross between Wordle and SimCity. Golden State has to pick up about 150 containers loaded with auto parts appliances and electronics from the port terminals every day. The stores and suppliers want their stuff as soon as possible and each load has a deadline — typically a few days after arrival in the port — after which fees start to accrue. To get those goods Figueroa has to match up drivers with empty containers that the terminals will accept. That way the drivers can drop off the old containers and reuse the chassis to pick up the new ones. So he scans a spreadsheet for the oldest empties he can return to stop fees from accumulating.

Golden State’s yards meanwhile can only accept so many containers. That morning one of its yards had 88 containers sitting in 90 spots. If Figueroa didn’t move empties out of the yard soon Golden State would run out of space.

By 5 a.m. his phone was ringing every few minutes. Figueroa who has a black beard with gray streaks switched seamlessly between English and Spanish while also speaking fluent logistics jargon.

Port truck drivers are nearly all independent contractors seeking to line up the most profitable loads and avoid those that would cost them time and money while sitting in lines at the port or stuck in Los Angeles traffic.

“To keep a driver you’ve gotta be on their level sometimes” Figueroa said. “I’m a driver psychologist because I do a whole lot of listening.”

One driver called looking for work only to call back a few minutes later saying his battery had died.

“Well let me know when you get it fixed not a problem” Figueroa assured him. “Ándale pues.”

He sent one driver to take a shipment from the yard to an appliance warehouse and another driver to haul an empty container back to the port and pick up a new load: “Ándale bye-bye.”

At 6:41 a.m. a driver wearing a reflective-striped shirt and orange polarized sunglasses stopped by the office and said he was ready for a load. Figueroa sent him to fetch a shipment of tires that would start accruing fees if not picked up by the end of the day.

A few minutes later the phone rang.

“Uh-oh” Figueroa said. “What happened? Don’t scare me. Don’t scare me.”

It was a driver who was supposed to pick up an empty container from the yard return it to the port and pick up a new load between 7 and 8 a.m. But he had accidentally pulled from the yard a container full of auto parts destined for a customer.

Before Figueroa could worry a colleague reported that another driver who was supposed to pick up a load of auto parts had broken down. The problem had essentially fixed itself. Figueroa reassigned the driver who’d taken out the wrong load to cover the delivery for the driver who’d broken down.

Yet Figueroa still had to cover the 7 to 8 a.m. appointment to pick up a new load at the port. So he called the driver with the orange sunglasses.

“Hey that load I gave you? Cancel it” Figueroa said. “I am going to send you another load instead.”

The tires would have to wait getting closer to racking up fees.

As things quieted down Figueroa started going through the COSCO containers that had been sitting on the specialized chassis for weeks collecting thousands of dollars in fees. But as usual there were no appointments at the terminal that would accept both the container and the chassis.

So he started to see if he could just return the container and then separately turn in the chassis later.

Amid the congestion finding an appointment has been like trying to nab tickets for a K-pop concert or a COVID-19 vaccine in early 2021.

There was an appointment for 5:30 p.m. But before Figueroa could type in the container number to reserve it the appointment was gone. The next one wasn’t until 10:30 p.m. and it was Friday night. The chances of getting a trucker to cover it were slim.

But Figueroa said he knew a trick.

“I’ve done this so much” he said “that I’ve figured out that they’ll open appointments every half hour on the two mark and by the two mark I mean they’ll open appointments at 8:02 and 8:32.”

It was almost 8:02 a.m. Figueroa placed his fingers on the keyboard and refreshed the terminal’s website. He refreshed again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again.

“If I didn’t get one by now I’m probably not going to get one” he said.

At 8:32 a.m. Figueroa tried again. No luck.

It too would have to wait and the meter kept running.

The imbroglio over the bananas was becoming increasingly desperate for One Banana.

The company typically shipped five to six refrigerated containers of bananas with Hapag each week. The family-owned firm had started with one plantation in Guatemala in 1958 and grown into one of the largest producers of tropical fruits in Central America.

With more than 100 vessels queueing outside the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach last fall One Banana’s loads suddenly had to wait longer. And shipping rates had increased substantially. Starting in September One Banana contacted 15 trucking companies and almost all refused to pick up the importers’ containers if they were from Hapag because they were afraid of getting stuck with them and racking up fees.

“We have 30+ empties out of the port with nowhere to return them” a One Banana employee wrote to Hapag in October. “On top of this we have 30+ full containers of perishable product that is sitting at the port and getting older every day because no carrier will go into the port to get it because they know they will be stuck with containers for weeks.”

The employee added “I do not see how it is right that we are getting charged demurrage for containers that we cannot even pickup because we cannot return your empties.”

As weeks passed without a resolution One Banana faced a choice of whether to pay $12000 per container to get its 600000 pounds of bananas to grocery stores. The company had already incurred more than $300000 in detention and demurrage fees on 67 containers since the start of September.

“We can only help you if you pay in advance” the trucking firm told the company.

One Banana declined to say whether it agreed to pay the fees.

But it did pay a price.

The bananas had already gone bad.

South Korea has reportedly sent a largest-ever contingent to the ongoing US-led Rim of the Pacific 2022 (RIMPAC 2022) exercise as its president wrapped up his first appearance in NATO. Chinese experts have warned that these moves send a dangerous signal that the Yoon Suk-yeol administration is deviating from a neutral line amid China-US competition and losing diplomatic autonomy to serve the US' Asia-Pacific strategy which also faced concerns in South Korea over relations and cooperation with China.RIMPAC 2022 exercise kicked off on Thursday which the US Pacific Fleet described as ""the world's largest international maritime exercise.""According to a statement 26 nations 38 surface ships four submarines nine national land forces more than 30 unmanned systems approximately 170 aircraft and more than 25000 personnel will train and operate in and around Hawaii and Southern California from June 29 to August 4.Launched in 1971 the RIMPAC exercise is designed to enhance cooperation among participating countries in securing sea lines of communication and countering potential security challenges at sea.However with the US' promotion of its ambitious Indo-Pacific strategy the exercises have turned into a platform for the US and its allies to test their combat techniques and capacities to prepare for potential military conflicts in the sea especially conflicts with China in the South China Sea or the Taiwan Straits.Except for Japan and Australia South Korea this year also actively participated in the exercise as it sent the largest contingent to the RIMPAC since the country first joined the exercise in 1990 the Yonhap News Agency reported.The South Korean fleet joining this year's RIMPAC includes the 14500-ton Marado amphibious landing ship the 7600-ton Sejong the Great destroyer the 4400-ton Munmu the Great destroyer the 1800-ton Shin Dol-seok submarine a P-3 maritime surveillance aircraft two Lynx helicopters and nine amphibious assault vehicles according to Yonhap.The move is partly the result of the so-called consensus reached by South Korea and the US on the Korean Peninsula to deter North Korea during US President Biden's visit to South Korea Lü Chao an expert on the Korean Peninsula issue at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences told the Global Times on Friday.Leaders of Japan and South Korea had also expressed interest to underpin a security alliance with the US' Western allies during their first participation in the NATO Summit in Madrid on Wednesday.Lü said that the large-scale contingent is a practical move of South Korea to tell the US that it is willing to get closer and enhance cooperation with Japan in creating a military alliance.This is a dangerous signal as it indicates that although trying to explain that its cooperation with the US does not target China South Korea is deviating from the neutral stance between China and the US and sacrificing its diplomatic autonomy to serve the US' Indo-Pacific strategy to contain China Lü warned.These moves will not only harm economic and security interests of South Korea in the long run but will exacerbate regional confrontation and division experts warned.Some awkward moments for Yoon showed that his first appearance at NATO was not so smooth as he expected.In one photo of the four leaders who attended the NATO summit for the first time that was released on the NATO website on Wednesday Yoon's eyes were closed while the other leaders of Japan Australia and New Zealand smiled.In a video clip circulating on Thursday Yoon smiling and nodding his head was given a ""no look handshake"" by Biden which was described by some South Korean netizens as ""pathetic."" Korea Herald reporter Yim Hyun-su posted the video on Twitter with the words: ""When someone you think is your bestie doesn't acknowledge you at a party.""Concerns also rose within South Korea especially after South Korea's senior presidential secretary for economic affairs told media in Madrid the export boom era through China that South Korea has enjoyed over the past 20 years is coming to an end adding South Korea needs to diversify its markets to Europe media reported on Wednesday.""It is largely the South Korean government that lacks strategic thinking in their approach to the Indo-Pacific Strategy and alliance with the US"" Jaewoo Choo a professor of Chinese foreign policy at the Department of Chinese Studies Kyung Hee University told the Global Times on Friday.""The Yoon government wants to be an active player but the public is very concerned of China's market and our national interest in China. Most of all they want our relationship with China mended but not in this fashion. That's why there are some protests"" Choo said.As for the RIMPAC exercise despite South Korea's sincerity to show an attitude to the US through it military experts pointed out that they are just a series of shows for the US to flex muscle and try to sell more weapons.And even if it looks like the US is attracting more partners to join the exercises this year the participants have different considerations Song Zhongping a Chinese military expert and TV commentator told the Global Times.Among these partners only Japan and Australia probably would actually come or is able to help the US if a military conflict erupts between the US and China. Many other countries especially some small countries are just ""kidnapped"" by the US to join and would only take part in a few of the projects Song pointed.Commissioned in 2021 the South Korea's Marado amphibious landing ship is expected to serve as a de facto prototype and contribute to the country acquiring knowledge and capabilities about light aircraft carrier operation for their model of light aircraft carrier.

Royce Da 5’9 is a student of Hip Hop culture first and foremost. Along his journey he’s contributed a stellar body of work including 2020’s Grammy Award-nominated album The Allegory. The 22-track project boasted appearances from Benny The Butcher Conway The Machine KXNG Crooked CyHi The Prynce DJ Premier and Vince Staples among others.

It also featured an uncredited contribution from his longtime friend and Bad Meets Evil co-conspirator Eminem. The two Motor City natives have consistently appeared on each other’s endeavors and now fans can own part of Royce Da 5’9’s Book of Ryan single “Caterpillar” featuring Eminem and King Green. Released in 2018 the song has amassed over 61 million YouTube views and peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.

In partnership with music royalty marketplace Royal Nickel Nine has given fans the opportunity to purchase streaming royalty rights to “Caterpillar” that will generate payouts as the song is streamed. In sharing ownership of his music with fans Royce joins artists such as Nas Big Boi Logic Diplo and Joyner Lucas in rewriting the decades-old rules of the music industry. Historically this type of music ownership and investment has been limited to record labels and private equity groups.

By allowing fans to invest directly in the artists and songs they believe in Royal is empowering artists and creating a new relationship between musicians and their supporters providing greater autonomy from the institutions that have historically dominated the industry.

“I regained ownership from a lot of my masters going back to the early 2000s” Royce told HipHopDX in a recent interview. “I am really really really proud of that. This is more of a cultural thing than it is a business play. This is me being proactive with just taking steps with things that I’m interested in.

“I feel like it’s the perfect time to get my feet wet with just something that’s moderate something that’s cool. I wanted to show everybody you can take steps and there’s no such thing as a L. So why not do it? You know Royal is a fantastic company.”

Beginning June 28 fans were able to buy in at three different tiers that came with exclusive content beginning at $79 and going all the way up to $1299. As Royce Da 5’9 explained “We have one called 500 Gold that’s the cheapest one at $79. That’s for 0.0222 percent ownership. Right? That gets you first dibs on the next Royce Da 5’9 drop which is the next NFT drop. And then it gives you access to the collector channel.

“Then you have the 250 Platinum at $299 and that’s 0.0884 percent ownership. You get exclusive content first dibs on the next drop. And then three the Diamond one is $1999 at 0.5915 percent ownership per token. With that you get an in-person writing session with me at my studio Heaven which hasn’t been open to the public yet. So that’s very exclusive within itself. Then there’s limited edition autographed vinyl. Obviously first dibs on the next drop and access to the Royal collector channel and some exclusive content which I’m not even saying what that’s going to even be yet because it’s going to be some exciting shit.”

Royce admitted he’s still learning about the cryptocurrency space but getting fantastic guidance from the people at Royal. Evidently it was a smart move for the company too — “Caterpillar” sold out in 30 minutes.

“I’m learning as I go” he said. “I’m not stepping into this space claiming to be an expert. I hate when people do that. I hate when people come into the rap space act like that they’re expert lyricists. Like that shit offends me a little bit. It’s the same in the sneakerhead world. It’s the same in professional sports. It’s the same with acting. Rappers trying to be actors. The Samuel L. Jacksons of the world start to speak out.”

But as Royce Da 5’9 explained he didn’t enter the partnership looking for a “get-rich-quick scheme” — it’s not about money for him. In fact he has Nas to thank for the inspiration.

AD AD LOADING... AD

“I’ve seen Nas do it” he said. “Nas was one of my fucking idols. I seen him do it and it was exciting just as a fan. Like when I seen him do that that was one of the first fan moments that I had in a very long time. I just thought ‘Wow.’ He did it with one of his last albums. He’s leading away because normally these types of activations are done by record labels and companies that buy up everybody’s masters.

“It’s normally done by those types of companies. So when you see it done by an actual artist with their own music and having a free rein to play ball with their own music however I just think it sets a very positive tone for the creators.”

Nas announced his Royal partnership in January with the songs “Ultra Black” and “Rare” from 2020’s King’s Disease and its 2021 sequel. With prolific Hip Hop artists such as Nas blazing the trail Royce is hoping even more will follow suit.

“If you have the right situation if you can still control the master you can still play ball with labels” he said. “They still have a place. They can participate in stuff too but they don’t have to own everything. And that’s the thing that I want the youngins to realize. They don’t have to own everything but if it’s moving properly there’s a space for them to be in. There’s a degree in which you can be embed with them where they’re still happy. But if you create it it should be yours.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29sdW1uaXN0L2FydGljbGUvUm9iZXJ0LU1pbGxlci1XaHktQ1QtdHJlZXMtbWF5LWdldC1hLWJyZWFrLWZyb20tMTcyNzY3MzAucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Miller: Why CT trees may get a break from the hungry spongy moth caterpillars,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ctinsider.com/columnist/article/Robert-Miller-Why-CT-trees-may-get-a-break-from-17276730.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29sdW1uaXN0L2FydGljbGUvUm9iZXJ0LU1pbGxlci1XaHktQ1QtdHJlZXMtbWF5LWdldC1hLWJyZWFrLWZyb20tMTcyNzY3MzAucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2NhdGVycGlsbGFyLXRvLWNob2NvbGF0ZS1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2FuLWNoZW1pY2FsLWVuZ2luZWVyLXR1cm5pbmctaW5zZWN0cy1pbnRvLXNuYWNrcy00OTQxMzHSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy53aW9uZXdzLmNvbS93b3JsZC9jYXRlcnBpbGxhci10by1jaG9jb2xhdGUtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhbi1jaGVtaWNhbC1lbmdpbmVlci10dXJuaW5nLWluc2VjdHMtaW50by1zbmFja3MtNDk0MTMxL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caterpillar to chocolate: South African chemical engineer turning insects into snacks,"South African chemical engineer Wendy Vesela has found ways of turning the spiky green and black caterpillars -- which are packed with protein and iron -- into flour that can be used in savoury biscuits and sweet chocolate protein bars cereals or smoothies. He wants to change the way edible caterpillars popularly known as ""mopane worms"" are viewed and eaten.

For many people particularly from western European backgrounds the idea of eating insects is still riddled with fear and inhibition. But they can be a valuable source of nutrition and farming them is not detrimental to the environment. When steamed and sliced mopane pieces can also be used as pizza toppings.

Vesela says she has found domestic and international customers for her organic products. Edible insects and worms may indeed be gaining popularity in Western cultures. But food anthropologist Anna Trapido insists that the trend should not be seen as just another dietary fad a ""kind of adventure tourism where you get a badge"" for eating them.

""Mopane needs to be treated with respect because they are part of people's emotional spiritual culinary genres"" she said.

Vesela tried to woo reluctant customers with biscuits and protein bars at a recent food fair in Johannesburg's upmarket Sandton district as reported by AFP.

""I won't eat a worm. I'm sorry it's disgusting. But if you give it to me in the form of chocolate... it's really delicious"" said Gail Odendaal 38 walking away with a bag of protein bars.

Mopanes are environmentally friendly too requiring no extra water or land as they breed and feed on mopane trees which grow in hot and dry regions of southern Africa.

They are a better source of protein than many other foods on the market said dietitian Mpho Tshukudu.

American-Statesman Correspondent

I grew up in a fishing world — hunting too to be honest — that was seriously focused on bringing home something to eat.

People ran trotlines on the river and filled up ice chests with as many fish as they could hold and I never saw a fish fillet that didn’t come out of a box until I was out of college and fishing alone on Lake Livingston.

Because things were so heavily weighted toward catching lots of fish and taking them home there were bait houses in town out on the water and even along the highway. People raised their own red wigglers picked up nightcrawlers after it rained and raided webs and wasp nests for caterpillars and larvae.

Leggett:Texas hunting and fishing legend Murry Burnham remembered for his dedication to animals

I can remember more than one clapboard Panola County house that burned down when people tried to burn out a big old wasp nest that was hanging under the eaves of the building. Folks used to wrap an old rag around the end of a cane pole and poke it up against those giant nests to force the adult wasps away so they could raid the larvae out of the nest.

And the first time my granddad stopped and bought a bucket of redfin minnows at a bait shop/gas station/country grocery store at River Hill in Panola County I couldn’t wait to stick a gold hook through the back of one of them and catch some big old white perch. We called crappies white perch.

But the top of the line fish bait good for big bream catfish on a trotline or goggle eye in a slough off the river had to be catalpa worms. Country folk bastardized that into “catava worms” but that didn’t change their effectiveness.

The worms are actually the caterpillar form of the catalpa sphinx moth and they grow in a huge web well up into the tree usually starting in mid-June and running into early July. That would mean they’re growing now if you happen to have access to a tree and can get them out of the web and into a bait box.

Old-timers always placed the worms in neat layers covered in corn meal and placed them in the freezer. Then all it took was to haul them out and rig them up. The worms would thaw out on the way to the lake or pond and you just worked them up onto a hook and dropped them into lake spots.

Leggett:More animal species have contracted COVID recently. What does this mean for humans?

The first fish I caught on a catalpa worm was a really nice goggle eye that grabbed the worm the instant I dropped it down against the trunk of a sweet gum tree that was standing in shallow water in a private lake I was fishing. He gave me a good old time before I could land him on the rotted old cane pole I was using.

After that I went tree to tree along the banks of that lake without catching a single other fish. That was OK though because that was one of my dad’s favorite fish to eat and he got a kick out of it when we brought it home. Nearly too big to scale and fry whole I remember chowing down on that fish since I got first dibs having caught it myself.

If you can find a catalpa tree around your neighborhood it would be worth it to ask your neighbors for the right to pull down any webs you see up in the tree and save those caterpillars for your next fishing trip.

Maybe go to Lady Bird Lake or Lake Austin both home to some pretty good bream fishing or Fayette County Lake where there are good bream beds in the shallow water between the shoreline and the grass beds that grow around the lake.

You’ll be glad you did.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbXVkZHlyaXZlcm5ld3MuY29tL25vdGV3b3J0aHkvYWx0b3JmZXItcmVudHMtb3BlbnMtZmFjaWxpdHktaW4tcXVpbmN5LWF0LTY2MDEtYnJvYWR3YXkvMjAyMjA3MDIxMzAwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Altorfer Rents opens facility in Quincy at 6601 Broadway – Muddy River News,"CEDAR RAPIDS Iowa – Altorfer Rents the Cat rental store recently opened two full-service locations.

LOUIS — Big windows. White floors. Technology galore.

The atrium at downtown St. Louis’ 100 North Broadway has plush seating an outdoor patio and soon a café that beckons the office tower’s tenants to stay awhile. The conference rooms come with built-in microphones and cameras for virtual meetings. The owner Larson Capital Management invested $16 million in upgrades hiring its own tenant architecture firm Trivers to lead the redesign.

“For about 10 years this was completely underutilized” said Trivers Principal Joe Brinkmann. “Nothing was happening.”

The investment is already paying dividends: Housing giant McCormack Baron Salazar recently moved to the tower after years at another building just a few blocks away trading size for quality.

The coronavirus pandemic left companies across the country rethinking the traditional office. Some downsized expecting a portion of their workforce happy to work from home would never return to a cubicle. Others decided they had to improve their offices to entice employees back into the building. And that all means landlords with space on their hands and concerns for future demand are shelling out big bucks to upgrade their buildings.

Here companies like agriculture and pharmaceutical giant Bayer footwear brand Caleres and managed health care provider Centene Corp. are ditching big footprints.

“They’re certainly not outliers” said Jim Loft executive vice president of Gershman Commercial Real Estate. “But at the same time these companies are putting a value in having good quality office space and they’re making a significant investment in it.”

Caleres is selling its Clayton headquarters to a developer that will remake the site into an office tower with retail and a commercial fitness center. The shoe company will have less space but more amenities.

Centene said it would cut 65% of its office space nationwide.

And more recently bakery-café chain Panera Bread Co. announced it would leave its longtime Sunset Hills headquarters for a smaller office in Fenton at the 1400 Building once the south campus of corporate incentive company Maritz.

“It was sort of a ‘build it and they will come’ approach” said Mark Alspaw Maritz’ vice president of real estate and property services.

A competition for tenants

Maritz consolidated employees to the north campus around 2018. It renovated the 400000-square-foot south campus upgrading the technology there and adding amenities like a new fitness area with yoga studio. The 1400 Building is now 76% occupied despite not being in a prime office market for companies. Alspaw credits that to the amenity-rich campus and its position along Interstate 44.

In Clayton the metro area’s top office market older buildings are facing competition from new construction like the 1 million-square-foot twin towers at Forsyth Pointe which should see tenants move in by the end of the year. U.S. Capital Development is adding amenities like a rooftop garden terrace and juice bar training and conference areas and touchless technology.

It’s also counting Shaw Park just steps away as an amenity and designed the development without columns to maximize views of the park said Managing Partner Scott Haley. It’s already scored as tenants Commerce Bank the law firm Husch Blackwell and packaging supplier Barry-Wehmiller Cos. among other top companies.

The new construction prompted the owner of the nearby Plaza in Clayton Chicago-based Franklin Partners to transform the fifth and six floors packing them with upgrades after losing Husch Blackwell.

And Los Angeles-based real estate investment firm Tryperion Holdings which has owned and managed about 1 million square feet of office space in St. Louis recently wrapped up renovations at Shaw Park Plaza the Clayton high-rise that overlooks its namesake with a new fitness center lounge and conference rooms.

“It’s an amenities arms race right now” CEO Jeffrey Karsh said. “The buildings that are seeing success in leasing are well-amenitized with either the amenities inside the building or outside that are walkable: retail fitness lunch options.”

So intense is the race that even owners of what the commercial real estate industry considers to be Class B and Class C offices those that lack high-end amenities and feature outdated finishes are feeling pressured to make upgrades. These owners could previously compete on price alone — offering no frills translated to a lower rental rate. But now more and more tenants are expecting amenities. Inflation and the rising cost of construction aren’t making it easier experts said.

“The inability to modernize … you’re going to get left behind” said David Kelpe senior vice president of CBRE in St. Louis. “St. Louis has a lot of older buildings and a lot of investment is going to be required.”

Not every owner will have what it takes to survive.

“There are some buildings whose owners will give up and cede them to the lender” Karsh said. “Then it’ll be the lender’s problem.”

Still holding on to office space

It’s unclear how much of that the St. Louis region will experience. Loft the VP at Gershman said the metro area has traditionally been conservative on new construction and has never been overbuilt.

And ditching the office altogether is unlikely for most companies. A national survey from CBRE found that more than a third of companies are transitioning back to the office now and that an overwhelming majority want employees back at least half the time.

Financial services firm Block formerly known as Square touts a hybrid work model allows employees to work wherever they want and just declined to renew its lease at its San Francisco headquarters. But it is not dumping the office altogether: It still has space there and across the country including its newly refurbished building on North Tucker Boulevard in St. Louis.

Financial planning firm Moneta Group recently expanded its Shaw Park Plaza footprint by an additional 27000 square feet. The company chairman and CEO Eric Kittner said has continued to hire up to 40 new employees annually and now tops out at around 425 locally.

A hybrid working model is the new normal he said but a majority still spend a significant amount of time in the Clayton office.

“We like to meet with clients in person when possible because you see body language that doesn’t translate as well virtually” Kittner said. “We want to be efficient where we can but we really want to be effective and sometimes being effective means that we need to be in person.”

McCormack Baron maintains a hybrid model at its new smaller office at 100 North Broadway in downtown St. Louis — changes brought on because of the pandemic.

“The building was already under renovation so we were able to create a new vision for our workplace” the company said in an email. “The owner and architects did a terrific job. The bright atrium that serves as a central gathering space is a real highlight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9jb21wYW5pZXMtbmV3cy9hbHNoYXlhLWdyb3VwLXNlbGVjdHMtYWxzYXlhaC1zcXVhcmUtdG8tb3Blbi1pdHMtZmlyc3Qtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWRyaXZlLXRocnUtdW5pdC1pbi1tdWhhcnJhcS10d2c3ZDRxetIBoQFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9jb21wYW5pZXMtbmV3cy9hbHNoYXlhLWdyb3VwLXNlbGVjdHMtYWxzYXlhaC1zcXVhcmUtdG8tb3Blbi1pdHMtZmlyc3Qtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWRyaXZlLXRocnUtdW5pdC1pbi1tdWhhcnJhcS10d2c3ZDRxej9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alshaya Group selects Alsayah Square to open its first Starbucks Drive Thru unit in Muharraq,"A partnership was signed between Alshaya Group and Alsayah Square to host a new Starbucks branch in the centre of the commercial and medical area in Busaiteen at Alsayah Square development.

Un “patto” innovativo che ha visto protagonista la multinazionale del settore chimico con sede a Forlì e i residenti della popolosa zona della città. Tutto nasce dal “volontariato d’impresa” progetti nei quali diverse aziende incoraggiano direttamente i dipendenti a partecipare ad attività che si possono realizzare durante l’orario di lavoro e che vedono l’impresa nella veste di “motore” della solidarietà. Ecco quindi che una decina di dipendenti della “Celanese” grazie alla collaborazione con Comune e Alea si è armato insieme ai volontari dei quartieri di tutto l’occorrente per raccogliere rifiuti abbandonati e tutto quanto poteva creare degrado negli spazi pubblici dei Romiti. Per due giornate i dipendenti-volontari della ditta con partenza dall’area verde “Maria Cristina Gori” hanno setacciato l’ambiente circostante ripulendo tutta la zona muniti di attrezzatura (guanti pinze raccoglitrici palette e contenitori appositi dedicati per la raccolta differenziata).

I partecipanti sono stati impegnati anche nell’attento lavoro di separazione della carta della plastica del vetro e del secco in ossequio allo spirito e ai principi di una raccolta differenziata e consapevole. «Il fenomeno degli abbandoni è un problema sempre più ampio che oggi crea disagio per il decoro urbano ma anche soprattutto per l’inquinamento ambientale specialmente le microplastiche responsabili dell’inquinamento dei mari – ricorda Stefano Valmori coordinatore del comitato di quartiere dei Romiti –. Gettare rifiuti a terra significa immettere nell’ambiente un oggetto che vi rimarrà dai 3 mesi se è carta ad un secolo se di plastica con un impatto che deve tener conto che in Italia la plastica non raccolta raggiunge le 500.000 tonnellate ogni anno».",,,,,,,,,,,,

LOUIS — Big windows. White floors. Technology galore.

The atrium at downtown St. Louis’ 100 North Broadway has plush seating an outdoor patio and soon a café that beckons the office tower’s tenants to stay awhile. The conference rooms come with built-in microphones and cameras for virtual meetings. The owner Larson Capital Management invested $16 million in upgrades hiring its own tenant architecture firm Trivers to lead the redesign.

“For about 10 years this was completely underutilized” said Trivers Principal Joe Brinkmann. “Nothing was happening.”

The investment is already paying dividends: Housing giant McCormack Baron Salazar recently moved to the tower after years at another building just a few blocks away trading size for quality.

The coronavirus pandemic left companies across the country rethinking the traditional office. Some downsized expecting a portion of their workforce happy to work from home would never return to a cubicle. Others decided they had to improve their offices to entice employees back into the building. And that all means landlords with space on their hands and concerns for future demand are shelling out big bucks to upgrade their buildings.

Here companies like agriculture and pharmaceutical giant Bayer footwear brand Caleres and managed health care provider Centene Corp. are ditching big footprints.

“They’re certainly not outliers” said Jim Loft executive vice president of Gershman Commercial Real Estate. “But at the same time these companies are putting a value in having good quality office space and they’re making a significant investment in it.”

Caleres is selling its Clayton headquarters to a developer that will remake the site into an office tower with retail and a commercial fitness center. The shoe company will have less space but more amenities.

Centene said it would cut 65% of its office space nationwide.

And more recently bakery-café chain Panera Bread Co. announced it would leave its longtime Sunset Hills headquarters for a smaller office in Fenton at the 1400 Building once the south campus of corporate incentive company Maritz.

“It was sort of a ‘build it and they will come’ approach” said Mark Alspaw Maritz’ vice president of real estate and property services.

A competition for tenants

Maritz consolidated employees to the north campus around 2018. It renovated the 400000-square-foot south campus upgrading the technology there and adding amenities like a new fitness area with yoga studio. The 1400 Building is now 76% occupied despite not being in a prime office market for companies. Alspaw credits that to the amenity-rich campus and its position along Interstate 44.

In Clayton the metro area’s top office market older buildings are facing competition from new construction like the 1 million-square-foot twin towers at Forsyth Pointe which should see tenants move in by the end of the year. U.S. Capital Development is adding amenities like a rooftop garden terrace and juice bar training and conference areas and touchless technology.

It’s also counting Shaw Park just steps away as an amenity and designed the development without columns to maximize views of the park said Managing Partner Scott Haley. It’s already scored as tenants Commerce Bank the law firm Husch Blackwell and packaging supplier Barry-Wehmiller Cos. among other top companies.

The new construction prompted the owner of the nearby Plaza in Clayton Chicago-based Franklin Partners to transform the fifth and six floors packing them with upgrades after losing Husch Blackwell.

And Los Angeles-based real estate investment firm Tryperion Holdings which has owned and managed about 1 million square feet of office space in St. Louis recently wrapped up renovations at Shaw Park Plaza the Clayton high-rise that overlooks its namesake with a new fitness center lounge and conference rooms.

“It’s an amenities arms race right now” CEO Jeffrey Karsh said. “The buildings that are seeing success in leasing are well-amenitized with either the amenities inside the building or outside that are walkable: retail fitness lunch options.”

So intense is the race that even owners of what the commercial real estate industry considers to be Class B and Class C offices those that lack high-end amenities and feature outdated finishes are feeling pressured to make upgrades. These owners could previously compete on price alone — offering no frills translated to a lower rental rate. But now more and more tenants are expecting amenities. Inflation and the rising cost of construction aren’t making it easier experts said.

“The inability to modernize … you’re going to get left behind” said David Kelpe senior vice president of CBRE in St. Louis. “St. Louis has a lot of older buildings and a lot of investment is going to be required.”

Not every owner will have what it takes to survive.

“There are some buildings whose owners will give up and cede them to the lender” Karsh said. “Then it’ll be the lender’s problem.”

Still holding on to office space

It’s unclear how much of that the St. Louis region will experience. Loft the VP at Gershman said the metro area has traditionally been conservative on new construction and has never been overbuilt.

And ditching the office altogether is unlikely for most companies. A national survey from CBRE found that more than a third of companies are transitioning back to the office now and that an overwhelming majority want employees back at least half the time.

Financial services firm Block formerly known as Square touts a hybrid work model allows employees to work wherever they want and just declined to renew its lease at its San Francisco headquarters. But it is not dumping the office altogether: It still has space there and across the country including its newly refurbished building on North Tucker Boulevard in St. Louis.

Financial planning firm Moneta Group recently expanded its Shaw Park Plaza footprint by an additional 27000 square feet. The company chairman and CEO Eric Kittner said has continued to hire up to 40 new employees annually and now tops out at around 425 locally.

A hybrid working model is the new normal he said but a majority still spend a significant amount of time in the Clayton office.

“We like to meet with clients in person when possible because you see body language that doesn’t translate as well virtually” Kittner said. “We want to be efficient where we can but we really want to be effective and sometimes being effective means that we need to be in person.”

McCormack Baron maintains a hybrid model at its new smaller office at 100 North Broadway in downtown St. Louis — changes brought on because of the pandemic.

“The building was already under renovation so we were able to create a new vision for our workplace” the company said in an email. “The owner and architects did a terrific job. The bright atrium that serves as a central gathering space is a real highlight.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

A group of UK investors backed by former Army chief Lord Dannatt has been holding talks with US giant CF Industries about buying the Ince plant in Cheshire for the last six months. It has been seeking assurances from the Government to help smooth a path to the deal but has so far been unsuccessful.

The Ince plant is one of only two fertiliser factories in Britain and is a key supplier of carbon dioxide a byproduct of fertiliser production to industry. CO2 is used in everything from surgical operations and meat processing.

CF Industries last month announced plans to shut the Ince plant in August leaving the consortium called UK Nitrogen just weeks to secure a deal. The group plans to approach the Prime Minister through an intermediary this week to directly lobby for support.

A spokesman for UK Nitrogen said: ""We are asking about some of the environmental and gas issues with the plant. You would need quick action on those given the timescales.

""We are not asking for any taxpayer money at all we just need help facilitating some environmental hurdles. Also this would be a non-runner without its people.

""These facilities are extremely important and we feel they should be under UK management and UK ownership.""

A permanent shutdown of Ince could weaken Britain's food supply chain and pose a risk to key supplies of CO2.

The National Farmers Union the Agricultural Industries Confederation and the British Meat Processors Association have all warned that the Ince plant's closure could leave the farming industry overly reliant on one fertiliser factory in Billingham Teeside for domestic supplies.

It is understood the UK Nitrogen consortium first launched early stage discussions about a takeover in January but have so far been rebuffed by the company.

The consortium has asked the Government to provide assurances about the supply of gas to the facility as well as help with the carbon taxes which could help unlock negotiations.

The Government provided a multi-million pound subsidy to CF Industries to keep the Billingham factory open in September over fears about a lack of supply of carbon dioxide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDk3NTcyNS9FeC1Bcm15LWNoaWVmLUxvcmQtRGFubmF0dC1haW1zLWJ1eS1DTzItZmFjdG9yeS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpc2lzbW9uZXkuY28udWsvbW9uZXkvbWFya2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwOTc1NzI1L2FtcC9FeC1Bcm15LWNoaWVmLUxvcmQtRGFubmF0dC1haW1zLWJ1eS1DTzItZmFjdG9yeS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Army chief Lord Dannatt aims to buy CO2 factory,"The former head of the Army Lord Dannatt is spearheading an audacious plan to snap up a crucial manufacturing plant closed by its US owner.

Plan: Lord Dannatt is fronting a group of UK-based investors to acquire CF Industries' factory in Ince Cheshire

CF Industries produces 60 per cent of Britain's CO2 supplies as a by-product of agricultural fertiliser production.

The gas is crucial in packing and preserving fresh food and salads. A threat to permanently close Ince and its sister factory at Billingham Teesside in October last year forced Ministers to intervene with a bailout worth tens of millions of pounds.

But CF Industries announced the permanent closure of its Ince plant last month blaming cost pressures. It will channel all its UK production through Teesside.

A spokesman for Dannatt said talks are at a 'sensitive stage'.

CF Industries said it has 'spoken with several parties' but discussions have not yet 'appeared likely' to secure the plant's future.",,,,,,,,,

“Most immediately motor carriers must evaluate and adopt alternative operating models to mitigate risk if they intend to continue to do business in California” was the admonition from the Benesch law firm in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in the case of California Trucking Association vs. (state Attorney General) Bonta. The decision opens the door for the imposition of AB5 the law on independent contractors that leans heavily toward classifying workers as employees rather than ICs.

“Motor carriers should immediately evaluate their California operations to determine what steps if any should be taken to respond to the changed backdrop for trucking” was the call to action from the trucking-focused Scopelitis law firm.

On the other side of the divide there was celebration including a victory lap by Lorena Gonzalez the former and future labor leader who successfully pushed for AB5’s passage in the California legislature in 2019.

The fact that trucking companies will have to abide by basic labor laws in CA takes us one step closer to rebuilding the middle class that was almost deregulated out of existence. Proud of my @Teamsters union #defendingDynamex hasn’t been easy… but nothing good ever is. #AB5 — Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher (@LorenaSGonzalez) June 30 2022

“The fact that trucking companies will have to abide by basic labor laws in CA takes us one step closer to rebuilding the middle class that was almost deregulated out of existence” Gonzalez said in a tweet.

In denying a review of the appellate court decision the Supreme Court returned the case to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A 9th Circuit ruling in 2021 overturned a lower court injunction that had kept AB5 at bay from California’s trucking sector even as the law that seeks to define independent contractors was implemented in other parts of the economy.

The original injunction from the lower court was based on its conclusion that AB5 was in conflict with provisions in the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (F4A). Attorneys for the trucking industry were heartened when the court agreed to consider questions of state preemption of F4A including looking at a case involving C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW). But ultimately the court failed to take up both the CTA and C.H. Robinson cases.

The appellate court had allowed the injunction against the law to remain in effect while the CTA pushed to have the Supreme Court hear its appeal. With that denied the stay is expected to be lifted within days and AB5 will go into effect retroactively to Jan. 1 2020. That creates the prospect of litigation or state action for past actions.





A mixed bag of earlier exemptions

The implementation of AB5 throughout the California economy in 2020 came with a Swiss cheese lineup of exemptions both in the original bill and in AB 2257 which sought to address the concerns of sectors that said they had been particularly hard-hit by AB5.

Among the exempted professions: doctors dentists and hairstylists. Among those exempted in the second bill: translators (who were particularly vocal about the damage to their industry under AB5) youth sports coaches and insurance inspectors.

Critics of AB5 have held that the lengthy seemingly random list of exemptions was evidence that AB5 was largely targeting two sectors: trucking and gig drivers such as those at Uber Lyft and with parcel services. So far that latter group has not come under AB5 because of voter approval of Proposition 22 on Election Day 2020 though a court later ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional. That court decision is on appeal and a stay has allowed gig drivers protected by Prop 22 to remain outside the control of AB5.

AB5 is particularly problematic for the trucking sector. That’s because it is based on the ABC test to define independent contractors the B prong of which is being interpreted as a possible death knell or at least a major hindrance to the independent owner-operator model in trucking.

The B test defines an independent contractor as a worker who is engaged in “work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business.” A trucking company hiring an independent owner-operator to move freight is seen as likely in violation of the B prong.

Unions eye drayage drivers as an opportunity

The question now turns to what the trucking industry does specifically in response to the hard reality that AB5 has arrived on the doorstep.

From the organized labor side recommendations on how trucking companies should proceed include turning drivers into employees.

“If I was advising the trucking sector I would be getting ready for AB5 to be the law of the land in California and for the state to begin enforcing it” Doug Bloch political director for Teamsters Joint Council 7 which represents the union in Northern California and northern Nevada told FreightWaves.





Bloch said the Teamsters “recognizes there are legitimate owner-operators out there in trucking.” But he pivoted when discussing trucking to a specific part of the trucking ecosystem: drayage drivers.

“In places like the ports the state has found misclassification to be the norm” Bloch said. Drayage drivers should now be “looking at where I am going to end up working” he said predicting that port companies that now utilize the services of independent drayage drivers will turn to an employee model.

Bloch said the Teamsters ran a campaign “a decade ago” that was successful in converting some drayage companies to an employee model rather than one utilizing independent owner-operators.

“That is our goal to have owner-operators hired as drivers” Bloch said. “Our goal is for the shipping industry to take responsibility for these drivers.” If the workers are converted to employees he said it will be easier for them to be paid an amount that reflect at least the minimum wage and it would push the responsibility for buying new zero-emission vehicles on to the port companies rather than on to the drivers. “We’ll be asking fleet owners to do this” Bloch said.

Given the state’s focus on regulatory issues surrounding the ports it is reasonable to think actions by California under AB5 might first arrive in the drayage industry.

Matt Schrap the CEO of the Harbor Trucking Association which represents drayage companies issued a brief but harsh statement in response to the high court’s decision.

“It is extremely unfortunate that this Court couldn’t see through their own political agenda to identify the obvious preemption that exists under the F4A” he wrote in an email to FreightWaves. “This ruling will have far reaching impacts that will upend the industry as we know it. Tens of thousands of truck drivers will be driven out of established business relationships within a week. No doubt this will further stress the supply chain.”

Bloch was asked what would be the impact on freight movement in lanes away from the ports — specifically an example in which an independent owner-operator moves freight between Riverside County outside of Los Angeles and Northern California. What might that person’s legal status become?

“It’s a good question” he said. But he came back to the issue of misclassification. “I don’t really care what sector of the trucking industry you’re in I would be concerned about misclassification.”

Bloch added that “what we’ve seen is that every time the laws change the industry finds some way to adapt.”

CTA issues blistering statement

Not surprisingly the statement issued by the CTA after the SCOTUS non-action held little back.

“Gasoline has been poured on the fire that is our ongoing supply chain crisis” the organization said. “In addition to the direct impact on California’s 70000 owner-operators who have seven days to cease long-standing independent businesses the impact of taking tens of thousands of truck drivers off the road will have devastating repercussions on an already fragile supply chain increasing costs and worsening runaway inflation.”

Existing trucking company models may need to change

In a note Marc Blubaugh of the Benesch law firm sent to clients he discussed several alternatives to the traditional model.

One is an employee driver model along the lines of what union officials would like to see. Another is largely turning a carrier that now utilizes independent owner-operators into a brokerage house and putting freight in the drivers’ hands in the same way that a traditional brokerage would do. Since freight movement would no longer be part of the company’s activity the independent owner-operators would be engaged in “work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business” the specific wording in the B prong.

Blubaugh did not mention it but AB5 came with the business-to-business exception a multipronged test that must be fully met to legally hire an independent contractor who might otherwise violate the ABC test. There is disagreement in the industry about whether the exception’s rigorous tests and need for 100% compliance make it largely unworkable.

Greg Feary a partner with the Scopelitis law firm said Thursday he already had discussions with clients who are “starting to take action. You are going to see the trucking industry respond to this relatively rapidly.”

He said there was a “laundry list of options on the table.” Some of them are extreme like halting all business in California particularly if it’s a relatively small part of a company’s business. “Why take the risk?” Feary said.

A push by a company to bring on more employee drivers might come into conflict with what Feary said was the “conventional wisdom … that most of these independent contractors don’t want to be employee drivers.”

The brokerage option as discussed by Feary would involve drivers who are now independent but are leased to a company and operating under their DOT authority would obtain their own authority. The company they are leased to would then broker freight to that driver.

“For me motor carriers are going to have to be making decisions and review all of the potential options” Feary said.

Action by the state might come quickly Feary said. The state agencies most likely to bring legal action for what are seen as violations of AB5 would be the state Division of Labor Standards Enforcement or the state’s Employment Development Department.

In the U.S. overall it takes a net worth of $2.2 million to be considered ""wealthy"" by other Americans — up from $1.9 million last year according to financial services company Charles Schwab's annual Modern Wealth Survey.

However if you want to be considered rich by residents of large metropolitan areas it will require even more wealth.

In San Francisco the threshold for what's considered wealthy is a net worth of $5.1 million. That's the highest total in the survey which examined 12 of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country.

To be considered ""financially comfortable"" a San Francisco resident would need a net worth of at least $1.7 million the survey finds.

Here's a look at what it takes to be considered wealthy by city in 2022 as ranked by net worth thresholds:

San Francisco: $5.1 million Southern California (includes Los Angeles and San Diego): $3.9 million New York City: $3.4 million Washington D.C.: $3.3 million Seattle: $3.2 million Phoenix: $2.7 million Boston: $2.7 million Dallas: $2.6 million Houston: $2.6 million Atlanta: $2.5 million Chicago: $2.5 million Denver: $2.3 million

The online survey was conducted in early February with a sample of 500 to 750 local residents for each metropolitan area between the ages of 21 and 75.

Net worth is a measure of the value of the assets a person or corporation owns minus the liabilities they owe.

For every trade Robinhood facilitates it needs to have sufficient reserves posted as collateral for the two days it takes for trades to settle. The problem was that Robinhood only had $700 million for collateral—it was short $3 billion and had just a few hours to get the rest of the money.

Retail traders were using the app to buy up tons of volatile meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment boosting their prices in attempted short squeezes—which meant Robinhood had to post commensurate amounts of collateral to stay solvent until those trades settled.

In the hours between the clearing house’s notice—first sent at 5:11 am US eastern time—and the 10 am deadline for the margin call Robinhood executives pressed the clearing house for leniency and simultaneously tried to raise money.

The lobbying and fundraising efforts worked. The company also abruptly halted trading on volatile stocks like GameStop for the day which limited its own immediate risk but prompted an uproar from its customers and a congressional hearing and investigation.

Last week more than a year after the GameStop short squeeze was front-page news the US House Financial Services Committee’s Democratic staff released the results of its investigation (pdf) showing exactly how Robinhood averted financial disaster on a day when it should have gone under.

If you have bought or sold a stock in recent years and weren’t charged by your broker to do so you probably have Robinhood to thank. Robinhood pioneered no-commission securities trading through a business model called payment for order flow (PFOF). The company’s popularity with retail investors forced established brokers like Fidelity and Charles Schwab to eliminate trading commissions in 2019.

Robinhood doesn’t actually execute trades for its customers. Rather it sells its customers’ orders to so-called market makers like Citadel Securities and Two Sigma Securities who vie to complete those orders.

Still Robinhood has to post collateral for its customers’ trades to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) which is a division of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) the largest securities clearing house in the US. The DTCC is a private company that is heavily regulated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

A phone call and a fundraising round

At 7:15 am on the day of the margin call Dan Gallagher Robinhood’s chief legal officer placed a phone call to an unnamed deputy general counsel at the DTCC according to the House investigation. Gallagher is a former Republican commissioner of the SEC the primary regulator of the DTCC. He and the DTCC official were “professionally acquainted” the report says noting the two previously worked together at a law firm. On the call Gallagher asked to escalate the matter to senior DTCC officials “to discuss how to obtain relief waiver or an exemption.”

By 9:11 am and after several more phone calls between Robinhood and DTCC officials Robinhood’s collateral deposit requirements were reduced from $3.7 billion to $1.4 billion still leaving the firm $700 million short.

The justification for granting billions of dollars in waivers wasn’t explained. According to the report the DTCC’s market risk director “conveyed that Robinhood’s Excess Capital Premium charge was being reviewed for downward adjustment without commenting on why it was being reviewed or what would qualify Robinhood for a downward adjustment.”

While Gallagher was negotiating with the DTCC Robinhood chief financial officer Jason Warnick was calling up investors. By the 10 am deadline Warnick had secured $1 billion in new investment. It kept fundraising after the Jan. 28 deadline. By Jan. 30 the company had raised a total of $3.5 billion.

Without this dual-pronged approach Robinhood would have defaulted to the DTCC like Lehman Brothers did during the 2008 financial crisis. When a default happens the clearing house “assumes control of the defaulted member’s portfolio and liquidates it” the report says to reduce risk to the broader financial system.

Robinhood’s unlikely survival

That Robinhood was able to get out of this debacle was nothing short of a miracle says Tyler Gellasch executive director of the Healthy Markets Association an investor trade group and a former Senate and SEC lawyer.

“It is the equivalent of a four-engine plane losing all four engines at 30000 feet and landing safely” Gellasch says.

Gellasch is critical of the risk management shortcomings that contributed to Robinhood’s troubles. He chalks up the firm’s survival to its political savvy. “This shows the power of having an extraordinarily politically connected executive on your team” he said.

Robinhood’s failure could have had serious consequences for the broader financial system too.

“There isn’t really a precedent for a firm like Robinhood to fail” Gellasch says. “The sudden collapse of a broker-dealer with millions of accounts could very easily have been the spark that ignited a broader market disruption.”

James Tierney a securities law professor at University of Nebraska College of Law and a former SEC lawyer says that while defaulting is a big threat to small brokers Robinhood appeared confident that it was in a sense too big to fail.

“It reminds me of the old saying ‘If you owe the bank a million bucks that’s your problem but if you owe the bank a billion bucks that’s their problem’” he says.

In one internal message obtained by the Congressional committee Robinhood president and COO David Dusseault told a colleague that the company would be able to navigate the clearing house’s requirements. “We are to [sic] big for them to actually shut us down” he wrote.

In an email to Quartz through a spokesperson Robinhood deputy general counsel Lucas Moskowitz says the House committee investigation report is “nothing new once again confirming that January 2021 was an extraordinary once in a generation event that stressed every stakeholder in the market.”

Six months later in July 2021 Robinhood went public raising another nearly $2 billion for its coffers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmbGEuY29tL25leHN0YXItbmV3cy13aXJlL3RoZXNlLWNvbXBhbmllcy1sZWZ0LWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtZm9yLXRleGFzLWR1cmluZy10aGUtcGFuZGVtaWMvYW1wL9IBaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmbGEuY29tL25leHN0YXItbmV3cy13aXJlL3RoZXNlLWNvbXBhbmllcy1sZWZ0LWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtZm9yLXRleGFzLWR1cmluZy10aGUtcGFuZGVtaWMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These companies left California for Texas during the pandemic,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wfla.com/nexstar-news-wire/these-companies-left-california-for-texas-during-the-pandemic/amp/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmbGEuY29tL25leHN0YXItbmV3cy13aXJlL3RoZXNlLWNvbXBhbmllcy1sZWZ0LWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtZm9yLXRleGFzLWR1cmluZy10aGUtcGFuZGVtaWMvYW1wL9IBaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmbGEuY29tL25leHN0YXItbmV3cy13aXJlL3RoZXNlLWNvbXBhbmllcy1sZWZ0LWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtZm9yLXRleGFzLWR1cmluZy10aGUtcGFuZGVtaWMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Assessments of the US major’s North American assets included in a pilot project announced in February have earned Project Canary’s highest certification ratings for operational and environmental performance. Eighty-two wells achieved “platinum” status and three wells receiving “gold” status based on continuous monitoring of its methane emissions Chevron announced.

Gas produced by these wells can be marketed now as RSG-certified a goal that Chevron wants to achieve in the second half of 2022. For natural gas to be sold as RSG methane emissions must be continuously monitored and certified by a third party.

Chevron’s pilot project with Canary targets well-by-well certification at two sites in the Midland Basin in Texas and three sites in Chevron’s Mustang Development Area of the DJ Basin in Colorado. Natural gas produced at these five sites totals approximately 80 Mcf/D.

Project Canary’s TrustWell Certification program reviews and analyzes its clients’ operational impacts from individual wells and facilities on water air land and the community. More than 600 data points within 24 operational categories are included in the analysis the company said.

As part of the project Chevron has deployed Canary X continuous pad-level methane emissions monitoring units at select locations. Canary’s sensor portfolio includes high-fidelity spectroscopy-based methane detection and emissions quantification for oil and gas operations plus Aeris Technologies’ laser-based gas analyzers covering other emissions such as ethane nitrous oxide formaldehyde ethylene oxide and benzene.

Insuring Independence of IoT Monitoring

In a recent interview with JPT Chris Romer CEO and co-founder of Project Canary pointed out that Canary owns the monitoring devices used to measure emissions 24/7 at its project locations and in Chevron’s case “those IoT [internet of things] devices do not go through Chevron’s SCADA system; so the results are truly third-party IoT-driven measurement.”

Project Canary is an SaaS-based (software-as-a-service) data analytics company organized as a public benefit corporation which is a for-profit company but is also accountable to its shareholders for achieving a public benefit as part of its mission.

Steve Green president Chevron North America Exploration and Production called Canary’s certification “an important milestone” that demonstrates the operator’s commitment to transparency and validates “our current practices and insights to inform and shape how we continue to achieve our lower-carbon aspirations.”

In 2020 Chevron reported that its US onshore production methane intensity was 85% lower than the US industry average attributing the figure to the company’s emphasis on incorporating strategies to limit fugitive emissions in the design construction and operation of its facilities.

Those strategies have included the implementation of leak detection and repair use of low-/no-emissions pneumatic devices and the centralization of production facilities combined with continuous monitoring of emissions. The company also said it is expanding its methane detection capabilities to identify the best opportunities to further lower emissions and is on track to reduce methane emissions intensity by more than 50% from 2016 levels by 2028.

In early May ExxonMobil obtained an “A” grade certification under the independent MiQ standard for managing methane emissions at its its Poker Lake New Mexico facilities in the Permian Basin while also becoming the first oil and gas company to earn the top certification for control of methane emitted from associated gas.

Responsible Energy Solutions a Texas-based independent auditor in the field of differentiated natural gas assessments carried out the study using MiQ standards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8zOS1sZWFubi1yaW1lcy1lcGljLWFicy0xMjAwMDA1MTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At 39 LeAnn Rimes Epic Abs In A Daring Cut-Out Dress Made Fans Go Wild,"In honor of the GRAMMY Museum's latest exhibit singer LeAnn Rimes stopped by to visit and she looked absolutely gorgeous while doing it!

As a Grammy-winning artist herself the ""Blue"" singer was the hot topic of the night (figuratively and literally) as she attended the event dedicated to her successful career called ""An Evening with LeAnn Rimes."" LeAnn came dressed to impress and we think it's time to file this look under ""LeAnn Looks We Love"" because these cut-out details are everything and more.

If you've been keeping up with the starlet you know that cut-out dresses are her jam and who can blame her?! Those abs deserve to be shown off. LeAnn looked stunning in her yellow maxi dress and wasn't afraid to take a major plunge to show some extra skin under an oversized denim jacket.

Later in the night LeAnn took a trip down memory lane to visit one of her old dresses that probably holds the most meaning for the singer. And no it's not her wedding dress. Sorry Eddie!

Yep that's the dress that 14-year-old LeAnn won her first Grammy in for ""Blue"" and made history as becoming the youngest person to win a Grammy. The iconic white dress is on display as part of the GRAMMY Museum's ""The Power of Women in Country Music"" exhibit. From Dolly Parton and Shania Twain to Taylor Swift and Mickey Guyton the exhibit highlights the past present and future female trailblazers in the country music genre.



""It’s humbling to be included in the Women In Country exhibition alongside such powerful and impactful female artists. This also couldn’t be better timing to highlight items from some of my most memorable moments as this year marks my 25th anniversary in the industry"" LeAnn said in an interview with the museum.

LeAnn shared this fun video with ""Blue"" playing in the background while exploring the exhibit and needless to say fans sung her praises in the comment section with messages like:

""Still one of my favorite songs 👏""

""A phenomenal singer when a artist can sing any genre of music...you know she's pure talent❤️""

""You're so cute.. I love it!!! 😍🔥👏❤️""

The exhibit will be on display until October 2nd and with an upcoming album being released in September fans have a lot to look forward to.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Pennsylvania pastor ""blessed"" to be alive after man tries to shoot him during sermon

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

Pennsylvania State Police have charged Bernard Polite 26 of Braddock after he entered and attempted to shoot pastor Glenn Germany while the pastor was delivering a sermon at Jesus' Dwelling Place Church on Sunday. Pastor Glenn Germany / Facebook

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

Two teenagers are accused of vandalizing the organ and sound system at the Immaculate Conception Church in Irwin Pa. Immaculate Conception Church / Facebook

""It was an important sacramental day for our parish and the children and their families were affected by the two teenager's actions"" Father John Moineau. ""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

The fact that Cisco has managed to award more than a million certifications since 1998 is a clear suggestion that there are benefits in the training.



Those who have been trained formally in Cisco technologies show an increase in productivity. They have been found to make fewer errors than those who just receive training on the job. They develop skills that are valued by customers and employees alike. Participants at the training camps have come back and reported better speed quality and depth in their customer interactions. Employers have reaped the benefits of more productive employees.



While the growth of online courses today has made many online CCNA courses available classroom training in CCNA continues to be the most sought after and the most effective. Even with ten years of experience in networking many individuals are still feeling the need to opt in for CCNA classroom training. Here's a look at what makes the training special.

9 Ways CCNA Classroom Training Can Increase Your Productivity:

1. You gain current knowledge directly from experts Classroom training gives you the update on advances in networking knowledge and skills with hands-on training that is far more effective and quick in helping to assimilate this knowledge. Classroom training camps in Routing and Switching Security SP Operations Voice and Wireless offer intensive coaching in the latest innovations and improvements in these fields. Courses typically run for five days or more. Certification exams are also taken on-site so participant engagement is maximum.

2. Real-life scenarios are better teachers CCNA Classroom training uses real-life scenarios to teach skills that could potentially crop up on the job. Webinars are just not enough to give you the skills and training with the minimum amount of downtime that you need to gain expertise and employment prowess. Hands-on CCNA boot camps are bound to be of high quality and with the best instructors who have experience in the field. Market-leading training with the latest advances in Cisco technology can best be imparted when you are face to face with someone who is well-versed in these advancements.

3. Troubleshooting is easier in the classroom Engagement in the classroom with qualified coaches gives you plenty of opportunity for problem solving as soon as you face stumbling blocks in your training. A day with a traditional training instructor typically runs a full workday from 9 to 5. Classrooms provide you with as much access as is possible so that you are able to resolve queries and solve problems much faster than you could in an online scenario.

4. You learn faster in the classroom

You learn faster when the onsite training provider delivers the material to you through a combination of audio visual and tactile methods. E-learning and online CCNA courses may allow you to read and view material at your own pace. But any learning is best done through a variety of mediums and that is what classrooms offer. Once you are done with a classroom course you can immediately go back to work and begin to apply the knowledge that has been ingrained in you through conscious and subconscious learning.

5. Flexible learning modules are available Most CCNA course providers try to offer intensive training in as short a time as possible so you don't have to spend too much time out of your workplace. You will be usually given the choice of attending a public classroom or a private group. Public classrooms typically are live and led by instructors at the training facilities of the training provider. These classrooms also typically offer labs for experiencing real life scenarios. Private groups usually the best option for corporate training can also be arranged with instructors and tailored curriculum delivered at the location of your choice. Private training can be made cost effective and more efficient than public groups. You can also supplement these classroom courses with self-paced online modules for maximum efficiency.

6. Classrooms offer more than study courseware Besides scenario labs classroom training also offers practice tests and case studies for in-depth learning. They give you the opportunity to apply your new knowledge to your work environment not just for Cisco CCNA exams. Instructors will typically use demonstrations to keep the lessons engaging and relevant all the way.

7. Higher chances of qualifying the exams There are effectively two aims of CCNA training: one is to prepare you for the CCNA certification exam and the other is to better equip you to manage Cisco networks at your workplace. When you attend classroom training you are more likely to qualify for the exams and be able to write the qualifications next to your name. There have been many individuals who have failed to achieve certification through online courses while diligent classroom training has had a higher success rate in preparing you for the CCNA exams and for your workplace.

8. Business networking is easier in the classrooms The classroom will give you the opportunity to interact with industry professionals and others like you preparing for certification. Establishing a relationship with instructors and experts can add to your business network which is always a bonus in the professional sphere.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuaHVsbHRpbWVzLmNvbS9odC1vbmxpbmUvMjAyMi83LzMvYm9hcmQtb2tzLWxpdmUtbXVzaWMtYXQtcGFyYWdvbi1ib2FyZHdhbGstYXNrcy1vcGVyYXRvci10by1taXRpZ2F0ZS1ub2lzZdIBgAFodHRwOi8vd3d3Lmh1bGx0aW1lcy5jb20vaHQtb25saW5lLzIwMjIvNy8zL2JvYXJkLW9rcy1saXZlLW11c2ljLWF0LXBhcmFnb24tYm9hcmR3YWxrLWFza3Mtb3BlcmF0b3ItdG8tbWl0aWdhdGUtbm9pc2U_Zm9ybWF0PWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Select Board OKs live music at Paragon Boardwalk asks operator to mitigate noise,"By Carol Britton Meyer

The new operator of the Paragon Boardwalk won approval for outdoor live music at the venue but at reduced hours after neighbors raised concerns.

Paragon Entertainment Ventures LLC’s new operating partner Charles Veysey asked the select board Wednesday to amend the license to permit outdoor entertainment including live music –beyond the piped-in music that is already allowed. The property is owned by Hingham residents Chris and Diane Reale.

Noting the large audience for the hearing Veysey explained his role in bringing the popular Cisco Brewers beer garden experience to the Paragon Boardwalk.

“Cisco is all about live music a family-friendly environment and cocktails” he said.

Outdoor entertainment at this venue could include a DJ karaoke an amplification system live vocal and instrumental music (up to five instruments – drums guitar and keyboard) and dancing by patrons on a 30-by-30-foot dance floor at the 183-197 Nantasket Ave. site. Indoor live music is already allowed.

Veysey’s request also included allowing live entertainment until 11 p.m. seven days a week. However following a more than 1-1/2 hour discussion that involved comments from concerned neighbors about quality-of-life issues the board voted 4 to 1 in favor of the following effective through Oct. 13:

· outdoor piped-in music only Monday through Wednesday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and both piped-in and live music outdoors Thursday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.

· Monday and other legal holiday hours of 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. for outside piped-in and live music;

· no outdoor light shows;

· a requirement that Paragon Boardwalk make every effort possible to mitigate the outside noise from any kind of music and also work on a noise mitigation plan to be presented to the select board and Town Manager Philip Lemnios at a future time;

· that Veysey provide contact information to neighbors and abutters in the event they have any noise complaints; and

· that the volume of music be turned down in an effort to work cooperatively with the neighbors.

Select board member Irwin Nesoff voted against the motion because he thought the end time for the outdoor music should be 10 p.m. seven days a week.

When asked for his opinion as to the above hours Veysey agreed “in the spirit of compromise.”

A large group of neighbors attended and one submitted a petition related to their concerns about live outdoor entertainment at this venue.

Concerns voiced at the meeting included the volume of the music and at what time it should be required to end and difficulty hearing their televisions and radios and being unable to open their windows or sliders to get fresh air while the music is playing.

Some neighbors recalled noise issues that were brought up last year at the Boardwalk under a different operator and also concerns about the volume of the music at a recent event at this location.

Before the vote resident George Murphy likened the request to allow live outdoor music to “a fire bell that we all better wake up to” and suggested that the town create a noise ordinance to assist with these types of discussions.

Following through with the discussion in the meeting Veysey shared his contact information with neighbors and abutters in the hallway of town hall after completion of that part of the agenda.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3Blci5jb20vOTE1NjU3L3RoZS13b3JzdC1hZGRpdGlvbi10by10ZWFtLWZsYXNoLWFjY29yZGluZy10by1mYW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Worst Addition To Team Flash According To Fans,"Cookies help us deliver our Services.

The Worst Addition To Team Flash According To Fans

Ever since he first received his powers Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) has never had to go through it alone on ""The Flash."" In Season 1 of the show Barry is guided on his journey by the team at S.T.A.R. Labs a group that originally consists of Caitlin Snow (Danielle Panabaker) Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes) and Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh). The trio assist the new superhero in sorting out his new abilities and ultimately help him stop metahumans all over the city. Team Flash specifically Cisco even creates Barry's suit itself and all of its subsequent upgrades.

Every member of the group is essential in their own right not only for their specific knowledge and meta-abilities but because they care for Barry each other and the safety of Central City. However Team Flash also changes throughout the run of the series. Most memorably characters like Cisco Ramon Wally West (Keiynan Lonsdale) Julian Albert (Tom Felton) and Ralph Dibny (Hartley Sawyer) come and go.

After a multitude of jumbled timelines and world-ending events the Season 8 version of Team Flash includes Iris West-Allen (Candice Patton) Joe West (Jesse L. Martin) Cecile Horton (Danielle Nicolet) Allegra Garcia (Kayla Compton) and Chester P. Runk (Brandon McKnight) along with Barry of course. Although fans still seem to be resonating with the show on some level (via Rotten Tomatoes) some clearly think one particular addition to Team Flash is the worst.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC9idXNpbmVzcy1sZWFkZXJzLWF0dHJhY3QtdmVuaWNlLXJlbW90ZS13b3JrZXJzLXRhY2tsZS1vdmVyLXRvdXJpc20tMTY5MTIxM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Being in Venice is good for your mental health': The remote workers tackling the Italian city's overtourism,"“Relocating to this city has been nothing short of inspirational” says Susana Martinez. “Venice has given me a boost of energy. When you are exposed to new experiences your creativity takes off.”

Feeling worn out by the daily grind the 48-year-old software engineer swapped her usual office in Madrid for three months of remote working in the dreamy watery city earlier this year. Martinez is one of 16 employees for the multinational technology company Cisco who was asked to participate in the remote working pilot in Venice.

Housed in apartments in the central city and invited to work in various locations participants were monitored to measure shifts in their productivity work patterns and levels of wellbeing. The results will help make the final tweaks to Venywhere – a new initiative aiming to draw to Venice international remote workers from around the world – before it goes live in September.

Venywhere’s organisers want to inject some vitality into the city that is waning under the 21st century blight of “overtourism”. And workers who sign up for the scheme could be on the cusp of richer less stressful and happier lives.

“Venice is not only beautiful it is also inspiring” Ms Martinez said the day after the pilot ended last month. “I loved grabbing my camera after work and getting lost in Venice’s streets or strolling along the seafront and stopping for a bowl of spaghetti or a spritz. Sometimes the smallest things in life make the biggest difference.”

Mathilde Bosgiraud another participant says she didn’t notice Venice’s car-free silence when she first arrived. “Then I went to Rome and it was a crazy return to reality after all of that peace and quiet” says the 29-year-old account manager who usually works out of Cisco’s Paris office.

While it may seem like paradise Venice is grappling with major problems. Hordes of tourists clog canal-lined alleyways. Roughly 20 million visitors descend on the city of 50000 every year and rental prices have soared as homeowners put properties on Airbnb.

Locals briefly reclaimed their city when the pandemic blocked international travel. But tourism levels are now surging back to pre-Covid levels. On 31 May in an effort to limit the swell local authorities announced they will soon introduce a tourist entry fee.

Mathilde Bosgiraud another participant says she didn’t notice Venice’s car-free silence when she first arrived

Venywhere’s organisers believe they can reverse the trend by drawing digital nomads freelancers and companies to Venice to diversify the city’s tourism-centric economy and fuel the rise of local worker-oriented services.

Compact enough to be navigated on foot and free of the air pollution that commonly plagues more trafficked locations Venice will be uniquely attractive to remote workers suggests Gianpaolo Barozzi an HR manager at Cisco.

Other remote working initiatives are cropping up in the city. The Procuratie Vecchie the former home of Venice’s governors that skirts the full length of St Mark’s Square reopened in April following a major renovation by British architect David Chipperfield. Generali the insurance giant that will use the 16th-century building as a headquarters included a smart-working space inside.

But Venywhere is focusing on international workers by helping newcomers find ideal homes organising social activities to help them bed in and issuing advice on how to navigate Italy’s infamous bureaucracy. The initiative has set up eight work locations in art foundations an 18th-century library and the enormous Arsenal complex.

“I am not a believer in co-working” says Venywhere founder Massimo Warglien. “We want to locate people in open spaces where they are not isolated and can meet with locals.”

The idea was dreamt up jointly by the Fondazione Venezia a local foundation aimed at driving growth in Venice and Venice’s Ca’ Foscari University during the pandemic. Venetians developed a more “intimate relationship” with their city while it was deserted.

Thousands of workers have already opened Venywhere accounts online with hundreds indicating that they will relocate to the city by the end of the year

The proportion of companies that have more than half of their staff working remotely has risen from 16 per cent before the pandemic to 62 per cent today according to a recent study by Cisco. That has turned international workforces into a resource to be tapped.

Thousands of workers have already opened Venywhere accounts online with hundreds indicating that they will relocate to the city by the end of the year. Many currently planning on short stays may extend their visit Michele Buglisi president of the Fondazione Venezia predicts. “We could see a similar trend to that in the academic world where students arrive initially for one or two years and ultimately remain” he says.

The potential positive effects of relocating to a new city are becoming evident. Surveys data and interviews showed that workers became more independent responsible and focused during the pilot Mr Barozzi says.

Ms Martinez says she felt more valued by – and consequently more committed to – her company while Ms Bosgiraud (above) added: “Being in Venice is good for your mental health… you have to adapt to Venice’s slower pace of life.” Both say they have developed a special connection with the city.

“Venice is now my adoptive home” says Ms Martinez. “I’m definitely going to be coming back every year.”"

Growing up with his brother and sister in a cramped two-bed terrace backing on to a railway line in Ilford east London Stevenson 35 had always wanted to make a lot of money. “I was a clever poor ambitious kid who just didn’t want to be poor any more.”

He achieved his goal by the age of 22 getting a job as a trader at Citigroup in Canary Wharf in 2008. Within two years he had made his first million. His pay and bonuses continued rising as his bets – that interest rates wouldn’t rise and the inequality gap would widen – made tens of millions for the bank.

Then he quit. “I was making more money than I could ever imagine” Stevenson says from his flat in Limehouse overlooking the Citi tower he once worked in. “But it wasn’t right.”

He adds: “I made the money by betting on what is a fucking disaster right? I bet on the long-term continual collapse of the global economy. No fucking joke right? You know people will die because of that. Families’ lives will be ruined and it will get worse and worse and worse.

“Look at what is happening right now with the cost of living crisis. In the winter half of this country will not be able to afford to turn the heating on.”

However Stevenson didn’t just walk away from his old job. He is now working to fight the system he previously worked in campaigning to raise awareness among the wider population about what bankers like him are doing in the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf and the City of London to “continue to make the economy unfair”.

“The only way to change the system is to make the people really fucking angry about it” he says as we walk along the Thames from his flat to his old Canary Wharf office. “You know I used to work in that building there and get paid a million pounds a year. Now I’m out here giving away information for free and it’s not like the media is all over me – the establishment don’t want the people to know the truth.

CV

Age 35

Family Sister a poet and brother computer programmer.

Education BSc in maths and economics London School of Economics. MPhil in economics Oxford.

Pay Zero.

Best advice he has been given “Throw your textbooks in the bin if you want to really learn about economics.”

Biggest career mistake “I’m struggling to think of a mistake. How about ‘I should have stressed out less and enjoyed it more’.”

How he relaxes “I go for runs along the canal read fiction and study languages. Recently I’m writing a fair bit as well.” He speaks French Japanese Spanish and Italian.

“If people knew how much of a serious problem inequality is we could have a proper conversation to do something about it.”

He is trying to tell them what he believes is the truth in a series of videos on his YouTube channel GarysEconomics including explaining how the City works why the rich got even richer during the coronavirus crisis and why millionaires should be taxed more.

When asked why he gave up the money and his career he says: “If you walk past your neighbour’s house and it’s on fire what do you do? You try and get them out. This is an economy on fire.”

Stevenson who has arrived from the gym in a tracksuit adds: “This is a disaster happening now and I don’t want it to happen. I would like to have kids one day and I would like to tell them: ‘I predicted this disaster’ and they’re gonna say ‘What did you do? Did you make a ton of money off it or did you try to stop it?’ I’ll say I made a ton of money but also I tried to stop it.

“Honestly I find it amazing when people like you ask me why. I don’t want this disaster to happen and I am trying to stop it. Can I stop it? Maybe not. But there’s not many people that can afford to do this and have knowledge I have so I have to try.”

In the six years he worked at the bank Stevenson earned enough money to never have to work again. The fight he says is to help others who are struggling. “I know that I’m rich. But this is my friends and my family. I didn’t go to Eton. This is the people I grew up with.”

I’m talking about going after the families who have been keeping their money for ever. Money makes money so it’s just going up and up Gary Stevenson

His sister Debris Stevenson is a poet and grime artist whose coming-of-age story Poet in da Corner inspired by Dizzee Rascal’s seminal album has been performed at the Royal Court theatre and toured the country. His brother is a computer programmer who taught himself how to build supercomputers from components he found in skips. He helped both of them buy their homes.

Stevenson who campaigns for a wealth tax as part of the Patriotic Millionaires movement describes wealth inequality as “a cancer in our economy” that “is untreated and it’s growing”. “If you do nothing about it it is inevitable that the economy will get worse and worse.”

So what would he do if he were Rishi Sunak? “Well if I was the chancellor and my father-in-law was one of the richest men in the world what I would probably do is make sure that we never tax rich people so that my kids would be fucking rich.”

More seriously Stevenson says tackling inequality should be a priority for the government. “The policy which I campaign for mainly is a wealth tax because I think it’s the most realisable” he says. “But there’s other ways too including limits on the length of time people can hold on to wealth.”

He proposes that if wealthy people had to spend a proportion of their money within a certain period it would boost the real economy and help with the cost of living crisis.

“Tax is the most important thing. It’s the only way that poorer people can have a chance of catching up” he says. “I’m not talking about huge taxes on high earners like doctors or lawyers; I’m talking about going after the families who have been keeping their money for ever. These families have hundreds of millions of pounds and money makes money so it’s just going up and up. I was paying 45% tax on my earnings but the Duke of Westminster was paying next to nothing on his billions of inheritance.”

When the sixth Duke of Westminster died in 2016 his heirs paid no inheritance tax on the bulk of his £8.3bn family fortune. His son Hugh Grosvenor 31 inherited the title and became one of the world’s richest people as the major shareholder ofglobal property company Grosvenor Estates which owns swathes of properties in the West End Mayfair and Belgravia in London as well as estates in Cheshire Lancashire and Scotland.

He fears politicians and economists won’t be able to fix the economy until their backgrounds better reflect society. “If you fill politics and economic departments like you fill these skyscrapers [in Canary Wharf] with people from rich families from elite schools and universities they don’t give a fuck because they’re winning” he says. “Of course they don’t know what’s happening. These guys think the economy’s great because it’s great for them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA3LTA0L2pwbW9yZ2FuLWJvb3N0cy1nbG9iYWwtd2VhbHRoLWJldC13aXRoLWNpdGktY3JlZGl0LXN1aXNzZS1oaXJlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JPMorgan Boosts Global Wealth Bet With Citi Credit Suisse Hires,"Why did this happen?

Despite their long history however the popularity of these loans has waxed and waned over the past several decades. They’ve also evolved over the years to meet the needs of consumers looking for more flexible ways to borrow against their homes.

Here’s a look at the history of home equity loans including their rise to mainstream use in the 1980s part in creating the Great Recession and sudden decline at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key Takeaways Home equity loans have been around since the Great Depression though they were originally used mainly as a last resort for low-income borrowers with few other alternatives.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 helped ignite home equity lending taking away the tax deduction for interest paid on non-mortgage debt.

Home equity loans continued to surge in the 1990s and early 2000s with major banks rolling out large marketing campaigns that touted them as an easy way to turn your equity into cash.

The Great Recession of 2008 put a damper on their use and the COVID-19 pandemic restricted access to them but they still remain popular.

Originally for the Less Creditworthy

Home equity loans which allow homeowners to turn their home equity into cash have been around since the Great Depression although they were relatively uncommon at first. Lenders were primarily consumer finance companies and specialized second mortgage companies with depository institutions accounting for only about two-fifths of loans issued. Economic conditions caused many property owners especially farmers to be at risk of foreclosure and with sources of credit difficult to find the loans began as a way to stave off disaster.

For example if an individual owned a home valued at $100000 and only owed $50000 on their first mortgage a lender might allow the individual to take out another $25000 in the form of a home equity loan. Alas this second mortgage rarely helped in the long run as the Depression deepened and many people lost their properties. As a result home equity loans were equated with poverty and carried a social stigma.

Becoming Mainstream in the 1970s and 1980s

This began to change in the 1970s and 1980s. A number of factors contributed to their explosion in those decades including the fact that more depository institutions—including big-name banks—decided to get into the market.

Banks had certain advantages over finance companies including the ability to offer home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that consumers could access by writing a check. Suddenly homeowners had the ability to borrow only the amount they needed when they needed it rather than taking out a lump-sum loan. Depository institutions also tended to have an older client base than finance companies did with more equity from which to draw.

The popularity of these loans only grew with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which removed the tax deduction for the interest paid on non-mortgage debt. This in conjunction with comparatively low interest rates made home equity loans much more attractive than unsecured loans which you could no longer write off on your tax return. As a result the sector grew at a staggering pace. The total value of outstanding equity loans jumped from $1 billion in 1982 to $188 billion in 1988.



Marketed to the Masses by Big Banks

The 1986 tax law wasn’t the only force driving the explosion of home equity lending however. Around the same time larger banks were undertaking a concerted effort to change the image of second mortgages once thought of as a last resort for the financially troubled.

One of the first things banks did was to change their advertising terminology. Pei-Yuan Chia a former vice chairman at Citicorp who oversaw the bank’s consumer business in the 1980s and 1990s told The New York Times in a 2008 interview: ""Calling it a 'second mortgage' that's like hocking your house but call it 'equity access' and it sounds more innocent."" Citigroup introduced a campaign in the early 2000s urging homeowners to “live richly.” Banco Popular had a “Make Dreams Happen” ad campaign that used the slogan “Need Cash? Use Your Home.”

“Banking started using consumer advertising techniques more like a department store than like a bank” Barbara Lippert of Adweek told The New York Times in 2008. “It was a real change in direction.” What these marketing campaigns usually left out were the dangers that come with these loans including the risk of foreclosure for borrowers who couldn’t pay them back.

Playing a Part in the Great Recession

The market for home equity loans continued to grow through 2005 when the value of new HELOCs reached nearly $364 billion. At that point the growth of the market was fueled in large part by a lowering of credit standards which meant even customers with weaker FICO scores or high debt-to-income (DTI) ratios could often get approved.

This all changed over the next couple of years which saw a dramatic decline in home values and a corresponding surge in defaults engendering the Great Recession. As a result loan originations dropped off dramatically while banks tightened their lending guidelines. As the housing market slowly recovered equity-based lending began picking up though not at the pace experienced during the 2005 peak.

COVID-19 Slows Recovery

Home equity lending dipped again early in the COVID-19 pandemic with banks such as JPMorgan Chase suspending HELOC originations on April 16 2020 based on economic uncertainty and the tumultuous job market. Citigroup followed suit nearly a year later on March 3 2021.

Even with the job market’s recovery and Americans sitting on a record amount of home equity—$9.9 trillion at the end of 2021 according to the data firm Black Knight—both of these major banks have yet to resume new equity loans. Bank of America however has continued to offer HELOCs including a hybrid model with a fixed interest rate that can mimic a home equity loan. According to reportage by The Wall Street Journal it initially implemented tighter lending standards to mitigate credit risk but has since reverted to its previous underwriting policies.



The absence of multiple large banks from the market hasn’t prevented home equity loans from making a comeback in 2021 however. The prospect of continued interest rate increases has made lower-cost home loans more attractive leading to substantial growth in home equity loan originations and new HELOCs.



How Long Have Home Equity Loans Been Around? Advertisements for home equity loans date back to at least the Great Depression. Back then they were relatively rare and usually used by homeowners with no other way to pay off their debts. Their popularity surged in the 1970s and 1980s when larger banks began to offer them and Congress passed legislation that phased out the tax deduction for other types of interest payments.

What Were the First Companies to Offer Home Equity Loans? For much of the 20th century most home equity loans were primarily originated by consumer finance companies companies specializing in second mortgages and even individuals. By the 1970s however more-traditional banks were starting to add these products. As depository institutions they could offer equity-based lines of credit that consumers could access by writing a check.

How Did the Tax Reform Act of 1986 Affect Home Equity Loans? Among other provisions the Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed the tax deduction for interest paid on non-mortgage debt. This made home equity loans a more attractive alternative to other loans.

The Bottom Line

Home equity lending has been around for nearly a century although the industry didn’t really come into its own until banks started reshaping the image of these loans in the 1980s followed by Congress passing legislation that made them more attractive than other forms of borrowing. The Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic both put a damper on their use but as of today home equity loans remain a tremendously popular vessel for borrowing money.

The bank’s chief executive officer Karen Darbasie held a presentation on Thursday for the business editors of the three daily newspapers in which she made the disclosure.

She was asked specifically if First Citizens was prepared to apply for a license and start from scratch a new bank in those countries.

Darbasie said “Am I open to starting operations applying for a license to build from scratch and do both ? Yes! Am I open to do that across the jurisdictions? Yes!”

She added “What I can say categorically is that we are interested in diversification from the group perspective product customer and geography.”

First Citizens’ CEO said while the bank was disappointed in not being able to consummate the Scotiabank Guyana deal it was still very interested in the South American country.

“We are still interested in Guyana we are interested in lending to entities and projects in Guyana we will do that… only with the requisite regulatory approvals from the Bank of Guyana and we continue to try to explore opportunities in Guyana.” Darbasie told the briefing.

She said First Citizens has customers from T&T who are engaging in projects in Guyana and would like to support its customers from T&T in their business opportunities.

Darbasie said the failure to extend to purchase agreement was based on the fact that there was no clear way forward and denied ever being told by the Guyana government or the Bank of Guyana that the transaction would not be approved.

“I think when the Scotia transaction came to an end we did put out a Q and A that stated we are interested in lending across the region lending subject to regulatory approvals from T&T we are still interested in lending to entities or projects in Guyana and we are interested in northern Caribbean as well. So we are interested…We are looking at what opportunities develop and based on what develops and if it makes sense we will progress it.”

She added “When you enter into agreements such as these to purchase these agreements normally have an expiration date because they are entered into at a point in time with a price and it’s a clearly defined period.

“To be honest COVID happened nobody really thought COVID would have taken so long and the process stretched out and the agreement came to an end it was never declined the agreement came to an end before and consummation could happen.”

Darbasie was asked if the threat of Fintec meant that the best approach to moving into Jamaica or Guyana was a digital first approach she said if it happens it would be a combination of both digital and brick and mortar. Promising to keep us updated if there were any announcements to be made.

“In T&T we are deploying brick and mortar in conjunction with a digital strategy. So we are maintaining our branch footprint and we are investing in new products and services and technology to really expand our digital product offerings.

“So we doing both in T&T. My personal view is that you need a brick and mortar presence in our state of development where we are in the region that it would be very difficult to have a full financial services group which is what our ambition is without some degree of brick an mortar in that model.

“Percentage brick and mortar vs digital will vary according to the state of development of the country.” Darbasie explained.

On the issue of First Citizens future outlook and whether it is holding a lot of government debt as a state enterprise Darbasie accepted that the bank had more government paper than its competitors but said it was only 35 per cent of the total balance sheet.

She argued “Am I concerned in the current environment? Not really concerned in the current environment because T&T is performing better in the current environment because a lot of the negatives that are impacting across the board is actually benefiting us from an energy price and taxes etc  unlike some countries.”

She noted that a significant part of the First Citizens balance sheet is actually in investment with more of the balance sheet in investment as opposed to loans.

Asked about the experience from taking a hit on sovereign paper from Barbados.

She said “We took the hit from the Barbados restructuring on the chin. We didn’t have a choice they restructured because the size of our operations in Barbados is so small any hit is a material hit but it was not a material hit that caused an issue with our earnings potential in that year.”

She was asked if in being exposed to the Barbados situation has chastened the bank’s approach to lending to governments she said “My philosophy on any asset is to look at the credit risk of the asset relative to the return of the asset. So anything that we do whether it is a loan or an investment whether it is a private sector or a sovereign we look at the risk reward ratio.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYmFua2luZ3JhdGVzLmNvbS9iYW5raW5nL2JhbmtzL2JhbmtzLW9wZW4tb24tanVseS00dGgv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29iYW5raW5ncmF0ZXMuY29tL2JhbmtpbmcvYmFua3MvYmFua3Mtb3Blbi1vbi1qdWx5LTR0aC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Banks Open on the Fourth of July 2022?,"Commitment to Our Readers GOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has amplified supply chain challenges and commodity squeezes. Beyond the broader economic impact it will create particular challenges in the months and years ahead for banks active in and with exposure to Russia and Ukraine as they grapple with operational challenges and the beefed-up sanctions regime.

But even before the war began in February there were already rumblings of global inflationary pressures and incoming economic turbulence. And with central banks including the US Federal Reserve European Central Bank and the Bank of England now engaged in a clear programme of interest rate increases while beginning to wind down stimulus it is evident we are entering a new economic phase.

For banks this is not necessarily bad news; indeed profitability in the era of low interest rates has been a major challenge. The data for 2021 (the full-financial year data the 2022 Top 1000 World Banks ranking is based on) points to a significant recovery in profitability compared to last year when banks collectively booked hundreds of billions of dollars in impairment charges expecting significant loan losses due to Covid-19 disruption.

Top 1000 aggregates

2022 ($bn) 2021 ($bn) Change from previous year (% bps) Aggregate Tier 1 10383 9913 4.74 Aggregate Total Assets 154211 148583 3.79 Aggregate Pre-Tax Profits 1439 936 53.73 Profits/Tier 1 (%) 11.09 7.57 352.07 Return on Assets (%) 0.75 0.51 23.67

Bounceback

Aggregate return on assets in the Top 1000 now stands at 0.75% compared to 0.51% last year broadly in line with where it was in 2020’s Top 1000 results (based on full-year data from 2019). Profits as a percentage of Tier 1 capital has also jumped from 7.57% last year to 11.09% this year higher than the figure for 2020. In dollar-and-cents terms aggregate pre-tax profits reached $1.44tn — the highest figure ever recorded in the Top 1000. This shows a 53.7% year-on-year increase and a 24.1% increase on 2020.

However as our analysis shows it is unclear to what extent profitability has improved in a meaningful sense. The impact of Covid-19 economic disruption on banks’ loan books has been less severe than expected in large part due to major central bank and fiscal stimulus packages. As a result banks have benefitted from lower-than-expected impairment charges which has boosted their profits. But it remains to be seen what shape banks are truly in following the pandemic and what kind of springboard that will offer in responding to current market conditions as stimulus packages are unwound.

Tier 1 capital grows

Looking beyond profits and profitability the overall resilience of the global financial system continues to look secure with aggregate Tier 1 capital continuing its upwards march. The minimum Tier 1 capital of a bank within the Top 1000 now stands at $556m up from $547m last year. Aggregate Tier 1 capital topped $10tn for the first time hitting $10.38tn — a 4.7% increase compared to last year. Aggregate Tier 1 assets also hit their highest-ever level growing 3.8% year-on-year to hit $154.21tn. However the growth rate of both Tier 1 capital and assets has slowed significantly compared to last year. Between 2020 and 2021 aggregate Tier 1 capital rose by 12.7% and assets by 16.0%.

There are some significant regional disparities. While Tier 1 capital grew by 9.1% for Asia-Pacific to hit $5.19tn (the first time it has topped $5tn for any one region) in western Europe it decreased by 3.6% to $2.37tn. In North America Tier 1 capital increased by 6.2% to hit $1.95tn. In Africa the Middle East and South America Tier 1 capital grew by 9.3% 11.1% and 7.6% respectively.

Increases for Asia-Pacific continue to be driven by China which accounts for $3.38tn of the region’s Tier 1 capital with aggregate Tier 1 capital for the country’s banks growing by 14.4% year-on-year. This is in stark contrast to Japan which saw its Tier 1 capital decrease by 10.3% to $642.6bn — its lowest value since 2017. Japan’s figures however have been skewed by the yen’s slumping exchange rate against the US dollar. All data in the Top 1000 is converted into US dollar values (if not already provided in that currency) to enable aggregation and international comparison.

In western Europe just seven of the 22 countries saw their aggregate Tier 1 capital increase year-on-year and this only includes two major banking economies — Switzerland and the UK which had increases of 3.4% and just 0.9% respectively. France which has the highest aggregate Tier 1 capital of any western European country in the Top 1000 saw an annual decrease of 4.6%; Spain saw a decrease of 0.9% and Germany a decrease of 4.1%. Turkey and Greece both saw particularly substantial decreases in percentage terms of 30.0% and 26.2% respectively. In Turkey’s case it was negatively impacted by the currency devaluation.

Chinese dominance continues

Chinese banks have continued to consolidate their increasingly dominant position within the Top 1000. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has now made it a full decade at the top of the Top 1000 rankings. Its Tier 1 capital has continued to swell growing by $68.9bn since last year to hit a massive $508.85bn — a 15.7% increase and the first time an individual bank in the Top 1000 has held more than $500bn in Tier 1 capital on its balance sheet. It has more than twice the Tier 1 capital of JPMorgan the highest non-Chinese bank in the rankings in fifth position. It also holds a mammoth $5.52tn in assets on its balance sheet.

Four other Chinese banks join ICBC in the top 10 with China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China each maintaining their second third and fourth positions respectively in the ranking. Bank of Communications has also moved from 11th to 10th position. This marks the first time that Chinese banks have made up half of the top 10.

China also now makes up half of the top 20 — increasing its share from nine of the 20 in 2021 — with China Citic Bank entering the top 20 for the first time. Its 18.0% increase in Tier 1 capital saw it leapfrog from 24th to 19th position.

At an aggregate level Chinese banks are also increasingly dominant — accounting for a third of Tier 1 capital across the whole Top 1000. This is a slight increase from last year when they accounted for 30%. Within Asia-Pacific Chinese banks account for 65% of aggregate Tier 1 capital up from 62% last year. Japan the next nearest this year accounts for just 12% — down from 15% last year.

China’s aggregate pre-tax profits increased by 15% year-on-year to reach $400bn. Its relative share of global net income has fallen from 37% last year to 27%; although similar to last year it continues to account for two-thirds of Asia-Pacific pre-tax profits.

Compared to last year Asia-Pacific overall also accounts for a smaller total of global profits. In 2021 its share of total global net income was 55.1% compared to 43.0% this year. North America and western Europe have picked up that slack. North American banks represented 28.5% of net income this year compared to 23.9% last year and for western Europe its share has increased from 10.3% to 17.3%.

Although China has by far the most dominant position by size of banks the number of Chinese banks in this year’s Top 1000 has decreased by four to 140. But China remains second only to the US in total banks in the Top 1000 which has 186 — an increase of eight from last year.

European changes

It is a year of significant change for Europe for this year’s rankings. In western Europe merger and acquisition (M&A) activity was the main driver behind a reduction of seven banks in this year’s Top 1000.

The central and eastern Europe (CEE) region has 13 fewer banks than last year. We have been unable to gather data from the two Ukrainian banks — PrivatBank and State Savings Bank of Ukraine — which were part of the ranking last year. There are also fewer Russian banks in our ranking this year just six banks compared to 21 in 2021 as we have not been able access the necessary data.

US holds steady

There has been little change for the US’s biggest three universal banks — JPMorgan Chase Bank of America (BofA) and Citi — with them retaining their fifth sixth and seventh positions in the Top 1000 ranking respectively. Their Tier 1 capital levels have generally remained relatively stable although JPMorgan’s has increased by 4.8% compared to last year to hit $246.16bn while BofA’s Tier 1 capital decreased by 1.8%.

The most significant US mover and shaker in the top 20 is Goldman Sachs which saw its Tier 1 Capital increase by 15.1% to hit $106.77bn — the first time it has surpassed $100bn.

In recent years Goldman has been expanding outside of its traditional investment banking focus. Its Marcus digital banking platform for retail customers has now grown to a customer base of more than 10 million with more than $110bn in deposits since its 2016 launch in the US and 2018 launch in the UK. The bank plans to push this expansion much further with the launch of a digital chequing account by the end of this year. It is also pushing ahead with further expansion of its transaction banking services which it launched in the US in 2020 and in the UK in 2021. It already has more than $50bn in deposits in this division and is targeting $100bn by 2024.

Goldman Sachs also succeeded in increasing its pre-tax profits by 116.2% building on a relatively strong performance last year where it was one of the few large US banks to achieve growth in pre-tax profits compared to 2020 (16.1%).

Overall it was a good year for pre-tax profits across the US banks with aggregate pre-tax profits increasing by 97.7% compared to last year. Just nine of the 186 US banks in the Top 1000 had smaller profits compared to last year.

Wells Fargo the US’s fourth-biggest bank in particular saw its pre-tax profits jump from just $581m last year to $28.82bn this year — a 4860% increase. It was able to benefit from a $4.1bn reduction in its provision for credit losses compared to last year when it recorded a $13.4bn provision for credit losses.

The bank also benefited from gains in areas such as in its affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and sales of its student lending asset management and corporate trust businesses. It remains subject to the $1.95tn asset cap imposed on it by the federal reserve in 2018 (with some limited exemptions for Covid-19-related lending). Although CEO Charlie Scharf has commented that the bank is “making significant progress” in addressing regulatory concerns he says “there is still work to do” which will take time.

JPMorgan Citi and BofA recorded pre-tax profit increases of 68.4% 78.9% and 96.2% respectively.

Top 20 shake-up

HSBC is once again the only European bank in the top 10; it has reversed its one position gain of last year returning to ninth position with its Tier 1 capital decreasing by 2.4%. It was able to boost its pre-tax profits by 115.4%; this was largely driven by a reversal in impairment charges. The bank is likely to see further adjustments in its assets and capital as it continues to progress its plans to withdraw from the US mass-market retail banking.

In February this year HSBC completed sales of 80 branches to Citizens Bank and 10 branches to Cathay Bank along with associated deposits and loans; these sales will be reflected in its 2022 annual report. In March it also announced it had entered into a deal to sell its Greek retail operations covering 15 branches to local bank Pancreta although this deal is not expected to be completed until the first half of 2023.

However the changes are part of its wider strategy to pivot towards Asia and the Middle East and it is likely to make new investments in that region. For instance HSBC Insurance subsidiaries in Asia-Pacific are currently pursuing plans to take full ownership of HSBC Life China (from the current 50%) and to increase ownership in Indian life insurer Canara HSBC Oriental Bank of Commerce Life Insurance Company from 26% to 49%.

Turning to the other banks in the top 20 France’s two largest banks Crédit Agricole and BNP Paribas have also slipped down the rankings from 12th and 13th last year to 14th and 15th positions this year with their Tier 1 capital falling by 3.6% and 6.6% respectively and assets by 3.6% and 2.6%. It is important to note the euro has fallen in value against the US dollar so if considered in local currency there is not the same fall. Each increased their pre-tax profits by 55.5% and 27.8%.

Japan now has just one bank remaining in the top 20 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group which shifted from 10th to 12th position its Tier 1 capital dropping by 12.4%. However its pre-tax profits grew by 29.3%. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group with its Tier 1 capital falling 9.7% has dropped from 16th to 21st position. The Tier 1 values have been negatively impacted by the falling value of the yen.

Profits recovery

This was a year when several banks had an impressive turnaround in fortunes with their pre-tax profits. Santander which last year recorded its first loss in its 160-year history of $2.56bn has recorded pre-tax profits of $16.5bn this year.

In 2020 the bank made a non-cash adjustment to the valuation of goodwill and deferred tax assets on its balance sheet which had a significant negative impact. Much of this adjustment applied across its subsidiaries Santander UK Santander Bank Polska and Santander Consumer Nordics and US businesses Santander Bank National Association and Santander Consumer USA. It attributes its improved performance to growth in loans and deposits and an improvement in credit quality.

NatWest which last year made a pre-tax loss of $468m recorded pre-tax profits of $5.82bn. This was in part down to an impairment release of $1.7bn but the UK lender also attributes the results to growing its lending cost reductions and digital transformation.

UniCredit has also moved from a $3bn loss to pre-tax profits of $1.41bn. The bank which gained its new CEO Andrea Orcel in April 2021 is currently engaging in a major strategic plan UniCredit Unlocked to deliver growth and long-term profitability. However the bank faces some risk given its exposure to Russian markets.

Germany’s Commerzbank which last year made the second-largest loss in the Top 1000 at $3.2bn has also moved back into the black albeit with modest pre-tax profits of $119m. Last year was the first year of its major restructuring programme which included planned staffing cuts of 10000 people as well as the closure of 340 of its 790 branches. It has benefitted from a significant year-on-year reduction in impairment charges.

This year the biggest loss in the Top 1000 was Greece’s Alpha Bank which made a pre-tax loss of $3.37bn closely followed by Piraeus Bank also of Greece which made a loss of $3.07bn. Both banks have been undergoing restructuring within their balance sheets to improve asset quality.

Impairment charge falls

Global pre-tax profits at an aggregate level reached $1.44tn a 53.7% increase compared to last year. This is in stark contrast to previous year when pre-tax profits fell by 19.2% year on year. At a regional level South America saw the biggest annual increase in profits at 128.8% followed by western Europe at 102.8% and North America at 90.2%. Spain was the country with the biggest annual increase in pre-tax profits at 621% followed by Poland at 464%.

In many cases this reversal in fortunes for pre-tax profits reflects the opposite trend for provisions and impairment charges. Impairment charges are costs that recognise the diminishing value of assets (for instance loans where there is a reasonable expectation of it not being paid back) and are included on bank-income statements — as such increased impairment charges have a direct impact on profits. Last year aggregate global impairment charges ballooned from $472bn to $754bn. This year they have fallen back down to $411bn.

North America saw the biggest regional fall in impairment charges with an annual decrease of 124.2% followed by western Europe at 63.9% and CEE with a decrease of 56.1%. At an individual country level some of the biggest reductions were seen in the US with a 129.0% fall in impairment charges the UK with a 114.6% drop and Australia with a 102.5% fall.

Interestingly China’s impairment charges only fell by 1.5% year-on-year but unlike many other countries its banks did not see significant increases in the year prior. Last year impairment charges at Chinese banks had increased by 22% compared that to its next nearest peer by size of banks the US which last year had a 157% increase.

A similar trend is visible when comparing China’s pre-tax profits to the US’s. China’s banks had by far the largest aggregate pre-tax profits of any country at more than $400bn this year. Yet this was just a 15% year-on-year increase. This compares to the US which had pre-tax profits of $342.73bn this year an increase of 97.7% compared to last year.

At first glance it may appear the US banks are more profitable based on these figures; however the significant increase in US pre-tax profits is largely attributable to the annual fall in impairment charges following a one-off major increase whereas China’s pre-tax profit growth has been more stable in recent years.

Post-crisis performance

Indeed China’s bank did not suffer a drop in pre-tax profits between 2008 and 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Looking across the period since then as an overall trend its aggregate pre-tax profits have gradually climbed.

For western European banks even 13 years later their pre-tax profits have never recovered to 2008 levels. In 2008 western European pre-tax profits stood at $355bn and they fell the following year by $390bn to a loss of $35bn. Since then they have been up and down and this year’s figure of $258.75bn is the highest level they have reached since 2008.

North American banks experienced an even bigger loss in 2009 with pre-tax profits falling by $216bn from $140bn in 2008 to a loss of $76bn. Unlike western Europe however aggregate pre-tax profits at North American banks had been consistently increasing until last year. They recovered to 2008 levels in 2011 overtook western European profits in 2012 and this year stand at $408.27bn. For Asia-Pacific it is clear the extent to which China has come to dominate the region’s banking industry in the post-crisis period. In 2008 China’s aggregate pre-tax profits were $77bn compared to $121bn for Asia-Pacific excluding China. As of this year China’s pre-tax profits stand at $400bn compared to the rest of the region at $206bn.

Lending activity

In order to benefit from rising interest rates banks will need to boost their lending particularly to customers they can be confident will not default during potentially challenging economic circumstances. This year’s Top 1000 figures (although not reflective of current market activity) suggest that banks in most regions have remained relatively cautious. For instance although gross total loans in Africa increased by 10.2% year-on-year their gross total deposits increased by 11.0%. Similarly gross total loans in the Middle East increased by 10.2% but total deposits also grew by 10.6%.

In North America deposit growth has far outstripped loan growth with gross total loans increasing by 7.4% and total deposits increasing by 11.8% year on year. In western Europe this trend is even more pronounced with gross total loans decreasing year-on-year by 3.0% and gross total deposits increasing by 0.4%. However the overall health of western European banking loan books appears to have improved. Aggregate allowances fell by 19.8% year-on-year and allowances as a percentage of the total loan book fell by 30.25 basis points (bps). In North America the decrease was even greater with aggregate allowances falling by 27% and allowances as a percentage of the total loan book falling by 62bps.

Big M&A deals

Although only 12 M&A transactions were completed within the Top 1000 during the 2021 financial year there were some major deals. The largest by far was the merger between Samba Financial Group and National Commercial Bank to create Saudi National Bank. The combined bank is now the largest banking entity in the Middle East with Tier 1 capital of $32.62bn. It is in 67th position in the rankings leapfrogging Qatar National Bank (77th this year) which was previously the region’s largest bank.

The next largest deal was Spain’s CaixaBank’s acquisition of Bankia which was completed in March 2021 having first been announced in September 2020. CaixaBank says the combined bank now has almost 20 million customers in Spain making it the largest retail bank in the domestic market by share of customers (Santander is Spain’s largest bank by Tier 1 capital and assets). The combined entity is Spain’s third-largest bank by Tier 1 capital and second-largest by assets at $772.77bn. Western Europe was the most active region for M&A accounting for five of the 12 deals taking place in 2021.

For comparability and consistency we convert all the data used in the Top 1000 into US dollar values. However year-on-year depreciation in the value of some currencies can have the effect of suppressing the position of some banks within the ranking. For transparency the table ‘The Foreign Exchange Effect’ lists the 50 banks within the Top 1000 that would move up rankings the most if the effects of the depreciation were recalibrated. Typically smaller banks are affected the most. This year the largest bank affected is TC Ziraat Bankasi which could have been in 111th position in the rankings rather than 177th without the effects of currency depreciation.

As a federal holiday public and private businesses close.

However we have information about open and closed spots for Independence Day.

Why do we celebrate Independence Day on the Fourth of July?

On July 4 the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence in 1776.

The Declaration of Independence officially made the United States an autonomous country freeing the 13 colonies from Great Britain's grasp amid the Revolutionary War.

Since then July 4 has been the birthday of America. The nation will turn 246 years old in a few days.

On June 28 1870 Congress passed a law that officially made Independence Day a federal holiday.

Establishments closed on July 4:

July 4 is a national holiday and various establishments are not open.

-Federal government offices

-Banks

-Schools

-US Postal Service

-Local government offices

- New York Stock Exchange

-Nasdaq

Do you need to make a transaction or attend the bank?

Most of the banks won't be open. If you need to make a transaction attend the bank to receive a benefit from it and do it before July 4.

Which banks are closed on July 4?

According to GOBankingRates the next banks will resume their activities on Tuesday 5.

If your bank doesn't appear on the list double-check. Most banks will be closed.

Is Sam's Club open on July 4?

According to Sam's Club's official website all Sam's Club locations will be open on July 4. However the fact that they will be open does not mean that they will operate on their normal schedule.

So their customer service hours during Independence Day will be from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Plus members) and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Club members) which means they will close two hours earlier than normal.

Are liquor stores open on July 4?

This year July 4 falls on a Monday which means that like government institutions some stores will also be closed but liquor stores are expected to remain open.

So the best thing to do is to check the schedules of local stores to see if they will have special hours of operation."

GENEVA – In boxing a fighter is said to punch above his weight if he hits as hard as boxers much heavier.

In high-energy physics – Big Science studying tiny sub-atomic particles – that phrase fits Israel to a “T” a country that punches way above its weight in science and technology.

Specifically Israel is the only non-European full member of CERN – a French acronym for Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire – the consortium of countries that built and run the amazing Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Israeli researchers from Technion Tel Aviv University and the Weizmann Institute play important roles in CERN research. And this has been the case for over 30 years.

I was privileged to visit CERN and to view the LHC here firsthand after speaking to a conference of European R&D managers. A general view of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment is seen during a media visit at the Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the French village of Saint-Genis-Pouilly near Geneva in Switzerland July 23 2014 (credit: REUTERS/PIERRE ALBOUY)

But first some background.

What is high-energy physics also called particle physics?

It is a costly lengthy difficult quest to understand the very basic small stuff we are all made of.

Matter and radiation are made up of very small particles much smaller than atoms or even protons. High energy physics studies the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and how they interact in theory and through experiments.

The dominant theory that explains the dynamics of basic particles is called the Standard Model. Recent research suggests as often happens with theory that this model needs some repair.

For instance consider ‘dark matter’ – dark because we cannot see it as it does not interact with light. Astronomers say there must be nearly six times more matter in the universe than we can now see to explain galaxies and how they form and behave.

And ‘dark energy.’ We now know the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. But how? Why does gravity not slow it down?

There must be unknown unobserved energy out there fully two-thirds of all energy currently known that drives this ever-more-rapid expansion and overcomes the pull of gravity.

The universe is filled with mysteries that scientists struggle to answer (Illustrative). (credit: PIXABAY) How do scientists study the tiny particles that we are all made of?

With massive accelerators like LHC located in a suburb of Geneva at the Swiss-French border.

Picture a huge circular racetrack 27 km. (17 miles) in circumference in a tunnel deep underground. Except it is not for Formula 1 race cars (200 mph) or Arabian thoroughbred horses (44 mph). Rather it is a racetrack for protons. And the protons do not race in parallel but purposely smash into one another from opposite directions at very close to 186000 miles per second nature’s speed limit.

Inside the accelerator two high-energy particle beams of protons travel at close to the speed of light but in opposite directions before they are made to collide. Super-powerful magnets speed them up. When they smash into one another a whole array of smaller particles are generated.

Why do this? The tiny particles flying off these violent proton collisions can reveal what is inside them. It takes great ingenuity to observe the particles emerging from these collisions – and as we shall see below Israeli physicists play a key role in this.

Protons have a positive charge. Huge superconducting electromagnets can accelerate the protons and then make them collide. And believe me: it is a lot harder to do this than to describe it. It takes immense creativity and engineering skill and massive resources to get two proteins each one-millionth of a nanometer in size to smash head-on into one another when each is traveling at nearly the speed of light. It is not unlike having two tiny bumblebees fly in opposite directions around the earth and then smash into one another precisely at Times Square.

How have Israeli physicists specifically contributed to high-energy physics research?

I spoke with Yoram Rozen Technion physics professor who explained it in laymen’s terms:

“The High Energy Physics group at the Technion with Profs. Enrique Kajamovitz Shlomit Tarem and myself is active at CERN the European center for particle physics. Israel became the first non-European member in 2014.

“The group is mainly involved in an experiment called ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider. The goal of the collider and the ATLAS detector is to investigate discover and understand the fundamental laws of physics that govern the universe.

""The goal of the collider and the ATLAS detector is to investigate discover and understand the fundamental laws of physics that govern the universe."" Yoram Rozen

“The current knowledge is summarized in a theory called the Standard Model. The last piece of this puzzle was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [Compact Muon Solenoid a general-purpose detector] in July 2012. This is of course the Higgs boson whimsically called the God Particle. The Technion group contributed to the search for the Higgs particle which in 2013 won Peter Higgs and François Englert the Nobel Prize in Physics.”

Wait a minute! God Particle? What in the world?

In science scholars build theories and then experimenters try to prove or disprove them. A physicist named Peter Higgs theorized in 1964 with several others that a “scalar boson” (later known by his name) should exist. But proving its existence crucially important turned out to be really hard. It took 48 years.

In 2012 experiments at the CERN LHC finally found a subatomic particle that matched the elusive Higgs boson.

The event shows characteristics expected from the decay of the SM Higgs boson to a pair of photons (dashed yellow lines and green towers). (credit: Wikimedia Commons) But why was it called the God Particle?

According to Business Insider: “The phrase God Particle was plastered across the front pages of news outlets everywhere when the discovery of the particle was announced in 2012. “God Particle Discovered” is a much sexier headline than “Higgs boson discovered” but most physicists hate the term.

“It was not the intended nickname for the famous particle. The story goes that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon Lederman referred to the Higgs as the Goddamn Particle meant to poke fun at how difficult it was to detect the particle. It took nearly half a century and a multi-billion-dollar particle accelerator to do it.

“The Goddamn Particle was the title of Lederman’s book that came out in the 1990s and was wildly popular. However his publishers weren’t exactly on board with that phrasing so the title was changed instead to the God Particle.”

I think God Particle is a perfect name for the tiny Higgs boson and here is why. A CERN official explained that the discovery of the God Particle helps explain what happened one-trillionth of a second after the Big Bang the massive explosion that created our universe 13.8 billion years ago.

But the CERN physicists are not satisfied. They seek to look back in time to 10 to the minus 43rd seconds after the Big Bang.

How will this end poverty cure cancer wipe out hunger halt wars and lengthen life? It won’t. But mankind has always sought to understand the origins of the universe. It is a worthy quest of great intrinsic value.

Rozen continues to describe the LHC and Israel’s role:

“We already know that the Standard Model is not the final word in describing the universe. There is evidence that suggests that there is more to it that it is a limited version of a larger theory. While we do not know what this additional physics is often called physics beyond the Standard Model we have a powerful tool at our hands to investigate the possibilities.

“This tool is the LHC and the ATLAS detector. The LHC a 27 km. instrument-cluttered tunnel accelerates protons (hydrogen nuclei) to an incredible energy bringing them to 99.9999% of the speed of light the ultimate speed limit of the universe. When these protons collide they can create heavy particles via the famous Einstein formula E=Mc2. Heavy unstable particles decay into lighter ones and eventually into stable particles following the laws of nature. Measuring the final particles in the chain is the way to trace back and learn about these laws.

“The particles are measured by the ATLAS detector a large building-size apparatus. Three universities in Israel – Technion Weizmann Institute and Tel Aviv University – collaborated to build a significant piece of the ATLAS detector capable of detecting and identifying a particle called a muon whose presence in the collision might hint at an interesting process worth studying.

“In addition to the contribution to the construction and operation of the detector the Technion group is very active in the search for the improved standard model. To be more specific we are active in searches for additional Higgs particles not the standard model particle but a new one that is charged. We are exploring other avenues as well exploiting our deep knowledge of the muon system and looking for particles that in contradiction to the standard model binds differently to muons.

“Last but not least we look for Dark Matter by searching for anomalies in the behavior of collision events where some energy seems to be missing. There are several observations in astronomy that tell us that the amount of matter seen is significantly less than what is needed to explain the behavior of celestial objects. Not being able to see this extra matter means it does not bind to light hence it was named Dark Matter.” The ATLAS particle detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland (Illustrative).

How did Israel get to sit at this phenomenal CERN table and in many ways play a leading role?

Israeli physicists have always excelled at high-energy physics theory and experiments. Hence Israeli scientists were involved with CERN research as early as 1991. And on January 15 2014 Israel joined the 20 other CERN member states as an official full-fledged member. Members fund CERN in proportion to their GDPs; Israel pays for close to 2% of the CERN budget. I understood that Palestinians also do research at CERN which Israelis foster. Politics are absent. Scientists from nations that dislike one another collaborate closely at CERN.

How has humanity benefited from this expensive research?

A senior CERN official explained that when CERN was born in 1954 two primary goals were first to stem the brain drain of young European scientists leaving for the US and second to establish a cooperative framework among European nations that had earlier fought two terrible wars.

It emerges that finding the “God Particle” was just the start. There may be a whole family of Higgs boson particles. In science as in life one thing leads to another. Look for CERN and Israeli physicists who join in its research to continue to unlock the deepest mysteries of our existence.

There are 9000 workers and scientists on the site daily and a total of 70 km. (43 miles) of tunnels and caverns with 670 buildings. The Large Hadron Collider alone took a decade to construct at a cost of $4.75 billion. According to Forbes magazine “taking all costs into consideration the total cost of finding the Higgs boson ran about $13.25 billion.”

For me a Masorti Jew visiting CERN was a religious experience. At the place where the God Particle was discovered I wondered is there sacrilege in the very name? Not in the least.

The more we understand the amazing complexity and astounding order of our universe and what it is made of the more I personally find it a believable hypothesis that it is of Divine origin.

“And I [God] shall dwell within you” the Bible says. At CERN for me “within” took on new meaning. ■

To reduce its carbon footprint JSW Steel has earmarked a sum of Rs 10000 crore to increase use of renewable energy to replace thermal power and other green initiatives its Chairman Sajjan Jindal said. Various steel makers use coal to generate thermal power for captive use.According to a Ministry of Steel document globally the iron and steel industry accounts for around 8 per cent of total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In India  it contributes 12 per cent to the total CO2 emissions. Thus the Indian steel industry needs to reduce its emissions substantially in view of the commitments made in the COP26 climate change conference.""We have earmarked Rs 10000 crore for investments to reduce our carbon emissions through various initiatives such as increasing the use of renewable energy to replace thermal power reduce our fuel rate through improved raw material quality via beneficiation and deployment of Best Available Technologies (BAT)"" Jindal said.JSW Steel has already contracted for 1 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy of which 225 MW has become operational in April 2022 and the balance will come on stream in phases Jindal said in his address to shareholders in the company's Annual Report for FY 2021-22.He further said the expansion of the company's Vijayanagar plant from 12 MTPA to 19.5 MTPA is underway and capex cost is well below global benchmarks.The company's ongoing expansion projects are oriented towards producing steel with higher use of renewable power best-in-class digitalisation to achieve operational efficiency and best available technologies to reduce associated CO2 emissions.""We are consciously going beyond basic steel and are consistently maintaining the share of VASP (value added and special products) in our product mix to over 50 per cent"" he said.The energy transition has provided a significant opportunity for steel players with huge investments being made in renewable power generation and transmission and distribution infrastructure all of which are steel-intensive.""At JSW Steel ESG ( Environmental Social  and Governance) is core to everything we do. We have committed to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity... by 42 per cent by 2030 compared to the base year of 2005 aligned with India's Nationally Determined Contribution NDC )"" Jindal said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2F1dG8vbmV3cy9mdXR1cmUtb2YtYXV0b21vdGl2ZS1pbmR1c3RyeS1lbGVjdHJpYy1vci1lbGVjdHJpZmllZC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjYxNTg3NC5jbXPSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYXV0by9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZS1vZi1hdXRvbW90aXZlLWluZHVzdHJ5LWVsZWN0cmljLW9yLWVsZWN0cmlmaWVkL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjYxNTg3NC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future of automotive industry: Electric or electrified?,"This article is authored by Naveen Soni President

India

It is heartening to see the electric revolution picking up pace in India. Government policies like the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) which provide subsidies for EV production and charging infrastructure are steps in the right direction.The number of EVs on the roads is increasing with more and more OEMs entering the EV mobility space.However current EV sales stand at less than 1 per cent of total vehicle sales in India as against the global figure of 2-3 per cent. As per a report on EVs by Lux Research EV sales are predicted to overtake ICE vehicles sales between 2035 and 2040. This prediction is naturally dependent on how customer preferences developments in technology and policy measures shape up. As bullish as one would like to be in India at least we are seven to ten years away from EVs making a dent into ICE sales.While the benefits of an EV to the environment and consumers are undeniable it is important to understand the different kinds of eco-friendly vehicles which are available in the market. Let’s start with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) or what are most commonly called electric vehicles as everything is powered by a battery. Next are Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) which have a smaller battery than Hybrid ElectricVehicles (HEV) but can be run on battery or fuel. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) or hybrids as they are known are petrol-powered cars with a small battery and electric motor inside and can run on battery or fuel.And finally we have the Fuel Cell Electric vehicles (FCEV) which primarily run on Hydrogen as a fuel which combines with oxygen in the air and the resulting energy produced by such chemical reaction is stored in battery inside the vehicle which powers the vehicle. All the above four vehicle types are collectively called Electrified vehicles which have varying degrees of electrification.Hybrid drivetrains combine the best of ICE and electric motors and Lexus has been more prolific than any other luxury car manufacturer when it comes to hybrids or Self Charging Hybrid Electric vehicles as we like to call them. Lexus’s history with hybrid vehicles dates back to 2005 when the company launched its first hybrid the RX 400h. It was the first luxury car in the world that paired a high-performance petrol engine with a potent electric motor and a self-charging battery.The trade-off between power and efficiency wasn’t a concern with Lexus Hybrid Drive a petrol-electric ‘full hybrid’ combination which is central to all of Lexus’s current luxury hybrid electric cars .There is another significant advantage HEVs have over PHEVs and BEVs which is that HEVs do not need to be plugged-in to charge the battery.A full hybrid system like the Lexus Hybrid Drive has two power sources – a battery-powered electric motor and a petrol-driven combustion engine – which are entirely separate from one another. Either of them can power the car on their own or the power from both units can be combined. The system’s ‘intelligence’ ensures that when the petrol engine is running it is driving the generator to charge the battery.In low-speed urban environments the generator shuts down the petrol engine and lets the electric motor take over. This means that the car can operate with zero emissions. As per tests conducted by government bodies in Indian driving conditions Hybrid Electric vehicles run more than 60% of the time and 40% of the distance as pure battery electric vehicles.Lexus Hybrid Drive is derived from its parent company Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive technology. The hybrid system has sold more than 19 million units worldwide till April 2022 since its launch in Japan in August 1997. Even Lexus has sold more than 2.3 million hybrid electric vehicles.Lexus Electrified is the new name for the ongoing evolution of the electrification strategy that Lexus first launched back in 2005 with Lexus Hybrid Drive. On a global scale Lexus aims to achieve 100% BEV sales by 2035 and unleash the full potential of Lexus engineering.The future is electric and bright; however it may be prudent for the industry and society at large to consider hybrids as a bridge to this bright future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9uZ3NsLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWJhbGFuY2Utb2Ytc3lzdGVtcy1mb3ItMzI1LW13LXNvbGFyLXByb2plY3RzLWluLW1hZGh5YS1wcmFkZXNoL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyNjMyNjIxLmNtc9IBmQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9uZ3NsLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWJhbGFuY2Utb2Ytc3lzdGVtcy1mb3ItMzI1LW13LXNvbGFyLXByb2plY3RzLWluLW1hZGh5YS1wcmFkZXNoL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjYzMjYyMS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NGSL to build balance of systems for 325-MW solar projects in Madhya Pradesh,"

While fans may expect a sweet marshmallow taste from the 12-ounce can the flavor will likely come as a surprise. Instead it's created with a mix of the artist’s favorite flavors — strawberry and watermelon — along with the classic Coca-Cola taste.

Marshmello who is the first artist to collaborate with the century-old cola brand calls the mix a ""vibey blend."" The limited-edition drop is set to hit shelves on July 11th in the U.S. followed by select countries globally.

Similar to Wendy's (WEN) Pernod Ricard (RI.PA) and others in the food and beverage space that have recently entered the Metaverse Coca-Cola is inviting fans to experience a ""Melloverse for themselves."" On July 9 there will be an ""immersive takeover"" on Twitch owned by Amazon (AMZN) in which fans can access metamerch.

Then beginning July 25 fans can scan a QR code on a can to access the Coca-Creations online hub. On the site there will be an opportunity to use AI technology to transform one's emotions while listening to Marshmello's latest track into a personalized piece of digital art.

This is the third iteration of the beverage giant's innovation hub Coca-Cola Creations which launched in February. Other limited-edition drops included Zero Sugar Byte and Starlight.

Coca-Cola was not the only company out with an innovative collaboration that swept the internet this week. Arby's Meat Sweat Defense Kit in collaboration with Old Spice (PG) sold out in just hours after going on sale Wednesday for $60 while Taco Bell's (YUM) collaboration with Cheez-It on the new Big Cheez-It Tostada (K) was a top trend on Google the day it dropped.

According to a Reuters report the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit revived Meenaxi Enterprise Inc’s US trademarks after finding Coca-Cola failed to prove it suffered any harm in the United States that would give it a basis to challenge them.

Parle Bisleri introduced Limca lemon-lime soft drinks in India in 1971 and Thums Up cola there in 1978. Coca-Cola bought the rights to the drinks in 1993.

Thums Up and Limca are sold extensively in India and other countries in Asia and Africa. Coca-Cola also said importers have been selling them in America since at least 2005.

Meenaxi has been selling drinks with the same name to Indian grocers in the United States since 2008 and received federal trademarks for them in 2012. Coca-Cola asked the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the registrations in 2016.

The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board found Coca-Cola could bring the case because Meenaxi’s products could harm the reputation of its drinks among Indian-Americans. It cancelled the registrations after finding Meenaxi was trying to “dupe” US consumers.

The Federal Circuit said on Wednesday that the board should not have let Coca-Cola challenge the trademarks because the company did not show it had been injured in the United States.

Coca-Cola does not sell the drinks widely in America and did not demonstrate any lost sales from Meenaxi’s products the court said. Sales of the drinks by third-party importers also did not establish standing for the company under trademark law.

The alleged harm to Coca-Cola’s reputation among the Indian-American community could not sustain the case either. The Federal Circuit said there was “no basis to assume that an American of Indian descent is aware of brands in India” and the board’s opposite conclusion relied “at least in part on stereotyped speculation.”

The case is Meenaxi Enterprise Inc v. Coca-Cola Co U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit No. 21-2209.

We witness a plethora of odd concoctions and experiments done with food often. However this recipe for a salad kind of surpasses all the cringe-worthy dishes. Read on to find out about it further!

The now-viral post was shared by Lizzie O'Leary on Twitter and made its way to Reddit. It featured the recipe for a Coca-Cola salad. The ingredients to make the dish were orange jello Coca-Cola cream cheese and nuts. To make the salad the person has to put the jello on the cream cheese. Next it instructs to pour boiling Coca-Cola over it and add the nuts. Yes you read that right.

Take a look:

Netizens were obviously horrified to see such a bizarre recipe for a salad. While some people were curious to try it others purely rejected the concept.

""That line struck horror in my heart"" a user wrote.

Another user commented ""Please someone make this and post it on here.""

See the comments here:

In fact some users informed that they have actually tried a salad like this with just small variations.

Redding adds that this pass is perfect for kids of all ages having parents/guardians save money on bringing a group of younger children. As well as older kids have the ability to plan their day around some physical activities while also being in a safe environment without their parent’s supervision.

“We most certainly see that demographic (Youth 13-17) coming through here in the summer months it will be interesting to see what covid has done or how they may have changed the demographic we see but I do really hope that youth feel this is a great indoor safe place where they can come and enjoy their summer holidays” said Redding.

The Eastlink and Coca-Cola Centre will be offering a list of activities and amenities this summer with the Summer Blast Pass:

Fitness Centre (Including Fitness Classes)

Indoor Pool

Fieldhouse

Squash and Racquetball Courts

Track

Indoor Skating Rink (Including Drop-in Shinny and Stick & Puck.)

Redding says a drop-in pass is good for an entire day and one wristband is good for a whole day’s worth of activities.

The Summer Blast Pass can be purchased now through the Eastlink Centre guest services desk calling 311 or by an online booking account available by clicking here.

With this they have joined Genpact  TCS Infosys Wipro and Cognizant each of which has over $1 billion in BPM revenue. For WNS this was the highest rate of growth since becoming a public company in 2006.EXL says there’s been a clear step up in average growth rates since the pandemic and these higher rates will continue into the foreseeable future.The biggest reason for this is that enterprises around the world need data analytics and insights more than ever before and these companies have transformed themselves over the past five years to deliver precisely that. They have moved very far from the call centre business they were known for two decades ago and they are today at the heart of helping companies digitally transform to enrich customer experiences.KS Viswanathan VP of industry initiatives at Nasscom says such is the confidence in Indian BPM that global enterprises are today outsourcing to them sensitive areas that they would not think of doing so earlier. “Indian BPM operators were never in the business of revenue operations but now they are impacting the topline impacting customer experience asset utilisation” he says.Voice-based customer interactions he says may come from the Philippines finance & accounting (F&A) from Poland but analytics and digital experience will come from India. “The new normal is for delivery of business outcomes to be done by India” he says. Over a third of India BPM’s revenue he says comes from AI operations analytics and advanced intelligence systems.Rohit Kapoor  vice chairman & CEO of EXL says the biggest pivot the company made was to shift its focus to becoming a data-led company. “When we adopt a dataled approach it provides very clear visibility to our customers in terms of the change that we are driving why we are driving that change and what impact it has – because ultimately our customers are looking for business outcomes to be delivered to them and for them to have higher-end customer satisfaction and customer engagement” he says.Keshav Murugesh  group CEO of WNS notes that uncertainty and volatility has increased markedly making analytics services and solutions critical. Covid brought extreme uncertainties. Then came record levels of inflation and a major war. Todaythere’s talk of a potential global recession. On top of this there are new-age customers who are used to far more automation than ever before. So enterprises Murugesh says are looking for a service delivery model that provides predictable outcomes in a very unpredictable business environment. And that he says is what companies like WNS provide with technologies like AI data analytics and robotic process automation (RPA). “Our revenue from digital disruptors (those in the forefront of digital transformation) grew 29% year-over-year and now represents close to 20% of the total company revenue” he says.Yusuf Tayob group chief executive of Accenture Operations the BPM arm that accounts for $8 billion of Accenture’s $50-billion revenue says with the power of data and technology they are changing multiple parts of the customer organisation at the same time and at speed and enabling innovation-led growth. And India he says remains the strategic pillar for Accenture’s business.All of the companies have interesting case studies of the analytics work they have done for clients. WNS says they implemented a proprietary solution driven by AI and ML to engineer a digital trans- formation for a leading shipping company – enabling the customer to realise $3 million in annual savings 35% productivity benefits 75% automation and 50% improvement in data quality. “Enterprisewide assessments across multiple countries and vendors helped in identifying automation opportunities and creating an automation roadmap. The RPA infrastructure for scale was designed and provisioned in the cloud” the company says.EXL created data loops for an insurance company that connected the underwriting finance and claims functions – which normally tend to be independent silos – enabling lessons from one to be applied to the other. So if the company is seeing heavy claims being paid out to a particular customer they can use that information in real time to apply that to underwriting and pricing decisions.Kapoor says not only do they use data analytics to help clients create insights out of data and make better business decisions they also then take the intelligence and the insight from the data and apply it into core operating processes and make these processes digital operations. That’s when a truly digital transformation happens.,,,,,,

“It’s a little disheartening when I see it because the flag is a representation of our country’s history” said Petty Officer Howard who is a member of the United States Navy Reserve at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and has spent 17 years defending and honoring the nation’s most iconic symbol of freedom.

However he admits he’s a stickler for details and flag etiquette.

“I don’t think it’s disrespectful” Howard said of people flying tattered flags. “They are putting it out to show their pride and I think in many cases they do not have the means to replace it.”

That’s where he comes in.

In addition to his duties as a reservist Howard works for Comcast which employs over 18500 veterans Michigan National Guard and reserve service members and military spouses. He also serves on its Veterans Network Resource Group which launched a grassroots campaign last fall to replace any tattered or torn flags they might see while working in their communities.Over

“It’s a small gesture but it really means a lot” Howard said of the free three-feet by five-feet flags that are offered to homeowners businesses and anyone else flying America’s flag.

“We don’t discriminate” Howard said. “They don’t even have to be Comcast customers.”

Since launching its patriotic campaign Comcast has replaced 40 flags.

Among the most grateful was the daughter of a World War I veteran.

“Her flag was discolored and was starting to fray at the edges” Howard said. “She was an older woman and was so glad when we stopped and asked if we could replace it. She couldn’t get over it. ‘For free?’”

Howard said the program has become his passion.

“A lot of times they will tell their stories as veterans or what the flag means to them” he said and that makes their commitment to seeing the brightest representation of their country’s red white and blue flying even more rewarding.

“All of our employees are watching” Howard said. “You never know. We might knock on the door or leave a card when we identify a flag in need of replacing as we go about our day.”

Sakic thanked Kroenke for backing him and providing what the franchise needed to succeed.

I’m not going to exaggerate here in search of a contrived hot take.

The boos among the cheers were not widespread but were noticeable. It definitely was a mixed reaction.

Wait … the Avalanche just had won the NHL championship for the third time in their 27 years in Denver and for the second time under the Kroenke umbrella and the owner is booed?

Could you imagine that happening with Pat Bowlen? Of course you couldn’t.

The fact of the matter is that the Kroenke ownership has been great for Colorado. Stan is Kroenke Sports and Entertainment’s chairman and CEO.

Let me emphasize that.

The Kroenke ownership also including Stan’s son Josh who is president of both the Avalanche and Nuggets has been great for Colorado.

Also give it credit for the other teams in the KSE Colorado portfolio: Major League Soccer’s Colorado Rapids and the National (indoor) Lacrosse League champion Colorado Mammoth.

KSE also owns the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams and Arsenal FC of the Premier League. But that’s of secondary concern here. (Unless family competition is an added impetus for the Rob Walton ownership group once the Broncos’ new ownership takes over. Stan’s wife Ann Walton Kroenke who for a time technically was owner of the Nuggets and Avalanche until well after the NFL rolled back cross-ownership rules and Rob Walton are cousins.)

The reason for those scattered boos Thursday was obvious.

They’re tied to the ongoing Comcast / Altitude fiasco that for three seasons has prevented the Avalanche (and Nuggets) from being available on the dominant cable system in the Denver area.

That’s not how to nurture a fan base that wants to watch a handful of the best players in the world including Nikola Jokic Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar and their teams.

The relatively universal availability of Avalanche games in the playoffs — including via TNT and ABC — was great but also was a reminder of what so many had missed in the regular season.

I get it. We’re Comcast subscribers and we’re frustrated too.

But the boos?

I would have hoped that the issues — ownership’s role in the Avalanche’s NHL championship on the one hand; and the KSE / Altitude’s ongoing dispute with the cable carrier on the other — could be separated for at least a day.

I’ve opined on the dispute several times and won’t run through it all again. But to summarize: It’s a business dispute between a mega-mega-mega corporation and billionaires.

Stan Kroenke a competitor in all things including business wants to win.

Comcast’s motives are murky including the possibility that it wouldn’t mind it if independent regional sports networks are put out of business. The RSN role in the marketplace has evolved and perhaps the model no longer is viable.

After three years of receiving zero in rights fees from Comcast KSE’s hard line in refusing to simply get the best offer possible from the cable carrier and viewing it as a promotional loss leader is baffling. To me that would make economic sense.

But KSE also deserves some credit for keeping Altitude on the air and at least available to those able to get it via DirecTV and through other means.

Another settlement conference linked to the Altitude lawsuit against Comcast is scheduled for mid-July. Previous conferences have been unsuccessful resulting in delay and frustration. Perhaps this one will be different.

Put all of that aside for a moment.

Denver is one of four markets with dual NHL-NBA ownership.

The other three are the New York Rangers and Knicks; the Washington Capitals and Wizards; and the Toronto Maple Leafs and Raptors. There are fine-print disclaimers for the official ownership structures especially in Toronto but those are the realities about control of the franchises.

Considered as tandem operations the Kroenke-owned Avalanche and Nuggets are the best of the four.

Actually you could go farther and say that regardless of dual or separate ownerships Denver has the best situation of all markets with both NHL and NBA franchises. The Kroenkes deserve credit for that too.

In the Avalanche’s case the ownership’s strength is recognizing what it doesn’t know hiring personnel up and down the organizational chart it trusts and allowing them to do their jobs. Stan and Josh Kroenke both with basketball playing backgrounds are more activist in NBA discussions.

In a hard-cap NHL the payroll parameters are pretty much set by the CBA so it’s not a matter of giving financial carte blanche. I still remember once asking Josh Kroenke at an availability for an Avalanche draft class what his philosophy was about NHL free agency. He pointed across the room to Sakic and said: “My philosophy is whatever he says it is.”

Perhaps the euphoria of this championship will accelerate a move toward construction of a new practice facility/rink for the Avalanche whether linked to a new Nuggets practice gym or otherwise.

I would have hoped that the Kroenkes would have been chagrined or even outraged by the unfair and ill-timed boos and be moved to address the cause.

But it’s business.

Stan Kroenke likes to win there too.

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade major corporations are adding abortion travel costs to their employee benefits.

The goal is to ensure their employees can seek abortion care if they live in states where the procedure is now or will soon be illegal. About 26 U.S. states are expected to swiftly outlaw abortion following the overturn of the landmark 1973 ruling according to the Guttmacher Institute which researches reproductive issues.

A trickle of companies announced abortion travel coverage earlier this year after states including Texas introduced restrictive abortion laws.

Or possibly it was an evening this spring when he led a triumphant Beethoven’s Ninth with the full orchestra a full chorus and a full house.

Or maybe it came last month courtesy of a jumbotron and a few delirious seconds at Comerica Park.

Sporting a Detroit Tigers cap and jersey visiting the ballpark for his first-ever major-league game Bignamini was in a suite when the stadium cameras zeroed in.

The gregarious Italian conductor was at his feet pumping his arms and grinning wide as his face appeared on the giant outfield screen in a massive welcome-to-Detroit moment.

Thirty months after being named to the prestigious DSO spot Bignamini is at last getting a chance to get a feel for the city. After a pandemic-hobbled early tenure marked by quarantines and canceled dates the Italian music director is belatedly experiencing what he wanted from the outset: “the love of feeling part of the community.”

A festive scene unfolded in the Comerica Park suite that night in mid-June as DSO musicians staffers and donors piled in for an all-American baseball night with the European newcomer. In his one-on-one interactions with the musicians it was clear the DSO’s artistic leader commands respect while remaining lighthearted and approachable.

“I like to have a very good close connection with all of them” he said.

A wide-eyed whirlwind had accompanied Bignamini’s introduction to Detroit in early 2020. Amid the frantic rush of media rounds the 43-year-old was the first to acknowledge his English was far from perfect.

While he has certainly improved on that front — he’s comfortable and increasingly fluent these days — Bignamini also seems to have grown into his leadership role. There’s a confident decisive presence to go with the likable personality.

As the Tigers took on the White Sox below musicians lauded the energy fun and camaraderie Bignamini has brought to Orchestra Hall. Their enthusiasm reaffirmed a truth that has set in around the institution: Everybody loves Jader.

The admiration is mutual.

“There’s a very particular atmosphere here in Detroit” Bignamini said. “Your love for life is strong. Onstage with the orchestra it’s the same — just smiling smiling smiling.”

Ahead of the Tigers’ game that steamy June evening Bignamini dropped by the team’s dugout. He promptly hit it off with catcher Eric Haase the Westland native who came home to the squad in 2020. Overhead the stadium PA pumped out Stevie Wonder’s “Signed Sealed Delivered I’m Yours” a little dose of Motown fortuitously punctuating a Motor City moment.

As they chatted Haase revealed he had married into a family of Italian descent — indeed his wife’s aunt is a classical violinist working in Europe. The catcher vowed to make his way soon to Orchestra Hall to watch Bignamini at work.

The DSO maestro upped the invitation: How about grabbing dinner at his new favorite Detroit restaurant the contemporary Italian joint SheWolf? Bignamini has also become fond of Slows BBQ and Grey Ghost.

Haase was all about it.

“If you say it’s good I trust you” the catcher replied. “I always trust Italians with food.”

Bignamini’s jersey for the evening gifted to him by a DSO executive bore the No. 18 — denoting his status as the 18th maestro in the orchestra’s history. It’s a legacy that dates to 1887 seven years before the Tigers’ founding.

""I'm the new player"" Bignamini cracked when he arrived at the ballpark in his Tigers regalia. ""A very bad new player.""

When he was appointed in January 2020 as successor to Leonard Slatkin he was primed to hit the ground running. The Italian conductor flush with a six-season contract was teeming with ideas brimming with energy and ready to get acquainted with the city that had bet on him.

Though he’d not previously held a music director gig he was a rising star — a well-traveled clarinetist with an opera background who made his mark guest-conducting orchestras across Europe and North America. With big artistic visions and personal charm Bignamini had already won hearts behind the scenes. For DSO executives their adventurous choice was quickly paying off.

But within weeks the global pandemic intervened.

In those early months Bignamini put on a good face working with his orchestra remotely and popping up on screen for the DSO’s virtual events. But it was a difficult time. For nearly two years every trip to Detroit for a concert or other DSO business meant a mandatory two-week quarantine.

“It was so hard” he said. “Just so hard.”

Things have mostly settled now and audiences are back. Last month Bignamini wrapped his first complete season as the DSO’s maestro. While still based in Italy for much of the year at home with his wife and two teenage children he's finally spending significant time here.

“I love it to death” he said. “The people in Detroit — you’re so strong with a positive attitude always ready to work hard but smiling. It’s sort of like my orchestra. They want to work so hard and arrive at the highest level possible but always with a positive attitude. I love this about the people.”

Bignamini has emphasized that his leadership is open-ended: He seeks ideas from his players listens to their opinions wants to grasp their responses to a piece of music. Problem-solving is a group effort.

That rapport with musicians was obvious during the night at the ballpark.

“They have to understand we are all in the same team. Of course I’m the leader but I don’t want to be an old-style maestro — a Toscanini or something like that” he said. “Because I think it’s better to motivate them by involving everyone in a lot of different activities to live together to share some ideas.”

The Tigers rolled out the red carpet for Bignamini. He got a first-class tour of the ballpark including a pregame batting practice where he watched soaring baseballs with an emphatic “Wow!”

Would he be interested in throwing out a ceremonial first pitch? Bignamini attending the first full baseball game of his life worked his face into a mock frown.

“Next time I’ll practice first” he joked.

The maestro made his way through Comerica Park’s noisy bustling concourse checked out statues of Al Kaline and other Tiger greats and posed for photos with mascot Paws and the giant tiger out front.

Someone directed his attention to the outfield sign labeled ""Miggy Milestones"" — which on this day stood at 505 home runs and 3041 hits.

""You're like our Miguel Cabrera"" a DSO executive told him.

Bignamini asked an official how many fans the stadium could hold. More than 41000 came the answer. He grinned. The entire populace of Crema his northern Italian town birthplace could fit inside Comerica Park with seats to spare.

Bignamini went on to spend his boyhood in nearby Cremona a city just double the size but renowned for its musical history including a rich opera tradition and the origins of Stradivarius violins.

At the Tigers game the conductor played down his own sports roots. But a friend revealed Bignamini was in fact a talented youth soccer player with professional possibilities before he embraced a life in music.

The maestro is excited about the DSO's upcoming season which launches Sept. 30. He'll conduct half of the season's 20 classical weeks particularly relishing the challenge of Mahler’s Second Symphony (“Resurrection”) in November.

""We have an incredible orchestra such great musicians and they deserve to play big repertoire"" he said.

It's part of an ongoing programming vision with an eye to diversity showcasing works by women and composers of color. Eighteen such pieces are billed for 2022-23 alongside the traditional classical stock pops concerts and neighborhood events.

Bignamini is also geared up for a busy weekend at Michigan's Interlochen Arts Camp where he'll conduct the DSO on July 22 before directing the orchestra's players alongside a youth ensemble.

Bignamini’s taste of Detroit-style Americana happened to land on Flag Day. At Comerica Park he stood near home plate to watch as several dozen immigrants were sworn in as U.S. citizens in an on-field naturalization ceremony.

“Hang on to the good parts of your heritage and share them with your neighbors” said the federal judge who presided.

Later that night Bignamini described the scene as touching. For an Italian he said it was a glimpse into a distinctive sort of American pride.

He said he's thrilled to be immersed in it in Detroit.

“The community needs the orchestra” he said. “And the orchestra needs the community.”

Detroit Tigers fans have liked what they've seen so far out of top prospect Riley Greene and on Saturday the outfielder added another first to his MLB resume.

He came up to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning in a 3-3 game between the Tigers and Kansas City Royals and with one out Greene sent the Comerica Park faithful home happy.

On a 1-0 count Greene launched a ball to dead center field clearing the first level of hedges beyond the 420 foot sign for his first career homer in the big leagues a walk-off solo shot.

In the first inning Greene hit a 413-foot triple the first ball he's hit over 400 feet in his MLB career. Add on another 19 feet to that and you've got his home run distance a 432-foot blast to the deepest part of any MLB park.

Home runs like that are what keep players up in the big leagues and Greene has most definitely earned his stripes after today's game.

The Tigers actually hit back-to-back homers to win the game in the ninth with Victor Reyes starting the scoring with a solo home run.

Since his MLB debut on June 18 Greene has hit .302 in 43 at-bats with 13 hits the one homer three RBI and an .876 OPS. He's been one of Detroit's best hitters over that time and in those 12 games the Tigers are 6-6.

Detroit currently sits at 30-46 on the year 12.5 games back of first place in the AL Central and two games clear of the Royals who are in last place.

With two hits on Saturday Greene is currently on a four-game hitting streak and will look to extend it to five with a great day on Sunday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL3Nwb3J0L2FyY2hpdmVzLzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvMjAwMzc4MTA0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tellez hits his fifth home run in five games,"Tellez hits his fifth home run in five games

AP PITTSBURGH Pennsylvania





Rowdy Tellez on Friday homered for the fifth time in five games and drove in five runs while Corbin Burnes took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning as the Milwaukee Brewers routed the Pittsburgh Pirates 19-2.

Willy Adames hit a grand slam as the Brewers connected five times. They also had five doubles among their 16 hits.

The Brewers got seven runs in the second inning and eight more in eighth. It was the first time in franchise history they had scored at least seven runs twice in an inning in the same game.

Tellez’s homer was a three-run shot to right-center field that capped a seven-run second inning against rookie Roansy Contreras (2-2). Tellez also had a two-run double in the fourth to push the Brewers’ lead to 9-0.

“He hits the ball hard and when he does square the ball up it has a chance of going out of the ballpark and that’s what he’s been doing” Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.

In Detroit Michigan Vinnie Pasquantino took an unusual path to home plate on his first big-league home run — a furious sprint a desperate slide and even a tag as he and Hunter Dozier hit back-to-back homers leading the Kansas City Royals over the Detroit Tigers 3-1.

Playing his third game in majors Pasquantino was zero for six overall when he hit Michael Pineda’s first pitch of the fourth inning to deep right. The ball hit the top of the fence bounced off a railing and back onto the field.

Thinking the ball was in play Pasquantino tried to get a double out of it but Javy Baez took Willi Castro’s throw and tagged the rookie as he slid into the bag. The Tigers shortstop then told Pasquantino to get up and enjoy the last half of his home-run trot.

“I got tagged out at second base by Javy Baez” on home run No. 1 Pasquantino said. “How cool is that?”

“I’m glad that all got captured on video because I’m going to be showing that to my grandkids someday” he said.

The shelves at Villa Market were stocked with American brands. Katie Lockhart

I'm an American citizen who's been traveling around Asia for nearly four years.

Whenever I explore a new place I'm eager to dive into the local cuisine and typically make a beeline for the street-food markets. But there are moments when I crave a familiar taste of home like Tostitos chips dipped in a pint of Ben & Jerry's Phish Food.

Luckily I found upscale grocery stores that carry classic American foods during my trip to Bangkok.

Many of the items were priced considerably higher in Thailand than they are in the US but I was happy to shell out the extra Thai baht for them.

Here's what the American food selection looks like in Villa Market an international grocery-store chain in Bangkok.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdyb2Nlci5jby51ay9maW5hbmNlL3doeS1pcy1rZWxsb2dncy1zcGxpdHRpbmctaW4tdGhyZWUtYW5kLXdpbGwtaXQtd29yay82NjkwNjIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is Kellogg's splitting in three and will it work?,"Kellogg’s announced a shock split of its business last week spinning out North American cereals to focus on its higher-growth snacking brands

As Kellogg’s prepares to split its business in three could the glory days of the multi-category consumer mega-corps be behind them?

The cereals and snacks giant is spinning out its problematic North American cereals division and its nascent plant-based division to focus on its higher-growth global snacking arm. The plan marks a shift of strategy from its fellow consumer food and drink giants which have typically prioritised growth by selling off lower-growth or non-core divisions. Kellogg’s will create three distinct publicly listed companies by the end of 2023: Global Snacking Co containing 80% of its current business including its international cereals portfolio; North American Cereal Co; and Plant Co the latter anchored by its US MorningStar Farms brand. The rationale is similar to that behind Unilever’s sale of its spreads division and Nestlé’s sale of its US ice cream and waters business – to shift away from non-core lower-growth assets and invest in categories of higher growth. For Kellogg’s this means its snack brands such as Pringles Pop-Tarts Cheez-It Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats. Its traditional cereals have suffered from the structural decline in traditional breakfasts as consumer habits shift while the division has also suffered in recent times from strikes supply chain disruptions and mounting commodity price pressures. Kellogg’s CEO Steve Cahillane who will lead the main snacking business said the split means the cereal division “will not have to compete for resources against a high-growth snacking business”. Meanwhile the much smaller Plant Co division will be an innovation-driven pure-play plant-based player. With sales of $340m the North America-focused business remains in growth phase but crucially – unlike other listed players in the space such as Beyond Meat – it generates a profit. Notable consumer spin-offs Consumer health: Last year pharma giants GSK and Johnson & Johnson both pledged to spin off their consumer health arms to become separate standalone companies. GSK rebuffed a £50bn raid from Unilever to plough ahead with its plan to split out ‘Haleon’ and IPO it in July. Johnson & Johnson is hoping its offshoot will list by November 2023.

Kraft/Mondelez: Pre-Heinz merger Kraft Foods span off confectionery arm Mondelez including the Cadbury brand in 2012. The split followed Kraft’s controversial takeover of Cadbury in 2010. Separately Mondelez has thrived now boasting annual revenues of $26bn. Kraft’s more troubled path saw revenues shrink before its mega-merger with Heinz.

Cadbury Schweppes: Under the urging of activist investor Nelson Peltz the chocolate and drinks arms split in 2007. While the split was welcomed strategically it left Cadbury vulnerable to the Kraft takeover. Schweppes – which became Dr Pepper Snapple Group – was acquired in 2018 by Keurig Green Mountain to become Keurig Dr Pepper. Cahillane said the independent companies would be “better positioned to focus on their distinct strategic priorities”. In reality this is Kellogg’s grasping the nettle of the key issue many other consumer giants face: looking after the bottom line while prioritising growth. GlobalData’s Nidhi Chauhan suggests prevailing chaotic market conditions have intensified the need to address underperforming divisions. “With the snacks business growing at a faster rate than the cereal and plant-based product divisions these smaller companies may be able to move quicker and smarter than the heavy Kellogg brand” he says. While global giants have historically benefited from scale this restructure is driven by the belief that category focus outweighs back office synergies. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson notes: “Whilst there may be security in size and savings to be made by sharing back room operations strategically there’s a gulf between family favourites and pushing plant-based boundaries.”

Best of both worlds

A break-up rather than sell-off theoretically enables the company to benefit from the best of both worlds – reliable cash generation from its mature categories and the benefit of structural growth opportunities in more on-trend areas.

This isn’t a new approach just one rarely seen in food and drink in recent years which has focused on portfolio management through M&A and tended to retain relatively diverse product categories.

Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard notes the move could be seen as an “admission that turning around the US cereal business is proving tough” but it is also reminiscent of the Mondelez split from Kraft a decade ago.

Howard suggests shedding the problematic cereals business – as well as shedding debt on to it – could propel Kellogg’s to trade more in line with other snacking companies like Mondelez’s EBITDA multiples of 14-15 times compared with its current level of around 12 times.

How investors and customers will take to the split-off cereal business is less clear. But clean splits may become increasingly attractive to consumer giants.

The past decade has seen little such activity but in recent months GSK turned down Unilever’s mega-billions approach for its consumer health arm to instead spin it out via a London IPO next month. Johnson & Johnson announced a similar consumer split in November 2021. Bernstein’s Howard suggests Campbell Soup Co or Conagra Brands may also follow suit.

Of course it could still be that Kellogg’s announcement is precursor to a more traditional divestment.

OC&C managing partner Will Hayllar comments: “The debt markets are not as open for big ticket debt at the moment and therefore they may feel like public market rather than selling to a buyout group provides the cleaner path forward.

“I suspect this gives them certainty where they can lay out the future strategy of these divisions as separate companies and if someone wants to come in and make an offer they are still able to do so.”

In particular the plant-based division would seem to offer opportunities for an investor to scale up off-market. Notably Kellogg’s even floated that a sell-off of the division remained a possibility.

Even the cereals business could attract buyer attention now Kellogg’s has announced its intention to demerge it with its reliable cash generation and potential for margin-focused restructure appealing to buyout firms in particular.

Shareholders were broadly supportive last week with shares up around 6% and remaining up a week later.

It provides more evidence that the City has grown impatient with slow-growth mature businesses. The post-Covid period has already seen General Mills and Danone diversify their portfolios while Unilever is under pressure to move much faster with Nelson Peltz set to take his board seat in a few weeks.

Kellogg’s bold move is certainly unlikely to be the last consumer spin-out as unprecedented economic pressure puts more business models under the microscope.",,,,,,,,,

Here's why job numbers in the Alaska oil patch are not.,"Roughnecks worked on BP's Parker Rig 272 which was drilling into the Lisburne Reservoir at drill site L3 in Prudhoe Bay on May 22 2015. (Loren Holmes / ADN)

Oil prices in Alaska have surged to their highest levels in a decade.

But job numbers in the oil and gas industry have barely budged upward after they crashed during the COVID-19 pandemic even as other sectors of the economy enjoy a solid rebound.

Industry observers in Alaska give several reasons for the tepid job growth in the oil patch.

They say it mirrors a trend in the industry nationally a slow recovery that breaks from past practice. Companies increasingly flush with cash aren’t investing in oil field activity like they once did when the good times rolled.

Companies are now more likely to question big long-term projects observers say as investors raise concerns about the industry’s past performance and new regulations that could result from climate change policies.

Sara Teel an economist with the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development said in a June report that companies face shareholder pressure to cut capital expenditures while some lenders and investors are shying away from funding projects in environmentally sensitive areas such as the Arctic.

It’s usually “drill baby drill” for oil and gas companies when prices rise Teel said in a phone interview.

“But when prices spiked this time they restricted spending” she said. “They are investing some but not like before.”

In Alaska the COVID-19 pandemic gutted the oil and gas workforce. Jobs plunged by about 40% as demand for crude oil and the gasoline it makes collapsed.

Alaska North Slope crude oil hit a record low of $16.55 a barrel in April 2020 Teel noted in the report. Two years later the price rose to $109.41 per barrel a “whopping” 561% jump she wrote.

Meanwhile jobs in Alaska’s oil patch have grown by only 18% to 7200 after bottoming out in November 2020 at 6100 jobs the latest state records show.

The workforce is a fraction of what it was in December 2014 when it hit a record 15300 positions. Oil prices and job numbers at the time began a multi-year slide. But just before the pandemic the industry was rebuilding reaching 10000 positions.

Teel wrote that the current slow job growth and “muted” activity is being caused by several factors including automation in the oil patch that continues to reduce the need for workers.

The industry’s tolerance for risk also has changed she wrote. Alaska projects can also require huge up-front costs and years of planning.

Investment could grow if prices remain high for a long period she said.

The risk of an economic downturn is making the industry more cautious said Roger Marks a former petroleum economist for the state.

“I think (the slow recovery) has to do with inflation and supply bottlenecks going on throughout rest of economy” Marks said. “And the recession I think has people skittish about investing too much.”

Sean Clifton a policy and program specialist at the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas echoed those concerns.

[A ‘carbon bomb’ or much-needed energy? A village on Alaska’s North Slope holds key to Biden’s climate policy.]

“The likelihood of companies being willing to pull the trigger on projects goes up when the price of oil goes up” he said. “But there are complications from the supply chain and access to basic materials like steel.”

“So it’s not as easy as flipping a switch and getting back to work” he said. “Unfortunately the market is still complicated.”

A lean workforce

Industry observers say an additional important factor behind the slow job growth is that Hilcorp Alaska took over operation and partial ownership of Alaska’s largest oil field Prudhoe Bay in 2020. Hilcorp is known for operating with a lean workforce compared to the much larger BP the previous operator they said.

“That’s going to be a permanent change in the industry’s employment profile” said Brad Keithley a retired Alaska oil and gas attorney who tracks economic issues in Alaska.

Other factors include concerns about future climate change regulations that could impact the industry and increased production of renewable energy that could affect demand for oil and gas he said.

“There’s a fundamental change going on in the oil industry raising questions about its future and as a consequence people aren’t putting a lot of additional cash into generating additional projects” Keithley said.

Hilcorp has been increasing its workforce in Alaska said Luke Miller a spokesman for the company.

The company hired about 70 new people last year. It is on pace to more than double that number this year he said.

Hilcorp also produces oil and gas in Cook Inlet in Southcentral Alaska and employed more than 1500 people in Alaska last year.

Job increases in the Alaska oil industry are generally tied to new projects said Teel the Alaska economist. The lack of new fields in Alaska explains some of the slow growth she said.

[Oil refineries are making a windfall. Why do they keep closing?]

Kara Moriarty head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association the industry trade group in the state said oil companies are largely focused on drilling within existing fields rather than launching big new projects.

“If you want more jobs you have to have more activity” she said.

Projects on hold

In Alaska drilling activity plunged after the pandemic was declared and remains slow compared to pre-pandemic years according to data from the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.

The industry completed 291 wells in the two years before March 11 2020.

It completed 138 the next two years the data shows.

Two major projects in Alaska that could sharply boost jobs are on hold or uncertain industry observers say.

ConocoPhillips’ Willow prospect is undergoing a new round of federal review after a federal judge ruled in favor of conservation groups that had sued to stop it.

Also Oil Search’s Pikka prospect faces major financing questions as banks withhold financing for Arctic projects following pressure from climate activists. And Oil Search’s merger last year with Santos a larger Australian oil company has raised uncertainty about Pikka’s future.

Santos now the parent of Oil Search said in a prepared statement that it employs about 150 people in Alaska primarily located in Anchorage.

“At Santos we are focused on controlling costs and not the fluctuation in oil prices” the statement said.

The company will maintain that low-cost model as it works toward making a final investment decision on Pikka the statement said.

Tara Stevens a spokeswoman for ConocoPhillips said in an email that the recent increase in oil prices is a promising indicator of future industry growth. But high oil prices don’t immediately result in growth she said.

She said ConocoPhillips in Alaska is focused on expanding drilling and production in existing fields which includes projects in the Alpine field Greater Mooses Tooth-2 and Fiord West where new oil production started in recent months.

ConocoPhillips’ workforce of 960 has held steady the past two years while capital spending in Alaska has remained stable she said.

Willow is an $8 billion project that could create more than 2000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs she said.

With the supplemental environmental review underway ConocoPhillips has not made a final decision to invest in the project.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The explosion occurred inside the pizzeria’s kitchen while FDNY and Con Edison were searching for the source of the odor the FDNY said.

Large companies are disappearing at a much younger age than they used to. According to a study by management consulting firm McKinsey the average lifespan of a company on the S&P 500 list of the publicly traded enterprises was 61 years in the late 1950s. In 2016 it had fallen to just 18 years. Today companies are merged bought-out or simply go belly up at a much faster pace than they used to.

The longevity of companies on another index the Fortune 500 which compiles the largest 500 U.S. publicly traded and private corporations based on revenue is comparable to S&P 500 corporations according to Mark Perry senior fellow of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Perry found that in 2019 only 52 companies have been on the Fortune 500 list since its inception in 1955.

Why only about one in 10 of these companies have lasted for at least 64 years is a matter of academic discussion. One popular explanation is the concept of creative destruction which says that in order to innovate we need to dismantle the old. Companies therefore cease to exist (at least in their original configurations) when they’re supplanted by companies involved in newer industries and innovations. (These are the most innovative companies in 2021.)

We live in a time of accelerated technological disruption and record-high merger and acquisition activity too which might help to explain why modern large companies have shorter lifespans than they used to.

So what about the stalwarts the oldest companies? Why is Bank of New York Mellon founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1784 still around? Part of the reason is that companies in certain industries benefit from their longevity. Fortune 500 companies involved in financial services (like Edward Jones) and energy (like Exxon) tend to have older foundation dates for example.

The largest newest companies (think Amazon Alphabet and Apple) tend to be involved in the latest innovations and newest industries. The youngest company on our list is over 150 years old. Apple is not even 50. (These are America’s most hated companies.)

To determine the oldest companies in the Fortune 500 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data on Fortune’s website. Companies in the 2021 Fortune 500 were ranked based on founding date. Data on annual revenue and number of employees also came from Fortune.

He is survived by his best friend and loving wife of 47 years Sandy (Kunkes) McGill son John McGill and daughter-in-law Jackie (Cordivari) McGill of Cranford NJ son Scott McGill and daughter in law Alice (Tran) McGill of Broomall PA Brother David McGill and his wife Adrienne Sisters Denise (McGill) Avallone and her husband Roger and Maureen (McGill) Howley and her husband Michael; Brother-in-laws Anthony Dilodovico Mitchell Kunkes and his wife Lenora Paglia; and four treasured grandchildren. Predeceased by parents John and Teresa McGill brother Terrence McGill and sister Mary Ellen Dilodovico.

John was born and raised in the Graham Beach section of Staten Island NY; one of six children to John and Teresa. After attending and graduating from New Dorp High School for the seemingly sole purpose of meeting Sandy in Earth Science class he spent a career in gas utility construction as an Operating Engineer and Shop Steward with Con Edison in Manhattan and other private companies in New Jersey. Marrying Sandy and settling later in Howell NJ with their two sons and then retiring to Bordentown NJ.

Like his father before him he loved working with his hands and was an avid modeler and craftsman. No one worked better with duct tape and liquid nails. He was an avid cycler and could often be found circling the Manasquan reservoir daily at dawn sharing sunrise photos with family and friends. His passion for loud music and laughter would only be surpassed by his love for others. He found joy and enlightenment in relationships and conversation with family friends and strangers.

It wasn’t until later in life that he had found his true purpose: As “Pa” to his four grandchildren. These were his people. His perfect audience his ice cream crew. The highlights of his days and the proudest of his accomplishments.

A kind thoughtful and compassionate man he gave all of himself to those who knew him well and to those whom he had just met. Taken from us too soon as the best always are.

Relatives and friends are invited to attend a visitation Wednesday July 6 2022 from 10:00 AM-1:00 PM with a funeral service starting at 11:00 AM at the Huber-Moore Funeral Home located at 517 Farnsworth Ave. Bordentown NJ 08505. A repast will be held following the service and visitation.

The family will be sitting Shiva at the home of Sandy McGill on Wednesday July 6th from 7-9 PM Thursday July 7th from 1-4 pm and 7-9 PM and Friday July 8th from 1-4 PM. Memorial contributions in John’s memory may be made to Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/"

Friends

Canopy Growth was crushed this week falling in the U.S. by 25.5%. The stock is now down in 2022 by a lot more than the 54.7% decline in the Global Cannabis Stock Index falling 67.8% during the year-to-date and a stunning 95% since early 2021:

Canopy Growth Since Inception (in Canada)

We first highlighted the convertible debt as an upcoming challenge in late December when the stock was near US$9.62. We followed up in February calling out three companies that had too much debt at the time and might need to sell some stock. For Canopy Growth we pointed out that as of their Q3 they moved from net cash to net debt. At the time the stock was trading at about 2X tangible book value. The company waited until the stock fell a lot to improve its liquidity. At a price of US$2.50-3.50 the number of shares it will issue later this month is tremendous.

While we are more optimistic due to the pending resolution of the large convertible debt outstanding we aren’t especially bullish on the name: There are no holdings of the name in our model portfolios at 420 Investor. The transactions to buy Wana Brands and Jetty Extracts give us great concern. There is a chance that the company could be out the purchase price and never able to actually close the deals. Canopy Growth has spent more than $366 million in cash and stock for the acquisitions of the majority of these companies and could ultimately face a write-down.

Canopy Growth’s market share in Canada has been in decline. Investors have looked to the company as a potential leader but the company has failed to deliver. Even with the convertible debt deal helping to address the debt situation we remind readers that the company has a C$900 million credit facility due in 2026. Of course there is still more convertible debt too and it is due in June 2023.

With the price down so much we wanted to share the change in our perspective. While we aren’t really bullish on Canopy Growth relative to peers we are no longer bearish on the price. At C$3.66 we get a market cap of roughly C$1.5 billion based on the approximately 403 million shares outstanding. This is 1X tangible book value half the level from early 2022. It’s important to realize that most of the potentially dilutive securities are far from their exercise prices. As of 3/31 the company had long-term debt of about $1.5 billion and cash and short-term investments totaling less than $1.4 billion. The current enterprise value then is roughly C$1.6 billion.

Taking into account what has been announced with respect to conversions of the convertible note (assuming US$3) the share-count will issue about 68 million shares which based on the current price would boost the market cap to more than C$1.7 billion. We expect that given the cash burn will be less than fiscal 2022’s C$545.8 million we project it will be about C$200 million. This would leave the enterprise value at about C$1.8-1.9 billion based on current prices. Recall that Constellation invested a lot more than that for a partial stake years ago.

Looking at fiscal 2024 projections the analysts expect revenue could increase from about C$521 million in fiscal 2023 which isn’t that different from fiscal 2022’s C$520 million to about C$698 million. The enterprise value is just 2.7X this amount. The company is projected to continue improving its loss of EBITDA but the 2024 forecast is still -C$124 million.

At this point the Canopy Growth stock price seems awfully low but we don’t bet the stock is a great performer until it begins to generate a profit. One positive outcome would be for the beverage business to become much more lucrative. We think this will not only improve the numbers but this development could get Constellation to take them out modestly higher. Also the ability to close those U.S. acquisitions would likely boost the numbers and raise the interest in acquisition for Constellation Brands.

For those who have shorted Canopy Growth this convertible debt conversion with the VWAP over the next couple of weeks playing a big role looks like a chance to flatten one’s position to us.

It’s the 4th of July weekend. We have been saying cannabis stocks could fly and as prices are at all time lows it could be a great time to give 420 Investor a try.

New Cannabis Ventures publishes curated articles as well as exclusive news. Here is some of the most interesting business content from this week:

Episode 5 of Alchemy of Souls starts with us in the past seeing more of Mu-Deok’s history. As a child she was amazed by her father who happened to be a constellation recorder mage for Cheonbugwan. Unfortunately he was killed and she witnessed this happen tears stinging her face in shock.

With the young girl looking over her deceased parents she was approached by Jin-Mu who actually offered to train her. He took the girl out to the dark recesses of the mountains where she trained and honed her skills.

When she returned to the world she showed up as Naksu but of course she’s now returning to that very place as Mu-Deok which is pretty poetic. And that place in question is called Danhyanggok.

Mu-Deok and Jang Uk head there but the latter can smell chicken. It turns out it’s actually being cooked at a cabin nearby as it soon becomes apparent someone else is staying there. There’s even dog outside too. Jang Uk queries Mu-Deok whether this is an elaborate ploy from Mu-Deok to set up a home for them. She’s quick to write off that idea though!

Meanwhile the leader of Jinyowon gathers the mages of Daeho to hold a Unanimous Assembly. Aside from Jang Gang and his family all eleven convene together and have a big meeting. This is all in preparation for the upcoming duel between the Crown Prince and Jang Uk.

With the head of the families gathered together they hear that Uk has been stripped of his title. As he’s had a lot of teachers – some of which sitting around the table – they write off Uk’s abilities and claim he has no power. Park Jin speaks up though and decides to shoulder the humiliation for Songrim should Jang Uk lose this duel.

Over in Danhyanggok the owner of the cabin returns learning from his faithful mutt that there’s a soul shifter inside. This explains the red aura it was able to see earlier on. He thanks the dog for his help given the soul has no malice right now and wouldn’t have been able to see her.

Just before using his powers to kill her he thinks twice. When he turns around he finds Jang Uk standing before him with his sword. He removes the bracelet and lunges at the guy. However the stranger effortlessly shrugs our protagonist off and easily thwarts him with magic of his own.

Jang Uk refses to answer the guy’s questions and calls for Mu-Deok to flee. She does not and this conflict spills over in the morning.

Mu-Deok and Jang Uk begin bickering about who this guy is; he instantly believes they’re married from the way they’re talking to one another. This guy is certainly something though having mastered Jipsu and operating way above the Ryusu level given he can control fire. Not only that he also shows off his powers in controlling water through the Chisu technique too.

However there are bigger problems afoot. Given Jang Uk has been drinking all the water from the pot of tea he’s shocked to learn this actually lowers sexual libido through the use of chaste herbs. He’s shocked and believes the guy is lying. As for Mu-Deok she realizes this mage is the infamous Hemp Master Lee. He too has cut off his libido to focus more on magic.

Mu-Deok thinks it’s a good idea Jang Uk follow suit telling him that “impotence is a small sacrifice.” Jang Uk is frustrated and slams his fist down on the table; the bowl flies across and smashes Mu-Deok in the face. Despite blood trickling down her face she smiles warmly as she realizes this is his Chisu energy trickling out.

While this is going on Yul seems to find Songrim’s spirit plaque after chasing a wagoner. Park Jin tasks him with finding out for certain whether it’s actually his or not.

At the same time Jin-Mu continues to scheme deciding to move Kil Joo’s soul into a eunuch shortly. Interestingly Jin-mu has a soul ejector he could use too.

Back with Jang Uk though he continues to learn under the guidance of Master Lee. He encourages Jang Uk to lt him be his teacher properly pointing out that his last pupil head off and work at an infirmary. And that guy? None other than Heo Yeom of course! Small world!

As for Mu-Deok she happens to be in town wanting to spread the rumour that Jang-Uk has already mastered Ryusu. Unfortunately she’s stopped by Kil-Joo and his men who grow suspicious of her believing her to be Naksu. Only she obviously doesn’t have a blue mark and that throws him off her scent.

Mu-Drok drops to her knees before the Crown Prince asking for help. She claims that Jang-Uk is shaking in fear at the prospect of fighting the prince. She also doesn’t want the guards to be sniffing around her from now on. The Crown Prince eventually agrees to help.

Yul and Dang-gu arrive at Danhyanggok intending to find out about this Spirit Plaque. On the way though Yul finds the spot that he and Mu-Deok shared in the past and reminisces. Speaking of which Mu-Deok and Jang-Uk do eventually show up but when they do Mu-Deok is still drunk from her encounter with the Prince and falls into Yul’s arms.

Back at the palace Park Jin learns that an unknown guy has broken through the barrier and is currently at the gates. It’s Master Lee! He’s shown up to see Yeom and asks for his help presumably with the corpse he earlier escaped with that floated down-river. This one is also petrified like the others we’ve seen.

As the episode closes out Mu-Deok reminisces on an old tree she’s fond of from her past one she was able to ascend when she was Naksu. With no way of reaching the top by simply climbing now Jang Uk promises to help her ascend. This is his motivation going forward intending to reach Chisu level in order to make this a reality.

The Episode Review

As the weeks pass Alchemy of Souls really does feel like a live-action version of Demon Slayer and Avatar. That’s not necessarily a bad thing though as this show has its own flair and style something that we’re starting to see more of now that we’re five episodes in.

The worldbuilding in this show has been great and Alchemy of Souls has managed to deliver deep rich lore in a relatively short space of time. However it does also complicate matters especially with four different families lots of interpersonal drama and the different locations too.

Interestingly it appears that Naksu’s father may actually have been killed for something to do with prophesying Jang Uk’s birth or a significant element of his life going forward especially if constellations are involved.

Although there isn’t a massive amount of development plot wise this episode this chapter does help to deepen the character ties and introduce Master Lee whom I’m assuming is going to be an important character going forward.

Either way though this unique weekend drama is certainly shaping up to be one of the must-watch shows this year.",,,,,,,,,

It was in 1922 that Jobling’s won the licence for the manufacture of the brand which had taken America by storm where it was made by Corning Glass Works thanks to its durability in the kitchen.

Over the decades all Pyrex glassware in homes across Britain and the Commonwealth (except Canada) was made by the highly-skilled workers in the factory in Millfield.

The glassworks was the biggest employer after the shipyards in the then town with generations of the same family often crafting glass a skill that dates back to AD674 on Wearside where French glaziers created Britain’s first stained glass.

But in 2007 centuries of tradition came crashing down when the Wear Glass Works owned by Arc ceased production and closed for good.

It’s a factory of which many people in the city hold fond memories and Shauna Gregg archives collections and exhibitions officer at Sunderland Museum & Winter Gardens say it’s been great to take a trip down memory lane with former workers for the Pyrex100 exhibition.

The first phase of the exhibition which has been assisted by funding from Esmée Fairbairn Collections Fund looks at some of the art glass made by Jobling’s in the 1930s.

The range was an experiment by the firm at a time when their highly lucrative licence to produce Pyrex was under review. Designers were recruited from France to produce modern glass in up-to-date colours.

Pyrex 100 exhibition at Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens.

They imitated the more expensive French products of the 1920s and 1930s such as Lalique. It was much cheaper than glass made by the French firms aiming at stylish though not rich customers.

The range was only made for a few years and although not a profitable line in its time Jobling’s art glass is popular with collectors.

""I actually visited the factory in 2007 on the last day of production through my work at the museum” explained Shauna. “At one time most people in Sunderland were related to or knew someone who worked in the factory. The best part of the exhibition has been chatting to the people who used to work there. It was a factory with a very social side to it with things like the Queen of Glass competition and sports days. It was also very flexible for women for childcare.”

Although the museum has a permanent glass display the Pyrex100 display in the Art Gallery features pieces from the museum collection that aren’t usually on display as well as loan pieces.

The first phase of Pyrex100 features Art Glass made in Sunderland

There’s also a section of contemporary glass works including pieces depicting virus structures by Luke Jerram whose Museum of the Moon installation recently wowed the crowds at Durham Cathedral.

The first phase of the exhibition will be on display until August. From September the display will look at the more iconic Pyrex pieces famous for their distinctive patterns which proved a hit in post-war kitchens when housewives looked to improve their skills.

""Pyrex was directly marketed to housewives” explained Shauna. “It came at a time when society changed from servants doing the work to labour-saving devices and Pyrex reflected this.”

The glassware’s resistant and easy to clean properties made it a must-have kitchen accessory and its durability meant it was so difficult to break that it would often be passed down to other family members.

Shauna said: “It was a popular wedding gift and patterns like the Chelsea were big sellers. It was so durable that it would be in people’s kitchens for decades and that’s why they have such fond memories of it especially now when we have more of a throwaway culture.

""I can still remember my gran’s blue Pyrex mixing bowl and all the biscuits and cakes that were made in it.”

So anyone who wants to fill up at a Costco gas station will have to be a member beginning Tuesday — the day after the July 4 holiday.""The practice of offering members-only gasoline sales does not violate any of New Jersey's consumer protection laws"" said Steven Barnes director of communications for the Office of the New Jersey Attorney General.

In 2004 Costco and other warehouse clubs were told restricting gasoline sales to members would violate state law after the retailer posted signs at pumps requiring drivers to present a membership card. The membership card requirement ultimately was abandoned by those companies operating in the Garden State.

The attorney general's office in its recent statement did not explain how it came to a different conclusion in 2004.

Earlier:Costco wants to limit gas station fill ups to members but is it allowed in New Jersey?

Costco has not responded to requests for comment on the reason behind its plan to turn away anyone from its gas pumps who is not an active club member. Its gas prices are often lower than its competitors and its lines are sometimes longer than a few cars.

Meanwhile BJ's has continued to serve all motorists gas despite its longstanding station signs that say ""members only.""

A Costco sign posted in June at its gas station pumps in Mount Laurel announces a new policy to serve only its active card members

A basic annual Costco membership costs $60.

Gas prices at many New Jersey stations are hovering under $5 a gallon with some Exxon stations having among the highest prices exceeding $5 a gallon.

Meanwhile Barnes said the attorney general's Division of Consumer Affairs encourages New Jersey residents to contact the division if they become aware of or may be subject to price gouging at stations in New Jersey and file a complaint .

""The Division of Consumer Affairs is committed to standing up for New Jersey's consumers in the face of unfair and deceptive acts and practices"" Barnes added.

July 3 2022

Story By Mike McGlothlin

Has the used truck market gone mad? Sort of. Coinciding with the supply chain issues limiting the availability of virtually all new vehicles collectors enthusiasts and especially car buyers on tighter budgets turned to alternative means of transportation when the shortage hit. Of course we all know what happened to the used car market after that. Prices exploded and in fact continue to hold steady at their “potentially new” going rates. The story is no different for diesel trucks which often command a premium not only for their engines but because they’re capable of so much hard work.

But while the used diesel pickup market has changed prices haven’t skyrocketed as much as you think—so long as you’re willing to put some effort into your search. Yes price-gouging is occurring but so are reasonable sales both privately and at dealerships. And yes you’re likely going to have to hunt in order to find the right truck for the right price but it’s 100-percent doable—even in today’s wild market. Below we’re highlighting the used diesels that can not only be had for a reasonable dollar amount but that have proven track records of being rock-solid reliable.

For the record we’re talking about clean rust-free trucks here—not the local township’s 300000-mile plow truck with a body and frame on the verge of rusting in half. Happy hunting!

OBS Fords (’94.5-‘97)

Let’s start with the survivors the old body style (OBS) Fords. The trucks that would’ve rusted out more than a decade ago if they lived up north but that can still be found—albeit with some faded paint to contend with—down in Texas New Mexico Arizona California and select other southern states. They were equipped with the first 7.3L Power Stroke V-8 the non-intercooled version that is known to be ultra-reliable. The trucks themselves are simple in nature and were at the tail end of a long production run (1980-1997) so parts are readily available in junkyards or through the aftermarket.

The Current Going Rate For A Clean OBS

It’s fairly safe to say you’re not going to find a clean OBS Ford for less than $10000 anymore but you don’t (and shouldn’t) have to spend $25000. Luckily with a 7.3L under the hood higher miles isn’t a concern. For a well-preserved ’94.5-’97 with 160000 to 300000 miles on the clock (4x4 or two-wheel drive crew cab or super cab and single rear wheel or dually) anywhere from $11500 to $18000 is a typical current asking price. However for low low miles (you know unicorns) you’ll be opening your wallet to the tune of $30000 if not more. To help take some of the needle-in-a-haystack out of finding a clean OBS Ford take a look at Handpicked Trucks a company dedicated to finding and selling affordable versions of ’92-’97 Fords.

P-Pumped Second-Gen’s (’96-‘98)

We clarify “P-pumped” here because some second-gens (’98.5-‘02) were equipped with the VP44-fueled 24-valve 5.9L Cummins rather than the P-pumped 12-valve 5.9L version we’re talking about. And why do we zero in on the ’96-’98 model years when they were available in ’94 and ‘95? Because the ’96-’98 model years are slightly more desirable versions of Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 series trucks thanks to the updated transmissions (namely the 47RE) they came with. On to the selling points. 1. The 12-valve 5.9L Cummins is stupid simple requiring very few electronics to start and function. 2. The Bosch P7100 holds near-endless performance potential in addition to lasting as long as the engine. 3. As for both the Cummins and the P-pump they’re known to last 500000 miles without any major overhaul of either component taking place.

The Current Going Rate For A Clean P-pumped Second-Gen

Like OBS Fords it’s best to look west and south for a clean second-gen. Corrosion is a huge problem for these trucks in the rust belt and you’d be hard-pressed to even find a rust-free version in a northern state. Once you’ve pinpointed your search area expect to pay a premium over what the OBS Fords are bringing. However there is no reason to pay $30000 or more unless you really want to. From reasonably low miles (160000) to more than 230000 asking prices tend to begin at $14000 for a 4x4 quad cab 2500 and peak around $27000 to $28000. For a low-mile unicorn i.e. a ’98 Ram quad cab with rear opening doors and the 12-valve Cummins expect to pay more than that though. At this point sellers definitely know what they have with one of the latter trucks in their possession.

O.G. Super Duty’s ('99-'03)

Ford developed the Super Duty right when the towing torque and payload wars between the Big Three really started burning hot back around the turn of the century—and Ford put everything on the line to ensure its product was of high quality. For that reason many of these trucks are still on the road today. Granted those roads are primarily in the southern and southwestern portions of the U.S. but the fact remains that they’re still out there. These trucks boast the second-generation 7.3L Power Stroke the one that came with an intercooler and a wastegated turbocharger—and that packed more horsepower (up to 275 hp) and torque (up to 525 lb-ft) right out of the box.

The Current Going Rate For A Clean ’99-’03 Super Duty

A well-kept 7.3L Power Stroke-equipped ’99-’03 Super Duty is going to command a few more dollars than an OBS Ford. However as a much more capable truck (towing and payload) as well as being a few years newer they should. Just don’t fall for the 20000-mile version selling for $50000 (again unless you want to). Rust-free quarter-million-mile Super Duty’s sell for anywhere from $17000 to $25000 at the present time you just have to find yours. Once again look south and west for a cancer-free candidate. And don’t lose sleep over a 250000-mile engine it’s just getting started.

LB7 Chevrolet HD’s ('01-'04)

GM’s answer to the Super Duty Ford’s Navistar-built 7.3L Power Stroke and Dodge’s legendary Cummins was the GMT800 platform the 6.6L Duramax V-8 and the Allison 1000. How did that work out? The Duramax and Allison proved so rock-solid that they both live on today more than 20 years later in GM’s latest and greatest HDs. The original Duramax the LB7 produced 300 hp and 520 lb-ft of torque and the ’01-’04 Chevrolet (and GMC) HD’s still continue to hold their own when it comes to towing. Add to that the fact that these trucks were fairly light made use of an independent front suspension and could knock down 20-22 mpg or more on the highway thanks to the five-speed Allison and you have one of the best used diesel truck options on the market.

The Current Going Rate For A Clean ’01-’04 Silverado/Sierra HD

While the LB7 Duramax did have injector issues by now most of these trucks have been treated to a fresh set with the Bosch replacements being updated to solve the internal ball seat issue (it’s complicated but there is more reading on that here). To sum things up don’t fear this engine it is one of the most reliable Duramax V-8’s ever produced—and given the Duramax’s reputation for durability that is saying something. Once again your best bet is to pluck an ’01-’04 GM HD from a milder climate. And as for price point $11000 (high miles) to $19000 (moderate miles) is the rough going rate right now with 100000-mile trucks commanding $24000 or more on dealer lots (and a couple thousand less privately). At the same time we’ve seen 180000 to 250000-mile models sell for much less (think $13000) so keep your eyes peeled when you’re on the hunt for one of these gems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vbm90LWlmLWJ1dC13aGVuLXVubGVzcy1wYXB1YS1uZXctZ3VpbmVhLXByZXBhcmVzLW5vdy10aGUtbmV4dC1iaWctZWFydGhxdWFrZS1jb3VsZC13cmVhay1oYXZvYy1pbi1sYWUtMTg1NzA40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Not if but when: unless Papua New Guinea prepares now the next big earthquake could wreak havoc in Lae,"Earthquakes can be especially devastating for developing countries where competing priorities can stymie resource allocation towards earthquake resilience.

Even in tectonically active areas where tectonic plates meet and scrape against one another large earthquakes may not occur often enough to seem like a priority compared to more immediate concerns. That is until one devastates a populated area as we’re now seeing with the tragedy in Afghanistan.

Nowhere is this more true than in Papua New Guinea. PNG is situated in one of the most tectonically active areas in the world – one that experiences more than 100 earthquakes of magnitude five or greater each year.

PNG’s stability and economic development are of great interest to Australia. Yet earthquake scientists know recent development gains could be threatened by earthquakes.

We helped create an updated national seismic hazard map for PNG based on modern earthquake data and knowledge of active faults.

The map was developed in a partnership between Geoscience Australia and the PNG government’s Port Moresby Geophysical Observatory. First published in 2019 it’s now providing the backbone for our ongoing work into earthquake risk assessment and management in PNG.

Eyes on Lae

The high level of earthquake activity in PNG was already recognised in national earthquake hazard maps developed in 1982. But the poor-quality data used in these early hazard maps resulted in broad areas of moderately elevated hazard – and did not reflect the very high hazard levels near active faults.

Worryingly PNG’s current building codes are still based on these outdated maps. Buildings and infrastructure near active faults may be vulnerable to large local earthquakes – particularly since PNG has adopted “Western” construction materials such as masonry which can be less resilient than traditional wooden structures.

The latest national seismic hazard map shows a particularly pronounced hazard in Lae PNG’s second-largest city. Lae sits adjacent to a major active tectonic plate boundary known as the Ramu-Markham fault system.

With a population of more than 100000 many lives and livelihoods would be threatened by a large earthquake. Lae is also a major economic hub for the country. It has the largest port and is the starting point of the transport artery running through mainland PNG.

Concerns raised by the latest hazard map about Lae’s potential vulnerabilities has led us to initiate the Lae Earthquake Risk Project involving the University of Technology in Lae and the University of Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby.

Our research goal is to better understand and model what the potential impacts of a Ramu-Markham earthquake may be and how Lae can boost its resilience in the event of a major earthquake.

How could a Ramu-Markham earthquake happen?

Large earthquakes happen when two tectonic plates move against each other.

In the case of the Ramu-Markham fault system two plates are converging or moving towards each other. This movement results in friction along the fault which builds up stress. An earthquake happens when the built-up stress surpasses the frictional strength along the fault.

While we often think of a geologic fault as a “line” a major fault system like the Ramu-Markham consists of many segments. Any one of these segments (or a combination) may be active.

Segments are often overlapping and each has a distinct level of activity. We can record this activity using precise GPS measurements of ground movements also called “strain”.

Our work started by identifying exactly which segments of the Ramu-Markham fault system are active and accumulating strain energy that might be released in an earthquake. We found the ground movement in this fault system can be explained by activity on a single segment called the Gain fault.

This fault segment is more than 100km long and most of Lae lies within 15km of it. A large earthquake at this distance could cause widespread damage.

The Bumbu fault

Although GPS measurements of ground movement are consistent with activity being confined to the Gain fault only this may not be the only way to explain the data.

The Bumbu fault is another segment of the Ramu-Markham fault system further south that cuts through Lae’s CBD. If it’s active it is of potentially greater concern than the Gain fault.

Studies from the 1990s on the geology of Lae’s urban centre suggest a “major tectonic event” happened about 250 years ago possibly on the Bumbu fault which changed the course of the Bumbu River flowing through Lae today.

Although this event was prior to European contact it’s supported by local oral histories and other analyses of elevation data taken from around Lae. Questions remain over whether it was a single major event or a series of smaller events over an extended period.

In either case being able to verify activity on the Bumbu fault would raise Lae’s earthquake risk to a new level.

Future work

The Lae Earthquake Risk Project is ongoing. In addition to more GPS measurements of ground motion it will involve setting up earthquake-monitoring stations in Lae and advanced satellite-based radar analysis. The latter should provide a much more detailed picture of which fault segments are active.

Once we know which active segments can produce earthquakes we can begin to estimate the intensity of shaking these earthquakes may cause in Lae – and what effects they may have on the city’s built environment.

This will hopefully provide specific guidance for constructing new buildings in Lae and strengthening existing ones. These are the most important steps that can be taken to reduce the impact of future earthquakes.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS Australia is scheduled to travel to India early next year for a four-match Test series.

The Aussies have failed to win a Test series in India since 2004.

Pat Cummins hopes Oz experience of playing in Sri Lanka and Pakistan will help them prepare better.

Elated by his team’s impressive display in the first Test against Sri Lanka Australian skipper Pat Cummins said his team’s experience of playing in the island nation will help them prepare better for the India series next year. The world's number one Test team is scheduled to travel to India early next year to take part in a four-match Test series. Australia last toured India in 2017 but failed to seal the series despite winning the opening Test.

The right-arm speedster who was handed the Australian red-ball captaincy last year feels turning wickets in Sri Lanka should be a good preparation for new players ahead of the four-match series in India.

After Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 10 wickets inside three days on Friday to go 1-0 up in the two-match series the premier pacer was asked whether the Baggy Greens can begin looking forward to the India tour. Cummins said that back-to-back wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka have encouraged his side.

The Australian skipper who is yet to lose a game said that he expects the likes of Alex Carey Travis Head and Cameron Green to develop from the Sri Lanka tour and believes Australia must win overseas to establish their superiority.

""Now that we've won a few games we can look forward. We've had Marnus (Labuschagne) Travis Head Cam Green Alex Carey who haven't played Test matches in conditions that have spun this much. We have a big series next year in India so this can really help develop and fast-track our batters. If you want to be the number one Test team in the world you’ve got to be winning overseas"" Cummins was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

""Swepson hasn’t played on wickets like this before so you absolutely learn so much from these tours. Fortunately we'll be learning at the same time as having a win. It’s part of the environment that we are trying to create"" he added.

Australia has not won a Test series in India since 2004 going down 0-2 0-2 0-4 and 1-2 in their last four visits. But they will hope to end the 19-year drought next year following a series victory in Pakistan and a 10-wicket win against Sri Lanka on Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vY3JpY2tldC5vbmUvY3JpY2tldC1uZXdzL3BhdC1jdW1taW5zLWV5ZXMtdGVzdC1zZXJpZXMtd2luLWluLWluZGlhLWFmdGVyLWF1c3RyYWxpYXMtZ2FsbGUtd2luLzYyZTE0NmMzMzA5NGE0ZDVkNmRiZDU4M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pat Cummins eyes Test series win in India after Australia's Galle win,"Pat Cummins eyes Test series win in India after Australia's Galle win

Australia Test captain Pat Cummins feels the ongoing series against Sri Lanka will help the Men from the Down Under prepare better for their much-anticipated series against India next year.

The Aussies do not have great memories from their last tour of India as the hosts handed them a 2-1 defeat in a Test series in 2017. The Aussies have failed to win a Test series in India since 2004 and they will look to end the 19-year drought next year when Pat Cummins & Co. tour India for the four-match Test series.

The right-arm pacer feels that the turning wickets in the Island nation should be good preparation for new players ahead of their four-match Test series in India.

When asked whether Australia have started looking forward to the India tour Cummins said that consecutive wins against subcontinent nations like Pakistan and Sri Lanka have boosted their confidence.

The Australian Test skipper also expects Alex Carey Travis Head and Cameron Green to learn from the Sri Lanka tour and believes the Men in Yellow must win the overseas series to stamp their authority on Test cricket.

""Now that we've won a few games we can look forward. We've had Marnus (Labuschagne) Travis Head Cam Green and Alex Carey who haven't played Test matches in conditions that have spun this much"" Cummins was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

""We have a big series next year in India so this can really help develop and fast-track our batters. If you want to be the number one Test team in the world you've got to be winning overseas.

""Swepson hasn't played on wickets like this before so you absolutely learn so much from these tours. Fortunately we'll be learning at the same time as having a win. It's part of the environment that we are trying to create"" he added.

Pat Cummins who was handed the Australian red-ball captaincy last year hasn't lost a single match yet. After beating Pakistan on their home soil the Aussies continued their dominance over Sri Lanka.

The Pat Cummins-led side recently outplayed Sri Lanka by ten wickets in their first Test at Galle. Nathan Lyon was the pick of the bowlers as he scalped nine wickets including a five-wicket haul.

Usman Khawaja did the talking with the bat smacking 71 runs while Cameron Green was adjudged Player of the Match for his blistering 109-ball 77.

Australia will lock horns with Sri Lanka in the second Test starting from July 8 at Galle. Earlier Australia sealed the T20I series while the hosts claimed the ODI leg of the ongoing tour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYXV0b2NvbXBvbmVudHNpbmRpYS5jb20vYW50aWZyZWV6ZS1jb29sYW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antifreeze Coolants,"Valvoline introduced a range of antifreeze coolants. Deepti Thore looks at the proposition of even operating temperatures in extreme drive conditions.

A vehicle is dependent on various lubricants to stay up and running. Coolants are crucial here! Here again the breed of an antifreeze coolant is deemed quintessential for extreme temperatures to help the vehicle maintain an even operational temperature. Like most fluids that need a vehicle to be drained and replaced at regular intervals coolants are no different. The coolant levels need to be monitored periodically and checked at least twice a year—before the summer heat and before the winter cold. To address the need for optimising engine performance in such varied and extreme climatic conditions Valvoline offers a range of Antifreeze or engine coolants for different duty cycles. The Cummin JV partner made its presence felt at the recently concluded Excon 2k21.

The most common variety of liquid antifreeze is an IAT coolant formula or Inorganic Additive Technology. ZEREX™ Original Green a type of IAT coolant is claimed to be a decade old proven formula aimed at corrosion resistance. Another common antifreeze formula is Dex-Cool® a coolant formula approved for use in GM Ford Chrysler and SAAB vehicles. The ZEREX™ Dex-Cool coolant also complies with multiple industry specifications for a wider acceptance. Contrary to green coloured base the base of the latter is distinguished by its orange sheen. The good part is that the new generation coolants can also be used in older generation vehicles by using special additives available in the market. Solutions like the AlugardPlus® are widely available. In other products Zerex™ G-05™ which is of HOAT (Hybrid OAT) type is a silicate coolant distinguished by a yellow sheen. The ZEREX™ G-48 Hybrid OAT (HOAT) is phosphate-free and turquoise in colour. ZEREX™ Asian Vehicle Phosphated HOAT (P-HOAT) type is available in either blue or pink base while the ZEREX™ G-40 another silicate variant HOAT (Si-OAT) has a purple hue. The company also recently introduced an advanced Glycol-based full-antifreeze coolant claimed to generate a high cooling formulation that offers the twin advantage of an extra-long service life and a superior corrosion resistance.

In general an AntiFreeze coolant is a coloured liquid that is mixed with water usually at a 50/50 ratio to help synchronise engine. As the temperature outside changes from hot to cold the coolant is pumped throughout the engine block to maintain an even operating temperature. Antifreeze does more than just regulate temperature contrary to popular notion. It also aids in the maintenance of a corrosion free environment when maintained at optimal levels. Some of the directly known use cases include keeping the radiator from freezing or overheating. With its expertise in this sphere Valvoline offers a variety of coolants and caters to diverse markets like American Asian and the European from motorcycles to passenger vehicles to the commercial vehicles (including solutions for agri and off-highway segments). Each can of coolant is formulated to keep its designated engine type optimally operational.

While the company continues to develop different formulations to fill the white spaces there is a strong speculation of acquisition looming large. According to a Wall Street Journal report Saudi state oil giant Aramco is eyeing the acquisition of Valvoline’s lubricants business which also includes the antifreeze coolant range. The company in 2021 is said to have hinted at wanting to separate its profitable retails business from the global operations business. A developing story beyond Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) the company is also known to be gearing up to meet the demands of emobility as per recent revelations by Sandeep Kalia Managing Director at Valvoline Cummins Pvt. Ltd. According to Rajesh Chauhan Head of Sales Cummins & Industrial at Valvoline Cummins Pvt. Ltd. the company has established close knit ties with nearly 14000 mechanics as part of an upskilling exercise earlier this year. Globally the company piloted its EV services in the US at its retail stores in line with the vision to extend state-of-the-art prognosis as a service solution to owners OEMs and fleet operators. These services extend to battery replacement tyre rotations cabin air-filter replacement wiper replacement and safety inspections in phase-one of the strategy to establish itself as the number one supplier of EV fluids. In Asian markets the company in partnership with Shanghai-based car maintenance service provider Tuhu is already catering to hybrid plug-in hybrid and BEVs. XEV is the suite of Valvoline motor oil battery protection fluid transmission and brake fluids."

More ways to save

Finding makeup products you enjoy can take some trial and error which means you'll be spending more than you planned.

An ex-Sephora employee has explained how you can return any products that didn't work out for you.

On TikTok where she goes by MaddieBWells she said most people don't know they can return products to Sephora even if they've been used.

The only exception is that the item you want to return cannot be more than 33% used.

She also said there's a way to get around Sephora's return policy which states a product must be returned within 30 days with a receipt for a full refund.

If you don't have the receipt as long as there's a way to look up the purchase such as with your Beauty Insider rewards account you will be eligible to get a refund.

The refund will be awarded using the same form of payment originally used to make the purchase.

If you return the product 30-60 days after the purchase the terms change she added.

At that point you will be refunded in the form of a merchandise credit or as an exchange.

It's nice to win twice.

Tamron Hall is still pumped after taking home her second Daytime Emmy award for her eponymous talk show.

In New Orleans to celebrate Essence Fest for the first time since the pandemic the star 51 opened up to PEOPLE on Saturday about the difference a few years can make.

""Last time we were here was 2019 we'd just launched the show"" says Hall. ""Now we're back and I just won my second Emmy last week. We're on a natural high and it's great.""

For Hall the moment she found out she won again was surreal. ""I was sitting there in the audience we were back in person. The first Emmy I won we were all at home and I learned on Zoom"" she said.

""But to be in the room with all my peers and my team and to receive that honor it was just... I still can't believe it. I thought I heard my name and then I looked at my executive producer Quiana Burns and I said 'Oh they really said my name oh my gosh!'""

Another highlight for Hall was getting to take the trophy home to her biggest little fan.

""The sweetest moment was when Moses was opening the box"" Hall says of her 3-year-old son with husband Steve Greener. I caught a redeye and rushed back home that night and he opened the box. To see him touch the Emmy...I said 'What's that?' And he said 'Emmy'. It was very very special.""

For more on Essence Fest listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.

Hall who famously walked away from her role at the Today show in 2017 says the accolades are ""a confirmation in ways that I'm only now processing."" She adds ""Now that the show is real I don't think about people who said I couldn't do it. I think about the people who told me how to do it and how you do it is by talking to people.""

And with Tamron heading into its fourth season and already renewed for another after that Hall is happy to pass on some sage advice to others entering the daytime space. Asked what tips she'd offer Sherri Shepherd—also in town at Essence Fest to give away a brand new Ford vehicle and promote her new show debuting in the fall—Hall calls upon the words of TV royalty.

""My advice is what Oprah Winfrey gave me. Always know your intention. Why are you doing it? What is the reason for the story the reason for the conversation"" says Hall. ""And that's not just a guiding light in television. That's a guiding light in life. What are your intentions? The greatest who ever did it gave that advice to me so I'll pass it down.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbWlsaWEtYmVjaHJha2lzLXNlcmhhbnQtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1oZXItMTY1NDM5NzI5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emilia Bechrakis Serhant Celebrates Her 37th Birthday in the Sweetest Way,"Emilia Bechrakis Serhant is celebrating her 37th birthday in the sweetest way: with her loved ones by her side and a delicious dessert to slice into!

The father was a man she knew she wouldn’t marry. She considered getting an abortion. But the nearest clinic was four hours away and she couldn’t afford to take off work — so she had the baby girl.

That girl is now 17 and working at a restaurant chain that has not told its employees whether it will cover abortion-related travel expenses though abortion is now prohibited in West Virginia. This past week Ms. Dietrich urged her daughter to find an employer that would cover the expense.

“It would be awesome for her to move to a state that offers it or at least work for a company that says ‘Hey we’ll foot the bill’” Ms. Dietrich said recalling her own struggle years ago to consider the logistics of an abortion. “How was I at 18 going to be able to drive four hours away pay for it take off work? There would’ve been no way.”

In the week since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade ending nearly 50 years of federal abortion rights dozens of large U.S. companies have said they will cover expenses for employees who need to travel out of state for abortions. Some companies even said they would relocate employees from states where abortion is banned.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2022 John Deere Classic feels like it’s J.T. Poston’s to lose after the 29-year-old has played his way into a 3-shot lead through 54 holes. Behind him is a three-way tie at 16 under between Scott Stallings Emiliano Grillo and Denny McCarthy.

Poston is a one-time Tour-winner who torched TPC Deere Run earlier this week with an opening 62. Stallings has bagged three Tour victories in his career and Grillo has even won once during his rookie year back in 2015. It’s McCarthy who has never won on Tour even if he’s been the man in contention lately.

It was McCarthy who hung around very late into the U.S. Open at Brookline a couple weeks ago finishing T7 and at the Memorial tournament two weeks before that finishing T5. A win for him Sunday would earn him a berth in the 2023 Masters his first time competing at Augusta National. It would also bring in his biggest career payday.

Sunday’s winner will come away with $1.28 million of the $7.1 million total purse while second place will clear just under a million at $773900. Check out the complete purse breakdown for the entire field below.

J.T. Poston picked up his second PGA Tour win at TPC Deere Run the midsummer stop between the U.S. Open and British Open.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZ2F0b3VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbGF0ZXN0LzIwMjIvMDcvMDIvb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHkta25vY2tzLWFoZWFkLW9mLWpvaG4tZGVlcmUtY2xhc3NpYy1maW5hbC1yb3VuZC1qdC1wb3N0b24tc2NvdHQtc3RhbGxpbmdzLWRlbm55LW1jY2FydGh5LXRoZS1vcGVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opportunity knocks ahead of John Deere Classic final round - PGA TOUR,"SILVIS Ill. — When some assess the pack of pursuers trying to prevent leader J.T. Poston from going wire-to-wire to claim a second career victory in Sunday’s final round of the John Deere Classic they might think of a famous and often-repeated line from “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.”



Who are those guys?



But while the annual PGA TOUR affair here in the heartland teed off on Thursday without recent FedExCup winners like Patrick Cantlay Justin Thomas or even crowd favorite in these parts Jordan Spieth one former champion echoes the thoughts of many. This field still represents the strength and depth the TOUR produces year in and year out. And come Sunday a new star will add their name to history.



The eclectic group of 14 players who will start Sunday’s stretch run within seven shots of Poston’s 19-under 194 total have an incredible opportunity to add weight to their resumes. The storylines are endless.



With Poston included that group owns eight career TOUR wins and features just three players who currently rank in the top 70 in the 2021-2022 FedExCup race. It includes one sponsor’s exemption making his third professional start and a 39-year-old Monday qualifier who has made six TOUR starts in his career.



Where else can such a variety of competitors change their lives over 18 more holes of golf? It is a pack of underdogs to be certain but this tournament has often been a bastion of opportunity.



So says Zach Johnson the two-time major championship winner who is arguably the most popular player in the John Deere Classic’s 51-year-history. No one has made more birdies at TPC Deere Run than Johnson.



“It’s going to be an exciting finish” the virtual hometown hero from nearby Cedar Rapids Iowa Johnson says. “There are some guys on that board who may not be household names right now but they will be. The guys here are really really good and they are hungry.”



The 2023 Ryder Cup captain won at Deere Run in 2012 where he needed to hit the shot of his life from a fairway bunker to escape journeyman Troy Matteson in a sudden-death playoff. It was the ninth victory on a 12-win resume that includes the 2007 Masters and 2015 Open Championship.



Johnson finished third or better six times in a seven-year span from 2009-2015 and while some of those years the names at the top had a familiar ring like Steve Stricker others were against those taking the opportunity the Deere has presented in recent times.



A then-teenaged Spieth claimed his first TOUR title in a three-way playoff featuring Johnson and Canadian David Hearn in 2013 before Brian Harman won his first TOUR title as a 27-year-old in 2014.



Bryson DeChambeau Michael Kim and Dylan Frittelli have all since claimed their first TOUR wins at TPC Deere Run.



Opportunity knocks again this year with a winner’s share of a $7.1 million purse 500 FedExCup points and a two-year TOUR exemption awaiting the last man standing. With not just playoff spots on the line so to our valuable points for those chasing Korn Ferry Tour Finals berths.



In addition — because Johnson is the sole survivor among three men in this week’s field who already were exempt — exemptions into the 150th Open Championship two weeks hence at St. Andrews will almost certainly be awarded to win place and show at the conclusion of Sunday’s race.



“That’s a lot of incentive” Johnson said.



Virtually to a man though Poston and leaders of the pursuing pack said looking ahead to all that awaits at the finish line won’t factor — can’t factor — in their process as they take the first tee.



“You know in the back of your head that’s part of it but I’ve been in this position before” Poston said. “I’ve won out here before so I’m just going to try and draw on that and not focus on all the stuff outside of what I’m doing.”



Saturday’s round gave Poston a further reminder that winning is hard. After taking a four-shot lead to the first tee his cushion was down to a single shot with two holes to play. A clutch eagle at the 17th salvaged a 4-under round of 67 and stretched his lead back to three over Scott Stallings Emiliano Grillo and Saturday playing partner Denny McCarthy.



Looking to rediscover the form that produced three wins between 2011 and 2014 Stallings bagged birdies at 15 16 and 17 to book a moving day round of 7-under 64. Grillo who won the Fortinet Championship in 2015 birdied four of the last five holes en route to a 6-under 65. Birdies on 17 and 18 carried McCarthy to a 66.



Although he has yet to win McCarthy came into the tournament as an early favorite with top 10 finishes at the Memorial and the U.S. Open.



Poston is in pretty fine form himself. After sharing second at last week’s Travelers Championship he now has held the lead after all three rounds at Deere Run and will be looking to become the first wire-to-winner at the John Deere since David Frost in 1992 and just the 13th on TOUR since 2015.



Of the 11 other players within seven shots of Poston’s lead only Aussie Cam Davis last year’s Rocket Mortgage Classic champ has a previous TOUR win to call upon but Grillo knows the talent is there star power notwithstanding.



“If you’re there after three rounds you have enough experience you have enough game” Grillo said. “Everybody wants to win. Everybody wants to make the most of the opportunity. Definitely going to be a battle tomorrow.”



At 8-under through three rounds with 35 players ahead of him Johnson doesn’t expect to be part of that battle but he knows from experience Deere Run breeds exciting finishes.



“It’s going to come down to the last hole or two — it always does” he said. “I’m excited. I love watching the finish here.



“The quality of golf is going to be spectacular” Johnson added. “That’s what we have every week. That’s the difficulty. It’s impressive. That’s why the PGA TOUR is the best.”



Who are those guys? Watch and find out.

Poston opened his week with a 62 closed with a 2-under 69 at TPC Deere Run and joined Scott Hoch (1980) and David Frost (1992) as just the third player in tournament history to lead from start to finish.

The win also locked up a spot in the 150th British Open at St. Andrews. Christiaan Bezuidenhout and Emiliano Grillo who tied for second locked up the other two available spots. For tying for second they each earned $631900.

Aten said the airline was seeking eight volunteers to offer their seats on the oversold flight and that each volunteer would be given $10000.

""If you have Apple Pay you’ll even have the money right now"" the flight attendant said according to Aten.

Aten told Fortune his group of eight did not take Delta up on their offer because they were not immediately made aware how many volunteers were needed.

McCrumb told KTVB 7 the offer began at $5000 but would then be increased to $10000.

Many people are making a living online as digital creators. Mark Zuckerberg recently announced some new ways that content creators can make money on Instagram and Facebook.

His brand Meta wants to make it easier for creators to earn money for their work. Some features are already available while others are being tested to be offered later. Learn more about these initiatives below.

For the time being creators can use Facebook and Instagram monetization tools at no cost. These include paid online events subscriptions badges and bulletins. Creators will keep all revenue earned until 2024 when Meta plans to charge creators for the use of these tools.

Interoperable subscriptions

Creators will be able to give their paying subscribers on other platforms access to subscriber-only Facebook groups.

Facebook Stars

Facebook Stars allows creators to monetize their video and audio content through a tipping system. Facebook will be opening this feature to eligible creators so they can earn money from reels live streams and video-on-demand content.

Monetizing Reels

Instagram's Reels Play Bonus program will soon open to a larger pool of creators on Facebook. This will allow creators to cross-post their Instagram Reels to Facebook to monetize on both social media platforms if they meet the bonus criteria.

Creator marketplace

Instagram is currently testing a creator marketplace where creators can get discovered and paid for their work. Brands will be able to use this marketplace to share new partnership and sponsorship opportunities with creators.

Digital collectibles

Testing is currently being done to allow more creators to display their non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Instagram. Meta also hopes to bring this feature to Facebook to allow cross-posting. In the future creators will be able to share NFTs through Instagram Stories.

It'll be interesting to see what creators think about these efforts. If they can more easily make money off of their platforms they'll likely want to create more content.

Other ways to make money online

Being an online creator is one way to make money online. But it's not the only way.

Many people are exploring ways to make a part-time or full-time income online. It could be a solid way to boost your income and help you reach your personal finance goals sooner.

One option is to get a side hustle. Side hustles can allow you to explore a new skill while making more money.

While not all of these opportunities can be done online many can. Side hustles that aren't online-based may offer flexibility -- allowing you to work on the weekends or evenings.

Here are some resources to help you explore more side hustle ideas:

Click here to subscribe to read more stories like this one.

If a heart attack isn’t documented did it really happen? For an artificial intelligence program the answer may very well be “no.” Every year an estimated 170000 people in the United States experience asymptomatic — or “silent” — heart attacks. During these events patients likely have no idea that a blockage is keeping blood from flowing or that vital tissue is dying. They won’t experience any chest pain dizziness or trouble breathing. They don’t turn beet red or collapse. Instead they may just feel a bit tired or have no symptoms at all. But while the patient might not realize what happened the underlying damage can be severe and long-lasting: People who suffer silent heart attacks are at higher risk for coronary heart disease and stroke and are more likely to die within the following 10 years.

But if a doctor doesn’t diagnose that attack it won’t be included in a patient’s electronic health records. That omission can come with dangerous consequences. AI systems are trained on health records sifting through troves of data to study how doctors treated past patients and make predictions that can inform decisions about future care. “That’s what makes a lot of medical AI very challenging” says Ziad Obermeyer an associate professor at the University of California Berkeley who studies machine learning medicine and health policy. “We almost never observe the thing that we really care about.”

Read More About AI in Medicine:

The problem lies in the data – or rather what’s not in the data. Electronic health records only show what doctors and nurses notice. If they can’t see an issue even one as serious as a heart attack then the AI won’t be able to see it either. Similarly doctors may unwittingly encode their own racial gender or socioeconomic biases into the system. That can lead to algorithms that prioritize certain demographics over others entrench inequality and fail to make good on the promise that AI can help provide better care.

One such problem is that medical records can only store information about patients who have access to the medical system and can afford to see a doctor. “Datasets that don’t sufficiently represent certain groups — whether that’s racial groups gender for certain diseases or rare diseases themselves — can produce algorithms that are biased against those groups” says Curtis Langlotz a radiologist and director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging at Stanford University.

Beyond that diagnoses can reflect a doctor’s preconceptions and ideas — about say what might be behind a patient’s chronic pain — as much as they reflect the reality of what’s happening. “The dirty secrets of a lot of artificial intelligence tools is that a lot of the things that seem like biological variables that we’re predicting are in fact just someone’s opinion” says Obermeyer. That means that rather than helping doctors make better decisions these tools are often perpetuating the very inequalities they ought to help avoid.

Decoding Prejudice

When scientists train algorithms to operate a car they know what’s out there on the road. There’s no debate about whether there’s a stop sign school zone or pedestrian ahead. But in medicine truth is often measured by what the doctor says not what’s actually going on. A chest X-ray may be evidence of pneumonia because that’s what a doctor diagnosed and wrote in the health record not because it’s necessarily the correct diagnosis. “Those proxies are often distorted by financial things and racial things and gender things and all sorts of other things that are social in nature” says Obermeyer.

In a 2019 study Obermeyer and colleagues examined an algorithm developed by the health services company Optum. Hospitals use similar algorithms to predict which patients will need the most care estimating the needs of over 200 million people annually. But there’s no simple variable for determining who is going to get the sickest. Instead of predicting concrete health needs Optum’s algorithm predicted which patients were likely to cost more the logic being that sicker people need more care and therefore will be more expensive to treat. For a variety of reasons including income access to care and poor treatment by doctors Black people spend less on health care on average than their white counterparts. Therefore the study authors found that using cost as a proxy measure for health led the algorithm to consistently underestimate the health needs of Black people.

Instead of reflecting reality the algorithm was mimicking and further embedding racial biases in the health care system. “How do we get algorithms to do better than us?” asks Obermeyer. “And not just mirror our biases and our errors?”

Plus determining the truth of a situation — whether a doctor made a mistake due to poor judgment racism or sexism or whether a doctor just got lucky — isn’t always clear says Rayid Ghani a professor in the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University. If a physician runs a test and discovers a patient has diabetes did the physician do a good job? Yes they diagnosed the disease. But perhaps they should have tested the patient earlier or treated their rising blood sugar months ago before the diabetes developed.

If that same test was negative the calculation gets even harder. Should the doctor have ordered that test in the first place or was it a waste of resources? “You can only measure a late diagnosis if an early diagnosis didn’t happen” says Ghani. Decisions about which tests get run (or which patients’ complaints are taken seriously) often end up reflecting the biases of the clinicians rather than the best medical treatment possible. But if medical records encode those biases as facts then those prejudices will be replicated in the AI systems that learn from them no matter how good the technology is.

“If the AI is using the same data to train itself it’s going to have some of those inherent biases” Ghani adds “not because that’s what AI is but because that’s what humans are unfortunately.”’

Addressing Inequality

If wielded deliberately however this fault in AI could be a powerful tool says Kadija Ferryman an anthropologist at Johns Hopkins University who studies bias in medicine. She points to a 2020 study in which AI is used a resource to assess what the data shows: a kind of diagnostic for evaluating bias. If an algorithm is less accurate for women and people with public insurance for example that’s an indication that care isn’t being provided equitably. “Instead of the AI being the end the AI is almost sort of the starting point to help us really understand the biases in clinical spaces” she says.

In a 2021 study in Nature Medicine researchers described an algorithm they developed to examine racial bias in diagnosing arthritic knee pain. Historically Black and low-income patients have been significantly less likely to be recommended for surgery even though they often report much higher levels of pain than white patients. Doctors would attribute this phenomenon to psychological factors like stress or social isolation rather than to physiological causes. So instead of relying on radiologists’ diagnoses to predict the severity of a patients’ knee pain researchers trained the AI with a data set that included knee X-rays and patient’s descriptions of their own discomfort.

Not only did the AI predict who felt pain more accurately than the doctors did it also showed that Black patients’ pain wasn’t psychosomatic. Rather the AI revealed the problem lay with what radiologists think diseased knees should look like. Because our understanding of arthritis is rooted in research conducted almost exclusively on a white population doctors may not recognize features of diseased knees that are more prevalent in Black patients.

It’s much harder to design AI systems like the knee pain algorithm that can correct or check physicians’ biases as opposed to simply mimicking them — and it will require much more oversight and testing than currently exists. But Obermeyer notes that in some ways fixing the bias in AI can happen much faster than fixing the biases in our systems — and in ourselves — that helped create these problems in the first place.

And building AIs that account for bias could be a promising step in addressing larger systemic issues. To change how a machine operates after all you just need a few keystrokes; changing how people think takes much more than that.

IBM’s Failed Revolution

In 2011 IBM’s Watson computer annihilated its human competitors on the trivia show Jeopardy!. Ken Jennings the show’s all-time highest-earning player lost by over $50000. “I for one welcome our new computer overlords” he wrote on his answer card during the final round.

But Watson’s reign was short-lived. One of the earliest — and most high-profile — attempts to use artificial intelligence in health care Watson is now one of medical AI’s biggest failures. IBM spent billions building a vast repository of patient information insurance claims and medical images. Watson Health could (allegedly) plunder this database to suggest new treatments match patients to clinical trials and discover new drugs.

Despite Watson’s impressive database and all of IBM’s bluster doctors complained that it rarely made useful recommendations. The AI didn’t account for regional differences in patient populations access to care or treatment protocols. For example because its cancer data came exclusively from one hospital Watson for Oncology simply reflected the preferences and biases of the physicians who practiced there.

In January 2022 IBM finally dismantled Watson selling its most valuable data and analytics to the investment firm Francisco Partners. That downfall hasn’t dissuaded other data giants like Google and Amazon from hyping their own AIs promising systems that can do everything from transcribe notes to predict kidney failure. For big tech companies experimenting with medical AI the machine-powered doctor is still very much “in.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMDIvYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9hYm9ydGlvbi1lbXBsb3llci1zdXBwb3J0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Post-Roe Women Discover How Their Employer Influences Abortion Access,"When Breanna Dietrich was 18 and working at a restaurant in West Virginia she got pregnant.

For: Valerie Chiu 12 Holy Angels Canossian School

In an effort to offset the economic effects of the pandemic on Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced earlier this year that there would be a new round of consumption vouchers.

Permanent residents age 18 or older were initially the only ones eligible for the scheme although for the second payment set for August 7 the government expanded eligibility to include non-PRs with the exception of domestic helpers and people who are planning to emigrate. I think it is unfair that people who have emigrated or who are planning to leave be denied the vouchers.

Picture Hong Kong as a gigantic house where we are all members of a massive family. We have many siblings uncles aunts and parents and we live together in a delightful mood sharing pleasant moments.

Why the voucher scheme was extended to non-permanent residents

When someone leaves the house for another we will probably still keep in touch with them and regard them as a part of the family. In this same vein those who have left the city should still be entitled to the consumption vouchers since they will always be a part of Hong Kong.

Giving vouchers to those who have left lets them know that Hong Kong still cares about them. It is a recognition of their past contributions to making Hong Kong a prosperous city.

Most of them had certainly contributed to society in one way or another before they left. For instance a man who worked as a doctor helped treat and cure countless patients. As a matter of fact this could increase the likelihood of them returning to Hong Kong one day because they could see that the city still cares about them.

What’s more people often leave for other places because they want their children to study in a different country. These children could see how the city cares for their family and may decide to return to Hong Kong in the future. They could spread the knowledge that they learned abroad and this would have a positive effect on society.

All Hongkongers aged 18 or above should have the right to receive consumption vouchers as Hong Kong’s Basic Law tells us that if we carry out our responsibilities we can have our basic rights.

Should domestic workers be entitled to Hong Kong’s consumer vouchers?

Against: Clarisse Poon 13 St. Paul’s Co-educational College

The consumption voucher scheme was introduced with the aim of increasing consumer spending and allowing more money to circulate in the local economy which has been hammered hard by Hong Kong’s strict zero-Covid policy.

Given this overriding objective it is fair that the programme excludes residents who have left or plan to leave while extending this resource to non-permanent residents who currently live in the city and can spend the voucher at local retailers.

In addition the scheme’s payment platforms are limited to ones within Hong Kong – such as Octopus and HSBC’s PayMe – so people who have left or plan to leave would not be able to spend the voucher anyway.

The money from the vouchers is given digitally only on Hong Kong platforms. Photo: KY Cheng

Another objective of the scheme is to help Hongkongers on an individual level many of whom have suffered from pay cuts or even unemployment due to coronavirus. This is one reason why the scheme has been expanded to include non-permanent residents; they live in the city contribute to its economy and pay taxes and they may have also suffered financially from our tough coronavirus restrictions.

Those who have not been in the city for the past few years are unlikely to have been affected by Hong Kong’s strict Covid-19 rules as many other places around the world have already lifted their restrictions. Hence their need for the subsidy is not justified.

Should consumer vouchers be given to all Hong Kong permanent residents regardless of age?

Finally from the perspective of fairness the scheme was launched using government funding. People who have been absent from Hong Kong for three consecutive years between June 18 2019 and June 22 this year without specific reasons are excluded from the voucher scheme and it’s likely these people have not contributed to government revenue through taxes during this time. Therefore it’s only fair that they should not benefit from the scheme.

Restricting consumer vouchers to Hongkongers who currently live in the city and who do not plan to leave is a justified policy that follows the principles of fairness and is a wise use of government funding."

Shoppers can find pricey-looking home goods available for the dollar store’s low prices according to money-saving writer Cynthia Measom.

“What’s even better than saving a ton on everyday household items is finding dollar-store items that look high-end but cost only around $1” Measom wrote in an article on the website GoBankingRates.

She said: “Finds like these make it easy to stock up on arts-and-crafts supplies buy emergency gifts or redo the wall art in the guest bathroom.”

From picture frames to glassware Measom offers suggestions for five items you can find at dollar stores that will look like you forked over serious cash.

If you are in the market for decorative picture frames the expert says dollar stores typically have good deals.

Chains like the Dollar General offer selections of frames for as low as $1.50.

But there is one important thing to note: you will likely have to shop in person to take advantage of bargains like this.

Another item you can buy at the dollar store that will look high-end is glassware.

According to another deal expert shoppers can pick up authentic pilsner glasses or elegant bourbon glasses at the dollar store without breaking the bank.

“You can easily buy four or six of these and pair them with a more expensive crystal decanter to serve as your own set or even as a special gift” expert Julie Ramhold said about the bourbon glasses available at the Dollar Tree for $1.25 each.

Meanwhile she noted the pilsner glasses available at the store look like they came straight from your favorite pub.

“They’re perfect for enjoying your favorite local craft beer and no one will know how little you had to spend on them” said Ramhold.

Another great deal can be found on a more temporary household decoration: helium balloons.

The savings experts say dollar stores offer serious savings on helium-filled mylar balloons compared to the usual party stores.

“If an upcoming party calls for a passel of helium-filled fancy-looking balloons but you don’t want to spend upwards of $50 check the dollar store” DealDrop co-founder James Crawford told GoBankingRates.

“The selection may be limited but you can save big.”

There are also more kitchen items that you can find deals on with experts saying that if you’re in the market for coffee mugs then dollar stores are a great place to check out.

“The first thing that comes to mind when I think of dollar store items that look more expensive is coffee mugs” Brooke Grasley founder of Restore Decor & More told the website.

“You can find some really great-looking coffee mugs at the dollar store and they don’t have to be cheap-looking either.

For more permanent decor additions check out stores like the Dollar General for small pieces of art to put on your walls.

“Whether you’re shopping for a small sign for your bathroom or you’re looking for a kitchen-themed piece of wall art it can pay off to check your local dollar store to see what it may have in stock” Measom says.

According to the expert you can pick up wall signs at Dollar General that look like they set you back “several dollars more” than you actually paid for them.

Keep in mind the stores tend to stock items like wall art based on the season and upcoming holidays.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vZ29vZG1lbnByb2plY3QuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVkLWNvbnRlbnQvY29tbWVudGFyeS1hcHBhbGFjaGlhLWNhbi1wcm92ZS1jb21wYW55LXRvd25zLWRvbnQtbGlmdC10aGUtd29ya2luZy1jbGFzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Commentary: Appalachia Can Prove Company Towns Don't 'Lift the Working Class',"This article was originally published by 100 Days in Appalachia a nonprofit collaborative newsroom telling the complex stories of the region that deserve to be heard.

As an Appalachian who is painfully aware of our history I found it took some nerve for Conor Sen to write in all seriousness under the headline “Amazon’s New ‘Factory Towns’ Will Lift the Working-Class” in Bloomberg last week.

Many of us have watched as chain stores like Wal-Mart Dollar General and Family Dollar have become the largest employers in our communities replacing the extractive industries of our past. But those jobs don’t come with the same pay and benefits that workers need to survive.

Giant companies like Amazon Walmart and Dollar General are the employers with the highest rates of workers on federal and state aid programs – making up as much as 3 percent of all recipients in some states. This low pay and the assistance employees receive in the form of SNAP benefits or food stamps requires them to work shop and live in the shadows of these supercenters reminiscent of the coal and mill towns that once stood in their place.

So when Sen’s piece about Amazon appeared in the national news as a full-throated defense of the company town I had to chuckle. I’ve been researching and educating on former and current labor towns for several years and pieces like his written without any historical context continue to amaze me.

Sen’s piece was right about one thing “economic realities dictate where these facilities get built.” Corporations build company towns in places without worker protections. They are made in the places urbanites forgot out of sight out of the mind of the coastal liberal elites. But they are a poison to the people who must survive in a toxic bubble of capitalistic pretend-live work play indeed.

You see “factory towns” aren’t a new idea they have been a significant part of Appalachian history for more than a century but that history never really ended. Appalachians still experience these isolated town structures today and I can promise they haven’t uplifted our working class.

By exploring the history of these communities we can see that towns owned by companies are inherently bad for workers. As history has shown us – and Amazon still does – companies with all-encompassing control over workers don’t just create a cycle of poverty; companies controlling workers is deadly.

So as national headlines praise this “new” idea that will bolster the middle class (insert eye-roll here) let me tell you about these places that will most certainly not save us.

What is a “Company Town” Anyway?

Most of the well-known reporting on the history of Appalachia focuses on the coal and in more recent times natural gas industries that have flourished here.

Due to the work of Appalachian and labor historians people are also familiar with the union organizing history of West Virginia specifically and its impact on the history of organizing across the country. The Mine Wars of the early 20th century for example led to the deaths of coal miners and their families who took up arms to fight against the mine companies imposing crushing work conditions and impoverishment.

Those conditions and cycles of poverty came as a direct result of the company town structure. Company towns are a concept named for the conditions surrounding areas where one industry – usually just one company – was most if not all of an area’s economy.

As capitalism entrenched itself as the economic system in the United States railroad coal forestry and banking barons also cemented control over how that system would look. Set in rural areas away from news reporting or even a nosey neighbor these companies offered pay boarding or a mill shack and subsistence farming in return for 16-hour workdays.

Children as young as six worked in factories mines and mills. Mary “Mother” Jones started her Childrens’ Strike in Alabama to bring awareness to the backbreaking and soul-crushing labor of the most vulnerable workers.

The pay workers were allotted came in the form of scrip – a type of wages usually associated with coal mining but was used by any industry where companies controlled the lives of their workers. Companies paid their workers with this scrip instead of actual salaries or American dollars. The company store took only the specific currency of their company. Workers couldn’t use it anywhere else and items were marked up to the point of debt making it impossible for families to leave the company and their towns.

The wretched of the mountains with no options and seen as sub-human people banded together for better conditions. These efforts usually happened to their detriment: Unions were illegal and the state and federal governments supported company bosses; bosses often called local police to quell uprisings.

But company towns existed in all parts of the region beyond the coalfields of central Appalachia. That history while often overlooked is the backbone of many a small Appalachian town.

Fort Payne Alabama Douglasville Georgia and Anderson South Carolina are just a couple-few.

A Glimpse into These Appalachian Communities

Driving into Fort Payne is breathtaking. My partner is from the tiny town and we spend a lot of time comparing small-town upbringing between there and Douglasville Georgia where I’m from.

Just outside Birmingham it is the town in every country song in every Bruce Springsteen lyric. Its beauty is idyllic and is also a measure of how southern Appalachian economies were built and sustained. It became known as the “Sock Capital of the World” due to the multiple textile mills and factories that supported the town’s economy through the 20th century.

Even now many work at Cooper Hosiery Mill or one of several factories and distribution centers. Manual labor is the economic engine of the town. The high school tucked into the mountain also sits between abandoned mills and still functioning factories that remind students that opportunities include staying to work or leaving for a better set of options.

Mining of course has a long history that is the book-end to the Wal-Mart-style company towns of today. While coal mining ravaged the mountains and people of central and northern Appalachia in Southern Appalachia it was gold.

The oldest gold rushes in the United States happened in Dahlonega (1838) and Villa Rica (1862) Georgia. The land in the area wasn’t fit for cotton plantations so textile mills took their place in the southern mountain economy after the depletion of gold in these areas. Many mistakenly believe that southern Appalachia like the Deep South was primarily supported by cotton plantations but mills and factories have been the actual economic foundation of these hills since the post-Antebellum period.

Douglasville Georgia is another town in the Smoky Mountains foothills about 35 miles west of Atlanta and 35 miles east of the Alabama state line. My hometown has a forgotten labor history.

Workers in Douglasville were unionized in 1933 and were a part of the General Textile Strike of 1934 just 15 years after the Mine Wars of West Virginia. The strike participation in Douglasville was not successful but efforts to improve conditions continued into the 1940s. The mill burned in 2012 – a fact I nor any of my friends or acquaintances ever knew until now.

Textile Mills in the Blue Ridge foothills of South Carolina also built mill towns. Anderson South Carolina is one of these small towns.

The Pendleton Mill is the oldest cotton textile mill in the state that is still operational. Now owned by La France Industries and in the tiny village of La France in Anderson County the surrounding area still has its own remote post office an elementary school water and sewage co-op and mill house neighborhood.

Furman University Museum of History curates a company town project on the mill history of Anderson Pickens and Greenville Counties. Scrip generally associated with coal villages can be seen on display reminding us that all types of companies found ways to control their workers and participate in wage theft.

Employees tied to the company and therefore the town earned significantly less than their Northern counterparts. These practices kept the underclass from gaining the power to change conditions.

Like the other mill towns Anderson has faced significant gentrification by moving away from just one or two industries. This gentrification can erase the rich history of the labor movements in Southern Appalachia along with the current working and living conditions of residents.

Manny a friend in Anderson whose family has lived in the area around (“this mill here”) for more than four generations sees the changes as a positive. I know him to be an amateur expert in the growth and change in Anderson. With a wealth of information and knowledge he can describe and explain the differences between the architecture of a “mill home” and the concept of a “mill house.” A mill house he explains is a one or two-bedroom home often what many would describe as a shack. However new and renovated mill houses are becoming chic. These changes can contribute to rising housing and rent costs. Gentrification can dramatically change a neighborhood but residents don’t always find this a negative outcome.

“I like that they’re building more ‘mill houses’ in this neighborhood. There’s a lot of shooting here and especially across the railroad tracks. There are some girls that bought these houses here (gestures to new and renovated homes across the street); they keep it nice” Manny says. “The neighborhood is more diverse. As long as they don’t price out the elders that live here I am for them improving the neighborhood. All [gentrification] ain’t bad.”

Change is inevitable as they say. Forgetting our history and what happens when we do prevents the difference that truly lifts the working class.

In fact Bethany a woman who dedicates a portion of her YouTube to Dollar Tree hauls revealed how she turns the $1 pans into beautiful creations.

Using the versatile 12-inch pizza pans from Dollar Tree the crafty woman got to work in a video shared with her one million YouTube subscribers.

END TABLES

""Our first DIY/hack is an oldie but a goodie. We're going to be making some end tables"" she said.

Bethany purchased some wastebaskets from Dollar Tree and glued them together using E6000 glue.

She placed a pizza pan which she spray-painted white on top of the waste basket gluing it to it.

She then added some coastal decorations to the waste basket and it was good to go.

Bethany was left with a beautiful nautical end table which she made use of in her washroom.

TIER TRAY

Bethany's next hack featured glass candle holders from Dollar Tree which she used to create a tiered tray. Using Gorilla Glue she attached the candle holders to each other.

She then glued the candle holders to the center of a pizza pan using E6000 and her hot glue gun.

She glued a pie pan to the other end of the candle holder and spray-painted the tiered tray white.

COFFEE TABLE TRAY

For her next hack the crafty woman spray-painted a pizza pan a metallic gold color.

""When you spray paint something with a metallic finish remember the oils on your finger can transfer to [it]. You'll just have to clean it off"" she explained.

She put some marble contact paper on the tray and glued some handles from Hobby Lobby on them.

She added some flowers for decor and was left with a really pretty coffee table tray.

WREATH

Bethany also turned a Dollar Tree pan into a wreath.

To get this done she painted the edges of the pizza pan teal.

Next she glued a coastal image with the words ""beach breezes"" on it to the pan.

To finish the wreath off she embellished it with various seashells and pearls.

BASKET LID

Bethany used a pizza pan to make a lid for a gray basket that she purchased at Dollar Tree.

She spray-painted the pan gray then attached a decorative knob to it with glue.

COMMAND CENTER

Bethany's next DIY involved painting a pencil box from Dollar Tree. She also painted a mini chalkboard black.

She glued magnets to the back of both items which made them stick to the pan because it's aluminum.

The pizza pan was spray-painted matte black and she placed the pencil box and mini chalkboard on it.

Just like that she had the perfect command center.

Despite the challenges of workforce issues supply chain problems and a struggling economy small business is booming in Moss Bluff.

Michelle McInnis is the Southwest Louisiana Economic Development Alliance senior vice president and Ward One (Moss Bluff) Economic Development Board president. She shared the names of new businesses that have recently opened or are set to open soon.

On Tuesday June 28 the line for Jo’s Cupcakes snaked down the counter and out the door. The line wasn’t as long as it was on the first day. Traffic wasn’t impeded. But the new Moss Bluff bakery did sell out again and not for the first time since opening at 909 Sam Houston Jones Pkwy.

Jeremy VanWinkle opened Titan Tires at 250 U.S. 171.

“With only two tire shops in Moss Bluff I felt like our community needed another option” VanWinkle said.

In addition to selling and installing tires Titan does auto repairs oil changes and caters to off-road enthusiasts with lift wheel kits.

Niche Creative Studio opened its second location in Moss Bluff at 271 U.S. 171.

“We chose Moss Bluff because it’s a fast-growing community” Melissa Hill said.

Now creative types don’t have to drive so far for their craft supplies good news particularly now when gas prices are high according to Hill.

Tiffany Daley and Alison Degeyter know the Moss Bluff culture and market well. The sisters grew up there. They’ve developed their own “niche.”

“We bring children’s play areas to events and homes that are specifically designed for small children” Daley said.

She said at many events small children end up in strollers or being held as their older siblings find suitable play. The Soft Play Sisters offer a safe and fun environment for children as young as a year to interact with and develop social and gross motor skills.

Sway Boutique and Gifts “hopped across the parking lot” to expand its space at 277 U.S. 171 going from 900 square feet to 2400 square feet according to owner Brittany Derouen.

Gracie Barra a jiu jitsu school for students 4 and up will open its new Moss Bluff location soon according to Genna Davis program director.

Other new businesses set to open soon are Fast Pace Physical Therapy Crust Pizza Taco Mel and The Dollar Tree.

Market Basket Foods is set to complete repairs from the hurricanes and open this summer.

“Moss Bluff is growing because there’s available land to develop commercially and residentially” said Police Juror Mike Smith. “The school system is good and these are factors that are attractive to home buyers.”

Smith and Marjorie Harrison Director of Calcasieu Parish Public Libraries reported on the status of library repairs and other hurricane cleanup.

“Repairs are underway on the Moss Bluff branch library” Smith said. The police jury has been cleaning up laterals. Like other areas having clear drainage is key. We’re also looking to expand River Bluff Park. That work has been held up because of the hurricane. We hope to add a multi-purpose type building to use as an event center.”

Harrison said the library will be back in October with improvements.

“We had a lot of repairs and took the opportunity to make some changes” Harrison said. “Not only are we building back a more functional resilient facility we’ve planned some changes sure to appeal to children and teens.”

Harrison said the layout will change. Paint is all new. Lighting is all new. Meeting room flow and egress has been improved. An outside area has been fenced in. Though it might not be in place as soon as October furnishings will be updated."

A press release from President Joe Biden’s administration describes the Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership as a joint effort between the White House national climate adviser four cabinet secretaries and the governors of “several East Coast states who are early leaders on offshore wind development.”

The 11 states listed are Connecticut Delaware Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York North Carolina Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.

Those jurisdictions cover the entire span of the nation’s eastern coast from Maine to North Carolina with the exception of Virginia.

Eight of the governors involved in the partnership are Democrats. Three — Larry Hogan of Maryland Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire — are Republicans.

The absence of Virginia and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin from the initiative is particularly surprising given the state’s efforts in recent years to market its Hampton Roads region as a key emerging wind hub.

Virginia notched an early win last October when Siemens Gamesa announced it would build the first U.S. offshore wind turbine blade facility at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal investing more than $200 million and creating over 300 jobs.

Richmond-headquartered Dominion Energy also operates one of the only two offshore wind installations currently generating power in the United States. Its 12 megawatt pilot off the coast of Virginia Beach was the first to be built in federal waters and its planned 2600 megawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is expected to be the largest wind farm in the nation.

Asked why Virginia is not involved in the new partnership Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter said in an email that “the commonwealth is already a leader in the offshore wind industry and the Youngkin administration is focused on the economic development opportunities presented by this emerging sector in a way that is consistent with promoting jobs for Virginia and its right-to-work philosophy.”

Porter said the administration “has participated in calls with the White House on offshore wind projects and continues to engage on this topic.”

“The governor supports and is fully committed to Virginia’s current offshore wind project and we will continue to support any future offshore wind development that meets Virginia’s economic needs and protects ratepayers from high energy costs” she wrote.

She did not respond to a follow-up question about whether the partnership comes with labor commitments that Youngkin believes would go against Virginia’s “right-to-work philosophy.”

Michael Ricci a spokesperson for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said in an email that the partnership has not involved any formal agreements or memoranda of understanding. He characterized it as a “workgroup organized by the administration to foster better federal-state coordination on offshore wind.”

The Biden administration has emphasized labor involvement in its messaging on the initiative inviting labor leaders to participate in the partnership launch at the White House and highlighting developers’ use of project agreements and union workers.

State Sen. Jennifer McClellan D-Richmond called on Youngkin to reconsider his decision to not join the partnership saying in a release that “it’s hard to understand why Governor Youngkin would choose not to participate in a bipartisan group of 11 governors working to grow offshore wind energy.”

“The Youngkin administration should not put right-wing ideology over job creation and affordable American-made energy” she said.

SALT LAKE CITY — Provo celebrated the opening of its new $69 million city hall and public safety headquarters on Saturday.

As several dozen people gathered in front of the modern building which boasts five stories and 204000 square feet at 445 W. Center Street Mayor Michelle Kaufusi emphasized the difficulty she faced when deciding whether to seek a new building to improve the city's public safety a few years ago despite the possibility it would be ""political suicide.""

""Making the safe decision doesn't mean it's the easy decision because we are trusted as stewards of the taxpayer dollar. And it remains weighty. That responsibility is not taken lightly"" Kaufusi said.

Provo residents in 2018 narrowly approved a $69 million bond to replace the previous city hall police station and Fire Station 2. As part of the bond the average Provo homeowner would pay an extra $10 per month in new taxes for the next 20 years city leaders said at the time.

Provo in 2018 needed a permanent emergency operations center which at the time was operating part-time out of the power building Fire Chief James Miguel said.

""We knew that the answer was virtually impossible but there was a great deal of courage to just go out and put that question in front of our residents and see if they could support us in wanting to provide them the very best"" Miguel said.

Kaufusi said the building is designed as an ""essential facility"" designed for use during natural crises or disasters.

""I think that most people don't know the amount of planning that takes place to ensure that when something does go wrong we have the ability to handle that"" Miguel said adding that the new emergency operations center will be a ""blessing"" in that regard.

Despite the pandemic and inflation that has affected building materials city leaders noted the building was completed within the planned two years and within budget.

The building is also designed to allow officers to work through earthquakes retired Police Chief Rich Ferguson said. It has space for regional training meaning they won't always need to travel to other cities and it has four kennels for K-9 officers to stay instead of remaining in officers' vehicles when they're at the headquarters.

""By working together we made Provo safer for generations to come"" Kaufusi said.

City officials noted the building was constructed to last between 75 and 100 years. It was designed to have zero net energy usage meaning it creates as much energy as it consumes.

Ferguson said the building ""stands as a pillar"" to police officers showing that the community respects and values them.

""There will be chiefs of police who will occupy this building who are in grade school today or maybe not even born. It will be a new era for the Provo Police Department and it will serve the city for longer than all of you here"" he said thanking residents ""from the bottom of my heart.""

In the new building the emergency operations center is located between the police fire and legal departments. The building also includes space for partners during crises including the Red Cross Dominion Energy Brigham Young University and other organizations leaders noted.

The previous Provo city building was erected in 1972 when the city had 45000 residents. City leaders said it was unable to withstand a moderate earthquake and it was too small to serve the growing population.

""Provo City Hall was designed as an 'essential facility' meaning it must remain in continuous use particularly in response to a natural disaster"" project director Scott Henderson said in a statement. ""To meet these stringent requirements it was designed per the highest risk category prescribed by the building code. In short when or if a disaster strikes we can remain operational for our citizens.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aW1lc2Rpc3BhdGNoL25hbWUvbWFydGhhLW1jc3dlZW5leS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNTU1OTA1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Martha McSweeney Obituary (2022) - Miami VA - Richmond Times-Dispatch,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/timesdispatch/name/martha-mcsweeney-obituary?id=35559053 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aW1lc2Rpc3BhdGNoL25hbWUvbWFydGhhLW1jc3dlZW5leS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNTU1OTA1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

It has been calculated that the three food outlets alone will create up to 50 jobs and add around £1m to the local economy each year.

Michael Robinson co-chief executive at Mansfield District Council Richard Burns from ARBA Mayor Andy Abrahams Tanbry Construction's Robert Bryant and Will Morlidge from D2N2.

Andy Abrahams Mansfield mayor said: “The Stockwell Gate North project is a commitment to regenerate a major gateway site in Mansfield bring more jobs to the town and provide diversity and choice in the town centre economy.

“Despite the issues of the past couple of years with COVID and lockdowns the aspiration to deliver the scheme hasn’t wavered and it’s exciting to see phase one coming to fruition.”

As well as Mansfield-based ARBA the scheme has been a real Mansfield project with for example Tanbry Construction of The Broadway carrying out the building work.

Will Morlidge chief executive of D2N2 the Local Enterprise Partnership for Nottinghamshire which has provided support for the development said: “It’s wonderful to see how this place has been transformed and great to see that employment opportunities are being created.

“Not only will the new outlets help to increase the footfall into the town centre but they will also particularly add to the development of the nighttime economy of Mansfield as a whole.”

Taco Bell Tim Hortons and Domino’s have taken up the three outlets.

Richard Burns from ARBA said: “It has taken a lot of hard work from ARBA its suppliers and the local authority to get to this stage and to create something that we as Mansfield people can be proud of.",,,,,,,,,

All stores have marketing tactics to get you in the door — stylish mannequins elaborate display windows posters screaming about all the discounts you can find inside.

But some are far more subtle so much so that chances are you’ve hardly ever noticed them. Picture your local grocery store for example. What do you see when you first walk in?

Most likely: Flowers. Big bright bouquets of fresh-cut blooms greet shoppers inside just about every major grocer from Whole Foods to Kroger to innumerable New York City bodegas.

That’s no coincidence — there’s a strategic decision behind those flowers’ placement.

“It is very very simple” says Paco Underhill the founder and CEO of behavioral research and consulting firm Envirosell. “If you can get someone’s nose and saliva glands working they become a much less disciplined shopper.”

That’s right: Flowers fire up the senses getting you ready to spend. Sure they’re aesthetically pleasing. And as you get closer your nose picks up on their aroma which tells your brain “this place has good stuff.”

“You’re signaling freshness you’re signaling ‘natural’… all the good things that make food good” said Ashwani Monga a professor of marketing at Rutgers Business School.

“If I’m a grocery store then that’s how I want you to see my store — logistically if this person can manage fresh flowers and sell them this person isn’t going to sell stale food.”

That psychological priming is just one way stores indirectly influence your behavior and encourage you to part more readily with your money. (Holiday music is another effective strategy.)

There's a strategic reason why so many grocery stores put bouquets front and center. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Psychologists call the effect misattribution — you’re in a good mood and ready to shell out for the holiday season for example not fully realizing that it’s because of the music and twinkly lights.

What makes flowers so effective is that they’re a high-margin item. They may account for only 1% to 3% of total sales but in 2019 stores reported an average gross margin of 47% on cut flowers according to a report from the International Fresh Produce Association. In other words that bouquet you bought for $15 likely cost the store just $7.50. That’s because most of the stems for sale in US grocery stores are flown in from South America where land and labor are much cheaper.

The grocery store flower scene has emerged over the past 30 years or so says Becky Roberts director of floral at the IFPA. As shoppers became more time-starved grocery stores evolved to be more of a one-stop shop with bank branches coffee shops post offices and of course florists.

Covid-19 lockdowns were especially lucrative for the cut flower industry.

“People had to come to supermarkets as one of the few places that they really could still come and shop” Roberts said. “They wanted things that could bring them a little joy a little fun a little happiness.”

Inflation is taking its toll of course but Roberts said she expects floral sales to remain strong even as consumers rein in spending on non-essential items.

“You might not be able to afford a $200 dinner now or to be able to take that road trip” she said. “But you still can go pick up a bunch of flowers and feel like ‘OK I’m still treating myself.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMi9tZWRpYS90dXJrZXktZHctdm9pY2Utb2YtYW1lcmljYS1ibG9ja2VkLWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBUGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDcvMDIvbWVkaWEvdHVya2V5LWR3LXZvaWNlLW9mLWFtZXJpY2EtYmxvY2tlZC1pbnRs?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turkey blocks access to the websites of Voice of America and Deutsche Welle,"CNN —

Turkey has blocked access to the Turkish websites of foreign media Deutsche Welle and Voice of America the country’s media watchdog announced on Friday.

A statement released by the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTUK) said the two outlets did not comply with “the law” and did not apply for a license within the required period. It said the pair were both told they needed a broadcasting license in February.

The RTUK argued the two websites needed broadcasting license because because they have “program” sections.

Deutsche Welle is German public state-owned international broadcaster funded by German taxpayers. Voice of America is run by the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) a government agency which is funded by the US Congress. The two websites have not been accessible in Turkey since Thursday.

DW said in a statement that it did not comply with the rules because “licensing would have allowed the Turkish government to censor editorial content.”

DW Director General Peter Limbourg said the company explained to RTUK why they “could not apply for such a license.”

“Media licensed in Turkey are required to delete online content that RTUK interprets as inappropriate. This is simply unacceptable for an independent broadcaster” he said in a statement published by DW.

The news organization said it would take legal action against the block.

Voice of America’s Acting Director Yolanda López said the network “firmly objects” to RTUK’s decision which she described as “a thinly veiled effort to censor unfavorable press coverage.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator Gulnoza Said criticized the decision to block the websites and urged RTUK to reverse it.

“Turkish authorities’ censorship of the international broadcasters Voice of America and Deutsche Welle is the latest attempt to silence critical media as the country prepares to hold elections next year” she said in a statement.

RTUK said it operates on legal grounds and that there was no need for anyone “to worry unnecessarily regarding freedom of expression and press.”

Turkey is ranked 149 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).

RSF said press freedom has been quashed under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with journalists routinely prosecuted and jailed for doing their jobs.

“No less than 200 journalists were prosecuted and 70 journalists were sentenced on similar charges since Erdogan was elected President in August 2014.”

With 90% of the country’s national media under government control international media including DW and Voice of America have become key sources of independent information RSF added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbW90aGVyc2hpcC5zZy8yMDIyLzA3L25naWFtLXRvbmctZG93LXNpbmdhcG9yZS1sb3ZpbmctY3JpdGljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'If you don't know the ground how can you formulate policies?': S'pore's 'loving critic' Ngiam Tong Dow,"Ngiam Tong Dow was one of Singapore’s pioneer civil servants with a career that stretched over four decades from 1959.

In his first decade Ngiam joined the Economic Development Board (EDB) when it was first formed in 1961 starting the country on the path to industrialisation. From the 1970s he became permanent secretary in a number of key ministries including the Ministry of Finance (1972–79) the Ministry of Trade and Industry (1979–86) the Ministry of National Development (1987–89) and the Prime Minister’s Office (1979–94). He also served as the EDB’s chairman from 1975 to 1981.

Ngiam eventually retired in 1999 from the civil service.

Here we reproduce an excerpt from the book The Last Fools: The Eight Immortals of Lee Kuan Yew about how Ngiam was also known for being outspoken on certain issues and how this was informed by his difficult childhood. In 2013 Ngiam made several statements about the high concentration of well-educated Singaporeans in the civil service and the impact of high ministerial pay on the dedication of political officeholders. He subsequently retracted these statements.

Edited by Peh Shing Huei The Last Fools is published by The Nutgraf Books and you can get a copy of it here.

By Prabhu Silvam

In its September 2013 issue the Singapore Medical Association (SMA) newsletter had published a dialogue between Ngiam Tong Dow and its editor.

When asked how the current crop of People’s Action Party (PAP) politicians differed from the pioneer generation Ngiam – whom the late Lee Kuan Yew once described as lacking guile – held no hostages.

He questioned their motive for taking up office alleging that high salaries for Cabinet ministers were turning the ruling party into a coalition of yes-men.

""In the early days Lim Kim San and Goh Keng Swee worked night and day and they were truly dedicated. I don’t know whether Lee Kuan Yew will agree but it started going downhill when we started to raise ministers’ salaries not even pegging them to the national salary but aligning them with the top ten” said Ngiam. “When you raise ministers’ salaries to the point that they’re earning millions of dollars every minister – no matter how much he wants to turn up and tell Hsien Loong off or whatever – will hesitate when he thinks of his million-dollar salary. Even if he wants to do it his wife will stop him.""

He went on to recount how the Old Guard Minister Lim [Kim San] used to stress the importance of finding a job that ensured financial stability. Ngiam suggested that the fear of relinquishing handsome pay cheques was affecting political discourse. This he believed was paralysing the country’s growth trajectory.

What’s worse he added was the apparent groupthink within the party. ""The civil service has definitely become tamer which is not good because we need a contest of ideas. The difference is that no one wants to make a sacrifice anymore. The first generation of PAP was purely

grassroots but the problem today is that PAP is a bit too elitist"" he said. ""I think that they don’t feel for the people; overall there is a lack of empathy.""

Criticism shocks the country

Ngiam’s words sent shockwaves across Singapore. In a country where it was almost blasphemous for the ruling elite to criticise one of their own this was a brazen show of defiance.

The public was enraptured. Online chatter about political in-fighting within the elites spread across social media platforms. Tabloid websites had a field day seizing the opportunity to boost readership numbers.

This was not the first time that Ngiam had spoken his mind. On the surface all seemed well. There were no outright allegations of slander defamation or even a mention of Ngiam’s controversial comments in Parliament.

Then came the letter that stunned the nation.

On Oct. 10 Ngiam sent a clarification statement to the SMA News Editor stating that he had given the “wrong impression” and that he “had not been fair” in the statements he made.

Among others he said:

""I retired from the civil service in 1999. Since then I have not attended any Cabinet meetings and have never seen one chaired by PM Lee Hsien Loong. Thus my statement that ministers will not speak their minds before PM Lee is unfair as it was made without knowing what actually happens at Cabinet meetings today. I have been told by civil servant colleagues that Cabinet discussions are robust – as robust as they were when I attended cabinet meetings as PS (Permanent Secretary) when Mr Goh Chok Tong was PM and Mr Lee Hsien Loong DPM.""

On the issue of ministerial pay Ngiam added that he knew some ministers who had given up successful and well-paying careers in the private sector to join politics at a much lower pay.

He also added that while some could have joined the private sector to make more money they decided to put the country before themselves.

""They have no reason not to speak their minds when they are convinced that they are doing right by Singaporeans"" he said.

PM Lee issues a reply to Ngiam

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on his Facebook page: “Mr Ngiam Tong Dow’s recent interview in the Singapore Medical Association’s newsletter attracted some attention. I am glad that he has clarified the statements he made especially his comments about my ministers. Mr Ngiam served as my Permanent Secretary in MTI years ago” he said referring to the Ministry of Trade and Industry.

And then came the kicker: “I hope that in retirement he will continue to support the institutions and systems that he helped build during his long and illustrious career.”

The episode shook up Singaporeans and watchers of the island in more ways than one. In a country where the ruling party has had an unbroken rule of more than half a century the top men toed the official discourse and silence was a virtue.

Ngiam’s criticisms and revelations were uncharacteristically bald blunt and brutal by Singapore’s standards. Even though he had built a reputation after his retirement in 1999 as a vocal critic of the government there were little or no repercussions at least in the eyes of the public.

But now his seemingly impenetrable fortress of immunity had turned to ashes.

Like Icarus his wings were no more. The message here was clear: nobody was bigger than the government not even Ngiam. The unthinkable had happened. There was sufficient pushback that forced the loud and proud critic to backtrack on his statements.

Why and how did he morph from an establishment heavyweight into this punching critic?

Viewpoint was informed by a challenging childhood

Ngiam was always someone who not only paid extra attention to the people on the ground but also remained close to them. He fully understood the intricate psyche – the hopes and fears – of the man on the street.

After all he was one of them. In 1946 at age nine he lost his father a court interpreter to tuberculosis. His mother a washerwoman was tasked with raising five young children on her own.

His hard early life informed him for the rest of his years.

In 2008 he already took aim at younger Cabinet ministers for being out of touch with the ground because of their privileged upbringing. In an event hosted by the EDB Society he pointed out that most of the younger Cabinet ministers hailed from upper-middle class backgrounds and ""so really do not know"" the impact of a policy on ordinary folks.

""So you do not know the effect of a 10-cent bus fare increase on a family"" he said. ""But if you’re from a poor family like my generation...you know very well if the bus fare goes up by 10 cents multiply by three or four times 50 cents a day for the whole family. So I don’t know how are they going to get this sort of empathy for the people.""

Ngiam said in Fullerton Stories:

""I learned frugality from Dr Goh Keng Swee. When he took Sim Kee Boon and myself for lunch we would order food from the canteen on the sixth floor (of the Fullerton Building). In those days you got meat soup towgay (beansprouts) for 50 cents a dish and so the three of us would have lunch for just three or four dollars.""

Ngiam: Policies cannot be formulated if you do not know what’s happening on the ground

Go to the ground solve the problems get the job done. Ngiam was a rising star in the new Singapore Inc emblematic of the young can-do spirit of the nation. In 1970 he became the government’s youngest permanent secretary at age 33 at the Ministry of Communications.

By 1975 he was made Chairman of EDB. The bottom guy had reached the top in record time.

Ngiam took his EDB experience to other parts of the government. When he died in 2020 former Head of Civil Service Peter Ong shared that there was ""constant admonition"" from Ngiam ""for all public servants to behave like EDB officers to help land investments into Singapore.""

It is thus perhaps no surprise that Ngiam would warn in 2003 that the bureaucracy’s biggest danger was that ""we are on autopilot.""

Instead of taking on the frontier spirit like at the EDB he was concerned that the Singapore government had softened and grown complacent.

In one of his most famous comments he explained in the same interview with The Straits Times why he believed the civil service was cruising:

""I suspect we have started to believe our own propaganda. There is also a particular brand of Singapore elite arrogance creeping in. Some civil servants behave like they have a mandate from the emperor. We think we are little Lee Kuan Yews. SM Lee has earned his spurs with his fine intellect and international standing"" he said referring to Lee as SM or Senior Minister the title he held after stepping down as Prime Minister.

Ngiam was a titan by the 1980s purportedly described as a “cult hero” by his contemporary J. Y. Pillay.

When Singapore ran into its first recession after independence he pushed for the unpopular and potentially politically suicidal move to slash wages.

He urged Lee Hsien Loong who was a relatively new politician in charge of the committee to overcome the recession: ""I said cut the CPF contribution rate for employers because we want to bring down wage cost fast and drastically to be competitive.""

CPF refers to Central Provident Fund which is Singapore’s national mandatory pension savings. Ngiam said that he learnt later that Lee had wondered why he was ""so fierce"" on the recommendation.

But as Ngiam shared he had consulted Goh earlier and the retired leader had said: ""Ngiam in politics there are no sacred cows.""

The economy rebounded quickly. ""Just one course correction just do it"" he said. ""The main thing about policy-making is to know the key problem and have the guts to deal with it.""

We are a great location and attracting attention just proves that point more” he said.

“Have you ever thought about why we need this about the taxes it’s going to generate about the longevity of the city of New Carlisle itself? We should have a right to make sure the longevity of this city is there and we have a right for this city to grow.”

The potential developments would be at New Carlisle Road west of Scarff Road; Addison-New Carlisle Road north of the Northwoods subdivision; on the east side of Ohio 235 and north of Twin Creeks.

The developments are proposed on a combined 586-acres.

DDC Management has a purchase agreement for a 115-acre farm in Miami County where it plans to build 298-single family homes. If approved the new community would be at 8805 E. New Carlisle Road at the corner of Scarff Road which is at the edge of Miami County and adjacent to the Clark County border.

The cost of the homes will start at about $250000. All of the land would be annexed from Miami County according to the proposal.

DDC Management has contacted the Miami County Engineer’s office to inquire about annexing the land into New Carlilse Miami County Administrator Charlotte Colley said. However an annexation proposal has not officially been submitted and the process has not been started.

Bridge said there has been no formal paperwork submitted to start the annexation process but the developer has submitted a review of the plat of land that was approved in March.

“We are unsure of the final plan. There has been review of the preliminary plat but the planning board had some concerns around density and lot widths” he said. “(The planning board) presented concerns and recommendations and (the developer) is coming back to resubmit the preliminary plat.”

Before New Carlisle City Council takes any action on the plan the developer must go through the annexation process in Miami County. Once that process has been started in Miami County the New Carlisle council would then have to pass a resolution that states the services the city can provide.

Bridge said no proposal has been made to council and the annexation or services agreement has not yet been passed. He said council is working with Bethel Twp. to draft and approve the annexation agreement.

As for next steps regarding this development Bridge said they are still talking about financing zoning and final plat approval.

“We are still quite a bit away from anything formal because of the legislative processes we have to go through” he said.

A joint business meeting with New Carlisle City Council and Bethel Twp. Miami County Board of Trustees was held to discuss the potential annexation and development.

Bethel Twp. Trustee Don Black said the township is opposed to the annexation. He said the township has lost 1030 acres to annexation since 1988 which is 5% of the township.

New Carlisle does not have to reach an annexation agreement with Bethel Twp. in order for this annexation to occur. However reaching an agreement is a way for the township to have some limited input into the annexation and development of the property.

Black added that the school district borders would not change and the children who go to Bethel High School will continue to do so.

New Carlisle Planning Director Derek Hutchinson said if the annexation does go through the only thing that will change is it will be considered New Carlisle and use the city’s utilities.

“I want to do what I think the citizens would want what’s best for the city as far as the tax base what will bring a better future to the city of New Carlisle or be able to move the city in the right direction to bring new business” said New Carlisle Mayor Mike Lowrey.

The early stages of the plan for this nearly 300-home development started in February.

Opponents for this additional housing say it will lead to a population increase that will stretch resources and impact the schools.

Residents in both Clark and Miami counties expressed their concerns about the proposed project.

Jason Layton who lives on New Carlisle Road near the proposed housing site said he’s concerned that additional housing will bring additional traffic and lead to an influx of students in the Bethel Local School District.

Layton is opposed to the project and said a few key points residents have regarding the new site is childhood occupancy of the new neighborhood schools the traffic impact and the environmental impact on Silver Lake.

“Bethel and many New Carlisle residents remain firmly against the annexation and development. It’s not right for Bethel school and we township residents don’t want the extra traffic or the environmental impact on Silver Lake” he said.

The Silver Lake property is owned by Jeff Morford and his 35+ member family. He said the property is approximately 100-acres with 17-acres of lake and is one of less than 120 naturally formed lakes in Ohio that has been there for 10000 years.

“I am still and will always be against the 300-house development DDC plans to put at Scarff and Lake because of habitat and environment issues for the honey creek corridor” he said. “In my mind the new residents and voters can change the fiber of New Carlisle.”

As Morford continues to be opposed to the development and suggests leaving it agricultural he has gotten signatures from residents against it. He said he went door-to-door and set up at a local church and got 117 residents who signed against the development.

700 new homes proposed.

Arbor Homes proposed a 83-acre site in Bethel Twp. Clark County to build 300-single family homes. The vacant land would need to be annexed but not across county lines Bridge said. If approved the new community would be at Addison-New Carlisle Road north of the Northwoods Subdivision.

The proposed layout would include 12 floor plans; six or more elevation styles per floor plan; structural options including basement sunrooms and room extensions; interior options such as gourmet kitchen and deluxe master bathrooms; vinyl siding; and masonry according to the plan.

The other development is proposed by D.R. Horton to build 400-single family homes on the 145-acre Brubaker farm property on the east side of 235 north of the Chrysler dealership.

The developer had a concept plan they presented earlier this month but due to the floodplain and studies they did they had to revamp it.

Hutchinson said this development is unique because the developer plans to leave space near Ohio 235 for commercial use.

This project has no timeline of when the developers will submit their plan.

Fourth proposed development

A fourth potential development was proposed by a private owner of 200-acres and the Clark County Land Bank of 43-acers to build 700-single family homes that would be north of Twin Creek. The project has no developer yet and no concept plans have been made.

Revenue from these homes will go right back into existing neighborhoods and infrastructure to repair streets and do more projects Bridge said.

“We are hopeful that the legislative bodies are receptive to the great work the administration has brought them” he said.

City welcoming to projects

Hutchinson said the city didn’t go after these developments the property owners and developers came to them. He said once a property owner and developer want to work with with them they will welcome concept plans and ideas on how to get residential and commercial properties.

“This is just the start. There’s going to be many years to follow with improvement and growth commercially and residentially. The benefits from this for the community are going to be huge” he said. “We want to do things right and make sure this is a benefit.”

New Carlisle has a population of 5559 in 2086 households. Over the next 10 years with the four potential developments the population is estimated to increase by 4414 in an additional 1698 households bringing the total to 9973 people in 3784 households by 2030.

New Carlisle was named the second healthiest housing market in Ohio according to an annual Ohio housing market study by SmartAsset.

SmartAsset is a financial technology company founded in 2012 centered around publishing articles guides reviews calculators and tools to assist people in making decisions about personal finance. The study surveyed cities and towns by evaluating homeowner and housing market factors such as the number of years that residents remain in the same home percentage of homes decreasing in value and others.

“We didn’t know that we’d be in this study like this... We’ve had a lot of activity with certain developers having interest in our town; we didn’t know what that was coming from and then all of a sudden we were notified of this article being published with the scoring criteria; and it all made sense to us at that point in time” Bridge said previously.

Bridge credited the high placement on the survey as a result of the city’s residents since the scoring was measured by metrics such as how many years residents remained in their homes and the risk of homes decreasing in value. He said that means people want to stay in the city.

Bridge who has been city manager since 2015 said he has worked hard to make positive changes including getting finances in order doing street repairs and putting money into the parks.

“You need all that foundation so people want to stay here and move into your city. I think people are starting to notice that New Carlisle is changing becoming a sought-after destination to live in” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbmouY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZ3VsZi1icmVlemUvMjAyMi8wNy8wMy9ndWxmLWJyZWV6ZS1ncmFkLXRvcC0xMC1maW5hbGlzdC1zdHVjay1wcm9tLXNjaG9sYXJzaGlwLWNvbnRlc3QvNzc4MDcwNjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gulf Breeze grad top 10 finalist in Stuck at Prom Scholarship Contest,"One recent Gulf Breeze High School graduate could soon earn $10000 toward her college education but it won't come down to her academics or typical extracurricular activities. Instead it will be determined by a public vote on a tuxedo she designed completely out of duct tape.

For the second consecutive year Adrienne Flowers submitted a design as part of the Stuck at Prom Scholarship Contest put on by Duck Brand duct tape. This year however she is a finalist in the competition for her tuxedo design. This means even if she does not finish first in her category she will still win a $500 scholarship and a prize pack from the company.

""About two years ago I was just looking at a ton of scholarship websites trying to find ones I could do. And one of them on the list was (this) contest. I was kind of confused so I clicked on it researched it. And I was like 'OK I'm going to do this'"" Flowers said.

Flowers' design combines the traditional look of a tuxedo with an additional luxurious section that mimics the feathers of a peacock. The sleek shiny black and gold colors seen on the front blend seamlessly with the more vibrant brighter colors on the back of her outfit.

She came up with this year's design in math class where she said it just ""popped"" into her head with no explanation.

She subsequently spent 81 hours and 50 rolls of duct tape on her tuxedo design. She said other than a little bit of help from her mother she made the entire tuxedo herself. And during those early stages when she was designing in class she remembers her classmates being a bit confused.

""So I'd work on it. And because it was the very beginning process people were confused and ask like 'What are you doing?' And I kind of have to try to explain but it's not really easy to explain"" Flowers said.

She said ultimately the people around her were supportive of her effort and eager to see her design for this year. Looking back at her design last year Flowers said that one was more ""basic.""

Flowers is planning to attend the University of Central Florida this upcoming fall and is set to study computer engineering. In her free time though she described the numerous creative outlets she takes advantage of citing her passion for sewing as one in particular that helped propel her this far in the competition.

""I'm all for the creative and artsy stuff. I'm always sewing something. And that's definitely what helped me to create this as I have a pretty great knowledge on patterns in clothing and how to craft it"" Flowers said.

If she is the outright winner for her category Flowers said she could foresee a scenario where she wears the tuxedo once or twice. But otherwise she said she probably will not wear it again.

The vote is now open to the public to crown the winners of the scholarship competition. People can vote at duckbrand.com/stuck-at-prom until July 13.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wdWJsaWNvcGluaW9ub25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9kZWVkLXRyYW5zZmVycy8yMDIyLzA4LzA1L2ZyYW5rbGluLWNvdW50eS1kZWVkLXRyYW5zZmVycy1qdW5lLTI2LWp1bHktMi0yMDIyLzY1Mzg3NTE1MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Franklin County deed transfers: June 26 - July 2 2022,"Chambersburg Public Opinion

The dry weather led to a hot and humid day but overall we saw decent sunshine that changes now as we move into the overnight.

WCPO - Brandon Spinner 2AM Sunday Future Radar

As we progress through the overnight we may see a few isolated showers and storms develop along the stationary front that is hanging out just to our south. With that areas of northern Kentucky have the best chance at seeing an isolated storm but that chance is 40% or less. Temperatures will be right around normal into the mid to upper 60s. Skies will stay partly cloudy.

After mostly cloudy skies to start the day Sunday expect to see a gorgeous afternoon with slightly lower humidity. That doesn’t mean it won’t be hot we are still looking at upper 80s but it wont be AS sticky. Should be a nice afternoon to get outside.

Overnight into Monday a warm front will slide in increasing our humidity and bringing a slight chance at a shower or thunderstorm on Monday.

He’s crammed a lifetime of high school sports accomplishments into just the past 10 months serving as a crucial member of three team state champions. The Reds defended their Class 2A football title in the fall won their second 3A wrestling title in three years in the winter then defending their 3A baseball title this spring.

True’s incredible accomplishments on the fields and on the mat earned him the Greeley Tribune’s Boys Athlete of the Year honor for the 2021-22 high school sports campaign.

True was also a part of Eaton’s previous football and baseball championship teams a year-plus ago during his sophomore season.

On the football field this past fall he recorded 112 tackles 68 solo from his middle linebacker position.

On offense he lined up at fullback and ran for 253 yards and seven touchdowns on 45 carries. He also caught 21 passes for 233 yards and two touchdowns.

During the winter wrestling season he capped his 41-11 season by placing third in the 220-pound bracket at the 3A state wrestling tournament.

Then on the diamond this spring True hit a team-best .571 to go with 53 RBI three home runs 14 doubles and two triples. He had a team-best on-base percentage of .682 particularly impressive for a powerful yet precise batter who also slugs .922.

Like many of his Eaton football teammates — along with past and present athletes throughout the area — True’s efforts on the field were inspired heavily by Larry Adams a longtime coach and teacher at Eaton who also coached at Arickaree Highland Northridge Greeley West Resurrection Christian and the University of Northern Colorado.

In a recent question-and-answer session with Greeley Tribune sports reporter Bobby Fernandez True discussed along with other topics the connection he continues to have with the recently deceased Adams and his family.

Q: (Bobby Fernandez) The past 18 months you’ve been a part of two football championship a wrestling championship of course two baseball championships. Most high school kids would be lucky and fortunate to win one state title but you’ve won five in the past 18 months. How would you describe this incredible experience you’ve had the past year and a half?

A: (Ryder True) Just unbelievable you know? Like you said every kid dreams of it. I’ve been fortunate to get six of them (including a wrestling title in 2020). So it’s unbelievable being able to do this with some of your best friends.

Q: Have you had a favorite moment over these last couple years competing in athletics here at Eaton?

A: Probably the last football game against University here. It was the last football game at this stadium which is awesome. It was probably one of the funnest games I’ve ever played in — just back and forth. That’s probably my best memory winning that game.

Q: How old were you when you first started playing sports Ryder?

A: Probably 2.

Q: Wow. Do you recall if you played everything right away? I mean was there a specific sport that you gravitated toward initially? Or was it just exactly what you’re doing now: Try everything out?

A: Yeah I did everything. I went from football basketball wrestling baseball. I did it all. I did wrestle a lot. I traveled quite a bit for wrestling but then I went towards football more.

Q: What was it about athletics — and then specifically when you started to gravitate more toward football — what was it about football that really drew you in and captured your interest?

A: The brotherhood and just going out there and getting to play with my friends and hitting people. It’s just a lot of fun.

Q: Athletics aside what do you like to do for fun? I know you stay so busy with school so busy with athletics. But when you get a weekend just to do whatever Ryder wants to do what do you like to do?

A: I like to go fishing and also go work on the farm. I like working on the farm a lot.

Q: Do you live on a farm?

A: No I live in town. But Larry Adams — I went and worked with his family. So it was a lot of fun.

Q: Of course the most incredible thing is with all that you’ve done so far you still have one more year left and it’s your senior year. I know you want to make that a special one. What’s left for you to do? Are there still one or two things you really want to check off your checklist?

A: I’d really like to make the All-State Game. That’s my main goal right now.

When paired with the Breaktor circuit protection technology which combines current switching and resettable bidirectional short-circuit protection with fast actuation Eaton’s BDU eliminates the need for up to 15 additional system components the company says. Traditional systems require a combination of pyro and thermal fuses and contactors.

The BDU’s primary function is to serve as an on/off switch to the battery depending on the mode the EV is operating in such as charging or driving. Current model EVs rely on one of three traditional BDU configurations: fuse and contactor; pyro fuse and contactor; or fuse pyro fuse and contactor all used together in a single BDU. While all provide switching and protection functions they each have disadvantages including overall system complexity serviceability coordination difficulties and susceptibility to fatigue under high current levels the company says.

Eaton’s Breaktor circuit protection technology also enables up to 350 kW DC fast charging when used to protect and switch the DC fast-charge circuit allowing EVs to charge in 15 minutes or less the company says. This capability is made possible by recent upgrades to the Breaktor circuit protection technology’s thermal management and materials to boost its power capacity. Breaktor circuit protection technology is now able to carry 500 amps continuously and up to 750 amps of continuous current when an active or passive cooling system is leveraged.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMi8wNy8wMi9yYWNpbmctZHJpdmVyLWFiYmllLWVhdG9uLW9uLXJlY292ZXJpbmctZnJvbS1oZXItYXVzdGluLWNyYXNoLTE2OTE5ODg5L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMi8wNy8wMi9yYWNpbmctZHJpdmVyLWFiYmllLWVhdG9uLW9uLXJlY292ZXJpbmctZnJvbS1oZXItYXVzdGluLWNyYXNoLTE2OTE5ODg5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Racing driver Abbie Eaton on recovering from her Austin crash,"Abbie Eaton: ‘I’ve always been out. I’ve never hidden who I am’ (Picture: Sam Bloxham)

The driving star on Racing Pride – the sport’s LGBTQ+ charity – competing with her partner Jessica and her favourite James Bond car.

What was your first car?

A Renault Clio. And you know what? I was really sensible. I guess I’ve always saved the speeding for the track.

What do you drive now?

I’m lucky to have a partnership with a BMW dealership in Colchester. I’m currently driving an X3 M Competition and it’s a pocket rocket. It’s a 503bhp SUV but you don’t feel the size of it.

Your partner Jessica Hawkins races alongside you in the W Series. Is that where you met?

I met Jess before the W Series. Motorsport is a small world especially for the female drivers. I remember crossing paths with her at Goodwood and seeing what she was up to but when I came to W Series we got to know each other a bit more became friends and now we’ve been together for two and a half years almost.

How competitive are you two?

We’re always competitive – we’d be rubbish racing drivers if we weren’t. But if one of us is having a difficult time or our confidence is tested we’re always there to support each other. Ultimately we both want each other to do well. The dream is to be at the front together.

Abbie races a Scuderia W

Who’s the best at power-slides?

We argue over this! But I’ll say Jess just so I have a happy girlfriend.

Jess is an Aston Martin Racing ambassador and was a stunt driver on the last Bond film. What’s your favourite 007 car?

I really liked the Land Rover Defenders in No Time To Die. They stood up to some pretty big stunts.

Last October you broke your back at the W Series race in Austin Texas yet you’re back this season. How?

It was the most painful thing I’ve been through. It was a freak accident. I’m still not 100 per cent but I’m a lot further along than I was nine months ago. Racing drivers are very impatient but you can’t be impatient with a spinal injury.

Was it difficult to come out?

I’ve always been out. I’ve never hidden who I am. I realised I was gay at probably 17. I’ve never been ashamed of being a gay person and have always been open in the public eye. It’s important for me to be involved with Racing Pride [motorsport’s LGBTQ+ charity] and using the platform I have to show you can be a successful female in a male-dominated industry. If my journey inspires other people then that’s a real positive.

There’s a big push in motorsport on inclusivity and diversity at the moment much more than when I started racing but we need to keep pushing. It needs to be at the core of the sport.

Abbie: ‘Motorsport is a small world especially for the female drivers’ (Picture: Sam Bloxham)

What’s the best electric vehicle you’ve driven?

I’m biased because I’m a test driver for EV company Fisker. But I’m definitely on board with the electric world. It’s a difficult transition and I’ll miss the noise and smell of IC engines but EVs produce instant torque smoothness and silence.

American Bull Fighting is growing in popularity throughout arenas across the U.S. The competition pits a lone bullfighter against a Mexican fighting bull to see who has the better moves.

Mexican Fighting Bulls are a bit smaller than the bucking bulls used in rodeo bull riding. Their smaller stature allows them to be more nimble and possess more stamina. Mexican Fighting Bulls are also extremely smart and can pick up on a bullfighter’s moves fairly quickly.

The goal of the bullfighters is to stay as close to the bull as possible (without getting trampled). Scores for the bullfighters are based on control style speed and tricks. The more tricks you pull off the better the score.

While the bullfighters’ goal is to not get mowed over it’s the bulls’ job to be as aggressive angry and ornery as possible and not let the bullfighter best the animal in their moves. The more aggressive engaging and fast the bull the more points.Unlike Spanish bullfighting the event does not incorporate swords or harming or killing of the animals.

Both bullfighters and bulls have 40-seconds in the ring with an optional 20-seconds should the bullfighter choose to prolong the insanity. As in bull riding 50% of the score is based on the bullfighter’s performance and the other 50% is based on the bull’s performance.

This year’s event was set up into five qualifying rounds with two bullfighters competing in each round. The bullfighter with the top score moved on to the finals.

This year the following bullfighters came out to show off their technical abilities in the Greeley Stampede’s American Bull Fighting event:

Jacob Rutherford

Westlee Jones

Kye Hicks

Kody Davis

Dylan Idleman

Malaqi Cook

Clayton Kneebone

Roper Rich

Chris Munroe

Andrew Garey

Rutherford got the competition started in the first round with a 81.5 score followed by Utah bullfighter Westlee Jones with a score of 83.

While Kye Hicks had good contact with his bull the Wyoming man had to take a few climbs up the fence to get out of the way of the charging beast.

Things went terribly awry for bullfighter Kody Davis who was in the second round along with Hicks. Davis was having a great performance up until he went down and the bull began to roll him with his head and step on the bullfighter.

Fellow bullfighters barreled into the ring to distract the bull so that Davis could get to safety. Unfortunately while the bull achieved its objective Davis left the competition with a score of zero.

“American Bull Fighting is like watching a car wreck — cringe worthy but fascinating” the announcer quipped.

In the third round bullfighters Dylan Idleman from Oklahoma and Texas boy Malaqi Cook took their run around the ring with a bull. Idleman’s bull got a bit too close to the bullfighter and was able to flip the man while Cook also got taken down.

Remarkably both bullfighters opted to take the extra 20 seconds in the ring with the combative animals. Idleman scored a 74 while Cook earned a score of 82.

Next up was Colorado natives Clayton Kneebone and Rich Roper. Kneebone fell and recovered but only ended up with a score of 63. Kneebone’s bull was so displeased with the score he decided to try and topple the fencing around the rear of the arena causing Wranglers to have to come out and reset the posts and secure the fence.

The 2021 Greeley Stampede champion and two-time American Bull Fighting champion Rich from Eaton entered the ring in his usual white cowboy shirt with black fringe. Rich’s bull busted out of the chute ready to obliterate anything in its path but Rich proved why he was a champion bullfighter. The Eaton man maintained close proximity with the animal and stayed in control of his performance throughout the entire 60-seconds.

Rich’s performance was the highest in the qualifying event at 86.5.

The last round featured Texas bullfighter Chris Munroe and Andrew Garey from Kersey.

Monroe laid down a solid performance despite having to fling himself over the fence to escape the constant barrage of horns from his bull. Monroe’s performance earned him a score of 76.

Twisting the ends of his handlebar mustache Garey waited to see what would come charging out of the chute. The duo’s performance earned them an 82 from the judges.

In between the qualifying round and the finals the event hosted King of Beers competition which allowed volunteers to show off their novice bullfighting moves.

Three teams of two men had to work together fill up a pitcher with water from buckets located around the ring using only a glass. One man was fitted with a Kevlar vest and his job was to fill the pitcher while the second man donning a plastic blow up bubble worked to keep a bull distracted for his team member.

Things did not start off well as the bull immediately burst one man’s bubble and began to roll and knock him around the ring. The other two teams took advantage of their competitor’s situation and ran frantically between the pitcher and water bucket trying to fill the pitcher as quickly as possible.

With so much chaos bubbles popping pitchers flying and men running combined with one angry bull it was questionable if anyone really won the competition.

Upon cleaning up pitchers and popped bubbles and resetting some of the fencing the top scoring bullfighters were ready to compete in the finals.

The final round of the competition featured Jones Hicks Cook Rich and Garey.

Rich was given a new bull after his first bull wasn’t really in the mood to play tag and refused to engage with the bullfighter or rather anyone.

The re-assignment proved to be positive for Rich as the current champion jumped over the bull maintained close contact kept the bull engaged and provided the crowded grandstands with the show they were expecting. Rich’s stellar performance earned him a score of 87.5 as well as a second championship title at the Greeley Stampede.

“You know if it was any better I’d be on the beach in the Dominican Republic. I’ll tell you what it’s the best feeling in the world to win your hometown rodeo” Rich exclaimed. “I’ll be back next year.”

In addition to a different format the American Bull Fighting event also featured a mounted shooting competition from the Colorado Regulators. Mounted shooting the fastest growing equine sport in the world is a team sport of a shooter and their horse running a course set with 10 balloons. The shooter uses two Long Colt .45 single action revolvers loaded with blanks to pop the balloons. The participant is score on time and number of balloons popped.

Penalties can be added to a shooter’s time for each missed balloon knocked over barrel or not following the course of fire.

Mounted shooting has different levels that represent a shooter’s skill with 1 being the beginning and 6 being a Master Mounted Shooter and all ages are welcome to participate in mounted shooting events.

De Chapman ran her course flawlessly and fast to earn a time of 9.4 seconds and the title of winner for the event. Rick Carlson came in second with a time of 9.6 seconds and Delos Searle was third with a time of 9.9 seconds.

The Sydney man who sold an item to an unknown buyer on eBay suspected something was amiss when he received a link purporting to be from Australia Post which took him to an online chat.

In the online chat a person appearing to be an Australia Post customer service representative named Sophie requested the man's bank details so he could receive payment for the item.

""I think I'm getting scammed. Someone bought something off ebay.com.au from me. This is what they sent me"" shared the confused man on Facebook.

The Sydneysider also shared a screenshot of the exchange between himself and the scammer which features Australia Post branding.

Australia Post and eBay have confirmed to Yahoo News Australia that it is a scam that has been circulating.

Scammer poses as Australia Post employee

""Is this Australia Post?"" asked the eBay seller in the online chat.

The scammer responded with what appears to be an automated message requesting payment details from the seller.

""Welcome to support the goods and delivery have been paid for. Please enter your details to receive payment for the goods. If you need my help please let me know"" reads the opening line of the scammer's message.

""This is the official link for receiving funds from AUSPOST"" the scammer added.

The man soon caught on that it was odd for a delivery service to request details that are securely stored on eBay.

""My details are in eBay. Why would you need them again?"" he asked the fake Australia Post employee.

The scammer responded by saying: ""You are talking about two different services. We don't share card information and we don't share information with third parties.""

'It is a scam' confirms Australia Post and eBay

""We have reviewed the post and we can confirm it is a scam"" an Australia Post spokesperson told Yahoo News.

The spokesperson said that it is important for customers to remember that Australia Post would never ""call text or email to request payment"" or ""ask you to click on an email link to print off a label to redeem your package"".

Australia Post would also never call text or email asking for personal or financial information including password credit card details or account information.

Similarly an eBay spokesperson urged users to be vigilant against scammers impersonating companies.

""eBay will never ask you to provide confidential information like your password or credit card details. We won't include attachments we'll never use threatening language and we'll always send a copy of any important messages to your eBay messages"" the spokesperson said.

""If a message doesn't appear to be from a legitimate source contains a suspicious URL demands immediate action or asks for personal information users should not respond and report any activity to us via spoof@ebay.com.au.""

How to protect yourself from scammers

On closer inspection it's evident the communication claiming to be from Australia Post is a phishing scam which is a type of scam that attempts to trick people into sharing personal details by pretending to be from a legitimate business.

In this case the scammer claiming to be from Australia Post used the man's details from eBay to lure him to click a link and directed him to an online chat that was designed to look genuine.

According to Scamwatch people can protect themselves from phishing scams by never clicking links or opening attachments from emails claiming to be from trusted organisations who ask you to verify details.

People who are worried they've received a spam link should also check the internet address of the website – as it will not be the official website of the organisation as in this instance.

But given their focus on economic driving they still managed to build a solid customer base in the United States.Unfortunately 1964 wasn’t exactly the best year of the Corvair. Despite the introduction of a series of engine updates including a power increase of the base unit from 80 to 95 horsepower the sales of the Corvair still went down significantly with the GM brand selling no less than 73000 units fewer than in the previous year.But as said the Corvair continued to be a very intriguing purchase for many Americans and this rust-free example is here to show precisely why.There’s a reason why we mentioned the rust-free thing from the very beginning. The car has spent no less than 40 years off the road so it’s quite impressive that it doesn’t exhibit any metal problems.The car still comes with the original black paint and while it’s being sold without an engine the original unit is still available if the buyer is aiming for the original setup. The car comes with lots of parts that can be used for the restoration including new door panels the trunk seal a front grill bar and so on.Finding an all-original Corvair in such good shape isn’t something that happens very often and this is why the car has already received 10 bids as part of the auction started by eBay seller thatboss429 . The top $1800 offer however isn’t high enough to unlock the reserve.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2RhcnlvLnV6L2VuLzIwMjIvMDcvMDIvd2UtdGVhY2gtdXpiZWstYnVzaW5lc3Mtb3duZXJzLWhvdy10by1zZWxsLW9uLWViYXktYW1hem9uLWFuZC1hbGliYWJhLXBsYXRmb3Jtcy1hbm5hYmVsLXN5a2VzLXhzbS1jb25zdWx0YW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""We teach Uzbek business owners how to sell on eBay Amazon and Alibaba platforms"" — Annabel Sykes XSM ...","""We teach Uzbek business owners how to sell on eBay Amazon and Alibaba platforms"" — Annabel Sykes XSM consultant

On July 1 21 craftsmen who completed the e-commerce course within the framework of the Ready 4 Trade Central Asia project were awarded a certificate ""Daryo"" reports.

The project funded by the European Union was carried out by the International Trade Center. Annabel Sykes the centre's e-commerce consultant said that this project has begun to bear its fruits.

""Our project started in 2020 and over the past 18 months we have trained 40 representatives of small and medium-sized businesses in 12 regions of Uzbekistan on e-commerce. Today 21 of them were presented with certificates for completing the ""electronic trade for small and medium-sized businesses"" training course. The project produced 8 national trainers. During the project participants made $108000 worth of sales online.

In particular businessmen learned to work with various marketplaces in particular trading on eBay Amazon and Alibaba platforms. They opened online stores. Also within the framework of the project we created 5 video lessons on the Uzbek language YouTube platform for learning e-commerce"" he said.

Francois Bejo head of the cooperation department of the European Union delegation in Uzbekistan also expressed his opinion at the event.

""Development of online commerce is the need of the hour. Today it is hard to imagine life without digital commerce. All products can be easily purchased online from the comfort of your home or office. The project we are implementing is based on the development of e-commerce"" said the representative of the European Union.

Feruz Temirov a miniature artist who received a special certificate also expressed his opinion about this project.

""I have a gallery in Bukhara. This project was started during the pandemic. The goal is to support Central Asian artisans that is to teach them how to sell their products through an online store. I also participated in the project. We were given an online lesson by specialists through the Zoom network. For example we learned how to open a site on the eBay platform how to make money transfers and through which mails the product can be delivered to the buyer.

With the help of this project I opened my online store ""Art Feruz"" on eBay and we got a lot of customers. At the same time I got to know dozens of collectors. We started to enter the world market through the trading platform. We are currently selling products to the USA and European countries.

By Jason Collins |

The fans and newcomers of the Skate skateboarding sim franchise didn’t have plenty to look forward to for the past decade since the release of 2010’s Skate 3 until two months ago when an information leak revealed that Skate 4 (now titled skate.) is in active development. Despite previously revealing the game EA tried hiding the facts and removing leaked information but it was too late; the cat was out of the bag. Now the game’s developer Full Circle released a pre-alpha trailer for the upcoming Skate 4. You can check out the trailer below:

Admittedly Full Circle stated that the trailer footage is put together using various prototypes of the game or as they have put it the pre-pre-pre-alpha versions of Skate 4. According to a report published by IGN the trailer is noticeably transparent about the game’s development process granting fans of the franchise a glimpse of various characters traversing the in-game world. Of course they also included all the interesting bugs and unnatural positions the skaters found themselves when said errors occurred.

However there are also segments of the trailer in which Skate 4 looks pretty polished showcasing what might be in store in the future. Luckily in most cases the finished product doesn’t look anything like the pre-alpha trailer. It usually looks feels and plays a lot better. But on the other hand this is developed under Electronic Arts publishing and comparing the latest Battlefield 2042 game with its trailer; we’d say that EA is still a couple of promises short — like delivering a working game.

Hopefully that won’t be the case with the upcoming Skate 4. Full Circle made the fans feel appreciated by taking their feedback into account. The game’s pre-pre-pre-alpha trailer showcases a variety of comments the developers took into account allegedly confirming some unprecedented features within the franchise like the introduction of non-binary characters. And while this might be a novelty for the Skate franchise it certainly isn’t anything new when it comes to Electronic Arts which recently introduced customizable pronouns in its The Sims games.

There are other novelties as well; it seems that free-funning (parkour) also made it to the game though to the extent that won’t overshadow the skating element of the game leaving parkour enthusiasts with Mirror’s Edge gaming titles and perhaps one of the better entries in the Assassin’s Creed gaming franchise. Besides the aforementioned customization options and free-running the ability to climb up skate sports and cross-platform play is also some of the mentioned features though we’re still not sure about the Skate 4 cross-gen play.

Given that Skate 4’s timeline isn’t discernable from the trailer and its current pre-pre-pre-alpha state it’s entirely reasonable to expect the game to arrive in very late 2022 but more probably sometime in 2023. This means that developers may forego cross-gen play due to Sony’s plan to stop releasing PS4 games by 2025. Unfortunately we can’t state anything for sure given the scarcity of details surrounding the game but we know it will also release on PC which is the franchise’s first on the platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jdWx0dXJlbGl2ZXJwb29sLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdGF0ZS1saXZlcnBvb2wtc3RhZ2VzLWFsaXN0YWlyLWdlbnRyeXMtMjUtcmVjdGlmaWNhdGlvbi1mb3Itd2UtYXJlLWludmlzaWJsZS13ZS1hcmUtdmlzaWJsZS1uYXRpb25hbC1mZXN0aXZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tate Liverpool stages Alistair Gentry's 25% Rectification for We Are Invisible We Are Visible national festival,"On 2 July Tate Liverpool will join 29 museums and galleries across the UK to host We Are Invisible We Are Visible (WAIWAV) presented by DASH the disabled-led visual arts organisation. Alistair Gentry will be creating work in the galleries modifying reproductions of pictures in the Tate collection to highlight the absence of representation of the disabled population within art.

Titled 25% Rectification Gentry’s intervention references the fact that nearly a quarter of people in the UK identify as disabled neurodivergent or D/deaf but we also don’t see them as subjects of art a quarter of the time. Gentry will perform his rectifications on reproductions of iconic works in the Tate collection adding items such as hearing aids wheelchairs prosthetics guide dogs and medication.

The event is free with the opportunity to drop in throughout the day at Tate Liverpool to see Gentry creating his artistic interventions on works such as Auguste Rodin’s The Kiss 1901–4 and William Hogarth’s The Painter and his Pug 1745.

Ahead of the event Alistair Gentry said: “In the spirit of Dada artists like Marcel Duchamp cheekily adding a moustache and beard to the Mona Lisa I’m taking it upon myself to actively ‘correct’ the canon of Western art and make it more to my liking. I’m hoping this makes people think about all the types of people we don’t see represented in mainstream art as subjects or models.”

Gentry makes performance lectures interventions participatory experiences and live role-playing games mainly for communities and audiences outside of conventional gallery theatre or performance spaces.

His inspiration comes from folklore magic silly costumes museums absurdity the uncanny valley doing things that help people think improving the world incrementally and making machines and systems do things their makers wouldn’t approve of.

Gentry is a former artist in residence at The Open Data Institute (London) Pervasive Media Studio (Bristol) the ESRC Genomics Policy & Research Forum at the University of Edinburgh and The Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence University of Cambridge. He has shown work at Folkestone Triennial La Biennale di Venezia Art on the Underground London Furtherfield London International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA) and Abandon Normal Devices at FACT Liverpool.

25% Rectification is part of WAIWAV which will see 31 d/Deaf Disabled and Neurodivergent artists stage Dada-inspired interventions to mark the 102nd anniversary of the 1st Dada International Exhibition in Berlin. WAIWAV asks the question – what if the Dada movement had started in 2020 in lockdown? What would they have done? Is now a timely moment to resurrect the spirit and essence of Dada?

Alistair Gentry 25% Rectification will be at Tate Liverpool on Saturday 2 July from 10am to 4pm.

But says neuroscientist Ignacio Morgado it’s an illusion that helps us live better lives. “Freedom includes a sense of responsibility which generates social cohesion and promotes cooperation among people” said Morgado. It’s a useful illusion that can also victimize some people. Some of the most visible victims are overweight people who now make up 53.6% of Spain’s population. Yet many people including doctors think overweight people have a character flaw that prevents them from getting off the sofa and doing some exercise for better health.

This perspective on obesity as a lifestyle choice and not as a disease has meant that “there never has been any investment in [anti-obesity] drugs in Spain” according to Cristóbal Morales an endocrinologist at the Virgin of Macarena Hospital (Hospital Virgen Macarena) in Seville (Spain) and a member of the Spanish Obesity Society (Sociedad Española de Obesidad - SEEDO). Nevertheless the relationship between excess weight and diabetes some types of cancer and cardiovascular disease is well known and some drugs to help very obese people lose weight have already been developed.

Diabetes drugs such as liraglutide and semaglutide administered at higher doses have proven to be effective for weight loss. A clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2021 showed that semaglutide resulted in an average weight loss of 15% in a group of nearly 2000 patients and a third of the study group lost more than 20% of their weight. The drug has been such a success in the United States that its manufacturer Novo Nordisk quickly ran out of supply shortly after its use for obesity was approved. The Spanish national health system will cover the cost of liraglutide and semaglutide when used to treat diabetes but not for obesity.

These drugs mimic incretins the hormones produced by our body when we eat. “They are analogs that are artificially modified to last longer in the body” said Guadalupe Sabio who researches the biological causes of diseases such as obesity at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC) in Madrid. They also stimulate insulin production by the pancreas and reduce blood glucose levels which makes them useful for treating diabetes. As they regulate what happens in the body when food is ingested these drugs “also reduce appetite prolong satiety [the feeling of fullness] and increase the basal metabolic rate [the amount of energy consumed by a body at rest] thereby increasing thermogenesis [the process of producing body heat]” said Sabio.

“Once the efficacy of this type of drug is widely recognized” said Morales “many pharmaceutical companies will develop and test their own products and overall supply will increase.” The latest drug of this type approved in the US for treating diabetes is tirzepatide manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company which will also seek approval for its use in treating obesity. “It’s so powerful that half of the patients using it practically go into remission from diabetes” said Morales. Administered at higher doses Lilly’s product has proven to be surprisingly effective at battling obesity. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that it resulted in an average weight loss of 22.5% which can amount to 55 pounds in some patients.

The success of these drugs makes some experts ask whether they can match the results of weight-loss procedures such as bariatric surgery and intragastric balloon placement. “I don’t think these drugs will supplant surgery altogether but they can an alternative treatment for some overweight conditions” said Carolina Perdomo an endocrinology and nutrition specialist at the Navarra University Hospital in Pamplona (Spain). “Some people need to lose weight before having surgery so these drugs can serve as a bridge therapy leading up to the surgical procedure” she said.

Rubén Nogueiras a researcher at the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain) thinks that these drugs could be used to treat obesity continuously in the same way they are used to treat diabetes. “Obesity is a chronic disease so one would expect the drug therapy to be chronic as well.” This raises the question of possible side effects from long-term use but Nogueiras does not consider this likely. “The most common side effect is nausea during the first two weeks of treatment but most patients handle the drug well after that. So far no major side effects from long-term use have been found during the extensive clinical trials that have been conducted” said Nogueiras. “These [drugs] are compounds that stimulate normal pathways in our body so the side effects are minimal. If a semaglutide slows down digestion and makes food remain in the stomach longer some digestive discomfort may occur but nothing more” said Guadalupe Sabio.

Dieting disappointments

Significant numbers of people diet regularly (around 20% of the Spanish population according to some surveys) and fail to main those diets at the same rate (around 80% according to SEEDO). Anti-obesity drugs could become an instant commercial success if not for their high price which could cost hundreds of dollars per month. If not covered by private health insurance plans or national health systems the cost could be an insurmountable obstacle for most people. However experts caution that these drugs are indicated for people who have been diagnosed with chronic obesity and are not meant for those who just want to slim down a bit to look good at the beach. In the study that tested tirzepatide to treat obesity the average weight of the participants was 230 pounds and their average body mass index (BMI) was 38 [weight divided by height in meters squared. An individual with a BMI above 25 is considered to be overweight. A BMI above 30 indicates obesity]. In some countries like Brazil says Cristóbal Morales “drugs sales for weight loss are enormous.” He warns against “trivializing obesity and treating it like an aesthetic problem when comprehensive lifestyle interventions are needed.”

Obesity begins in the mother’s womb and becomes entrenched through habits developed during early childhood. It is further aggravated by the large supply of unhealthy foods available in supermarkets and sedentary lifestyles brought on by social and technological changes. Fernando Fernández Aranda head of research at the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL) in Barcelona (Spain) and also head of the eating disorders unit at Bellvitge University Hospital specializes in the psychological aspects of eating disorders. He believes that this type of drug can be “used to complement healthy habits exercise and psychological support but is not a magic solution.” Fernández says obesity is a complex issue and “for individuals especially women who have suffered significant neglect or emotional stress during childhood or adolescence it can affect their eating behavior.”

Azucena García Palacios a psychology professor at the Jaume I University in Castellón (Spain) and a member of the Spanish Biomedical Research Center in Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition says that “losing weight is not hard – keeping it off is the hard part.” People fitted with intragastric balloons sometimes fail to maintain their weight loss which could also happen with pharmacological treatments. García says that these drugs “should not be sold as panaceas. Systematic studies have shown that people with previous psychological problems have a much lower success rate after an intragastric balloon placement.” She says that “obese people have more mental health problems” and psychological treatment is a form of support for people who need to lose weight due to a medical problem. For it to work the individual circumstances of each patient must be assessed. “When we want people to exercise we know that if the activity is not linked to something meaningful for the patient it’s difficult to sustain the exercise routine over time so we work to create that link” said García. “To treat binge eating we have to look at the emotions that lead to binge eating. It could be a sense of rejection or maybe it’s just a habit. But the binge eating might be associated with a diagnosable problem such as major depressive disorder. We have to see the look at the individual’s vulnerabilities and see where they lead so we can decide how we are going to act in each case” she said.

The surprisingly positive results of the new anti-obesity drugs are according to the experts good news for people with serious health problems caused by excess weight. But before they can be treated with these drugs private health insurance companies and national health systems must first acknowledge that obesity is a disease. This has already happened in the United Kingdom. The next step would be for the cost of these drugs to be covered by health insurance and national health systems. But for the time being anyone wanting to lose a few pounds to fit into a wedding dress shouldn’t think about this type of solution. Nevertheless the popularity of cosmetic procedures such as liposuction leaves little doubt that some people will want these drugs for a quick fix. But there are so many people who are overweight or obese there is little chance of finding a solution without a global strategy. This strategy must address every aspect of the problem from thoroughly understanding the condition’s most basic mechanisms to challenging the social and economic aspects of a way of life that leads to an ever-increasing number of people vulnerable to one of the major diseases of the modern world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qZW5uaWZlci1sb3Blei1iZW4tYWZmbGVjay13ZWFyLTE1NTkwMDI4OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck Wear Casual Outfits to Browse Luxury Cars In Beverly Hills,"Adorable affianced couple Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez enjoyed a Saturday afternoon out in Beverly Hills California looking casual and in love as they browsed luxury cars at the local Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Dealer. J.Lo was wearing a white long-sleeved shirt with a pair of light wash denim jeans featuring wide-legged bell bottoms. Her white sneakers just peeked out under the hem. She carried a large colorful Christian Dior purse and wore a pair of gold-rimmed sunglasses and gold hoop earrings.

Affleck wore a light jacket with three buttons over his black t-shirt and black pants and white sneakers. They walked hand-in-hand as they strolled around the parking lot laughing and smiling as they seemingly discussed the merchandise.

They were accompanied by Affleck's 10-year-old son Samuel also wearing black jeans like his dad and a blue t-shirt. Samuel recently backed a yellow Lamborghini into a BMW in a garage in Los Angeles called 777 Exotics according to the Daily Mail. Affleck had allowed his son a chance behind the wheel and he accidentally sent the car into reverse. Luckily there wasn't any visible damage to the vehicles or anyone involved. Lopez was apparently seated behind the young driver when things went awry.

One of Affleck's reps told TMZ everyone was fine and an employee at 777 Exotics employee said there “was no accident.”

“When [Samuel] got into the car it jerked back and forth” he said. “We have a small lot and the cars are close...Everybody was okay! They seemed happy and continued to browse. The dealership would more than gladly welcome the stars back.”

They added “Affleck loves cars. We hope they come in again.”

Since the Independent Construction Industry Rating Tool (iCIRT) register was launched in May including the first 19 companies rated as trustworthy four families told Chandler they had withdrawn deposits from unrated builders and developers and taken their business to one built by a rated company.

iCIRT was introduced as part of reforms aimed at avoiding repeats of the Mascot and Opal towers debacles which sparked a NSW parliamentary inquiry into construction standards and led to Chandler’s appointment as building commissioner.

iCIRT scrutinises and then rates developers with those given three or more stars out of five included on the new register. The platform applies to multi-unit multi-storey builds including town houses and apartments but is likely to be extended in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Is there any way to stop them?,"Private equity-backed companies are gobbling up vast swaths of residential property across the country including in Omaha.

They are buying up hundreds of thousands of homes every few months. Then they are renting them out often for more money and often in neighborhoods with larger Black populations and more single mothers than the national average.

The result: The number of tenants behind on rent in these homes has nearly doubled in the past three years according to a new report by the House Committee on Financial Services.

The Congressional committee and many other groups are now seeking to understand the impact that private equity companies are having on American homeownership – and searching for solutions.

Nebraska is not immune. According to a recent investigation by Flatwater Free Press and KETV Channel 7 Vinebrook Homes has been the largest buyer of single-family homes in Douglas County in the past two years. Vinebrook now appears to be the third-largest landlord in the city with most properties in North Omaha.

Across the nation and the Omaha metro community groups and local leaders are searching for answers: Should they combat companies like Vinebrook? If so how?

Other states are trying to enact laws to regulate private equity landlords. Nonprofits are trying to fill the gaps promoting homeownership through community land trusts. In Omaha local organizations are working to support homeownership in low-income neighborhoods.

Many Omaha residents may not know about out-of-state real estate companies like Vinebrook. But in other cities where these companies started buying up homes more than a decade ago it’s now clear that the Vinebrooks of the world have changed the homeownership landscape.

“Many residents….suspected that something was going on” said Rutgers University Law Professor David Troutt co-author of a housing ownership study focused on Newark New Jersey. “They knew it for the number of houses that seemed to be changing hands they knew it from rising rents and they knew it from the badgering calls knocks on doors…but they didn’t know exactly what.

“And now that they know…that it is an unprecedented number of outside investors seeking rent…there’s been a sense of ‘what next?’”

Across the country some state leaders are trying to change the home-purchase process itself.

In 2020 California signed a law to prohibit the bulk sale of foreclosed properties at auction. It raised fines for vacant property owners who fail to maintain their homes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9yZWFsZXN0YXRlL2FydGljbGUvQmxhY2stQmF5LUFyZWEtcmVzaWRlbnRzLW93bi1ob21lcy1hdC1oYWxmLXRoZS0xNzI3NzU2Ny5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Bay Area residents own homes at half the rate of white neighbors.

The developers are Lemor Development LLC and Empire Development Capital Holding LLC.

Lenor Empire and the city have a nonbinding Letter of Intent that would have the city selling the lots for a price to be determined through an appraisal process. The properties are at 297 Glenwood Ave. and 146 and 164 Lake Ave. The properties currently are vacant and when combined would create a site of just over 0.9 acres in size.

The proposed building would cost an estimated $79 million to construct not including the land cost. The total height would be 176 feet and there would be parking on the first through fourth floors for 138 vehicles in addition to space for building mechanicals and a gymnasium for residents. Floors five through 14 would be for the apartments.

The development would be known as Glenwood Hill Manor. There would be 10 studios 70 one-bedroom units 77 two-bedroom apartments and 20 three-bedroom units. The units would be priced to be affordable to people earning from 40% to 80% of the area median income for Westchester County.

The proposed building site is along the northwestern side of Father Finian Sullivan Drive and the southeastern side of Somerville Place. Nearby are Finian Sullivan Tower which is a 13-story affordable housing development and Monastery Manor which is a 12-story affordable housing development.

Attorney Neil Alexander of the White Plains-based law firm Cuddy & Feder told the Yonkers Planning Board that Lermor Development “focuses on transforming underserved communities and enhancing living standards by acquiring preserving constructing and managing quality and sustainable workforce and affordable housing while also establishing strategic partnerships with other minority developers contractors and suppliers.” He said that the company was formed by Kenneth Morrison company president and Harrison Rayford who is its director of acquisitions.

“Lemor has a strong commitment to reducing the critical shortage of affordable housing” Alexander told the board. “It also simultaneously works to positively impact the lives of tenants beyond the four walls. Lemor further seeks to inspire and grow minority firms as a diverse and socially aware developer.”

Lemor traces its roots to the mid-1960s when Leroy Morrison father of Kenneth Morrison started purchasing property in Harlem. The company has specialized in rehabilitating existing housing stock as well as building new mixed-use mixed-income and affordable housing.

In October of last year TruFund Financial Services Inc. a Community Development Financial Institution located in New York City announced that it had made an equity investment in Lemor which TruFund described as “a Black-owned real estate firm that specializes in the development and management of affordable and workforce housing.” The equity investment was to allow Lemor “to leverage increased liquidity fund affordable/workforce housing project development and grow internal capacity.”

Alexander described the other entity in the Yonkers development Empire Development Capital Holding as “a real estate consulting and development company based out of the New York City area with a focus on multifamily residential affordable housing projects.” He said that company founder Donell Leverett has more than 15 years”™ experience in the affordable housing industry and worked for the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and a variety of community development corporations.

The Yonkers Planning Board will be handling the environmental review of the project. In addition to merging the various lots into a single tax lot the developer is asking that the Yonkers City Council rezone the site from the current M zone that allows medium-density apartments to the A zone that allows high-density apartment buildings.

Alexander said that remapping of the property to the A zone is consistent with the immediately adjacent Monastery Manor Tower and a means to minimize the number and intensity of area variances required for the project.

The developer had a parking analysis prepared that concluded the number of proposed parking spaces is sufficient considering that the supply exceeds that of other similar facilities and that all of the spaces at the other facilities are not fully utilized.

According to Alexander the applicants hope that in the third quarter of this year the Planning Board will reach a conclusion regarding environmental impacts and that the City Council will adopt the requested rezoning. They further hope that in the fourth quarter of the year the Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals will handle the site plan and area variance reviews hold public hearings and grant necessary approvals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vcHJvcGVydHkvcmVzaWRlbnRpYWwvbmV3LWZ1bmQtd2lsbC1jby1pbnZlc3QtaW4taG9tZS1sb2Fucy1vZi10ZWFjaGVycy1udXJzZXMtcG9saWNlLTIwMjIwNzAzLXA1YXluOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New fund will co-invest in home loans of teachers nurses police,"Essential workers in NSW such as teachers police and nurses will have access from today to a new shared equity scheme that offers to co-invest up to 50 per cent of a mortgage so they can live close to work.

Also during their panel session speakers Farah K. Ahmed Cynthia Reichard Co-Chair of Fragrance Creators’ Board of Directors and Executive Vice President at Arylessence Inc. and Sumit Bhasin Fragrance Creators Board Member and Senior Vice President Innovation Product Development Corporate Research and Development at The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. emphasized the importance of value chain collaboration and supplier diversity and how digital can continue to enhance collaboration and meaningful transparency. The speakers reinforced the association’s commitment to advancing marketplace policies that allow all responsible businesses opportunity to create innovate and thrive while also delivering good for people and the planet.

The association also used the World Perfumery Congress as an opportunity to survey perfumers from around the world asking attendees to predict which scent will trend next in home care and in fine fragrance.

Step 2: Send a message through shareholder activism

Once you find out what companies in your investment portfolio are supporting abortion by paying for employees to travel for an abortion procedure among other pro-abortion policies and donations you should send a message (literally and figuratively) to those companies. An easy way to do this is to find the investor relations email or phone number on the corporate website and make contact. Here are some bullet points for you to consider in your message to these abortion-supporting businesses:

Abortion ends the life of a pre-born child and you are deeply opposed to your shareholder dollars being used to pay for such a procedure.

Abortion travel reimbursements are rife with tax and legal liabilities and as a shareholder you are concerned that the company is not acting responsibly with shareholders’ best interests in mind.

Abortion travel policies present a significant financial liability that may materially erode your returns as a shareholder.

Abortion travel policies open the door for costly abuse and fraud as companies likely will not be able to receive proof that employees actually used the money to have an abortion rather than just a free trip to sunny California on your shareholder dime.

Inform the company that if they refuse to stop payments for abortion travel you will be divesting of your shares – or – if you own individual shares (rather than a mutual fund) and it is possible with that particular company that you will be supporting a shareholder resolution to end that policy.

Step 3: Divest from or engage with abortion-supporting companies

If you own abortion-supporting companies through a mutual fund or ETF you do not have many options other than selling that fund and buying a different one that does not invest in abortion stocks so you need to research your options. You can find out about your pro-life investment options at inspireinvesting.com and if you want professional guidance from pro-life financial advisors specially trained and resourced to invest to support life you can connect with our team there.

If you own individual stocks rather than funds you also have the ability to file or join a shareholder resolution to oppose corporate abortion funding. This is a more complicated process but if there is a resolution being filed by our team at Inspire Investing or our pro-life allies it is exceedingly simple to support the effort with your shareholder proxy vote. To find out if there is a resolution in the works with the problem companies in your portfolio email us at inspire@inspireinvesting.com and also be sure to sign up for our newsletter at inspireinvesting.com to be informed of new resolutions and action plans you can participate in.

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade major corporations are adding abortion travel costs to their employee benefits.

The goal is to ensure their employees can seek abortion care if they live in states where the procedure is now or will soon be illegal.

Ever heard of ‘cheengu blue’?

We hadn’t either until the calming shade made its way to our Pinterest feeds.

Stylist journalist Leah Sinclair explained: ‘The cool tone has seen a surge of interest on the social media platform with people sharing how they incorporate the hue in their clothes make-up and homes.’

Cheengu blue is similar to baby blue like a lighter version of cornflower blue or Pantone’s colour of the year Very Peri.

Many of cheengu blue images online are tagged as a ‘South Korean aesthetic’ – and while there’s very little information out there about what cheengu actually means it may derive from the Korean word chingu which means friend.

The chambray hue is featured on everything from milk cartons to handbags with cloud and ocean imagery alongside cutesy daisy prints and clean lines.

Not only is the colour calming it goes perfectly with neutrals and brights alike conjuring thoughts of fresh washing hung out to dry against a perfect blue sky.

If that sounds like it’s up your street – and if you want to turn your home into a relaxed haven – we’ve rounded up our favourite cheengu blue buys.

Heads up Halloween lovers: there’s a new project in town and details of the new project are very hush hush- Disney hasn’t released a plot or even a title for the film in the works which has our wheels turning! What could it be?

So no plot no title? What DO we know? Filming will take place in Norwood Massachusetts during the month of August. According to the Norwood Community Media Disney plans to use several locations in using the town commons theater town hall and several parking lots. That’s um… not a lot to go on.

HOWEVER take a look at the town commons:

What much beloved Halloween movie does this remind you of? Halloweentown anyone?

While this is absolutely not confirmed and purely speculation at this point there is some support for the theory. According to entertainment website E! Halloweentown producer Sheri Singer has expressed a desire to create a sequel saying “I’d have to get Disney Channel to get on-board but I would like to [make Halloweentown 5]. I have ideas of how I would do it. There was some talk about it a year and a half ago but then it didn’t happen.”

Perhaps now is the time? After all we never thought we’d get a Hocus Pocus sequel either yet here we are! Though the original Halloweentown films were filmed in St. Helens Oregon it’s still possible this location could be related. After all it’s been 24 years since the first film’s debut. Marnie who was a young teen then would be an adult now and could have moved to New England.

Interestingly Kimberly Brown has an Etsy shop where she sells Halloweentown merchandise. Check out this photo of her modeling a (super cute) shirt while randomly holding a 5 balloon. She gives no explanation for the balloon. Could it be a subtle nod toward a new movie? Unlikely since she was recast in the fourth film but hey a girl can dream can’t she?

Another interesting theory is that it could be a Halloweentown remake. That would certainly not be surprising Disney is no stranger to remakes after all. The types of locations chosen for filming would seem to go hand in hand with the original.

It’s also entirely possible that this is an entirely new story which Halloween lover that I am would be so exciting! We will keep you updated on developments as they unfold. What do you think? Am I onto something with my theory or do you think I’m way off base? Let us know in the comments!",,,

Subsidy-free is not always what it seems. In recent years Cyprus has seen a wave of new PV parks that are often branded as “subsidy-free” but in many cases they do receive temporary subsidies. Specifically when a project is supported via a power purchase agreement (PPA) signed between a power generator and an offtaker this is typically subsidy-free. However the government has also allowed renewable energy projects to receive a variable subsidy the so-called avoidance cost.

The avoidance cost equals the amount of money national utility the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) saves by not paying fossil fuel power plants to generate when electricity is supplied by a renewable energy project. Cyprus does not have a competitive electricity market at present but when the country implements a competitive market design these projects will no longer be remunerated via the “avoidance cost” and will instead need to participate in the market.

Cyprus has fostered PV via various remuneration schemes. Ground mounted projects typically comprise solar farms supported either by government set feed-in tariffs (FITs) or a tariff set via competitive tender. Rooftop PV in Cyprus is generally installed under either net metering or net billing systems. These schemes are quite similar although systems installed under net billing unless energy storage is also included can only cover a maximum 80% of an investor’s annual energy needs. Net metering systems are also small and usually up to 10 kW per rooftop but net billing arrays can have capacities of 10 kW to 10 MW. Because of Cyprus’ compact size a net billing rooftop project can often be larger than a ground-mounted utility solar farm.

Installations

Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority (CERA) Chairman Andreas Poullikkas said that the country has installed 335 MW of PV capacity. Of this Poullikkas added about 100 MW are net metering and net billing systems. Cyprus has installed about 77 MW of PV capacity supported by government set FITs. The country has run only one renewable power auction awarding 50 MW of capacity in 2013. Of this only 35 MW has been installed.

The remaining installed solar has been executed via the “subsidy-free” provisions. Specifically 76 projects totalling 101.5 MW have been supported for the time being by the “avoidance cost” mechanism. In 2020 and 2021 74 of these projects were installed while another two were connected to the grid in early 2022.

Subsidy-free projects supported by PPAs comprise the most recent wave of solar installations in Cyprus. The government said Poullikkas encouraged a number of different renewable energy technologies to be developed under PPAs however only solar projects were able to get off the ground. The Cyprus Ministry of Energy Commerce and Industry (MECI) said in a press release in January 2022 that the PPA segment of the market features 132 systems of which 32 commenced operation in 2021. The remaining 100 systems will be electrified by the end of this year. Overall the PPA contracts correspond to 250 MW of solar capacity.

This last rush of solar projects predominantly in the form of “subsidy-free” projects allowed Cyprus to reach its renewable energy goals for 2020. However these goals lacked ambition. Thus Cyprus is currently generating only 16% of its electricity via renewables while for 2030 the country is aiming “at least [a] 26% share of renewables in gross final electricity consumption.”

Energy storage

Earlier this year MECI announced that the ministry is considering new tenders for systems combining renewable power and energy storage. The tender scheme for such systems is currently under consideration by the European Union (EU) and is pending approval.

Poullikkas said that the regulator hasn’t designed this tender scheme however he added that the regulator has established the rules defining how storage units will operate in the electricity market. CERA’s guidelines are technology agnostic.

Regarding behind-the-meter storage Poullikkas said that over the past three years CERA has licensed solar-plus-storage systems however they have not yet been installed. These are typically PV arrays around 5 MW in size coupled to a battery system. Poullikkas believes they will be installed soon as the regulatory framework for such systems is already in place.

There are a small number of pilot energy storage units operating in Cyprus. These include an 84 kWh battery unit manufactured by German company Autarsys and installed by a local partner in the suburbs of the capital city Nicosia.

Popular content

In April MECI published a new $1.6 million subsidy scheme that targets owners of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids encouraging them to install PV and battery systems. The new program allows households that own such vehicles to claim €750 ($796)/kW capped at €1500 per vehicle and a maximum of €2000 for the installation of battery storage. Combined with a recently rolled out €30 million subsidy scheme for the purchase of EVs it is possible Cyprus will experience a wave of distributed battery installations in the coming years. However Andreas Procopiou a local renewable energy expert who carried out research on the active management of electricity networks with high penetration of PV (the UK and Australia) says that Cyprus still needs more regulations and incentives to see growth in behind-the-meter storage installations.

Net metering and net billing schemes are great added Procopiou but those alone are not enough to encourage battery storage. pv magazine has confirmed separately that the regulator has not licensed any storage systems coupled with net metered projects. For batteries to become economically attractive said Procopiou Cyprus needs a number of new electricity regulations such as time-based tariffs and demand response while policies such as tax credits for those installing batteries and solar could also increase the attractiveness of distributed batteries.

Market design

Cyprus’ new electricity market design will play a central role in the evolution of its solar and energy storage markets. The regime is expected to commence before year’s end. The reforms will follow the EU’s so-called target model aiming to boost competition sustainability and energy security through increasing power flows between EU member states.

Given Cyprus does not yet have electricity interconnections with other countries it was allowed to delay its market reforms and until recently the national utility (EAC) enjoyed an absolute monopoly. Increased interconnection is coming however in the form of a project aiming to link Cyprus to Greece Israel and Egypt – a type of regional super-grid. Until the electricity market becomes fully liberalized before the end of the year the current transitional regime allows independent power suppliers to sell electricity to large consumers. To date there are two such suppliers: Evergy and Bioland Promithia.

Evergy COO Fanos Karantonis explained that it currently has 92 large commercial customers which it supplies with exlusively PV power. Karantonis is also managing director of the Karantonis group which either separately or together with Greece’s Mytilineos Group has developed a solar portfolio in Cyprus and sells some electricity to Evergy.

Given this new PPA activity the question is whether the new market design can fundamentally change Cyprus’ energy mix – which is currently based predominantly on gas and diesel. Karantonis said such a change would depend on a number of factors. These include the implementation of energy storage and the upgrade of the electricity network and its connection with neighbouring countries. Karantonis said Cyprus will need to curtail about 10 GWh of renewable electricity in 2022 corresponding to about 2% of its renewable generation.

Procopiou agrees adding that some of the fossil fuel generators that the network operator keeps online to guarantee its stability are according to EU law operating illegally due to dangerous emissions. Consequently Cyprus is paying penalty fees.

Lack of vision

Discussion turns inevitably to electricity prices. Cypriot Energy Minister Natasa Pilides told a local conference in March that solar had been prohibitively expensive until 2015 which had stifled an acceleration of its adoption. “If we [the government] had promoted solar more strongly [before 2015] the cost for the consumer would be greater” added Pilides.

However all data contradicts Pilides’ argument. Specifically Cyprus’ PV tender in January 2013 led to an average tender price of €0.0866/kWh. Today almost a decade later the EAC avoidance cost which reflects the cost of generating power through conventional power stations has climbed up to €0.192/kWh.

This so-called “avoidance cost” has recently been increased reaching unprecedented highs due to the war in Ukraine – particularly given Cyprus’ reliance on natural gas. However even before 2022 “avoidance costs” were mostly higher than the PV tariffs awarded under tender in 2013. The sun-washed island could become 100% powered by renewables saving electricity consumers money but for this to happen cost misconceptions and the vested interests of fossil fuels must be overcome.

There’s a reason the term “daily driver sports car” exists. It’s because typically purpose-built performance cars suffer from an inherent lack of usability: They’re loud uncomfortable and they require pristine driving conditions. What’s more they’re often bereft of the accessories we’ve grown used to and when they’re included they’re usually subpar.

These might sound like small concessions for the chance to drive a top-tier performance vehicle but try spending upward of $200000 on a car that makes you miserable half the time. Thanks to improvements in technology and manufacturing the line between sport and luxury is blurrier than ever.

Making fun cars more accessible is a good thing but they should at least feel different from your daily commuter. Few modern sports cars distinguish themselves like this better than ones from McLaren Automotive so much so that I was slightly worried that its latest vehicle the McLaren GT would lose those particular characteristics as a consequence of making the car more accommodating. While some rough edges have been smoothed out for better or for worse the luxury overhaul has been a bit overstated yet the characteristic McLaren charm remains.

Nuts and bolts

The McLaren GT is a mid-engine rear-wheel drive two-seater that acts as McLaren Automotive’s entry-level model. It’s powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 a variant of the motor found in other models across the lineup fitted with smaller turbochargers. This iteration drops the total power output but delivers power lower in the rev band making peak power more accessible sooner. It generates 612 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque that is routed to the rear wheels by way of a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.

With the help of launch control the McLaren GT can sprint from 0 to 60 in 3.1 seconds and can top out at 203 mph.

As with all McLaren cars the GT is built on a carbon fiber chassis that contributes to its light 3384-pound curb weight. It’s also fitted with electro-hydraulic steering which goes a long way in delivering its distinct driving feel. It all rides on an adaptive damping system and 20-inch front wheels and 21-inch rears.

As a GT this McLaren is meant for extended drives and thus its defining feature is the 14.8 cubic feet of storage space that sits behind the driver and on top of the mid-mounted engine.

It also features an active dynamics panel that allows drivers to customize the car’s behavior a 1200-watt Bowers & Wilkins sound system and the latest iteration of McLaren’s bespoke infotainment system. This is the heart of the McLaren GT’s user interface and sits in a 7-inch touchscreen in the center of the dash. Along with entertainment functions it pairs with mobile devices via Bluetooth gives access to a handful of car settings like ambient lighting and features HERE-powered satellite navigation.

This screen is supported by a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster behind the steering wheel. Some of the above info is pushed to that screen such as turn-by-turn directions though its main function is providing immediate car behavior information. The typical speedometer and tachometer are of course present but there are also tire pressure displays and other status indicators. This screen reconfigures itself depending on drive mode to better position more vital info while in a track or dynamic setting.

The UX

The big mission statement for the McLaren GT is that it’s a better balance between the driving dynamics that McLarens are known for and creature comforts. Every sports car maker tackles this particular dish with its own recipe and for its part McLaren Automotive goes heavy on performance and light on user-friendliness. The McLaren GT is meant to be its most approachable car yet but thankfully the extra dollop of refinement doesn’t overpower the distinct McLaren umami underneath.

Sliding under the dihedral doors and into the GT reveals a very performance-oriented cockpit. Two ergonomic seats are divided by a very small armrest and the sparse cabin is dominated by a leather-and-steel steering wheel flanked by two wheel-mounted paddle shifters. Behind this is the aforementioned 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster that can be accessed by one of the few stalks protruding from the steering column. The 7-inch touchscreen sits above the active dynamics panel and drive select buttons while the Bowers & Wilkins speakers stare at you from the doors like a hawk’s eye.

All of this is the first indication that the McLaren GT isn’t going to stray too far from its sports car roots: This cabin is nearly identical to the one in the 570S. Naturally there are minor differences including additional sound baffling. But one could go from car to car and be hard-pressed to spot them.

The next is the sensation of how purpose-built the car feels. All of the luxurious touches can’t hide the fact that you’re sitting in the carbon fiber monocell of a race-ready vehicle.

The McLaren GT doesn’t do quiet. Once the twin-turbo V8 fires up it’s your soundtrack throughout the drive Bowers & Wilkins be damned. From here on out the McLaren GT demands the driver be laser focused on the act of driving as none of the half-minded lollygagging we’re used to doing in daily traffic will fly. The steering feedback is ample the brakes require a very heavy foot and the haunches of the athletic-looking sports car obscures much of the rearward visibility.

When allowed to gallop the GT is enthusiastic with its acceleration and the sensation between all the systems working to keep the McLaren on course is palpable. Its electro-hydraulic steering communicates the road’s surface conditions fluidly and its heft gives drivers something substantial to embrace. This system combo feels more responsive to the fully electronic power steering that we’re used to it’s meatier and heavier but mechanically so not with just pre-programmed motorized resistance. Same goes for the suspension and active dampers as it’s easy to feel every bit of the McLaren GT doing its job.

How it executes its task is also determined by the active dynamics settings. Two knobs for handling and power each have three settings Normal Sport and Track. Normal is the most docile settings keeping the car’s ride as comfortable as it can be with all of the usual drive assists on and with the engine at its most tame. Sport causes the car’s overall handling to be a touch more aggressive and relaxes some of the stability control and it also heightens the throttle response as well as the transmission’s affinity for lower gears. Track is the McLaren’s most aggressive setting: Handling? Rigid. Traction control? Off. Engine and transmission? Unrestrained.

One of the most wonderful attributes of the McLaren GT and indeed one that it shares with its super sibling the 570S is that there is very little in the way of electronic hand-holding. This lack of a computerized safety net demands a higher application of driver skill and thus it makes crisp maneuvers very rewarding just as it makes slip-ups nerve-wracking. Think of the experience as somewhere between a Lotus Evora and the Audi R8 V10.

Living la vida macca

As exciting as it is to live life on the razor’s edge with the McLaren GT the bits in-between succumb to the usual supercar user-unfriendliness. A series of parking sensors and a backup camera make positioning the precious GT around much easier as is a push-button nose-raising feature which is a huge relief.

This eases some of the usual daily sports car frustrations but the true heart of the GT’s problems lay with the in-car interface.

For as good as the car is mechanically its in-house developed operating system is a particularly glaring weak point. McLaren knows this. Frankly it used to be worse.

The 10-core-processor-powered “Infotainment system II” is faster and more responsive than the units found in previous McLaren vehicles. Familiar swipes and pinch-and-zoom functions make using the touchpad easy though finding the desired menu is another matter. More often than not it will require a passenger-side co-pilot to give it the necessary attention or for the driver to pull off the road to sort things out. This could be something as simple as trying to select a music input source but its most frustrating when it comes to navigation.

Despite the upgrade the built-in system still feels far less intuitive and limited by current standards. Punch in the address and if it finds it there are limited routes to choose from if any alternatives. Deviate from the route and it will stubbornly insist that you find your way back long before it decides to reroute itself. There were also instances of inaccurate road data pushed our way directing us to turn on roads that weren’t there or sometimes not recognizing ones that were.

As the GT is not Apple CarPlay or Android Auto compatible drivers are out of luck when it comes to alternative navigation systems like Google Maps or Waze. Indeed the heavily bezeled touchscreen’s size and orientation mirrors that of a smartphone and there were many times we wished we could simply suction-cup our own phone over it just to find our way back home.

This doesn’t bode well for a car meant for long car journeys nor does the 14.8 cubic feet of storage space function as intended. The extra room that sits atop the engine means whatever is laid across it is subject to a great deal of heat. It’s great for a couple pairs of skis but not so great for cargo such as electronics.

The McLaren GT is a true sports car and none of its down-tuning or soft appointments take away from that. In fact it’s arguable that they don’t go far enough to substantially differentiate this car from others in the lineup or to live up to its Grand Tourer moniker. That’s certainly the case when it comes to its tech.

McLaren could’ve kept everything mechanically identical to its sibling cars and the GT could have set itself apart with a more robust user-friendly road-trip oriented interface easier maps bigger screens to facilitate easier access and 360-degree parking cameras and more modern mobile device compatibility just to name a few features we wished it had. As it stands the $205000 McLaren GT is a true entry-level exotic sports car that sticks to the classics.

It delivers on the full experience but in terms of tech it’s a lateral step.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW10cmFrLWNhYmluLWRpZmZlcmVuY2VzLWJ1c2luZXNzLWZpcnN0LWNsYXNzLXJvb21ldHRlLWJlZHJvb20tcGhvdG9zLTIwMjItN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Differences Between Amtrak Business First Class Roomette Bedroom,"I've spent around 75 hours collectively on four different types of East Coast Amtrak trains in upgraded premium cabins. Of all the rides I've taken I think one offers the best value.

The author sits in four different Amtrak accommodations. Joey Hadden/Insider

I've experienced many Amtrak trains while traveling along the East Coast. I've been on several trains in coach as a kid and more recently traveled in business and first class on Amtrak Acela trains between Baltimore and NYC which was about two and a half hours each way.

Acela is an Amtrak express train on the East Coast with only business and first-class seating. First and business class accommodations offer larger seats than coach and first class comes with perks like in-seat service.

The business-class ticket cost about $120 and the first-class ticket cost about $270.

I've also spent 60 hours on Amtrak trains traveling between Miami and NYC in bedroom and roomette accommodations.

Unlike business and first classes where you get a seat among other passengers a roomette is a private space with a door and blinds to cover up the windows. These are for long-haul train rides that travel through the night.

A step up from a roomette a bedroom accommodation on long-distance Amtrak trains offers even more space as well as a private bathroom.

The roomette cost about $500 and the bedroom cost about $1000.

Here's a closer look at all four upgraded seating types on Amtrak trains plus which I think offers the best value for the higher ticket price than you'll pay in coach.

Following several comments and queries sent by readers I have come to the realization that perhaps due to the length of the present series and complementing that the irregularity of some readers of the columns not surprisingly some of the readers have lost track of the sequence of the treatment on which I am presently proceeding. To recall briefly the topic under consideration now started about six months ago. Further the task I had set myself then was defined “as providing a general formulation or perhaps thesis which offers a coherent determination of the overall dynamic that most fittingly captures the historically unprecedented emergence of Guyana’s world-class oil and gas discoveries.

Since ExxonMobil’s announcement in May 2015 and First Oil later December 2019 it is currently projected that by 2025/26 despite start-up setbacks but backed by discoveries on its present trajectory Guyana’s daily rate of crude oil production DROP will reach around one million barrels of oil equivalent per day [1mlnboe/d].

My pursuit of this self-imposed task was originally scheduled to be accomplished in four discrete components founded on four distinct analytical pillars simply labelled [A-D].

Components A-D

The four pillars of analysis have been previously designated as follows: A] Formulating a general explanation for Guyana’s creaming curve which as I noted have revealed thus far unprecedented rates of petroleum discoveries. B] Articulating the essential nature of ExxonMobil which I project to remain comfortably the lead firm lead contractor and lead operator located principally but not exclusively in the Stabroek Block going forward to2025/26. In effect for the entirety of the period of this analysis.

While Pillars A and B are focused heavily on efforts at theorizing Pillars C and D shift focus principally to policy choices and required actions. Several of these actions I have been repeatedly recommending to the Authorities for adoption in the course of this long ongoing Sunday Stabroek series of columns on Guyana’s emerging oil and gas sector.

Thus C] refers to repeated recommendations made in regard to 1] the National Resource Fund NRF; 2] my proposal to establish a National Oil Company NOC; 3] updated advice on whether to join OPEC or not ;4] local content requirements LCRs; and finally 5] the Buxton Proposal which I have just revisited in the last 12 weeks of last year.

Similarly item D] refers to improved revenue capture governance and public openness in the face of relentless noise and nonsense in the local social and print media

Previously I had used a simple Schedule reproduced at right to illustrate the analytical schema underlining the four pillars as described above. I repeat it here solely for readers’ convenience.

Schedule 1: Analytical Pillars [A-D]

Key: NOC= National Oil Company; OPEC= Oil Producing Exporting Economies; LCRs= Local Content Requirements; BP= Buxton Proposal; NRF= National Resource Fund; *= linking [A+B] & [C+D] analysis.

To recap thus far I have introduced the notion of happenstance as the most fitting explanation for Guyana’s unprecedented world class oil and gas finds. Following that analysis I explored in some detail my judgement that ExxonMobil is what I would classify as a zombie+ corporation. Before addressing Pillars C and D I had posited it would be analytically necessary to link the theorizing columns [Pillars A and B] to the policy choices and actions ones [Pillars C and D]

I have done so by seeking to portray the present condition of Guyana’s oil and gas sector. I did this utilizing a sample of ten key indicators markers or data points that I have introduced over the years to represent the state of Guyana’s oil and gas sector going forward over the next decade and a half

Schedule 1 is shown below:

Item 1 refers to the existential threat created by Venezuela’s territorial claims on Guyana over the next decade and a half as well as a similar time-frame existential threat but this time posed by a catastrophic environmental event happening in Guyana’s offshore petroleum operations. Item 2 refers to the modelled shares of cost of operations projected by the IDB to 1925/6. Item 3 refers to the ruling oil market price over the timeline. Item 4 refers to the boom cycle which the World Bank has projected for Guyana going forward. Item 5 provides a realistic handle on Guyana’s oil resources

Item 6 refers to the key projections on offer by the Government as indicated in its National Budget 2022. Item 7 refers to a defect in the PSA that relates to the acquisition and regulation of exploration licensing. Item 8 refers to the private public distribution of global crude oil production. Item 9 refers to the nature of Guyana’s capitalist system. Finally Item 10 speaks to the petroleum governance framework in Guyana

Conclusion

In the course of the above I had observed that while over the years I had offered numerous markers/specifics and data points the sample which I used was adequate for accurately capturing the state of play in Guyana’s emerging petroleum sector.

I have completed all the above. Starting in the next column I treat with the policy choices and actions listed in Pillars C and D of the schema [see Schedule 1]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFhLmNvbS50ci9lbi9hZnJpY2Evc29tYWxpYXMtcHJlc2lkZW50LXRvLXBheS1vZmZpY2lhbC12aXNpdC10by10dXJraXllLzI2MjkxNTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Somalia's president to pay official visit to Türkiye,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFhLmNvbS50ci9lbi9hZnJpY2Evc29tYWxpYXMtcHJlc2lkZW50LXRvLXBheS1vZmZpY2lhbC12aXNpdC10by10dXJraXllLzI2MjkxNTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGVuaW5zdWxhcWF0YXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMDIvMDcvMjAyMi9ub3J0aHdlc3Rlcm4tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1pbi1xYXRhci1zdHVkZW50cy1lbmdhZ2UtaW4tZ2xvYmFsLW1lZGlhLWludGVybnNoaXBz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northwestern University in Qatar students engage in global media internships,"NU-Q student Komil Vokhidov is working on a production of a TV series documenting Qatar’s footballing history.

The Peninsula

Doha: Northwestern University in Qatar (NU-Q) students are putting their classroom education and media training into practice as they complete summer projects and competitive internships in media organisations around the world like beIN Media Group CNN Arabic Memac Ogilvy and ExxonMobil.

“Our students possess knowledge advanced soft skills and a wide range of interests that stand out in the work they do both in and out of the classroom.

Their involvement with positions in organizations with international relevance reflects the value of their immense talent as well as their contribution to knowledge production in the region” said Marwan M. Kraidy Dean and CEO of Northwestern Qatar.

Antonella Sansalone Komil Vokhidov and Sara Al Mana are among the students working professionally over their summer break.

They are working on a production of a new TV series documenting Qatar’s footballing history with beIN Media Group conducting research and interviews editing documentary and film segments and supporting in post-production and distribution work.

An avid football enthusiast from Italy Sansalone decided to study journalism in Qatar to report from the ground on the first World Cup to be hosted in the region. She says the internship has allowed her “to combine my passion for sports and field of study … and to put the reporting skills I learned in the classroom to show that Qatar and the Middle East actually have a long history of football as opposed to what is being told in the [mainstream] media.”

For third-year journalism major Vokhidov producing historical segments for the project has led him to explore how sports and diplomacy in the region are inextricably linked.

“Being part of this project allowed me to see first-hand how countries are using football not only for media and soft power gains and to create a favorable international image but also as a tool for nation-building” said Vokhidov.

“As a student in Qatar especially at the time when such major nation-building processes are happening you can actually witness it and have an impact on it yourself having this opportunity and level of accessibility is pretty fascinating” he said.

Aspiring public relations practitioner Al Mana wanted to expand her knowledge about elements of her country’s history that she hadn’t previously explored.

“Football is an integral part of Qatar’s development” says Al Mana.

“Before my internship I wasn’t really interested in football but as I got to work on documenting Qatar’s football history my interest in the subject has increased and I now see my work as a contribution to my country’s development” she said.",,,,,,

Among the differences will be a return after 10 years to the calendar-year schedule that will see the first official event of the new season played in January rather than September.

Another is a strengthened alliance with the DP World Tour that will see the top 10 players from the Race to Dubai – not already exempt on the PGA Tour – become PGA Tour members.

Several other changes will occur starting next year with a few details to be worked out along the way.

With the first co-sanctioned regular event between the PGA Tour and DP World Tour this week at the Genesis Scottish Open here is a summary.

Calendar Year Schedule

The 2024 FedEx Cup season will begin at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in January and end at the Tour Championship in late August.

Unlike years past only the top 70 players in the FedEx Cup standings through the regular season will qualify (instead of the top 125) for the first of three FedEx Cup playoff events – which will see the purses at the FedEx St. Jude and the BMW Championship increase to $20 million.

But that doesn’t mean players who finish outside of the top 70 lose their PGA Tour cards. In a return to the days following the start of the FedEx Cup in 2007 the fall events – apparently six – will serve as a place for those outside of the top 70 to continue to compete and try to retain their playing cards.

The exempt list will still be the top 125 players but those six tournaments will provide an opportunity for those outside of the magic number to move in and for those who are comfortable to potentially qualify for other big events by moving into the top 50 in the world rankings or earning a spot at the Tournament of Champions or the Masters.

How The Fall Will Work

There will not be a reset for players who finish outside of the top 70. That means those who are 70th to roughly 95th in the standings are safe to keep their fully exempt status for the following year. They can play as little or as much as they want.

Players below that risk losing their cards and those who are outside of the top 125 can improve their positions. It is unclear if it will simply be a continuation of FedEx Cup points earned to that point but those players will not be able to displace those who finished in the top 70.

And FedEx points earned in the fall will not count toward the following season.

The Global Series

Monahan announced plans for a three-tournament “Global Series’’ that will invite the top 50 in the final FedEx Cup standings to play events in such places as the U.K. Middle East and Asia. The format and locations are to be determined. And so is the field size. It will likely be larger than 60 players but these tournaments will offer $20 million purses with no cut. In theory if players among the top 50 skip the field will be filled going down the FedEx list. Players who do well in the fall as well as those from the countries where the events are held are likely to get invites to fill out the field.

What remains to be seen is: Will these events get World Ranking points? And will a majority of the top names participate? One of the benefits to the calendar season is it allows top players to take time off. Will they want to travel to faraway places?

The Korn Ferry Tour

The developmental tour that allows for players to earn a spot on the PGA Tour will undergo changes that increase the number of automatic PGA Tour cards from 25 to 30 but will eliminate what is now known as the Korn Ferry Tour Finals. That was established when the old Qualifying Tournament format was changed to not allow direct access to the PGA Tour.

As it will play out again this fall those players who finish No. 1 to 75 on the Korn Ferry Tour points list along with those who finish 126th to 200th on the PGA Tour’s points list will convene for a series of tournaments that lead to 50 PGA Tour cards. Those who finished in the top 25 on the KFT are assured of a spot but their priority order can chance based on the results in the KFT finals.

That will change in 2023. Those final events will simply determine the top 30. Then there will be a Qualifying Tournament to determine who gets on the KFT but the top five spots and ties will get PGA Tour cards.

Where their priority is – do they fall directly behind the top 125 and ahead of the KFT qualifiers? – is still to be determined.

The Fallout

Whether these changes were made in response to LIV Golf is a matter of debate. The Tour has been working on different ideas for some time. And much of this is good.

The calendar schedule is welcome and when you consider that you need to be in the top 70 to make the FedEx Cup playoffs and will have potentially nine less tournaments (from the fall) to earn the points the regular season should be more compelling. It puts more meaning on each tournament from January to August. It could lead to some of the top players competing more to make sure they get in the top 70. And it also removes the awkwardness of half the season being complete by the time the Masters is played.

From there they need to be in the top 50 after the FedEx St. Jude to reach the BMW Championship. And then the top 30 for the Tour Championship where the big FedEx payouts take place.

A potential issue could be the disparity between events that are getting big purse boosts and regular PGA Tour events. The Sentry Tournament of Champions goes to $15 million; the Genesis Arnold Palmer WGC-Match Play and Memorial go to $20 million; the Players Championship goes to $25 million. And the first two playoff events will also be $20 million.

If you’re the Honda Classic with maybe a $9 or $10 million purse the situation is not great. It follows Genesis and precedes Arnold Palmer and the Players. The Valspar Championship follows the Players and precedes the Match Play. The Valero Texas Open follows the Match Play and precedes the Masters.

Some of those big-money tournaments are traditionally skipped but it will be harder to do so with those big purses and smaller fields.

It’s just something to consider amid a serious of positive enhancements for the PGA Tour.

What will Phil do next?

The short answer is prepare for the British Open. Mickelson will be making his 28th start at The Open and his sixth at the Old Course at St. Andrews where he first played in 1995. Mickelson has never fared all that well at the home of golf his best finish a tie for 11th in 2000 when Tiger Woods romped to an eight-shot victory. But he’s never missed a cut there either.

“I love the golf course’’ Mickelson said at the LIV Golf event outside of Portland where he finished in a tie for 40th. “When I played there in ’15 (a tie for 20th) I thought the greens were difficult they have a strong blade of grass and you really have to roll it well. When they are like that they really don’t break a ton and you can make a lot of putts.

Phil Mickelson will make his 28th British Open start in two weeks. Soobum Im/USA Today

“I putted terrible and for me it comes down to a having a good putting week because the golf course sets up really well. If I miss it left left is fine all day for me on that golf course and so I can play my miss and get around just fine.

“And there’s something spiritual about playing there. I really enjoy it. I’m really looking forward to getting back there.’’

Mickelson 52 could use some divine intervention for his game at this point. Since his self-imposed four-month break the six-time major winner has played eight rounds of golf and broke par just once – in his very first round at the LIV Golf tournament outside of London. He missed the cut at the U.S. Open and was out of sorts at the Portland LIV event where he shot scores of 75-75-76 to finish 10 over par and 23 shots back of winner Branden Grace.

“My game feels a lot better than I’m scoring’’ he said. “A lot of good shots and then I’m making a lot of mistakes that are costing me five six shots a round. I’m not discouraged. I actually putted terrible in London and at the U.S. Open. I’ve putted well (at the Portand event). It just doesn’t feel that far off. I actually feel pretty good. But I’m not scoring yet.’’

Mickelson who won The Open nine years ago at Muirfield said he will head to the Old Course to keep working. “I’m going to go early and spend a little more time there’’ he said.

Fore! Things

1. J.T. Poston’s wire-to-wire win at the John Deere Classic was the first such victory on the PGA Tour since Joaquin Niemann did so at the Genesis Invitational in February.

2. Organizers of the JP McManus pro-am in Ireland did Tiger Woods a favor giving him afternoon tee times for both Monday and Tuesday. He begins play at 9:05 a.m. ET on Monday which is 2:05 p.m. in Ireland. The pro-am has attracted an all-star cast of players that includes Jordan Spieth Rory McIlroy Rickie Fowler Scottie Scheffler Matt Fitzpatrick Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and many others. The players are not paid for their appearance with all proceeds going to charity.

3. Jediah Morgan finished last at the LIV Golf Portland event shooting scores of 76-84-77 to trail the 47th-place finisher Shaun Norris by four strokes. It was a tough week for Morgan a 22-year-old Australian who earlier this year won the Fortinet Australian PGA Championship by 11 strokes. He tied for 30th in the first LIV Golf event outside of London then missed the cut at the U.S. Open. For his efforts Morgan received $154000 for the first event and $120000 for the second.

4. LIV Golf has made charitable contributions at each of its first two events directing more than $1 million to local charities at both the London and Portland tournaments. It did not make a big deal out of donations simply sending out a press release. Perhaps it could make a point to donate to women’s causes including women’s golf initiatives and getting behind an initiative that makes a difference.

Ryder Cup Fallout

While there remains some doubt on the European team side as to whether those competing in LIV Golf events will be eligible for the Ryder Cup – players such as Lee Westwood Martin Kaymer and Sergio Garcia last week made it seem clear they believed nothing should change – the American side seems to offer little debate.

And that’s from U.S. captain Zach Johnson.

“So what I know is this: in order to play on the Ryder Cup team whether you’re top six (automatic qualifiers) or a (captain’s) pick you must garner Ryder Cup points through the PGA of America’’ Johnson said at the John Deere Classic. “In order to garner Ryder Cup points through the PGA of America you have to be a member of the PGA of America.

“The way that we’re members of the PGA of America is through the PGA Tour. I’ll let you connect the dots from there.’’

That suggests that players such as Dustin Johnson Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau – who all starred for the U.S. team last fall at Whistling Straits – won’t be part of the Ryder Cup in Rome. Phil Mickelson’s slam-dunk future captaincy is also now in doubt.

LIV Golf officials have pushed back on this narrative. A look at the PGA of America bylaws shows that membership in the organization can be obtained in many ways including being members of other tours. Of course the PGA of America can change its rules. And since a player has to earn points via the PGA Tour to make the team automatically this only comes into play for captain’s picks. And a captain if so motivated can simply not pick any of these players.

Johnson 46 has played on five U.S. Ryder Cup teams been an assistant at the 2018 Ryder Cup the 2019 Presidents Cup and again at the 2021 Ryder Cup. He’s won two major championships including the last Open to be played at St Andrews in 2015.

“I’ve got some friends that have decided to go that route"" Johnson said. ""A lot of individuals that I'm for. I mean these are my friends. I'm for them. I want them to do well. I want them to you know find contentment or happiness in whatever it may be. It's not for me to say how that develops or how they find that. I will say I have the utmost respect for them individually.

“I would hope and I'm not concerned about this that they would have the respect for me and who I stand for and what I stand for. And I don't think it's very secretive or outlandish in saying that I'm for the PGA Tour. I'm for the individuals that paved the way for me in this great Tour this platform in order to entertain compete and I would say utilize for the betterment of others not just my family. I'm for that.’’

Meanwhile European captain Henrik Stenson continues to be linked to LIV Golf. He has not played the first two events nor has his name officially been added to the list of players who will compete at Bedminster in three weeks. If he does make the leap then what?

Money Matters

A story circulated since the first week of the LIV Golf Invitational Series in London: players with guaranteed contracts were not being withheld purse money as it was played off against their advances. So in other words it was portrayed as a player would not receive prize money until it totaled more than what he was being guaranteed for the year.

Not true.

Charl Schwartzel who won the first event and was on the winning team earned $4.75 million. He went to Twitter to refute claims that he was not paid that sum. Other players and an agent confirmed the same thing to SI.com.

At a news conference last week at the Portland event a LIV Golf interview moderator to took time out to also refute the claim saying that all prize money is separate from any guaranteed contracts.

The Open Countdown

The Open begins in 10 days at the Old Course in St Andrews Scotland. It will be the 150th playing of the championship that dates to 1860 and years of planning has gone into celebrating the occasion which was supposed to occur last year but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Old Course will stage The Open for the 30th time more than any other venue the first being in 1873 when Tom Kidd won the tournament as it was played for the first time on an 18-hole course.

The last staging of The Open at the Old Course was in 2015 when Zach Johnson won in a playoff over Louis Oosthuizen and Marc Leishman.

Six players earned their way into the field last week as the highest-ranked in the world not already exempt: Aaron Wise (USA) Brian Harman (USA) Sebastian Munoz (Colombia) Sepp Straka (Austria) Luke List (USA) and Si Woo Kim (South Korea) made it through that avenue.

Six more players qualified via finishing among the top three players not already in the top 10 at the Irish Open and the John Deere Classic. At the Irish Open it was John Catlin Fabrizio Zanotti and Davis Law. All three tied for fourth to earn their spots. At the John Deere Classic winner J.T. Poston Christiaan Bezuidenhout and Emiliano Grillo (who were tied for second) also earned a trip to St. Andrews via the Open Qualifying Series.

Another 16 made the field via four Final Qualifying Sites in the United Kingdom.

This week’s Scottish Genesis Open – a co-sanctioned PGA Tour/DP World Tour event – will offer three spots to the top three finishers in the top 10 not already exempt. And the Barbasol Championship – also co-sanctioned – will offer the final spot for a player finishing in the top 10 not already exempt.

The Genesis Scottish Open has for years been the event played the week prior to the British Open typically attracting a strong field of participants. The event will have its best-ever field as it is now co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour. That means players on the PGA Tour can earn FedEx Cup points and have another event count toward their membership requirements. It is especially helpful for those who compete on both Tours.

The result has been a boon to the field as 14 of the top-ranked 15 players in the world will take part led by No. 1 and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler. DP World Tour CEO Keith Pelley said “it will be the strongest regular tour event in our history.’’

The tournament is being played at the Renaissance Club which is next door to Muirfield in Gullane Scotland. Although the Renaissance is not a links along the lines of many Open venues it is still an excellent primer for the kind of feel and shots to be played a week later at St. Andrews.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTA5NzQ3NjMvTllQRC1jb3BzLXBvc2UtQW1hem9uLUZlZEV4LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXN0YWZmLWNhdGNoLWNyaW1pbmFscy1zdWJ3YXktc3lzdGVtLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDk3NDc2My9hbXAvTllQRC1jb3BzLXBvc2UtQW1hem9uLUZlZEV4LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXN0YWZmLWNhdGNoLWNyaW1pbmFscy1zdWJ3YXktc3lzdGVtLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NYPD cops pose as Amazon and FedEx delivery staff to catch criminals on subway system,"At least three NYPD officers were pictured posing as Amazon and FedEx delivery drivers at a subway station on Wednesday while hunting for perverts.

According to the Instagram user who posted the original photos the officers were trying to catch people jumping over turnstiles to avoid paying for their train ride.

The NYPD later confirmed they were plain-clothes cops and said they were also on the lookout for perverts who prowl trains and grope unsuspecting passengers.

Another social media user identified the station as the Myrtle-Broadway station in Brooklyn.

In a statement to DailyMail.com an NYPD spokesperson seemed to confirm the authenticity of the pictures saying: 'Transit Officers conduct plainclothes patrols due to the unique environment and challenges presented in the New York City Transit system.'

To counter rising crime on New York's subways Mayor Eric Adams announced in January that 1000 officers would be deployed in the system

The spokesperson said that the undercover officers concentrate on catching 'pick pockets' and 'sexual offenders.'

The statement concluded: 'The NYPD continues to conduct enhanced patrol deployments in the subway system and remains highly focused on the relatively small number of people responsible for much of New York City’s crime and disorder.'

New York City Mayor Eric Adams pledged to crackdown on crime in the Big Apple mentioning subway fare beating specifically.

Mayor Adams has also reinstated the controversial Neighborhood Safety Teams small teams of plain clothes officers. The unit was disbanded in 2020 in the wake of nationwide protests against police brutality.

In January Adams announced that 1000 more officers would be deployed in what is the nation's largest subway system.

The City & State New York published data showing that the majority of the group's arrests were for crimes such as fake IDs and stolen credit cards rather than gun possession arrests.

Following the well publicized arrest of 'Dancing is Happiness' musician John Ajilo on June 22 at the 34th street station at the foot of the Empire State Building Mayor Adams was quoted as saying: 'Listen you've got to follow the rules. That is how are system got in the way that it is now because no one was following the rules.'

Rape and robberies are up over 50% compared against the same time this year according to the Metropolitan Transit Authority's statistics

DailyMail.com has reached out to both FedEx and Amazon for comment on the photos.

Violent crime has become endemic on New York City's transport system in 2022.

Rape and robberies are up over 50% compared against the same time this year according to the Metropolitan Transit Authority's statistics. Meanwhile felony assaults are up over 15% and grand larceny is up over 97%.

NYPD Transit Chief Jason Wilcox told the MTA board this past Monday that the increase in larcenies were mainly on overnight trains. Wilcox said that there have been many cases where riders fall asleep on the train and wake up with items missing reports the New York Post.

Wilcox added: 'We are focusing on this type of crime. Our detectives are investigating these crimes. But we also ask riders to be more vigilant in this area when they travel the trains late at night.'

In total compared to this time last year transit crime citations are up 40%.

According to statistics from the MTA there were four assaults and 82 cases of harassment New York City's transport employees in June alone.

In 2022 there have been 35 assaults on subway trains and at stations on city employees.

While crime is up subway ridership is also up nearly 35% on this time last year.

In June it was announced that the NYPD was installing 100 hidden cameras on subway cars across the city.

The cameras are not monitored and do not transmit in real time but will be used as a back-up to help investigators establish evidence.

The selected trains are those where 53% of subway crimes occurred.

Tristan Trager scored two goals to record his second-consecutive brace replicating his tally from Wednesday’s game against Charleston Battery.

El Paso opened the scoring in the 4th minute. A Locomotive FC corner fell to Eder Borelli who touched the ball into open space and prevented the opportunity from being cleared by the Atlanta defense. Ricardo Zacarias found Luis Solignac with a first-time cross and the striker took a quick touch before slotting in his team-leading seventh goal of the season.

Trager netted the equalizer for Atlanta in the 11th minute. Raimar intercepted a pass in the offensive third as El Paso failed to play out of its half. The Brazilian found Robbie Mertz on the left edge of the penalty area and the Atlanta captain beat two defenders on the dribble before lofting a weighted ball to the back post. Trager was there to meet it heading it past goalkeeper Evan Newton.

The duo of Mertz and Trager combined again to take a 2-1 advantage for the hosts. Mertz picked up possession on the halfway line before putting Trager through on goal with a pass. The Air Force Academy alumnus ran into the El Paso box composed himself and found the back of the net with his left foot for his fifth goal in a week.

The Atlanta defense held strong until second-half stoppage time as Eric Calvillo converted a free kick to steal a point late on.

ATL UTD 2 (4-12-2 14 points) finishes out its two-match homestand against Birmingham Legion on Wednesday July 6 (7:30 p.m. ESPN+).

Instead the company placed all its bets on hydrogen which hasn’t proved particularly fruitful.

But despite being very later to the party Toyota has finally revealed its first dedicated production-electric car. Meet the bZ4X which packs in solar panels water-battery cooling a 252-mile range and more.

We recently took the Toyota bZ4X for a test drive to see just how good is Toyota's first EV?

Toyota bZ4X price and availability

Toyota has revealed that the bZ4X's price will start at $42000 which gets you a front-wheel drive ""XLE"" version of the car when it goes on sale sometime in Spring 2022.

A ""Limited"" variant of the FWD model will cost $46700 complete with larger wheels and a unique design. If you want an AWD model you'll need to pay $44080 while a Limited variant of that car costs $48780.

The Limited models differ in that they have larger wheels unique color schemes and a number of special design choices like multi-LED headlights chrome accents and a lower grille.

Toyota has been quick to note that stock is ""extremely limited"" (emphasis Toyota's) due to supply chain issues affecting the production of new cars.

Toyota bZ4X battery cooling technology

The bZ4X comes with a 71.4 kWh battery and the water-cooling tech is there to try and make it last for as long as possible. Heat is the enemy of batteries and prolonged exposure to high temperatures can speed up degradation and reduce your capacity over time.

Unfortunately heat is one of the by-products of faster charging which is pretty essential if you’re planning on driving beyond your car’s typical range.

Other automakers have come up with ways to keep the battery cool during the charging process. Companies like Renault blow cool air over the batter while the ever-popular Tesla uses a custom coolant to keep temperatures steady.

Toyota has opted for old-fashioned water and claims this means degradation will be as little as 10% after ten years (or 150000 miles) of driving.

All four cars are equipped with a standard CCS charging socket which offers up to 6.6 kW speeds at a Level 2 AC charger. According to Toyota that will recharge the car from ""low to full"" in around nine hours.

The FWD models can both handle up to 150kW DC rapid charging which Toyota claims will restore 80% of its power in 30 minutes. The AWD models can somewhat disappointingly only handle 100KW speeds.

Drivers will also be able to get solar panels built into the roof which will be able to offer some additional power to the battery. How much will likely depend on where you live but if other solar-powered cars are anything to go by it likely won’t be more than a few miles per hour at best.

Unfortunately Toyota hasn’t revealed any details on the panels including how much they might cost.

Toyota has confirmed that the range for the front-wheel drive model will be 252 miles per the EPA standard. The Limited model has a slightly lower 242 miles thanks to its larger 20-inch wheels.

The AWD model offers less still because that second motor needs power meaning you'll get up to 228 miles out of the car. The Limited AWD offers 222 miles of range per charge once again thanks to the larger wheels.

Toyota will sell the car in front and all wheel drive variants. Front wheel drive models pack in a 150kW motor that can offer 201 hp a top speed of 100mph and a 0-60 time of 8.4 seconds. Meanwhile the all-wheel drive models offer dual 80kW motors boosting that power to 214.5bhp and reducing the 0-60 time to 7.7 seconds.

Today bZ4X interior and yoke steering wheel

Inside the car is a 7-inch gauge cluster behind the wheel plus a larger infotainment screen in the middle of the dashboard. Fortunately Toyota hasn’t fallen into the trap of putting everything behind the touchscreen so there are physical buttons for key in-car features like climate control. Apple CarPlay is also supported and we hope that means Android Auto will also be available.

Originally the car was supposed to come with the option of a Tesla-style yoke steering wheel as well as a conventional round wheel you'll be used to. However there's no sign of that option on the Toyota website and all recent images feature the normal round steering wheel - which we are quite happy about.

Toyota bZ4X outlook

(Image credit: Toyota)

While there are still a few unknowns this paints a pretty clear picture of what Toyota has planned for the car. Honestly? It’s not too bad. Considering various Toyota executives have criticized EVs it’s a huge surprise that it has an EV at all — let alone one this impressive.

Pricing-wise Toyota is keeping the bX4X relatively affordable with the starting prices all well under the $50000 mark. With other automakers increasing prices that's going to be crucial in helping Toyota compete with companies that have been in this business for years.

But supply chain issues have affected the availability of the car even before it's gone on sale. That's something Toyota is going to need to try and address going forward lest people go to automakers that can fulfil orders much faster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLW5vdHRpbmdoYW1zaGlyZS02MTYzMzkwN9IBQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLW5vdHRpbmdoYW1zaGlyZS02MTYzMzkwNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nottingham students build solar car for Australia challenge,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIyL2p1bC8wMy91ay1pbnRlcmVzdC1pbi1zb2xhci1wb3dlci1lbmVyZ3ktYmlsbHMtc29hci1ib29t0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50LzIwMjIvanVsLzAzL3VrLWludGVyZXN0LWluLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWVuZXJneS1iaWxscy1zb2FyLWJvb20?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘It’s hot’: UK interest in solar power heats up as energy bills soar,"“It’s hot” says Steve Springett a director of the renewable energy brand Egg cheerily assessing the solar market. “There’s two key factors: people are understanding the environmental benefits of it better and energy is really really expensive at the moment.”

Consumer interest has increased in recent months as Britons hunt for ways to cut huge energy bills. A reduction in VAT on energy efficient systems from 5% to nothing this spring has added to the appeal of solar power.

The number of eBay searches for solar panels and solar power batteries increased by 54% and 134% respectively in June compared with same period last year. Consumers are also increasingly hunting for smart meters as they try to keep a handle on their energy use.

Murray Lambell the general manager of eBay UK says: “As the cost of living crisis hits shoppers are seeking out savvy investments to keep energy costs low wherever they can. Many are choosing green energy options as a solution that’s good for their wallet and the planet and we’ve seen a significant surge in demand for products like solar panels and batteries as a result.”

The boom is the latest in an industry so known for its unpredictable fortunes that it has been called the “solar coaster”. The name emerged from peaks and troughs created by the government’s “feed-in tariffs” through which householders received payments for the electricity generated by eligible systems to incentivise their uptake.

A rush of installations took place on the eve of each deadline before payments would become less generous followed by a fallow period. The closure of the scheme to new applicants in March 2019 drained some of the buoyancy from the market. Industry watchers say the market had become more stable since the scheme ended – until this year.

Data from the consumer credit reporting company Experian shows that about 1.9 million households intend to install solar panels or other renewable capabilities this year.

Springett says the huge increase in energy bills could reduce the time it takes to recoup the cost of an installed system coming down from “double-digit years” to more like seven depending on size and location of the property. Warranties usually last for 25 years and the panels – also known as photovoltaic cells – can last for up to 40 years. Costs typically vary between £5000 and £15000 for a family home and applications to connect to the grid can take about three months.

“There’s a definite crossover between people who are getting solar panels and electric cars and heat pumps. They want the whole package” Springett says.

The clamour for panels is now so great that one senior industry executive says his company ran out of labour and materials to take new orders. “I tried to pass on inquiries to competitors to help out the customers only to find out they didn’t have the capacity to help them either. A lot of the installers went back to their professions like electricians when the feed-in scheme ended and it’s hard to get them back” he says.

The solar panel industry is noticeably fragmented in the UK with few nationwide players. Ikea sold solar panels and batteries in the UK for two years before stopping in 2019 although it still sells them in Europe. Britain’s Solarcentury which was founded by the oil geologist Jeremy Leggett was bought by the Norwegian renewables specialist Statkraft in late 2020.

UK institutional investors have shown more interest in the industry of late. Shares in NextEnergy Solar Fund – which invests in large projects in the UK and Italy – have risen by 7% this year valuing the London-listed investment company at £640m. In the US John Burger the founder and chief executive of Sunnova recently said his company which is one of the country’s biggest residential solar firms had had its best ever day of sales. However tightening regulations tough markets and concerns over rising interest rates have pummelled the stocks of industry giants including First Solar and Sunrun.

For businesses rising electricity bills – along with labour costs – have made solar panels an attractive investment.

Amazon has announced plans to roll out solar panels across all of its UK sites and will have more than 30000 new modular solar panels installed on its facilities in Manchester Coalville Haydock Green Wakefield Bristol and Milton Keynes by the end of the year.

The increase in consumer interest in installing solar panels has highlighted difficulties in sourcing them. A squeeze on global shipping capacity and freight rates triggered by the pandemic has led to a shortage of inverters devices that convert the direct current created by the panels to alternating current used to power the home. The panels themselves are typically made in Asia with a central hub in China.

During a parliamentary debate last week the Conservative MP Nus Ghani noted that much of the production took place in Xinjiang where China has been accused of potentially committing genocide against the Uyghur population. Xinjiang officially an autonomous region of China accounts for about 45% of the world’s supply of polysilicon the key component of solar panels.

Asked about the sourcing of solar panels from China the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: “What’s happened over the last 20 years is that the Chinese have had a very strategic game they could see which way the global economy was going and they essentially monopolised and gathered extensive capacity in their own hands and we’re in a world now where we’re trying to get away from overdependence.”

Kwarteng has targeted a tripling in solar power by 2030 increasing capacity from 15 gigawatts now to 50GW. With further jumps in energy bills expected in October and again next year consumer frenzy to pile in this summer could well set Britain on its way towards hitting that target.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2d2luZC5lcy8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL2Zhc3Rlci1wcm9ncmVzcy1vbi1yZW5ld2FibGVzLWluLWl0YWx5Lzg2ODA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Faster progress on renewables in Italy?,"With its long coastline high mountains and sunny Mediterranean islands Italy should be well placed to increase its production of renewable energy. The challenge is to link power production with consumption over long distances and complex topography.

Italy is the fourth-largest energy consumer in Europe after Germany France and the United Kingdom. Its per capita consumption however is about 20 per cent lower than the EU average.

Italy’s varied topography is both a blessing and a challenge says Statkraft’s country manager Bernardo Ricci Armani:

“Italy is a sunny country and solar energy is an important part of our energy mix. Both sun and wind are most abundant in the southern part of the country including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. In the north the landscape is dominated by a series of wide plains. It’s also where the largest cities and most of the country’s industry are located.”

Most of its renewable power production thus takes place in the south while energy consumption is greatest in the north.

The Apennines mountain range stretches around the plains in the north and down to the southern part of the country.

“To build a bridge over the divide between north and south battery storage will be crucial to ensure a stable power grid” says Ricci Armani.

In 2021 thermal energy sources still accounted for most of Italy’s power consumption mainly natural gas but also some coal and biomass. Renewable energy sources account for around 36 per cent of consumption. Hydropower is the largest renewable source at 38 per cent followed by solar power at 23 per cent and wind power at 13 per cent.

“Coal power is being phased out. The authorities have set a goal that all the country’s coal power plants will close by 2025” says Ricci Armani.

Italy is estimated to be the world’s second-largest net importer of electric power with imports coming mainly from Switzerland and France.

In 2019 an undersea power cable was also put into operation between Italy and Montenegro. The cable connection stretches 445 kilometres across the Adriatic Sea and is the first “electric bridge” between the EU and the Balkans.

Italy wants to develop both solar and wind power but local opposition to landscape changes and other considerations means that the development of new renewable power can be slow. (Photo: Shutterstock)

Local opposition

Italy has high ambitions to increase its power production from renewable sources.

In 2021 the Ministry of Ecological Transition (Ministero della Transizione Ecologica – MiTE) was established as part of the Italian government. To achieve the goal of the EU’s green growth strategy (European Green Deal) for a carbon-neutral Europe by 2050 MiTE has strengthened its goals for Italy for 2030:

Greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by 51 per cent compared with the 1990 level up from the previous target of 37 per cent.

The share of power consumption from renewable energy sources will be increased from 30 to 37 per cent.

However the process of obtaining authorisation to build new renewable power plants can be both complex and tedious in Italy not least due to local opposition.

“Larger projects such as solar and wind power plants that will affect the landscape must be approved by environmental protection authorities. Power plants can also sometimes be planned near a church or a site of archaeological value. In many places local politicians use such arguments for populist purposes to block projects” says Ricci Armani.

The coalition government formed by Prime Minister Mario Draghi in February 2021 seeks to address these challenges by allowing central authorities to exercise greater power.

“I anticipate more problems when central authorities in Rome make more decisions affecting the regions. This is currently one of the fiercest debates in Italy” he says.

Italy is a bureaucratic country and previously the authorisation process for a wind farm for example could take between five and seven years.

“MiTe has a clear intention to shorten the processing time but so far this ambition has produced few results” says Ricci Armani.

Solar panels can also be useful in the Italian Alps. But the greatest potential for solar power is in the sunnier parts of the country in the south. (Photo: Shutterstock)

Increased use of electricity

Reduced access to Russian gas due to the war in Ukraine has highlighted Italy’s dependence on power imports.

“We can no longer rely on obtaining gas from Russia and I believe that the only solution in the long run is to develop more renewable energy” says Ricci Armani.

Italy is the only G8 country without nuclear power after the last two nuclear reactors were shut down in 1990 as a result of a referendum. A new poll in 2011 confirmed that an overwhelming majority of Italy’s population is against nuclear power.

“Some politicians have argued that Italy should reconsider investing in nuclear power but since Italians have clearly expressed their opposition to this in two referendums I think investment in new nuclear power plants is rather unlikely” he says.

The corona pandemic demonstrated the need to accelerate the green shift in Italy. High gas prices mean that more people want increased investment in renewable energy.

“In addition to solar and wind power the investment in hydrogen must grow in a more sustainable way. We must also work to change our habits for example by switching to using electricity instead of gas in households. Where I live in Milan we now use electricity for heating. More and more charging stations for electric cars are also being built in the big cities” he says.

Rapid growth

Statkraft opened its own office in Milan in 2020.

“The corona pandemic gave us a modest start but since October 2020 Statkraft has grown rapidly in Italy and we are approaching 30 employees across the country. We work on projects within solar and wind power and battery storage and we are active in power purchase agreements (PPA) and other market activities” says Ricci Armani.

As a company with long hydropower experience Statkraft is also interested in this energy technology in Italy.

“Some of the hydropower licences issued to private companies have expired and the European Commission has called on Italy to renew them to strengthen competition. It’s a discussion that has been going on for many years. The hydropower potential in Italy has been fully utilised so it’s not a question of building new facilities but possibly increasing the capacity of existing power plants. This could potentially be an important part of our activity in Italy” he says.

Combination between agriculture and energy

In any case the largest growth in renewable energy sources up to 2030 is expected to come from sun and wind. Competition between companies is fierce which has led to a sharp increase in land prices.

“Several local communities are concerned that the power plants are establishing themselves in agricultural areas where many farmers prefer to sell the land to power companies at a good price rather than grow fruit and vegetables. Agrivoltaics the simultaneous use of land for solar cells and agriculture can be a good compromise in this context” says Ricci Armani.

Statkraft has launched a project with an Italian university to find out which agricultural products are best suited to be grown in parallel with the production of solar power.

“We hope to come up with solutions that can create good synergy effects between agricultural and power production” he says.

High standards

Bernardo Ricci Armani sees two main challenges for Statkraft’s business in Italy:

Statkraft maintains a high quality level in its projects while contractors in some cases do not meet the same standard.

Statkraft does not compromise on compliance with the company’s values.

“Some contractors are sceptical about entering a partnership with us because they don’t know whether their subcontractors will be able to meet Statkraft’s requirements. Nevertheless I see Statkraft’s high standards and Norwegian culture as a competitive advantage” he explains.

Statkraft expends a lot of effort on communication in Italy not least with the Italian authorities.

“We inform them of who we are and how we work often in collaboration with the Norwegian Embassy and Innovation Norway. We are here to invest and Italy is a country with great opportunities” he says.

So dear readers Do you like the Ford Thunderbird?

Vote and give us your take in the comments section. Like my high school history teacher always told me “There are no wrong answers.”

My Take? No. I’m not a fan after owning a 1994 T-Bird with electrical surging issues that the dealership couldn’t fix. In its defense it had comfortable seats and a cigarette lighter. I’m a former Winston Lights chain smoker and a working lighter was a selling point.

The sawmill building dates back to 1936 when it was opened as part of Henry Ford’s planned community in Alberta. While other Ford mills in Baraga County — in L’Anse and Pequaming — produced more lumber the mill was intended to give the public a close-up view of Ford operations.

It remained in operation through 1954. Ford Motor Company funded renovations to turn the site into a museum Michigan Tech’s website said.

It remained open to the public from 1996 until being closed to the public about five years ago. Tech’s website identified several safety concerns including electrical systems walkways and lighting.

“We have to think about the safety of people that are visiting and so it’s been a few years since it’s been open to the public” said Andrew Storer Dean of Tech’s College of Forest Resources and Environmental Science.

Tech uses Alberta as a teaching and research facility for forestry wildlife and applied ecology students. Storer said Tech is involved in long-range planning for Alberta which he called critical for Tech’s education and research programs. Recent upgrades have included a new roof on the dorm building and upgrades to its water infrastructure.

“Now we’re thinking about ‘Okay what’s the long-term for the sawmill?’ and as we teach our students we’re considering all options” Storer said. “And the good thing is that we would like to keep the sawmill and there are people in the community who would like to see the sawmill remain and so we’re now starting to work with them.”

After a L’Anse Sentinel article in May in which the Tech’s Ford Forestry Center director discussed tentative plans to tear down the property next year Baraga County residents began talking to the university and local governments to find a way to ensure the landmark building could stay. After hearing public comment from several people the Baraga County Board approved sending a letter to Storer to support restoring the building at its June meeting.

Wayne Abba one of the residents involved was also introduced to Glenn Tolksdorf and Jim Dougovito both Tech forestry graduates and in Dougovito’s case the former director of the Ford Center.

“They had the same reaction we all did” Abba said.

Tolksdorf helped get in touch with Michigan Tech which sent a representative to the citizens’ first meeting last month Abba said.

“He opened the meeting by assuring us there was no official plan to tear down the sawmill” he said. “There’s no us vs. them. This isn’t like the fights that we’re having over things like wind turbines and seaplanes. Dean Storer has been really good in working with us and he invited us to share any interests or ideas that we might have.”

Abba said the interest group includes representatives from numerous groups throughout Baraga County including the Baraga County Chamber of Commerce Convention & Visitors Bureau Model A Club and the privately owned sawmill at Big Bay another Ford legacy project.

“We have a lot of people who say that’s such a natural tourism gateway at Baraga County” he said. “Baraga County without the sawmill is like Houghton and Hancock without the Quincy Mine Hoist. It’s kind of iconic.”

Storer said Tech will also meet with the group at the Ford Center this month to discuss the sawmill and the investment that would be needed to ensure it remains.

Work would likely be multi-stage Storer said — first shoring up the exterior then seeing if the interior could be restored.

“It remains to be seen whether or not they’d be sufficient resources to actually be able to open up the building to people just because of safety compliance and those types of things” he said. “We’re looking forward to working with the community on that plan and working with them to look for resources to do it.”

Storer said the university had not estimated the total cost of restoration but would first get an estimate for the initial phase of work.

At the June Baraga County meeting residents suggested possibly moving the building to another site if Tech was not interested in keeping it. Storer said the university did not want to sell or relocate the building.

“I don’t think there’s going to be a situation where we would sell a building” he said. “I could see us just working with a group and having them participate in the management of it.”

Group members have come up with several ideas including making the sawmill a commercial tourist center for Baraga County and the Western Upper Peninsula. It could also be used as an informational center for Tech to aid in recruitment Abba said.

Longer-term the group hopes to find some way to reopen the sawmill as a museum. That could be something as simple as something where people walk in and look at items behind Plexiglass Abba said. It could also include something where people walk through and look at exhibits incorporating audiovisual elements.

“It’s our hope that because there’s been such a quick meeting of the minds on this that we will work this into Tech’s administration process” Abba said. “They already run a museum at the Seaman Mineral Museum and they have people on staff that are familiar with grant writing. We are hoping to lend our support to anything they might be able to do after this meeting.”

Endowments would be the best way to secure the financing necessary to make long-term improvements to the sawmill Abba said. Group members have talked about reaching out to members of the Ford family about a donation.

The museum could also be expanded beyond the sawmill to talk about other parts of the Ford legacy Abba said. For an anniversary celebration the Fords had signed a lease with a Baraga County resident who owns the Model A to temporarily display it.

“There’s a tremendous amount of history with some of these old cars and these people would like to have a chance to display them” he said.

Another idea is attempting to have the site recognized as a historical landmark.

“That of course opens the doors to other kinds of grants and recognition as well” Abba said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2ZvcmQtc2ltdWxhdG9yLWhlbHBzLXZlaGljbGVzLWdldC1tYXJrZXQtcXVpY2tlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford simulator helps vehicles get to market quicker,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autonews.com/technology/ford-simulator-helps-vehicles-get-market-quicker on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2ZvcmQtc2ltdWxhdG9yLWhlbHBzLXZlaGljbGVzLWdldC1tYXJrZXQtcXVpY2tlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RyYXZlbC8yMDIyLzA3LzAzL2Nhci1tdXNldW1zLWF1YnVybi1pbmRpYW5hLWRpc3BsYXktY2xhc3NpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy1jb3JkLWR1ZXNlbmJlcmctZm9yZC83NzUxMjA2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Car museums in Auburn Indiana display classic vehicles,"Steve Stephens

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

AUBURN Ind. — Detroit wasn’t always the only “Motor City.” In the first half of the 20th century hundreds of automobile marques were produced in dozens of cities and towns across America’s industrial heartland.

Although Auburn Indiana no longer produces automobiles the town’s automotive history is you might say a real Duesy. And the town still celebrates — in a big way — its heritage as one of the top producers of luxury motor vehicles in the 1920s and 1930s.

Just a three-hour drive from Columbus in northeast Indiana Auburn today is home to three world-class automotive museums.

Travel:Fort Wayne Indiana a weekend destination with vibrant downtown

You don’t need to be an enthusiast of antique automobiles to be completely dazzled by the collections on display in Auburn. And the buildings in which the museums are housed are nearly as fascinating as the vehicles they contain.

Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum

The Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum (www.automobilemuseum.org) is dedicated as the name would suggest to the Auburn Cord and Duesenberg models produced in Auburn by the Auburn Automobile Company.

The museum is located in the original automotive showroom within what was the company’s world headquarters.

The headquarters was completed in 1930 in the art deco-style a style that also informed the design of the streamlined motorized beauties the company sold to discerning auto buyers.

The building itself a National Historic Landmark has been restored to its deco luster and would be worth visiting even without the dozens of classic automobiles — some one of a kind — that are on display on the showroom floor just as they would have been when the building was new.

In addition to the showroom museum visitors will find a variety of other displays on the three levels of the headquarters building including the office of company president E.L. Cord.

Cord an automotive visionary took control of Auburn Automobile in 1926 and purchased Duesenberg a year later. During Cord’s tenure Auburn produced some of the most iconic automobiles of the 1920s and 1930s.

Day-trip destination:History — and lots of whiskey — on tap in western Pennsylvania

Other displays include the Early Auburns Gallery featuring cars built by the company from 1903 until Cord’s ascension; and a display of other early cars built in other Indiana factories.

National Auto & Truck Museum

The National Auto & Truck Museum (www.natmus.org) is located directly behind the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Museum in the former service and experimental buildings of the Auburn Automobile Company.

The structures as when they were built are more utilitarian than the ornate headquarters building but they are the perfect place to display the museum’s eclectic collection.

Among the hundreds of vehicles are a large collection of trucks and engines built by International Harvester and Navistar; classic cars of the 1950s; muscle cars of the 1960s and 1970s an actual 1948 roadside diner moved inside the museum and numerous prototypes and one-of-a-kind vehicles.

Also within the larger museum is the collection of the National Automotive & Truck Model & Toy Museum with hundreds of toy and model cars including a large display of antique pedal cars.



Ford V-8 Foundation

The Early Ford V-8 Foundation built its national museum (www.fordv8foundation.org) in Auburn because of the other automotive museums already located there said museum Executive Director Joshua Conrad.

The museum is dedicated to 1932–53 Ford vehicles which also reflect much of the art deco aesthetic of the age.

The centerpiece of the museum is a newly opened wing including a section resembling a smaller version of the Ford Rotunda pavilion at the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair. The original rotunda was later moved to Ford’s Dearborn Michigan Headquarters where it served as a company visitor center until it burned in 1962.

Today the original Ford Rotunda marquee welcomes visitors to the museum. The inside of the new building reproduces an upscale 1936 Ford dealer showroom and displays representatives of every Ford model for sale that year.

Visitors can even take a self-guided stroll for a 1936 showroom experience learning about the features important to various buyers of the era and which vehicle would likely appeal to each buyer.

Each vehicle which looks as new as the day it rolled off the factory floor shines with an almost heavenly gleam. The surfaces are so reflective that without care every picture a visitor takes of a vehicle can become an accidental selfie.

The museum includes several other displays and galleries including a large collection of early Ford tractors.

Visitors who want even more old-car experiences can time a visit to coincide with one of Auburn’s many automotive-focused events such as the Third Thursday Cruise-Ins held on the DeKalb County Courthouse Square.

And the annual Auburn Cord Duesenberg Festival (www.acdfestival.org) held over Labor Day weekend attracts thousands of visitors from around the world to a wide variety of antique automotive events including parades swap-meets cruise-ins and a large and renowned classic automobile auction.

But how do the summer heat and humidity impact the instruments providing such delightful tunes?

FOX Weather talked to experts — who are themselves musicians — about the impact/role weather can make/play on drums guitars pianos winds and strings.

Drums

""Drums are the root the core of a lot of the music we listen to"" said Daryl Anderson drum designer/artist support for Yamaha Corporation of America.

Drum shells are typically made of wood such as maple birch and Mahogany. On the other hand snare drums the primary drum heard in a lot of music can also be made of metal.

The circular surface that stretches across a drum shell called the drumhead or skin is often made of plastics. (As the name suggests skins were originally made of natural materials such as goatskin and cowhide).

Weather can take a significant toll on the different materials in drums — along with the drums’ sound quality.

Take moisture for example.

""In the case of the drumhead if you were dealing with an actual natural skin playing surface that drumhead is going to absorb the moisture and slacken and become very dead and low in pitch"" Anderson said.

""That's also true of the shell itself where the drum shell is made of wood it's going to absorb moisture and that moisture is just going to be unnecessary mass and density for the vibrating walls.""

Extreme temperatures may also damage drums.

According to Anderson drums left in 110 degree-environments can cause paint on the drums to crack. Drum shells which are generally made out of thin veneers and multiple plies of wood may see those plies become unglued and separated in such high temperatures.

Sudden temperature changes may also wreak havoc on the instruments.

""I've seen that for drums but also even cymbals"" Anderson said. ""I've seen cymbals be super super cold go into a warm nightclub and get struck and then just crack because they become very brittle.""

To prevent this kind of weather-related damage Anderson recommends taking notice of environmental conditions. For example a drummer living in Florida would have to deal with factors such as salt water or high humidity so they’d need to be sensitive to how their instrument behaves within that particular set of conditions.

He stressed the importance of having a heightened awareness of how an instrument feels and sounds so the instrument can be cleaned and maintained before any significant damage could occur.

""If you're serious about your music you'll want to take care of your instrument"" Anderson said.

""So if you have a job to do and you need to play that show and it happens to be a thunder shower or if you're playing a gig and it's in the middle of the desert in Las Vegas just be aware and take notice of that and take care of your instruments accordingly.""

Guitars

""The people that don't live in the musical instrument world are certainly not aware of just how fragile acoustic guitar is"" said Andy Winston technical sales specialist of guitars basses and amplifiers for Yamaha Corporation of America.

""It really is a finely tuned piece of art that just happens to be made of wood and happens to make beautiful sound — so we do have to take care of it. We do have to treat it as if our living depended on it as if we couldn't make our music without it.""

Acoustic guitars are generally made of wood. Some guitars may have a spruce wood top and mahogany back whereas others might be made entirely out of spruce or even laminate woods.

Electric guitars may use alder or mahogany for the body with the guitar neck being made of mahogany. Electric hardware is then screwed into certain parts of the guitar.

Temperature and moisture can wreak havoc on guitars according to Winston.

For example musicians who live in the South where high humidity is the norm may have their acoustic guitars in danger of absorbing too much moisture and having the wood of their guitars swell.

The metal components of a guitar can also be compromised by these weather conditions.

""A couple of times I had a customer come in who lived on a boat and he wondered why all of the hardware on his guitar was starting to rust and turn green"" Winston said. The moist environment of his home had collected on his guitar causing the damage.

The lack of moisture however can also damage a guitar. Winston noted how a guitar in dry conditions will have a tendency to crack or split particularly where there’s the greatest pressure and tension from the strings.

However the ideal conditions for a guitar are easily within reach.

""If you're storing guitars or have a guitar collection try to keep that room between about 45 and 55% relative humidity"" Winston said. ""Yeah it might sound like it's Florida but it's the best thing for your instrument.""

For musicians storing their guitar in a case Winston advised tracking its humidity by using a device that sits in the guitar’s sound hole and provides readouts on humidity levels.

He also recommends keeping guitars out of direct sunlight when possible and cleaning the instrument after playing especially in environments of high heat and humidity.

Pianos

""Music is good for your soul and good for your health"" said Ryan Ellison piano services supervisor at Yamaha Corporation of America. ""It's something that we hope more people have in their lives musical instruments.""

Pianos are primarily made of wood but there are large components that are made of cast iron steel aluminum copper and other metals. Felt products are used throughout the piano plastic is used as the key top material and polyester gives pianos a shiny black finish.

The materials used in pianos along with the piano’s maintenance needs are most significantly affected by the humidity according to Ellison.

""They have an ability to you know take in moisture and also exhaust moisture within their cellular structure"" Ellison said.

""For example very dry cold temperatures very dry low humidity but also high temperatures with high humidity — these extremities situations are challenging for the piano.""

Ellison noted how low humidity can cause wood in the piano to separate as the wood is losing so much moisture that it is unable to stay together as it was built. On the flipside high humidity can lead the wood to absorb the moisture. This causes the cell structures in the wood to elongate and then the wood will push out against itself.

""The way that affects the piano is that it stretches the strings that are on the bridge that connects to the soundboard"" Ellison said. The strings are set to precise levels of tension so when the wooden soundboard they are attached to stretch or contract that changes the tension of the strings and causes the piano to go out of tune.

For example according to Ellison pianos in southern California tend to experience a lot of variance in their tuning around late August/September because that is when the Santa Ana winds blow in.

""It really drops the humidity level dramatically"" he said. ""That wind comes down through the valley and pianos just drop in pitch.""

According to Ellison the ideal level of humidity for pianos is 45% with an acceptable range being 35 to 55%.

""Piano is mostly just the need for maintenance throughout the cycles of the season and what you might run into in the very high humidity seasons versus the very dry seasons and what to do to prevent it or maintain it"" he said.

Winds and strings

""Everyone's a fan of music but it's a very different thing to be part of creating music and the physicality of an instrument"" said Austin Snowden Winds & Strings product specialist at Yahama Corporation of America.

Wind instruments are grouped into different types of wood and metals. Wood instruments are most commonly made of a wood called Grenadier an African wood that had ideal sound properties due to its hardness and density. Metal wind instruments are often made of brass with some coated with gold or silver.

String instruments are traditionally primarily wood such as spruce and maple whereas some of the instruments are electric and have metal components.

No matter their components any wind or stringed instrument can be affected by the weather.

""If you think about it when heat is applied to any object instrument or any anything heat makes things expand and cold temperatures make things contract"" Snowden said. ""So when you're talking about an instrument that's supposed to vibrate and produce sound waves that are expanding and contracting can not only affect how those sounds resonate in the instrument but also the instrument's ability to resonate.""

The physical integrity of the instrument can also be compromised.

Wooden wind and string instruments are particularly vulnerable to heat and humidity.

""You can imagine if you've got a wooden instrument particularly where you're blowing warm air through it and that our air has moisture in it but that in a freezing cold environment that moisture can freeze up"" Snowden said. ""It can get inside the cracks of the wood and then expand even more. That can cause cracks and really harm the instrument long term.""

The changes caused by heat and humidity can also cause metal strings in instruments such as violins to warp and become damaged.

Metal wind instruments while unable to absorb moisture can still be affected by it. Moisture can cause the instruments to expand and contract at a molecular level acoustically changing how the sound is projected and how the player feels that instrument is responding according to Snowden.

""It's really important for players to be conscious of what weather environment they are in and what they are coming to or going to and coming from"" Snowden said. ""When you hear an instrument a musician warming up not only are they warming up their chops their base their muscles but they also have to physically warm up their instrument.""

Snowden recommends players maintain this awareness of the climate wherever they play.

""Any climate that is mostly consistent would be ideal"" he said. ""But no matter where you live there's going to be some weather factors that you should be aware of and prepare for.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjIvanVsLzAyL2plcnJ5LWhhbGwtZmlsZXMtZm9yLWRpdm9yY2UtZnJvbS1ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaNIBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjIvanVsLzAyL2plcnJ5LWhhbGwtZmlsZXMtZm9yLWRpdm9yY2UtZnJvbS1ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jerry Hall files for divorce from Rupert Murdoch in US court,"Jerry Hall has filed for divorce from Rupert Murdoch citing “irreconcilable differences” with the billionaire media mogul.

In a petition filed in a California court on Friday six years after they were married the former model sought spousal support and legal fees from the 91-year-old.

It will be Murdoch’s fourth divorce. Hall was previously in a long-term relationship with Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones with whom she has four children. Hall and Murdoch started dating in 2015 and were married a year later.

According to reports in the US the split came as a surprise to people close to the family.

In the petition filed with the Los Angeles superior court Hall said she was “unaware of the full nature and extent of all [Murdoch’s] assets and debts and will amend this petition when the information has been ascertained”.

Hall who on Saturday marked her 66th birthday also requested that the court cut off its ability to award support to Murdoch.

Hall’s lawyer Ronald Brot and a spokesperson for Murdoch did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. News Corp of which Murdoch is executive chair did not comment.

But how do the summer heat and humidity impact the instruments providing such delightful tunes?

FOX Weather talked to experts — who are themselves musicians — about the impact/role weather can make/play on drums guitars pianos winds and strings.

Drums

""Drums are the root the core of a lot of the music we listen to"" said Daryl Anderson drum designer/artist support for Yamaha Corporation of America.

Drum shells are typically made of wood such as maple birch and Mahogany. On the other hand snare drums the primary drum heard in a lot of music can also be made of metal.

The circular surface that stretches across a drum shell called the drumhead or skin is often made of plastics. (As the name suggests skins were originally made of natural materials such as goatskin and cowhide).

Weather can take a significant toll on the different materials in drums — along with the drums’ sound quality.

Take moisture for example.

""In the case of the drumhead if you were dealing with an actual natural skin playing surface that drumhead is going to absorb the moisture and slacken and become very dead and low in pitch"" Anderson said.

""That's also true of the shell itself where the drum shell is made of wood it's going to absorb moisture and that moisture is just going to be unnecessary mass and density for the vibrating walls.""

Extreme temperatures may also damage drums.

According to Anderson drums left in 110 degree-environments can cause paint on the drums to crack. Drum shells which are generally made out of thin veneers and multiple plies of wood may see those plies become unglued and separated in such high temperatures.

Sudden temperature changes may also wreak havoc on the instruments.

""I've seen that for drums but also even cymbals"" Anderson said. ""I've seen cymbals be super super cold go into a warm nightclub and get struck and then just crack because they become very brittle.""

To prevent this kind of weather-related damage Anderson recommends taking notice of environmental conditions. For example a drummer living in Florida would have to deal with factors such as salt water or high humidity so they’d need to be sensitive to how their instrument behaves within that particular set of conditions.

Apart from these the regulator has penalised Kumaresh Ramakrishnan Puneet Pal and Rakesh Suri who were fund managers at the time of the violation of the rule.

Individually SEBI has levied a fine of Rs25 lakh on PGIM Asset Management Company Rs5 lakh on Menon and Rs2 lakh each on Ramakrishnan Pal and Suri.

In its order SEBI noted that five entities did not adhere to the provisions of the mutual fund regulations while executing ISTs between open and close-ended schemes of PGIM MF. While executing ISTs certain low-quality securities were transferred from close-ended schemes to open-ended schemes. The swap was done to thwart or arrest the potential redemption pressure.

The order added that they selectively protected the interest of investors of open-ended schemes at the cost of investors of close-ended schemes. The investors of close-ended schemes unlike that of open-ended schemes could not withdraw their investments before the maturity of the scheme.

""The ISTs which were done by the fund managers during the period of inspection were apparently prejudicial to the interest of close-ended scheme holders and was unfair to both sets of investors (Open and close ended scheme) as the inter scheme transfers were only to window dress the NAV (net asset value) and was inherently not intended to protect the interest of either set of subscribers"" SEBI said.

Through such acts they violated the provisions of mutual fund rules.

The SEBI order found PGIM AMC guilty of transferring good quality securities from its closed-end funds to open-ended funds while transferring stressed securities from open-ended schemes to closed-end schemes. It also questioned the fund house’s rationale in investments in certain securities such as Sunny View and SD Corporation in 2018.

With regards to two securities Sunny View and SD Corporation the market watchdog found that PGIM had transferred these securities from its open-ended funds to closed-end funds when bad news about these companies had started to come out.

The order came after SEBI carried out a thematic inspection on Inter-Scheme Transfers of downgraded debt securities of PGIM India Mutual Fund for the period of August 2018 to February 2019.

A close-ended scheme is related to a specific maturity period. In the case of close-ended schemes the net assets and NAV become relevant only towards the period of closure of the scheme while the NAV of open-ended scheme is very sensitive as the subscribers can seek redemption at any point in time.

As per the order the regulator found 315 cases of inter-scheme transfers and 25 of these took place with securities that were downgraded before or after the shifts. As part of the inter-scheme transfer incidents SEBI observed that the fund house had transferred stressed securities from open-ended schemes to closed-end schemes and good securities from closed-end schemes to open-ended schemes.

According to the SEBI order in October 2018 the stressed security of Jorabat Shillong was transferred from PGIM Medium Term Fund to PGIM Fixed Duration Fund. On the same day security of Power Finance Corporation - which “did not have any adverse developments pertaining to it” - was transferred from the same fixed-duration fund to the medium term fund.

Similarly the security of DHFL was transferred from Medium Term Fund to Fixed Duration Fund on October 17 2018 and on the same date good quality security of L&T Housing Finance was transferred from Fixed Duration Fund to Medium Term Fund.

The SEBI order revealed that PGIM AMC defended its actions by saying that even after it transferred securities from open-ended schemes to closed-end schemes the former still continued to hold sizeable chunks of the same securities. The underlying securities the fund house added continued to pay interest. Any downgrade as observed by SEBI it added was “only by one notch” and happened “much later” or “prior” to the inter-scheme transfer.

And the fund house also said that as opposed to SEBI's charges of not recording adequately the rationale behind the inter-scheme transfers (a requirement as per an earlier SEBI circular) “there is no specific template as to how detailed the reason must be”.

The SEBI order also stated that PGIM AMC had defended that it had recorded its investment decisions and the fund house was monitoring all its underlying securities adequately.

This SEBI order comes close on the heels of its order on Kotak Mahindra AMC and its chief Nilesh Shah where it imposed collective penalties of Rs1.6 crore on the fund house its CEO its trustee company and its debt fund managers. The penalties were imposed for flouting SEBI rules while investing in Essel Group companies.

Both cases were part of the larger credit crisis that had plagued the MF industry and the debt markets between 2018 (when the IL&FS crisis happened) and 2020 (when Franklin Templeton India shut down six of its debt funds).

Inter-scheme transfers have been undertaken by fund houses for years provided the securities confer to the scheme objectives in which they are transferred. But fund houses have been found transferring stressed securities from one scheme to another particularly from open-ended funds to closed-end funds to provide liquidity to open-ended schemes. Open-ended funds get inflows and outflows on a daily basis so liquidity in such schemes is very important.

When a scheme is saddled with illiquid securities the probability of it provoking a redemption crisis is higher. In order to avoid this fund managers usually transfer bad securities to closed-end schemes where there is no redemption pressure as they will mature in a few years (say 3 to 5years). The problem is that investors of closed-end funds are at a disadvantage if the stressed security continues to be stressed till redemption time of the closed-end fund. In which case investors of closed-end have to bear the loss.

In 2020 SEBI tightened inter-scheme transfer rules as part of its on-going strengthening mutual fund regulations after the Franklin Templeton debt fund crisis. It made ISTs more stringent. For instance schemes could only take ISTs after exhausting all other measures to generate liquidity like use of cash market borrowing and selling of underlying securities in the market.

If after all this a scheme still needs cash to meet its redemptions it should transfer the securities that come with a combination of low duration and high credit rating.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFiaWFuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2luZHVzdHJpZXMvYmFua2luZy1maW5hbmNlL3VhZXMtZmlyc3QtZGlnaXRhbC1iYW5rLXphbmQtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWJvYXJkLW9mLWRpcmVjdG9ycy1hcy1pdC1nZWFycy11cC1mb3ItbGF1bmNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UAE’s first digital bank Zand announces board of directors as it gears up for launch,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/banking-finance/uaes-first-digital-bank-zand-announces-board-of-directors-as-it-gears-up-for-launch on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFiaWFuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2luZHVzdHJpZXMvYmFua2luZy1maW5hbmNlL3VhZXMtZmlyc3QtZGlnaXRhbC1iYW5rLXphbmQtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWJvYXJkLW9mLWRpcmVjdG9ycy1hcy1pdC1nZWFycy11cC1mb3ItbGF1bmNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9ldS1tYWtlcy1kZWFsLW9uLW1pY2EtbGVnaXNsYXRpb24tdG8tcmVndWxhdGUtY3J5cHRvLW1hcmtldHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EU Makes Deal on MiCA Legislation to Regulate Crypto Markets – Regulation Bitcoin News,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9ldGhlcmV1bS10cmFuc2Zlci1jb3N0cy1jb250aW51ZS10by1zbGlkZS1uZXR3b3JrLWZlZXMtdGFwLWEtMTktbW9udGgtbG93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ethereum Transfer Costs Continue to Slide — Network Fees Tap a 19-Month Low – Altcoins Bitcoin News,

During repetitive endurance exercise fitness trackers and smartwatches are able to monitor the pace and speed at which you move combining it with your heart rate oxygen levels and the difficulty of your route to provide a great snapshot-by-numbers of how your workout went.

But yoga is a little more difficult. All the smartwatches listed above and indeed any fitness watch worth its salt tend to have yoga sports profiles available to them. But when you roll out your best yoga mat  you’re not getting the same experience as a run and it’s a lot more difficult to measure success than your fitness tracker (even the ones in our best fitness tracker list) might have you believe.

You can’t beat a personal best during yoga in any meaningful way you can record on a watch. You might be able to hit a new pose you couldn’t do before or you might finally get your heels on the floor during downward dog or go through the whole class without once thinking about your inbox feeling present for the practice. All of those count as progress on the mat.

But your watch or fitness tracker wouldn’t be able to tell you about these personal bests in the same way it can for runs rides and swims because it doesn’t have the technology or language to be able to do so. It can record your heart rate calories burned and exertion levels but it’s using the same “language” as it does to record a HIIT session for example. Most watches use a generic “multisport” statistic recording mode and just label it “yoga” in your activity log. That’s about as sophisticated as it gets although some higher-end Garmins are able to monitor your breathing during yoga flows.

Even Garmin’s strength training mode - for all its faults - allows you to set specific exercises and its motions count sets and reps. Likewise when it comes to swimming as many watches can now track individual strokes. No watch has the ability to do this with yoga poses and because of how varied the practice is from class to class I don’t think any convenient piece of technology ever will.

Occasionally the watch might even prove an unwelcome distraction especially if recording a workout means dealing with an always-on display and regular beeps. If you’re worrying about your vital stats during yoga in the same way you fret over your pace during a run you’re not quite going to hit the balance most classes encourage. Yoga is often thought to be a place to escape from notifications: inviting them into the studio seems crass especially if your watch is on loud.

But providing your watch or tracker is silent and its light-up face does not disturb other yogis I do think the yoga sports profile has a place on modern watches and trackers and should remain a fixture.

The aim of apps like Fitbit Premium Garmin Connect and Google Health is to become a one-stop-shop for all your health and fitness data gathering everything from sleep to your step count and your changing weight (if you’ve got one of the best smart scales that connects to your app of choice such as the Fitbit Aria or Garmin Index models) right through to your activity logs.

Although yoga isn’t necessarily something you can measure by heart rate and bodily responses alone it’s still great to keep a log of it. When you take a look back at how much exercise you did that week your yoga session is right there along with the rest of your workouts. And maybe the stats aren’t impressive but that’s not why we practice: it’s like journaling about your experience but from a physiological perspective rather than a mental one. Most apps allow you to rate how you felt after a workout with a selection of smiley faces: which fits into yoga’s emphasis on reflection and being present in your body for the duration of the workout.

On the other hand like any form of exercise recording it might allow us to see some progress. If yoga leaves your heart racing and out of breath as you make an effort to hold those difficult poses for the first time you’ll be able to see an improvement as you compare your physical responses to the sessions over weeks and months.

You’ll also be able to see your heart rate drop or not during any meditation that might occur during the practice. If your stress levels are still high even after those few minutes of mindfulness at the start or end of your workout it may be worth thinking back to the session speaking to your instructor and getting to the root of the problem.

Even though it’s just you and a yoga mat out there (and if you’ve not got one read our advice on how to choose the right yoga mat) a fitness tracker or smartwatch can help you reflect on your practice and record your progress even if those records are somewhat incomplete.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nYWRnZXRzLXdlZWtseS1nYXJtaW4tZm9yZXJ1bm5lci05NTUtZGl6by1idWRzLXAtYW5kLW1vcmUtMTEyMzAyOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gadgets Weekly: Garmin Forerunner 955 Dizo Buds P and more,Each earbud houses a 40mAh battery and can offer up to seven hours of nonstop music playback.

Few insights on what to do with running form data Amazon

In this hands-on review I test out the Garmin Running Dynamics Pod. This is a tiny device that collects and stores data to help you assess your running form.

Essential reading: Best fitness trackers and health gadgets

The pod-like gadget has been around for a few years now. The bunch of metrics that it spits out always piqued my interest but not enough to go for the purchase. It is only when I recently upgraded to the Forerunner 955 that I decided to go for the $70 device.

This is because it allows the Forerunner to gather Run Power data. To remind Garmin has added native integration for this with its latest watch release. But Run Power needs either the Running Dynamics Pod or one of the company’s chest straps in order to work.

Here’s everything you need to know about the Garmin Running Dynamics Pod.

The verdict

Garmin Running Dynamics Pod review: Design & hardware

I was surprised when I took the Running Dynamics Pod out of the box. It is tiny very tiny. About the size of a UK 50 cent coin as shown in the image below.

There is not much else in the box apart from a little instruction booklet. That’s because you don’t need anything else apart from a Garmin watch. The wearable does not re-charge so there’s no need for cables. Instead it works on a single coin cell battery. When the battery runs out you can replace it with a new one. A replacement will cost you between $2 or $3. So not a huge expense.

Opting for replaceable batteries was a sensible decision by Garmin. Why worry about yet another cable? Assuming daily use of one hour you can expect the battery to run for about a year. In fact most people will not use it that much so I’m guessing they could probably get two years of use out of it before needing to replace the battery.

The module which houses the accelerometer is housed in a soft silicone clip. Stretch it a bit and you can easily remove the pod.

As far as placement you are meant to attach the device on your back – to the center of your waistband. The silicone bit extends to a flexible clip which you can secure to your running gear.

My worry initially was that the pod might fall. The first few runs I found myself touching the pod every once in a while to alleviate my fears. But that was unfounded. The clip is very strong and when in place it stays firmly in place. No danger whatsoever of it falling off.

Having said that the pod’s tiny size is a mere 37.6 mm x 23.2 mm x 19.2 mm and weight 12 grams. So I could see myself eventually losing it either by leaving it in my pocket or misplacing it somewhere. But that’s not Garmin’s fault.

So far I have been extra careful to leave it in a safe place after each run. Perhaps that is why the company chose the flashy yellow silicone surround – it makes it stand out more.

Another interesting thing about the Running Dynamics Pod is that it has no on/off button. When you attach it to your waistband it will automatically switch on because it will sense movement. Leave it somewhere post-run and it can figure out your are not using it any more and it will automatically switch off. Another point towards simplicity – another plus.

As far as water-resistance the rating of the gadget is only 1 ATM. Which means occasional splashes rain or snow and even showering is fine. But you can’t submerge it in water or swim with it. It would be kind of pointless anyway doing that sort of thing.

Garmin Running Dynamics Pod review: Functionality

To first use the device you will need to pair it with a compatible smartwatch. The Pod does not work with non-Garmin gear so that is something to be aware of.

Pairing is done the same as with any other ANT+ accessory.

Go to Settings on the compatible device choose Sensors and Accessories .

on the compatible device choose . Then choose the Add New option and Search Al l. The watch will automatically scan the surrounding area so make sure to bring the Pod close and shake it to make sure it is on.

option and l. The watch will automatically scan the surrounding area so make sure to bring the Pod close and shake it to make sure it is on. After a little while you’ll get the message that the Pod is connected. In my case it appears in the list of accessories under RD Pod – xxxxxx (6 digit number). So you should get something similar.

That’s pretty much it as far as setup. This initial pairing only needs to be done once. From that point on as long as the Pod is awake it will automatically connect to your watch when it is in run mode.

One other thing you will want to do is add some new Data Screens to your run profile. This is so that you can view the running dynamics info and power run info on the watch itself in real-time.

Without going into to much detail the procedure is as follows:

Open up Settings on the watch and choose Activities & apps .

on the watch and choose . Select Run .

. Select Run Settings .

. Choose Data Screens .

. Then it is simply a matter of adding the appropriate Running Form and/or Power Data fields and tweaking this to your liking.

In my case this brought the total number of individual Data Screens to five on my Forerunner 955 setup. I created a separate page for running dynamics metrics and one for run power. During exercise I would occasionally scroll to one of these.

The data

Checking on running dynamics metrics on the watch allows you to tweak your form or check on run power while you are in motion. However of more use is the post-run data which allows you to review in detail:

Cadence

Ground Contact Time

Stride Length

Vertical Oscillation

Vertical Ratio

Ground Contact Time

Power data (with a compatible watch)

All of this is available in both the Garmin Connect mobile app and the web dashboard. But the latter is perhaps more useful as it allows you to group the data into weekly monthly six monthly and longer-term charts.

The same is the case with the power data which I will not go into much detail in this review. You can read my full overview of this functionality in a separate more detailed piece I did a few days ago.

To summarize the functionality works in exactly the same way as the Garmin Connect IQ run power store solution. But this is now natively built in as long as your watch is compatible. At the time of writing this includes the Forerunner 955 and 255. The feature is in Beta for Fenix 7 and Epix 2 and we are also expecting the Forerunner 945 LTE and perhaps a few other Garmin watches to get it in the months ahead. But if you don’t have one of these watches you can still use the Pod to estimate running power but via the Connect IQ store solution.

Of course the other option is to use a Garmin heart rate chest strap such as HRM-Run or HRM-Tri. You will get the same type of data with the addition of heart rate. But this is less convenient as it means putting a strap around your chest each time you head out for a run.

Shown below is a summary of the type of data you get in Garmin Connect after a run.

Some of this can be displayed in colour-coded charts and overlayed with lots of other data such as elevation pace heart rate and much more. The different colours correspond to how close you are to the ideal range.

The data can also be segregated into laps and segments. So for each lap or segment you can get detailed running dynamics metrics and run power.

The long-term charts display how the data is changing over time are shown below. These can be utilised to follow trends.

How useful are all these statistics?

The obvious question is to do with the usefulness of these types of biomechanical measurements. In my view it is only now that the native Run Power functionality has been added that it makes sense to buy the Running Dynamics Pod. At least for me it is what made the difference between purchasing and not purchasing the device.

That’s because the running dynamics metrics on their own have limited use. Particularly as Garmin does not provide any actual insights into the data. So you are left on your own to draw conclusions and turn the statistics into meaningful data.

One useful thing you can do is click on “Help” when viewing any particular running dynamics metric. This offers a brief explanation and shows “ideal” ranges to aim for.

For example with cadence (or the number of steps per minute) you want to aim for a high spm (steps per minute) figure. A typically cited target is over 180spm. This figure is also used in combination with GPS data from your watch to calculate the length of your stride during a run.

Vertical oscillation on the other hand measures the vertical torso movement with each step while running. It is captured in centimeters. In this case you typically want to aim for a lower number as lower vertical oscillation is more economical and provides less stress on the body. Here are the target ranges.

Ground Contact Time is also important. You want to be scraping the pavement just barely to propel forward whereas bouncing off the ground and having your head go higher is inefficient. This metric is also directly correlated with injury since the more time you spend on the ground the higher the impact on your body. Aim for a low amount of time.

Then we have Ground Contact Time Balance which measures your run symmetry by keeping track of the balance between your left and right foot ground contact time. The metric is shown as a percentage greater than 50% with an arrow to the left or right to show which foot is on the ground longer. Needless to say you want to aim for perfect symmetry – so as close to 50/50 as possible. Deviating from this a lot can lead to poor running form or can be an indicator of an injury.

I found the data interesting to sift through after the first few runs. Although it was difficult to draw conclusions as the info would differ from run to run depending on how fast I was going. But in general I found that my run balance and ground contact time were pretty decent. And that I need to work towards lowering my vertical oscillation in order to improve my run economy.

My run cadence is also good. The benefit of using the running pod instead of the watch on your wrist for this type of data is that the pod will be more accurate.

I see myself using the graphs from time to time to check for consistency and changes. For example if my balance is off I can do some extra stretching to loosen the muscles.

But it would be more useful if Garmin could do the analysis for you and spit out some useful suggestions and insights. Anything other than a nice relaxed posture good forward lean decent cadence – has room for improvement.

Used right this type of data also has potential to show potential soreness or early onset of injury. For example if you suddenly start favouring one leg over the other. So look for trends and changes for the better or worse. For those recovering from an injury it can offer a way to gradually ease into things.

Data nerds will feel right at home! And let’s face it – a lot of this data is just cool to look at!

Garmin Running Dynamics Pod review: The verdict

Garmin’s tiny but entirely capable Running Dynamics Pod is an interesting little device. Clip it to the back of your waistband and it will track a range of running dynamics metrics including power data if you have a compatible watch.

The data is interesting to read through although it does suffer from a lack of insights. So you are left on your own to draw conclusions and see how close you are to recommended ranges. Study your run cadence vertical ratio ground contact time balance and more to find out how you deviate from ideal running form. This type of info can also be useful as an indicator of an early onset of injury.

Garmin Running Dynamics Pod

Gadgets & Wearables may get a commission

The device does what it says on the tin and its ANT+ connectivity is good. I really like the simplicity of use and the fact that there is no charging. Once the battery runs out in a year or two spend $2-$3 to purchase a replacement battery.

However what actually nudged me into the $70 expense is the fact that I recently bought the Forerunner 955. Native run power data is now easy to use as long as you have the Running Dynamics Pod. Sure you can opt for a Garmin heart rate chest strap for the same type of data but for me it is much easier and less cumbersome to clip something on to my running shorts. I do not regret the purchase.

Overall I think most users will prefer the Pod rather than the strap. The Pod is simple unobtrusive and comfortable. Most importantly the extra data it provides has the potential to help you improve running mechanics efficiency and avoid injury.

You can check the Running Dynamics Pod on Garmin’s website. It can also be picked up on Amazon and other retail outlets.

Garmin has today announced its HRM-FIT heart rate monitor a device specifically designed for woman. The company now sells five different heart rate monitors. In this article we explain the differences between them.

The company may be known for sports watches but it also dishes out GPS technology across a diverse range of markets including aviation marine tracking and mobile apps. If you own one of its sports watches you are probably aware that Garmin also makes heart rate chest straps.

Still better than wrist heart rate monitors

The value of such devices are that they are much more precise than something attached to your wrist. Garmin may be on version 5.0 of its Elevate heart rate wrist sensor but this still trails heart rate chest straps when it comes to accuracy. This is particularly evident with high intensity exercise such as HIIT. That is why many cyclists and runners like to attach a heart rate strap before heading out to exercise.

Essential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets

Interestingly Garmin has not yet dished out anything that works from the mid or upper arm. We say interesting because other companies have gone down this route. Polar is one such example with its OH1+ strap but there are other examples. In our mind it is just a matter of time before Garmin gets into this space.

Technical specs compared

For now you have a choice of four Garmin heart rate chest straps. This includes HRM-Swim HRM-Dual HRM-Pro HRM-Pro Plus and HRM-Fit.

There’s is also Garmin HRM-Run which can be picked up on some retail sites along with HRM-Tri. The first has been around since 2013 the second since 2015. So it’s safe to say they are packing older heart rate tech smarts. It is not a surprise therefore that both of these have been officially discontinued as they have been superseded by newer heart rate monitors.

You might be able to pick up some great discounts on HRM-Run or HRM-Tri but know that you are running a risk as the product as not sold in Garmin’s store any more. Always best to buy the latest technology.

So it comes down to the other four heart rate monitors. Here’s a table showing how their technical specs stack up.

HRM Dual vs Swim vs Pro vs Pro Plus: functionality compared

As you can see HRM-Dual is the lowest spec but also the lower priced of the ones that are unisex. It is an option for those on a budget who do not need swim tracking ability or built-in storage.

Moving up in the range we get to HRM-Swim. The main upgrades with that one are better water-proofing and a non-slip design when in water. The device also has the ability to store and forward heart rate data to compatible devices.

Garmin HRM-Pro

Then we have HRM-Pro and Pro-Plus. These two are exactly the same apart from the colour options and battery changing mechanism. The latter adopts the ability to change the coin cell battery by twisting the module. So absolutely no tools are required which makes the whole process much easier.

As far as ability the main upgrades over the first two devices are an increased number of concurrent BLE connections Running Dynamics support for native run power on compatible Garmin watches running pace and distance estimates (both outdoors and indoors) and stand-alone basic activity monitoring. On top of that you get all the ability of the lower range Garmin heart rate monitors.

A heart rate monitor for women

The HRM-Fit priced at $150 stands out in Garmin’s product line for its focus on women’s fitness needs. It is uniquely designed to attach securely to medium to high support sports bras using three anchor points accommodating various body types. This design ensures stability and comfort during intense workouts.

Functionally the HRM-Fit is at the high-end. It supports advanced workout tracking including metrics like vertical oscillations ground contact time and stride length offering in-depth analysis of running form. The device is built for durability with a battery life of up to one year based on daily one-hour usage and features a tool-free door for easy battery replacement.

In comparison to other Garmin heart rate monitors the HRM-Fit introduces a specialized approach. While models like the HRM-Tri and HRM-Run are tailored for triathletes and runners with specific metrics the HRM-Fit is designed for women seeking a comfortable reliable heart rate monitor that integrates effortlessly into their fitness routine.

Garmin HRM-FIT

Garmin heart rate monitors compared: the bottom line

Garmin has a nice selection of Garmin heart rate chest straps. Nothing that works from the upper or mid-arm just yet but if you are serious about your running or cycling pursuits you will want one of these.

Top of the range are HRM-Pro Pro-Plus and HRM-Fit for women. We suspect Garmin will discontinue the first soon so best to go for one of the latter two. The main benefit of going for the latest generation chest straps over the older ones is support for running dynamics along with running power. The latter works on some smartwatches natively on other Garmin watches by using the Garmin Connect IQ store solution.

If you want to save some cash then HRM-Dual and HRM-Swim are your options. There really isn’t any other reason to choose one of these two. The second costs a bit more than the first but has better water-proofing onboard storage and swim tracking ability.

Whichever device you choose take comfort in knowing it will spit out accurate heart rate stats and work seamlessly with your Garmin watch. The other option is to go for another manufacturer’s strap. These will also play nice with your Garmin timepiece. Our device of choice is the Polar OH1+ but there are other good ones.

Check out the Garmin range of chest straps on the company’s website. Some of them can also be picked up on Amazon (HRM-Dual HRM-Swim HRM-Pro range).

The Boots and Hearts Barn Burner will return after a two-year absence and so far two legends of the ice have been named team captains for the event.

The Barn Burner charity hockey game will take place on Aug. 3 at Sadlon Arena and will see two star-studded teams going head to head. Money raised through the event will go to local charities such as the Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre (RVH) Foundation Huronia Rotary Club Easter Seals PIE Education and others.

NHL legends Gary Roberts and Mike Gartner have been selected as captains to head up the teams.

Gartner a Hockey Hall of Famer who has been one of the more familiar faces with the local event in recent years. He has been part of not just the Barn Burner series but also the Hockey Night In Barrie event which preceded it.

“Overall I’ve been a part of seven or eight of these” Gartner says. “I grew up in Barrie and live out in Shanty Bay so we’re still very much a part of the community.”

Gartner is also a local business owner being part-owner of National Training Rinks which has facilities in south-end Barrie Newmarket and Richmond Hill.

But he says the main reason he enjoys being part of the charity hockey game is to give back to the community and local organizations.

“Both my parents went through RVH. They’ve passed on many years ago now but were treated extremely well there. My family has gotten to know some of the people at RVH and I think because of that I believe it has being a major recipient of the funds raised is a big proponent for me” says Gartner 62.

Gartner’s family moved to Barrie when he was 13 years old and he played his bantam and midget hockey in the Barrie Minor Hockey Association (BMHA). He was also part of the Barrie Co-op Midgets 1975 Canadian National Wrigley Midget Championship.

“I still have great friends that I played minor hockey with 45 or 50 years ago"" says Gartner who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001. ""As a matter of fact some of them I still play hockey with to this day.""

In 19 NHL seasons the speedy winger scored 708 goals (which puts him eighth overall in the NHL record books) and had 1335 points in 1432 games. In 122 playoff games he also had 43 goals and 93 points. His 19-year NHL career included stops with the Washington Capitals (who drafted him fourth overall in 1979) Minnesota North Stars New York Rangers Toronto Maple Leafs and Phoenix Coyotes.

Gartner holds two NHL records that speak to his consistency: 15 consecutive 30-goal seasons and 17 seasons where he topped the 30-goal mark. In 2017 he was named among the the top 100 NHL players in league history.

Prior to joining the NHL the Ottawa native also played one season in the World Hockey Association (WHA) with the Cincinnati Stingers beginning when he was a teenager.

A seven-time NHL all-star Gartner credits some of his professional success to the people in this community who helped him along the way.

“There are a lot of very dedicated people in this community dedicated volunteers"" he says. ""I had great coaches growing up and I know there are people continuing that tradition always in the game of hockey.

“Obviously Barrie is not unique in that a lot of communities in Canada have that same approach but Barrie has grown a lot and we’re right on the cusp of being a big city. That said we still have that close-knit feel and that is a great thing to have"" Gartner adds.

Back from a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic the Barn Burner charity game is one event that Gartner says he anticipates every year.

“I’ve done a lot of charity events and this one is truly the most unique in that besides Gary (Roberts) and I it is entirely made up of current players” Gartner says. “We’ve had Steve Stamkos Connor McDavid Corey Perry and so on who have come out and played while still playing in the NHL. I can say we have another great bunch of players coming to the event this year and I’m just happy at the age of 62 that I can sort of play with them out there.”

Organizers announced this week that Toronto Maple Leafs captain John Tavares has also been added to the roster.

The Barn Burner charity game will be played Aug. 3 with doors opening at 6:30 p.m. Puck drop is scheduled for 7 p.m.

The Clare man was appointed chief executive of GE Aviation almost two years ago having played a stormer at aircraft maker Embraer. But last week Larry Culp the overall GE boss parachuted into the aviation division to take direct control with Slattery moving to the jump seat in the new role of chief commercial officer.

GE Aviation supplies engines for everything from bog-standard passenger planes to the American air force’s next generation of F-15EX fighter jets.

The rejigging of jobs comes after GE streamlined its business late last year into three divisions: aviation",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLW9mZmVycy1jcml0aWNhbC10ZWNoLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtaW5kaWFzLTV0aC1nZW4tZmlnaHRlci1qZXQtYW1jYS_SAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS91cy1vZmZlcnMtY3JpdGljYWwtdGVjaC10by1kZXZlbG9wLWluZGlhcy01dGgtZ2VuLWZpZ2h0ZXItamV0LWFtY2Ev?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Offers ‘Critical Tech’ To Develop India’s 5th-Gen Fighter Jet Three Years After It Punctured AMCA Program,"The revival of American defense major General Electric (GE) offers to help develop the jet engine for India’s under-development Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) should be taken with a pinch of salt.

The US suspended the joint development of aircraft engines under the Defense Trade and Technology Initiative (DTII) in October 2019. The timing of the offer amid two important geopolitical developments is suspicious.

Firstly Washington has been pressing India to condemn Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine and suspend its burgeoning oil trade with Moscow. Secondly the news of the offer came the same day as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Europe for the G7 meet.

The US Is Not A Reliable Defense Partner

Washington has actively supplied weapons to New Delhi worth $4 billion over the last decade with no contracts having been inked through competitive tendering.

The M-777 lightweight howitzer; the AH-64E Apache attack helicopters; Chinook heavy-lift helicopter; C-17 Globemaster III strategic airlift plane; the C-130J Hercules tactical airlift for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and; the P-8I Poseidon maritime reconnaissance aircraft for the Indian Navy have all been through the direct Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route.

It bares the political economy of US weapons sales that circumvents competitive bidding. Naturally it has also escaped joint manufacturing that entails more than a minimal level of technology transfer of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

But the suspension of the same jet engine project in October 2019 left a bad taste in the Indian industry and defense services casting doubt on the US move.

The then US Under Secretary for Defense Ellen Lord under the President Donald Trump administration had announced while speaking to a select group of journalists “the original project is suspended right now.”

The DTTI was created under the Obama administration and was the brainchild of his Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. The much-touted DTII had three other Working Groups – Land Systems Naval Systems and Aircraft Carrier Technology Cooperation.

Lord admitted the Americans ran into issues of “export control” which was enough evidence that its government and Military Industrial Complex (MIC) put commercial and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues before a “strategic partner.”

India saw the JWG on Jet Engine Technology as a pathway for the AMCA.

Moreover four other ‘pathfinder’ projects had failed to take off. They were the next-generation mini-UAVs that the Indian Army rejected for being too low-tech; roll-on roll-off kits for C-130; a mobile electric hybrid power source; and a protector kit for nuclear biological chemical fallout. The India Rapid Reaction Cell set up by the Pentagon was also downsized.

Suspect Timing

Foreign Minister S Jaishankar’s language in individual and joint statements in all diplomatic engagements since the war steered clear of criticizing Russia. He defended India’s oil trade with Russia upholding Delhi’s energy security needs amidst rising crude prices and runaway domestic inflation.

India has lapped cheap oil from Russia as crude elsewhere crossed $100 a barrel.

And in a direct attack on “Eurocentrism” in what also served as subtle blame on Europe for the crisis he called out its mindset “that its problems are the world’s problems but the world’s problems are not Europe’s problems.”

A section of foreign policy experts – many of them former American diplomats who served before and immediately after the war – had blamed the US for pushing unprovoked North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion which forced Putin’s hand.

At G7 Prime Minister Narendra Modi told G7 leaders that India would continue to do what it thinks is best for its energy security. Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra quoted the Prime Minister at a special briefing in Munich Germany in the early hours of Tuesday. Kwatra added that India’s position was “well-understood and appreciated.”

But the more powerful motivation was to lure India with having its fifth-generation stealth fighter flying soon with a super-cruise capable engine – considering India’s struggling efforts in this niche field. Super-cruise is the ability of an engine to fly at supersonic speeds at full throttle without having to engage the afterburners.

That it came the same day as PM Modi was attending the summit indicated the US hoped India could be enticed with an easy route towards a prestigious platform like a fifth-generation stealth aircraft.

Moreover the G7 summit came after the Brazil-Russia-India-China (BRICS) virtual summit whose joint statement “(urged) major developed countries to adopt responsible economic policies while managing policy spillovers to avoid severe impacts on developing countries.” It reflected their recognition that the spiraling food and oil prices resulted from Europe and the US’s sanctions on Russia not the war itself.

Talking points like “pandemic economic recovery” and “ensuring safe efficacious accessible affordable diagnostics medicines vaccines (for) developing countries and equitable distribution of vaccines” have been absent in the West’s statements and actions.

But what has been notable is the cautious and tacit attempts toward de-escalation between India and Pakistan and India and China.

On the same page over Russia and the non-dollar oil trade the strategic signaling towards wanting to de-escalate was reflected in Indian Ambassador to China Pradeep Rawat’s meeting with China’s Foreign Minister and State Councillor Wang Yi.

The Indian readout quoted Rawat agreeing with Wang on the “importance of bilateral relations for Asia and the world.” The only point of divergence between the two countries is the border issue.

The Chinese believe that larger areas of mutual interests can still be continued first to build confidence and trust in the bilateral relationship. On the other hand India sees the decade-old border issue as a significant source of instability needing immediate resolution.

Also India only informally criticized China for putting a ‘technical hold’ on the listing of Jamaat-ud-Daawa (JuD) chief Hafeez Saeed in the UN Security Council 1267 ISIL and al-Qaida Sanctions Committee.

Harsh rhetoric on non-state extremist terror from Pakistan has been absent from Indian statements or any reference to terrorism is without naming Pakistan directly.

It is not to mention the repeated olive branches to India from former Prime Minister Imran Khan his successor Shehbaz Sharif and his Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto. It means the desire to normalize ties with India is across the political spectrum in Pakistan.

So far Prime Minister Modi has read the writing on the wall and has correctly calculated that the US will not be rushing to its aid if a Himalayan war with China breaks out again.

In Europe not defending Ukraine directly and merely pouring in weapons did not look commensurate and in harmony with the scale of condemnation heaped on Russia’s “brutal unprovoked invasion.”",,,,,,,,,

Vero-TMPRSS238 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRRS239 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3 1 mM sodium pyruvate 1× non-essential amino acids and 100 U/ml of penicillin–streptomycin. Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were supplemented with 5 μg/mL of blasticidin. Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were supplemented with 10 µg/mL of puromycin. ExpiCHO-S cells were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All cells routinely tested negative for mycoplasma using a PCR-based assay.

Viruses

The Beta (B.1.351) and Omicron (BA.1 (R346) BA.1.1 (R346K) and BA.2) strains were obtained from nasopharyngeal isolates. All virus stocks were generated in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and subjected to next-generation sequencing as described previously39 to confirm the presence and stability of expected substitutions (see Supplementary Table 2). All virus experiments were performed in an approved biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility.

Monoclonal antibody purification

The mAbs studied in this paper S309 AZD8895 AZD1061 and the AZD7442 cocktail have been described previously91820.

S309-LS and S309-GRLR were produced in ExpiCHO-S cells and affinity-purified using HiTrap Protein A columns (GE Healthcare HiTrap mAb select Xtra #28-4082-61) followed by buffer exchange to histidine buffer (20 mM histidine 8% sucrose pH 6.0) using HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns. The final products were sterilized after passage through 0.22 μm filters and stored at 4 °C. VIR-7831 (clinical lead variant of S309-LS) was produced at WuXi Biologics.

AZD8895 and AZD1061 mAbs were cloned into mammalian expression vectors and expressed as IgG1 constructs with the TM (L234F/L235E/P331S) Fc modification with or without a second YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E) modification to extend half-life in humans. MAbs were expressed in 293 F cells after transfection with 293fectin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and isolated from supernatants by affinity chromatography using Protein A or Protein G columns (GE Healthcare). MAbs were eluted with 0.1 M glycine at low pH and dialyzed into PBS.

Mouse experiments

Animal studies were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (assurance number A3381–01). Virus inoculations were performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

Heterozygous K18-hACE2 C57BL/6 J mice (strain: 2B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Human FcγR Tg mice21 (FcγRα−/−/hFcγRI+/hFcγRIIAR131+/hFcγRIIB+/hFcγRIIIAF158+/hFcγRIIIB+) were a generous gift (J. Ravetch Rockefeller University) and bred at Washington University. All animals were housed in groups of 3 to 5 and fed standard chow diets. The photoperiod was 12 h on:12 h off dark/light cycle. The ambient animal room temperature was 70° F controlled within ±2° and the room humidity was 50% controlled within ±5%.

For experiments with K18-hACE2 mice eight- to ten-week-old female mice were administered the indicated doses of the respective SARS-CoV-2 strains (see Figure legends) by intranasal administration. For hFcγR Tg mouse experiments 12-week-old male mice were administered 105 FFU of a Beta (B.1.351) isolate by intranasal administration. In vivo studies were not blinded and mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups. No sample-size calculations were performed to power each study. Instead sample sizes were determined based on prior in vivo virus challenge experiments. Mice were administered the indicated mAb dose by intraperitoneal injection one day before or after intranasal inoculation with the indicated SARS-CoV-2 strain. AZD7442-TM (lacking the YTE modification that accelerates antibody elimination in rodents) was used in mouse studies.

Focus reduction neutralization test

Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with 102 focus-forming units (FFU) of different strains or variants of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibody-virus complexes were added to Vero-TMPRSS2 cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM. Plates were harvested 48–72 h later by removing overlays and fixing with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and incubated with an oligoclonal pool of SARS2-2 SARS2–11 SARS2–16 SARS2–31 SARS2–38 SARS2–57 and SARS2–7140. Plates with Omicron variant strains were additionally incubated with CR3022 and a pool of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs that cross-react with SARS-CoV41. Subsequently samples were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma 12–349) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma A6029) in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. SARS-CoV-2-infected cell foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and quantitated on an ImmunoSpot microanalyzer (Cellular Technologies).

Measurement of viral RNA levels

Tissues were weighed and homogenized with zirconia beads in a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 1 mL of DMEM medium supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Tissue homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at approximately 10000 × g for 5 min and stored at −80 °C. RNA was extracted using the MagMax mirVana Total RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the Kingfisher Flex extraction robot (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse transcription was carried out at 48 °C for 15 min followed by 2 min at 95 °C. Amplification was accomplished over 50 cycles as follows: 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Copies of SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA in samples were determined using a previously published assay42. Briefly a TaqMan assay was designed to target a highly conserved region of the N gene (Forward primer: ATGCTGCAATCGTGCTACAA; Reverse primer: GACTGCCGCCTCTGCTC; Probe: /56-FAM/TCAAGGAAC/ZEN/AACATTGCCAA/3IABkFQ/). This region was included in an RNA standard to allow for copy number determination down to 10 copies per reaction. The reaction mixture contained final concentrations of primers and probe of 500 and 100 nM respectively.

Viral plaque assay

Vero-TMPRSS2-hACE2 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well tissue culture plates. The following day medium was removed and replaced with 200 μL of material to be titrated diluted serially in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. One hour later 1 mL of methylcellulose overlay was added. Plates were incubated for 72 h then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (final concentration) in PBS for 20 min. Plates were stained with 0.05% (w/v) crystal violet in 20% methanol and washed twice with distilled deionized water.

Transient expression of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein and flow cytometry

ExpiCHO-S cells were seeded at 6 × 106 cells/mL in a volume of 5 mL in a 50 mL bioreactor. The following day cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-encoding pcDNA3.1(+) plasmids (BetaCoV/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 accession number MN908947 Wuhan D614; Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 generated by overlap PCR mutagenesis of the Wuhan D614 plasmid) harboring the Δ19 C-terminal truncation27. Spike encoding plasmids were diluted in cold OptiPRO SFM (Life Technologies 12309-050) mixed with ExpiFectamine CHO Reagent (Life Technologies A29130) and added to cells. Transfected cells were then incubated at 37˚C with 8% CO 2 with an orbital shaking speed of 250 RPM (orbital diameter of 25 mm) for 24 to 48 h. Transiently transfected ExpiCHO-S cells were harvested and washed twice in wash buffer (PBS 2% FBS 2 mM EDTA). Cells were counted and distributed into round bottom 96-well plates (Corning 3799) and incubated with serial dilutions of mAb starting at 10 μg/mL. Alexa Fluor647-labelled Goat Anti-human IgG secondary Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch 109–606–098) was prepared at 2 μg/mL and added onto cells after two washing steps. Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in wash buffer for data acquisition at ZE5 cytometer (BioRad).

Fc-mediated effector functions

Primary cells were collected from healthy human donors with informed consent and authorization via the Comitato Etico Canton Ticino (Switzerland). ADCC assays were performed using ExpiCHO-S cells transiently transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (Wuhan D614 BA.1 or BA.2) as targets. NK cells were isolated from fresh blood of healthy donors using the MACSxpress NK Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec cat. no. 130-098-185). Target cells were incubated with titrated concentrations of mAbs for 10 min and then with primary human NK cells at an effector:target ratio of 9:1. ADCC was measured using LDH release assay (Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (LDH) (Roche; cat. no. 11644793001) after 4 h incubation at 37˚C.

ADCP assays were performed using ExpiCHO-S cells transiently transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (Wuhan D614 BA.1 or BA.2) and labelled with PKH67 (Sigma Aldrich) as targets. PMBCs from healthy donors were labelled with CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) and used as source of phagocytic effector cells. Target cells (1000 per well) were incubated with titrated concentrations of mAbs for 10 min and then mixed with PBMCs (200000 per well). The next day cells were stained with APC-labelled anti-CD14 mAb (BD Pharmingen) BV605-labelled anti-CD16 mAb (BioLegend) BV711-labelled anti-CD19 mAb (BioLegend) PerCP/Cy5.5-labelled anti-CD3 mAb (BioLegend) APC/Cy7-labelled anti-CD56 mAb (BioLegend) for the identification of CD14+ monocytes. After 20 min cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before acquisition on a ZE5 Cell Analyzer (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 software. The % ADCP was calculated as % of monocytes (CD3- CD19- CD14+ cells) positive for PKH67.

MAb affinity measurements

(a) S309. SARS-CoV-2 RBD constructs contain residues 328–531 of the spike protein from GenBank NC_045512.2 with an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal 8xHis-AviTag. Proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C and 8% CO 2 . Transfections were performed using the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell culture supernatants were harvested five days after transfection by spinning at 4000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were then filtered through a 0.22 µm filter and supplemented with 10× PBS to a final concentration of 2.5× PBS (342.5 mM NaCl 6.75 mM KCl and 29.75 mM phosphates). SARS-CoV-2 RBDs were purified using HisPur Cobalt resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by buffer exchange into PBS using Amicon centrifugal filters (MilliporeSigma). S309 Fab binding measurements using surface plasmon resonance were performed on a Biacore T200 instrument. A CM5 chip with covalently immobilized anti-Avi polyclonal antibody (GenScript Cat #: A00674-40) was used for surface capture of His-Avi tag containing RBDs. Running buffer was HBS-EP + pH 7.4 (Cytiva) and measurements were performed at 25 °C. Experiments were performed with a 4-fold dilution series of monomeric S309 Fab: 571 143 and 36 nM and were run as single-cycle kinetics. Data were double reference-subtracted and fit to a binding model using Biacore Evaluation software. The 1:1 binding model was used to estimate the kinetics parameters. The experiment was performed in triplicate with technical replicates for each ligand (RBDs). Kinetics values out of instrument’s limit were omitted. K D values were reported as the average of all replicates.

(b) AZD8895 or AZD1061. Purified SARS-CoV-2 BA.2 RBD protein was purchased from AcroBiosystem. SARS-CoV-2 RBD constructs for D614G (residues 334–526) BA.1 and BA.1.1 (residues 319–537) were cloned with an N-terminal CD33 leader sequence and C-terminal GSSG linker AviTag GSSG linker and 8xHisTag. Recombinant proteins were expressed in FreeStyle 293X or 293 F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following transfection with 293fectin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s directions. RBD proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography using a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion column chromatography (GE Healthcare). AZD8895 and AZD1061 mAbs were isolated from expression supernatants by affinity chromatography using either MabSelect protein A or protein G columns (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 0.1 M glycine at low pH. MAbs were dialyzed into PBS. Fab fragments were prepared using papain immobilized on agarose resin (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s directions followed by purification over either MabSelect or protein A columns (GE Healthcare/Cytiva).Purified proteins were pooled and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to ensure purity and appropriate molecular weights as well as further evaluation by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering for some proteins.

Kinetic rates (k a  k d  and K D ) of AZD1061 and AZD8895 binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein were evaluated by biolayer interferometry using an Octet model RED384 instrument (FortéBio). Anti-His (HIS1K) biosensors (Pall FortéBio/Sartorius Part#18–5120) tips were first soaked in 1x kinetics buffer for 10 min followed by a baseline signal measurement in 1x kinetics buffer for 60 sec. His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD diluted in kinetics buffer to 5 μg/mL was loaded onto the tips for 180 sec. Antigen containing tips were then added to wells containing serial dilutions of AZD8895 or AZD1061 (at concentrations ranging from 3000 nM to 200 nM). Association and dissociation measurements were made for 300 sec each. All steps were performed at 30 °C and 1000 rpm shaking. Data were reference subtracted and fit to a 1:1 binding model using Octet Data Analysis Software 12.0. The fitted data were plotted with GraphPad Prism software (version 9.0).

Cytokine and Chemokine protein measurements

Lung homogenates were incubated with Triton-X-100 (1% final concentration) for 1 h at room temperature to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Homogenates were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines by Eve Technologies Corporation (Calgary AB Canada) using their Mouse Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 31-Plex (MD31) platform.

Lung pathology

Animals were euthanized before harvest and fixation of tissues. Briefly lungs were inflated with approximately 1.2 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde using a 3 mL syringe and catheter inserted into the trachea. Tissues were allowed to fix for 24 h at room temperature embedded in paraffin and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were scanned using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer slide scanning system and the images were viewed using NDP view software (ver.1.2.46).

Statistical analysis

All statistical tests were performed as described in the indicated figure legends using Prism v8.0 or 9.0. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way ANOVA when comparing three or more groups. When comparing two groups a Mann-Whitney test was performed. The number of independent experiments performed are indicated in the relevant figure legends. For correlation analyses best-fit lines were calculated using a simple linear regression. Two-tailed Pearson correlation was used to calculate the R2 and P values indicated within each panel.

The Clare man was appointed chief executive of GE Aviation almost two years ago having played a stormer at aircraft maker Embraer. But last week Larry Culp the overall GE boss parachuted into the aviation division to take direct control with Slattery moving to the jump seat in the new role of chief commercial officer.

GE Aviation supplies engines for everything from bog-standard passenger planes to the American air force’s next generation of F-15EX fighter jets.

The prestigious US$1 million reward by the Varkey Foundation is presented annually to an exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to his or her profession with funds also disbursed to the finalists to continue their good work.

Two years later Pemimpin GSL in partnership with YTL Foundation is launching a local edition of this prestigious award the Malaysia Teacher Prize to celebrate teachers whose exceptional efforts in educating young minds are often unseen and unrecognised.

The award seeks to raise the status of Malaysian teachers and celebrates the achievement of outstanding educators in the country. It is also the first of its kind here to honour teachers on a national level with a long-term professional development plan and generous prize money for those shortlisted.

The award is aimed at reaching 10000 teachers across the country. The grand prize winner will receive RM50000 while the four other finalists RM5000 each. Besides this the top 10 finalists will also receive professional development to help them better understand their impact and potentially scale their work beyond their schools. Applications for the Malaysia Teacher Prize is open to currently working teachers in Malaysia and will run until June 30. The shortlist is expected to be unveiled in August while the top five and grand prize winner will be announced in October.

“Last year we started talking to the Varkey Foundation about the competition space in Malaysia and how we could showcase local teachers and the innovations that they were employing in their classrooms” says Pemimpin GSL CEO Cheryl Ann Fernando. “Varkey didn’t have a local partner to bring the Global Teacher Prize to Malaysia so that’s what we signed up to do. There are 40 countries which run this competition locally and now we have joined them too.”

“In 2021 we actually started off with something smaller to not only put teachers in the limelight but also scale what they do in the classrooms” adds Samuel. “We have seen in the course of the pandemic some of the good ideas that have come from these classrooms organically so we looked for different ways to elevate the profession and add value to what was already being done. We saw this great idea in Sabah for example where a teacher taught coding to students without the use of computers — why are these stories not highlighted and these examples not replicated? This is part of the motivation for bringing the Global Teacher Prize to Malaysia.”

The YTL Foundation which is behind the establishment of Pemimpin GSL based on a desire to fund a school leadership development programme celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Its sponsorship of the Malaysia Teacher Prize represents another milestone in its ongoing commitment to empower individuals and communities to be catalysts of change throug education.

“YTL Foundation has always believed that strong and effective school leadership is fundamental in transforming schools and classrooms and the Malaysia Teacher Prize is a wonderful opportunity to call out and recognise great teacher leaders” says the foundation’s programme director Datuk Kathleen Chew. “YTL has supported Pemimpin GSL in its school leadership programme since its inception and we believe that this prize is a wonderful complement to its work.”

Although based on similar principles the local and international editions of the Global Teacher Prize differ in several ways. First the Malaysian prize is easier to apply for — submissions ask for four essays instead of 13 — and second and most critically is the professional development coaching element for those shortlisted which has a permanent impact on their teaching careers and subsequently the lives of students. “We’ve run programmes in schools for many years and it has been our mandate all this time — how we can promote better education. Definitely one pathway is to empower teachers to do what they do best so you have to find the best ones” Chew says.

While home learning and having parents become part-time educators during the pandemic has renewed our sense of gratitude for the critical role teachers play it also gave educators the opportunity to really showcase the breadth of their tenacity and creativity.

“Having been teachers pre-pandemic Samuel and I can say it wasn’t easy — what more during that period. Teachers were really forced to innovate” Fernando a Teach for Malaysia alumnus agrees. “A lot of them especially in rural areas really did everything they could to get homework to students and back including erecting a guard post outside the school for pick-ups and drop-offs or even bringing homework to kids’ homes and teaching full lessons on WhatsApp and Telegram! This really proves Malaysian teachers are amazing — in fact some of the best in the world — and they should be recognised.”

While this remains a noble ideal the overarching objective for the Malaysia Teacher Prize is much bigger — elevating the status of teachers and attracting greater talent into the profession. “This award will be a starting platform for teachers to share their stories particularly how hard they have worked during the pandemic to adapt to changing circumstances and do their best to provide excellent learning experiences for students. In the long run we hope this award serves as a motivation for teachers to continue improving student outcomes. We hope this will also encourage young people to see teaching as a profession of choice and sign up as teachers to further strengthen our education system.”

As a parent of seven children Chew has dealt with more than her fair share of educators both good and bad and is well aware that quality school leadership is a critical component of nation building. This insight was what drove YTL Foundation’s support of Pemimpin GSL from 2017. By the following year it was able to run fellowship programmes with 22 school principals and assistants and today has expanded to include activities for individual teachers in a total of 800 schools across the nation. “We receive calls frequently requesting these programmes so clearly word is spreading and it’s something the school leadership teams want and need” Samuel observes.

Immediate measures of success do include better results from students but what Pemimpin GSL is looking for is something a little different — teachers who are able to come up with localised and contextualised solutions for their students and school. “We lead them to a particular mindset” Samuel says. “One of the key things we do is teach these school leaders how to support teachers in the classrooms to be better educators — that’s what we work on.” One of many success stories that the duo share is a Tamil school headmistress whose sole objective was to help her teachers teach better in the classrooms and this resulted in a jump of pass rates from 2% to 48%.

These fellowships segue nicely into the Malaysia Teacher Prize as they can practice what they learnt during the sessions with Pemimpin GSL — there are different ones for school leaders and junior level teachers — and publish success stories through the platform of the nationwide competition.

There is a three-year plan in place for the Malaysia Teacher Prize depending on how things go this year. The target is 1000 applications this year 3000 next year and 5000 the following year. Each of the 10 finalists will also be recommended for the Global Teacher Prize and given the necessary support to put in their application.

“Teaching used to be considered a truly noble profession and it certainly still is but I think it has become apparent that even teachers need help” says Chew. “With that support they have proven what they can do — we are elevating not just the calibre of the teachers but also that of the public school system in the country. Teach for Malaysia started out with this objective and has made an impact. Young people now don’t aspire to be teachers which is not a desirable state of affairs — this is something we hope to reverse. In Finland for example the stature of teachers is so high. [Therefore] elevating the profession and making it one of choice is what [will] make our education system stronger.”

Although media headlines push the narrative that first-time workers are more likely to demand increased locational flexibility from their employers Gen Z employees may actually save the physical workplace.

A new poll from youth trend research firm Generation Lab reveals that 40% of college students and recent graduates prefer fully in-office work with 39% seeking hybrid positions and just 19% vouching for fully remote policies.

It's hard to get an accurate reading on how younger generations feel about the remote work versus office debate as data regarding Gen Z work is often contradictory. A similar survey by TenSpot a workforce engagement platform reports that 30% of Gen Z workers want to work remotely full-time as opposed to the 19% reported by Generation Lab. Meanwhile a study by SkyNova interviewing 1000 workers found that 47% of Gen Zers are seeking an in-person job.

Although numbers vary between polling platforms a general trend is easy to identify: the number of Gen Zers seeking fully in-person positions is overwhelmingly higher than other generations including notably their Baby Boomer counterparts. Indeed when comparing the generation just beginning to enter the workforce to the generation commencing their exit Baby Boomers are by far most likely to hold a pro-remote work stance.

SEE: Six ways to stay productive when working remote

This might seem counterintuitive as Gen Z born between 1997 and 2012 grew up during the rise of digital technology. Often referred to as 'iPad kids' this generation of digital natives is expected to be the most comfortable with the online nature of working from home.

However with its first members turning 25 in 2022 the eldest Gen Zers have only had a few years of 'regular' work experience prior to the beginning of the pandemic -- and many have solely experienced a hybrid or remote beginning to their careers. Without the introduction to and reinforcement of work norms that can be gained from working in a physical office Gen Zers report a dwindling sense of workplace community confusion over establishing mentorship and a lack of career development opportunities.

A survey by Axios shows that 66% of young respondents would prefer in-person feedback from their manager and 45% of respondents worry about maintaining a distraction-free workplace in a remote or hybrid future. As for the generations inbetween more than half of millennials and Gen Xers who are often juggling responsibilities such as childcare and taking care of the home prefer a hybrid or fully remote workstyle. Once again in keeping with trends Gen Zers are significantly more likely than Millennials and Gen Xers to champion an in-person workplace as reported by Eden a workplace management platform.

SEE: Remote workers want new benefits. This is how employers are responding

So what does this mean for employers attempting to accommodate their newest workers? Though it may make sense to assume these digital natives would enjoy the nature of remote work it is clear that Gen Z is craving human connection and a sense of direction in the workplace. Requiring everyone to be fully in-office may be a dramatic request but offering at least a portion of the physical workplace experience -- whether by implementing a hybrid work styles or making certain meetings and learning opportunities in-person -- will likely be greeted with enthusiasm by employees in their twenties.

A special report on the rise of ‘digital amnesia’,"Last week I missed a real-life meeting because I hadn’t set a reminder on my smartphone leaving someone I’d never met before alone in a café. But on the same day I remembered the name of the actor who played Will Smith’s aunt in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 1991 (Janet Hubert). Memory is weird unpredictable and neuroscientifically not yet entirely understood. When memory lapses like mine happen (which they do a lot) it feels both easy and logical to blame the technology we’ve so recently adopted. Does having more memory in our pockets mean there’s less in our heads? Am I losing my ability to remember things – from appointments to what I was about to do next – because I expect my phone to do it for me? Before smartphones our heads would have held a cache of phone numbers and our memories would contain a cognitive map built up over time which would allow us to navigate – for smartphone users that is no longer true.

Our brains and our smartphones form a complex web of interactions: the smartphonification of life has been rising since the mid 2000s but was accelerated by the pandemic as was internet use in general. Prolonged periods of stress isolation and exhaustion – common themes since March 2020 – are well known for their impact on memory. Of those surveyed by memory researcher Catherine Loveday in 2021 80% felt that their memories were worse than before the pandemic. We are – still – shattered not just by Covid-19 but also by the miserable national and global news cycle. Many of us self-soothe with distractions like social media. Meanwhile endless scrolling can at times create its own distress and phone notifications and self interrupting to check for them also seem to affect what how and if we remember.

So what happens when we outsource part of our memory to an external device? Does it enable us to squeeze more and more out of life because we aren’t as reliant on our fallible brains to cue things up for us? Are we so reliant on smartphones that they will ultimately change how our memories work (sometimes called digital amnesia)? Or do we just occasionally miss stuff when we don’t remember the reminders?

Endless scrolling can at times create its own distress and phone notifications seem to affect what we remember

Neuroscientists are divided. Chris Bird is professor of cognitive neuroscience in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex and runs research by the Episodic Memory Group. “We have always offloaded things into external devices like writing down notes and that’s enabled us to have more complex lives” he says. “I don’t have a problem with using external devices to augment our thought processes or memory processes. We’re doing it more but that frees up time to concentrate focus on and remember other things.” He thinks that the kind of things we use our phones to remember are for most human brains difficult to remember. “I take a photo of my parking ticket so I know when it runs out because it’s an arbitrary thing to remember. Our brains aren’t evolved to remember highly specific one-off things. Before we had devices you would have to make a quite an effort to remember the time you needed to be back at your car.”

Professor Oliver Hardt who studies the neurobiology of memory and forgetting at McGill University in Montreal is much more cautious. “Once you stop using your memory it will get worse which makes you use your devices even more” he says. “We use them for everything. If you go to a website for a recipe you press a button and it sends the ingredient list to your smartphone. It’s very convenient but convenience has a price. It’s good for you to do certain things in your head.”

Hardt is not keen on our reliance on GPS. “We can predict that prolonged use of GPS likely will reduce grey matter density in the hippocampus. Reduced grey matter density in this brain area goes along with a variety of symptoms such as increased risk for depression and other psychopathologies but also certain forms of dementia. GPS-based navigational systems don’t require you to form a complex geographic map. Instead they just tell you orientations like ‘Turn left at next light.’ These are very simple behavioural responses (here: turn left) at a certain stimulus (here: traffic light). These kinds of spatial behaviours do not engage the hippocampus very much unlike those spatial strategies that require the knowledge of a geographic map in which you can locate any point coming from any direction and which requires [cognitively] complex computations. When exploring the spatial capacities of people who have been using GPS for a very long time they show impairments in spatial memory abilities that require the hippocampus. Map reading is hard and that’s why we give it away to devices so easily. But hard things are good for you because they engage cognitive processes and brain structures that have other effects on your general cognitive functioning.”

Map reading is hard and that’s why we give it away to devices so easily. But hard things are good for you

Hardt doesn’t have data yet but believes “the cost of this might be an enormous increase in dementia. The less you use that mind of yours the less you use the systems that are responsible for complicated things like episodic memories or cognitive flexibility the more likely it is to develop dementia. There are studies showing that for example it is really hard to get dementia when you are a university professor and the reason is not that these people are smarter – it’s that until old age they are habitually engaged in tasks that are very mentally demanding.” (Other scientists disagree – Daniel Schacter a Harvard psychologist who wrote the seminal Seven Sins Of Memory: How The Mind Forgets and Remembers thinks effects from things like GPS are “task specific” only.)

While smartphones can obviously open up whole new vistas of knowledge they can also drag us away from the present moment like a beautiful day unexperienced because you’re head down WhatsApping. When we’re not attending to an experience we are less likely to recall it properly and fewer recalled experiences could even limit our capacity to have new ideas and being creative. As the renowned neuroscientist and memory researcher Wendy Suzuki recently put it on the Huberman Lab neuroscience podcast “If we can’t remember what we’ve done the information we’ve learned and the events of our lives it changes us… [The part of the brain which remembers] really defines our personal histories. It defines who we are.”

Catherine Price science writer and author of How to Break Up With Your Phone concurs. “What we pay attention to in the moment adds up to our life” she says. “Our brains cannot multitask. We think we can. But any moment where multitasking seems successful it’s because one of those tasks was not cognitively demanding like you can fold laundry and listen to the radio. If you’re paying attention to your phone you’re not paying attention to anything else. That might seem like a throwaway observation but it’s actually deeply profound. Because you will only remember the things you pay attention to. If you’re not paying attention you’re literally not going to have a memory of it to remember.”

If you’re not paying attention you’re literally not going to have a memory of it to remember

The Cambridge neuroscientist Barbara Sahakian has evidence of this too. “In an experiment in 2010 three different groups had to complete a reading task” she says. “One group got instant messaging before it started one got instant messaging during the task and one got no instant messaging and then there was a comprehension test. What they found was that the people getting instant messages couldn’t remember what they just read.”

Price is much more worried about what being perpetually distracted by our phones – termed “continual partial attention” by the tech expert Linda Stone – does to our memories than using their simpler functions. “I’m not getting distracted by my address book” she says. And she doesn’t believe smartphones free us up to do more. “Let’s be real with ourselves: how many of us are using the time afforded us by our banking app to write poetry? We just passively consume crap on Instagram.” Price is from Philadelphia. “What would have happened if Benjamin Franklin had had Twitter? Would he have been on Twitter all the time? Would he have made his inventions and breakthroughs?

“I became really interested in whether the constant distractions caused by our devices might be impacting our ability to actually not just accumulate memories to begin with but transfer them into long-term storage in a way that might impede our ability to think deep and interesting thoughts” she says. “One of the things that impedes our brain’s ability to transfer memories from short- to long-term storage is distraction. If you get distracted in the middle of it” – by a notification or by the overwhelming urge to pick up your phone – “you’re not actually going to have the physical changes take place that are required to store that memory.”

It’s impossible to know for sure because no one measured our level of intellectual creativity before smartphones took off but Price thinks smartphone over-use could be harming our ability to be insightful. “An insight is being able to connect two disparate things in your mind. But in order to have an insight and be creative you have to have a lot of raw material in your brain like you couldn’t cook a recipe if you didn’t have any ingredients: you can’t have an insight if you don’t have the material in your brain which really is long term memories.” (Her theory was backed by the 92-year-old Nobel prize-winning neuroscientist and biochemist Eric Kandel who has studied how distraction affects memory – Price bumped into him on a train and grilled him about her idea. “I’ve got a selfie of me with a giant grin and Eric looking a bit confused.”) Psychologist professor Larry Rosen co-author (with neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley) of The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World also agrees: “Constant distractions make it difficult to encode information in memory.”

You can’t have an insight if you don’t have the material in your brain

Smartphones are of course made to hijack our attention. “The apps that make money by taking our attention are designed to interrupt us” says Price. “I think of notifications as interruptions because that’s what they’re doing.”

For Oliver Hardt phones exploit our biology. “A human is a very vulnerable animal and the only reason we are not extinct is that we have a superior brain: to avoid predation and find food we have had to be really good at being attentive to our environment. Our attention can shift rapidly around and when it does everything else that was being attended to stops which is why we can’t multitask. When we focus on something it’s a survival mechanism: you’re in the savannah or the jungle and you hear a branch cracking you give your total attention to that – which is useful it causes a short stress reaction a slight arousal and activates the sympathetic nervous system. It optimises your cognitive abilities and sets the body up for fighting or flighting.” But it’s much less useful now. “Now 30000 years later we’re here with that exact brain” and every phone notification we hear is a twig snapping in the forest “simulating what was important to what we were: a frightened little animal.”

Smartphone use can even change the brain according to the ongoing ABCD study which is tracking over 10000 American children through to adulthood. “It started by examining 10-year-olds both with paper and pencil measures and an MRI and one of their most interesting early results was that there was a relationship between tech use and cortical thinning” says Larry Rosen who studies social media technology and the brain. “Young children who use more tech had a thinner cortex which is supposed to happen at an older age.” Cortical thinning is a normal part of growing up and then ageing and in much later life can be associated with degenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s as well as migraines.

Obviously the smartphone genie is out of the bottle and has run over the hills and far away. We need our smartphones to access offices attend events pay for travel and to function as tickets passes and credit cards as well as for emails calls and messages. It’s very hard not to have one. If we’re worried about what they – or the apps on them – might be doing to our memories what should we do?

Rosen discusses a number of tactics in his book. “My favourites are tech breaks” he says “where you start by doing whatever on your devices for one minute and then set an alarm for 15 minutes time. Silence your phone and place it upside down but within your view as a stimulus to tell your brain that you will have another one-minute tech break after the 15-minute alarm. Continue until you adapt to 15 minutes focus time and then increase to 20. If you can get to 60 minutes of focus time with short tech breaks before and after that’s a success.”

“If you think your memory and focus have got worse and you’re blaming things like your age your job or your kids that might be true but it’s also very likely due to the way you’re interacting with your devices” says Price who founded Screen/Life Balance to help people manage their phone use. As a science writer she’s “very much into randomly controlled trials but with phones it’s actually more of a qualitative question about personally how it’s impacting you. And it’s really easy to do your own experiment and see if it makes a difference. It’s great to have scientific evidence. But we can also intuitively know: if you practice keeping your phone away more and you notice that you feel calmer and you’re remembering more then you’ve answered your own question.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9lZGl0b3JpYWwtYW1hem9uLWtpbmRsZS1vYXNpcy1iZXN0LWV2ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why I spent $350 on an Amazon Kindle e-reader twice and would do so a third time,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9lZGl0b3JpYWwtYW1hem9uLWtpbmRsZS1vYXNpcy1iZXN0LWV2ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Canley the fourth ship for the U.S. Navy’s Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) program on Saturday June 25 at its Barrio Logan shipyard.

ESB ships are highly flexible platforms designed to support multiple maritime-based missions including Air Mine Counter Measures Special Operations Forces and limited crisis response. Acting as a mobile sea base this 784-foot ship has a 52000 square-foot flight deck to support aircraft operations. The four spots on the ship’s flight deck can accommodate MH-60 Seahawk helicopters as well as MH-53 helicopters H-1 helicopters and MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft.

The ships have sleeping spaces for 250 military personnel in addition to members of the crew. The Military Sealift Command operates the ships.

Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Michael E. Langley served as the principal speaker at the ceremony in addition to remarks from NASSCO U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps representatives. Following remarks Patricia A. Sargent the ship’s sponsor and daughter of the ship’s namesake christened the ship by breaking a bottle of sparkling wine alongside the hull.

“Today we celebrate and honor a true hero Sgt. Maj. Canley. This ship represents his courage selflessness and strength” said Dave Carver president of General Dynamics NASSCO. “On behalf of the 3500 men and women of General Dynamics NASSCO I am proud to present the USNS John L. Canley for christening.”

In 2020 Kenneth J. Braithwaite then Secretary of the Navy declared that the fourth ship in the ESB program be named after Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Maj. John L. Canley. Canley rescued more than 20 fellow Marines under enemy fire in Vietnam during the Battle of Hu City in 1968. In addition to the Medal of Honor the nation’s highest honor Canley receive the Bronze Star with Combat “V” and the Purple Heart.

The USNS Robert E. Simanek the fifth ship in the ESB program is currently under construction. The first three ships in the ESB program – USS Lewis B. Puller USS Hershel “Woody” Williams and USS Miguel Keith – have been delivered to the Navy.

General Dynamics NASSCO is also building a series of fleet replenishment oilers for the Navy. In addition it is one of several shipyards in the Port of San Diego that repairs Navy ships.

A-10C Thunderbolt II aircraft conduct Highway and Dirt Road landings in exercises Northern Agility and Agile Rage.

On June 29 United States Air National Guard (ANG) A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft from the 107th Fighter Squadron nicknamed the “Red Devils” Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) MC-12W C-145A and U-28A aircraft along with a C-146A aircraft from the Air Force Reserves made history by conducting landing taking off and performing Integrated Combat Turns (ICTs) on a closed 9000-foot section of Michigan highway M-28.

The temporary landing zone is one of several progressive training scenarios held this week under the Michigan Air National Guard’s exercise Northern Agility 22-1 in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. This is the first time that ICTs which enable the quick rearming and refueling of a running jet have ever been conducted on a public highway in the U.S.

Northern Agility 22-1 demonstrates the U.S. Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment doctrine which is about being ready to execute missions quickly in unpredictable ways and operating from austere airfields. The landing zone was named “Hawk LZ” in honor of F-16 pilot Maj. Durwood “Hawk” Jones from the Wisconsin ANG’s 115th Fighter Wing who lost his life in a training accident in Michigan in 2020.

“Northern Agility 22-1 is an historic exercise that supports the Air Force’s directive to ‘accelerate change or lose’ as well as the ability of our Airmen to generate combat power anytime anywhere.” said Brig. Gen. Bryan Teff assistant adjutant general and commander of the Michigan Air National Guard.

“Michigan is a champion for Agile Combat Employment so when it comes to leveraging our state’s unique partnerships training environment and resources to ensure the Joint Force stays one step ahead of our adversaries today was a huge success.”

Staging and additional training activities for contested logistics sustainment and multi-capable Airmen concepts are being held this week at other locations in Alger County including Sawyer International Airport and Hanley Field Alger County’s local airport.

Participating units include AFSOC’s 1st Special Operations Group Hurlburt Field Florida and 6th Special Operations Squadron Duke Field Florida; the Air Force Reserve’s 119th Special Operations Wing Duke Field; the Michigan ANG’s 127th Wing Selfridge ANG Base; the Oklahoma ANG’s 137th Special Operations Wing Will Rogers ANG Base; and the Maryland ANG’s 175th Fighter Wing Warfield ANG Base.

Additionally an MQ-9 Reaper from the North Dakota ANG’s 119th Wing Fargo ANG Base crewed by Airmen from the Michigan ANG’s 110th Wing Battle Creek ANG Base was also involved.

“Northern Agility 22-1 would not be possible without the long-term partnerships that exist between the Michigan National Guard and the Michigan State Police Michigan Dept. of Transportation Alger County Sheriff’s Office and of course support from our neighbors in the Upper Peninsula” said Lt. Col. Brian Wyrzykowski lead operations planner for Northern Agility 22-1.

“We see exercises like this as an investment in the U.P. that are critical to the state’s future economic success. Beyond that this is an extraordinary training opportunity for our Airmen delivered by the unwavering support of patriotic Michiganders.”

Meanwhile earlier in June A-10’s from the 190th Fighter Squadron nicknamed the “Skull Bangers” participated in austere field training at Fort McCoy. Eight A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft from the 190th arrived at the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC) in Alpena Michigan on June 4 2022.

The aircraft and Airmen from the Idaho Air National Guard participated in Agile Rage ’22 which is a National Guard Bureau-led exercise held at the Alpena CRTC part of the National All-Domain Warfighting Center. Agile Rage ’22 provided realistic training opportunities mimicking current and future combat environments dictated by the National Defense Strategy.

“Agile Rage 22 brought together multiple ANG capabilities from across the nation to test the performance of their Multi-Capable Airmen in a highly contested environment” said Major. Garett Ruby Agile Rage 22 exercise director. “Through Agile Rage 22 the ANG is developing and validating tactics techniques and procedures for the future war fight including distributed and austere air-to-ground strike capabilities for large-scale combat operations.”

The A-10 Thunderbolt II Pilots received Unprepared Surface Landing (USL) certification and Controllers on the ground from the 260th Air Traffic Control Squadron having received certification by gaining currency in operating from austere environments with training being conducted at the Young Landing Zone at Fort McCoy Wisconsin.

“Agile Rage is one of the first exercises that we’ve done where we’re executing the Agile Combat Employment mission” said Major. Michael Gillis officer in charge of the 124th Maintenance Squadron. “We’re going to be operating out of the CRTC and sending aircraft from here down to Volk Field Wisconsin and back.”

Northern Michigan’s National All-Domain Warfighting Center was selected as the site for Agile Rage ’22 because of its unique training airspace and facilities (Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center and Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training Center). The NADWC encompasses more than 148000 acres of ground maneuver training area and more than 17000 square miles of special use airspace one of the largest areas of its kind in the U.S.

As the war in Ukraine has highlighted the first targets that were selected by Russian forces of strategic importance to nullify was to destroy or capture airfields Ukrainian aircraft could operate from its obvious that the forward thinking UkAF have countered on this tactics and adjusted and have thus moved aircraft around to keep the Russians second guessing where the UkAF aircraft are operating from.

As such nations are getting a reminder in the use of austere field environments to base aircraft operations during combat operations. The purpose of this mission in Agile Rage is to increase unit ACE readiness which is a proactive and reactive operational scheme of manoeuvre to increase survivability while generating combat power.

This new paradigm depends heavily on training Airmen to be multi-capable who can operate in austere locations and respond quickly and create opportunities for ANG assets to integrate with joint assets in a full-spectrum combat environment.

“The primary goal here is training – training for that next fight” said Gillis. “The fight we’ve been in for the last 20 years could be completely different from our next fight so this training gives us a glimpse into how we could operate in that new environment.”

Exercise participants conducted numerous mission-essential tasks during Agile Rage ’22 including joint intelligence operations airspace control search and rescue coordination intra-theater airlift joint fires close air support interdiction of enemy capabilities and ACE.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzZW56YS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy91a3JhaW5lLWlzLXRoZS1sYXRlc3QtbmVvY29uLWRpc2FzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ukraine Is the Latest Neocon Disaster,"This post is also available in: French

The war in Ukraine is the culmination of a 30-year project of the American neoconservative movement. The Biden Administration is packed with the same neocons who championed the US wars of choice in Serbia (1999) Afghanistan (2001) Iraq (2003) Syria (2011) Libya (2011) and who did so much to provoke Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The neocon track record is one of unmitigated disaster yet Biden has staffed his team with neocons. As a result Biden is steering Ukraine the US and the European Union towards yet another geopolitical debacle. If Europe has any insight it will separate itself from these US foreign policy debacles.

By Jeffrey D. Sachs

The neocon movement emerged in the 1970s around a group of public intellectuals several of whom were influenced by University of Chicago political scientist Leo Strauss and Yale University classicist Donald Kagan. Neocon leaders included Norman Podhoretz Irving Kristol Paul Wolfowitz Robert Kagan (son of Donald) Frederick Kagan (son of Donald) Victoria Nuland (wife of Robert) Elliott Cohen Elliott Abrams and Kimberley Allen Kagan (wife of Frederick).

The main message of the neocons is that the US must predominate in military power in every region of the world and must confront rising regional powers that could someday challenge US global or regional dominance most important Russia and China. For this purpose US military force should be pre-positioned in hundreds of military bases around the world and the US should be prepared to lead wars of choice as necessary. The United Nations is to be used by the US only when useful for US purposes.

This approach was spelled out first by Paul Wolfowitz in his draft Defense Policy Guidance (DPG) written for the Department of Defense in 2002. The draft called for extending the US-led security network to the Central and Eastern Europe despite the explicit promise by German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in 1990 that German unification would not be followed by NATO’s eastward enlargement. Wolfowitz also made the case for American wars of choice defending America’s right to act independently even alone in response to crises of concern to the US. According to General Wesley Clark Wolfowitz already made clear to Clark in May 1991 that the US would lead regime-change operations in Iraq Syria and other former Soviet allies.

The neocons championed NATO enlargement to Ukraine even before that became official US policy under George W. Bush Jr. in 2008. They viewed Ukraine’s NATO membership as key to US regional and global dominance. Robert Kagan spelled out the neocon case for NATO enlargement in April 2006:

[T]he Russians and Chinese see nothing natural in [the “color revolutions” of the former Soviet Union] only Western-backed coups designed to advance Western influence in strategically vital parts of the world. Are they so wrong? Might not the successful liberalization of Ukraine urged and supported by the Western democracies be but the prelude to the incorporation of that nation into NATO and the European Union — in short the expansion of Western liberal hegemony?

Kagan acknowledged the dire implication of NATO enlargement. He quotes one expert as saying “the Kremlin is getting ready for the ‘battle for Ukraine’ in all seriousness.” The neocons sought this battle. After the fall of the Soviet Union both the US and Russia should have sought a neutral Ukraine as a prudent buffer and safety valve. Instead the neocons wanted US “hegemony” while the Russians took up the battle partly in defense and partly out of their own imperial pretentions as well. Shades of the Crimean War (1853-6) when Britain and France sought to weaken Russia in the Black Sea following Russian pressures on the Ottoman empire.

Kagan penned the article as a private citizen while his wife Victoria Nuland was the US Ambassador to NATO under George W. Bush Jr. Nuland has been the neocon operative par excellence. In addition to serving as Bush’s Ambassador to NATO Nuland was Barack Obama’s Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs during 2013-17 where she participated in the overthrow of Ukraine’s pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and now serves as Biden’s Undersecretary of State guiding US policy vis-à-vis the war in Ukraine.

The neocon outlook is based on an overriding false premise: that the US military financial technological and economic superiority enables it to dictate terms in all regions of the world. It is a position of both remarkable hubris and remarkable disdain of evidence. Since the 1950s the US has been stymied or defeated in nearly every regional conflict in which it has participated. Yet in the “battle for Ukraine” the neocons were ready to provoke a military confrontation with Russia by expanding NATO over Russia’s vehement objections because they fervently believe that Russia will be defeated by US financial sanctions and NATO weaponry.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) a neocon think-tank led by Kimberley Allen Kagan (and backed by a who’s who of defense contractors such as General Dynamics and Raytheon) continues to promise a Ukrainian victory. Regarding Russia’s advances the ISW offered a typical comment: “[R]egardless of which side holds the city [of Sievierodonetsk] the Russian offensive at the operational and strategic levels will probably have culminated giving Ukraine the chance to restart its operational-level counteroffensives to push Russian forces back.”

The facts on the ground however suggest otherwise. The West’s economic sanctions have had little adverse impact on Russia while their “boomerang” effect on the rest of the world has been large. Moreover the US capacity to resupply Ukraine with ammunition and weaponry is seriously hamstrung by America’s limited production capacity and broken supply chains. Russia’s industrial capacity of course dwarfs that of Ukraine’s. Russia’s GDP was roughly 10X that of Ukraine before war and Ukraine has now lost much of its industrial capacity in the war.

The most likely outcome of the current fighting is that Russia will conquer a large swath of Ukraine perhaps leaving Ukraine landlocked or nearly so. Frustration will rise in Europe and the US with the military losses and the stagflationary consequences of war and sanctions. The knock-on effects could be devastating if a right-wing demagogue in the US rises to power (or in the case of Trump returns to power) promising to restore America’s faded military glory through dangerous escalation.

Instead of risking this disaster the real solution is to end the neocon fantasies of the past 30 years and for Ukraine and Russia to return to the negotiating table with NATO committing to end its commitment to the eastward enlargement to Ukraine and Georgia in return for a viable peace that respects and protects Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

By Ndahi Marama Maiduguri

The Court of Appeal Sitting in Gombe on Friday sentenced Ma’aji Shettima Arfo the former General Manager of Maiduguri Flour Mills to 7 years imprisonment for allegedly stealing millions of Naira belonging to the Borno State Government and the Flour mills of Nigeria while he was the General manager of limited liability company.

Recalled that the Borno State High Court sitting in Maiduguri last year precisely in November 2021 sentenced the civil servant Ma’aji Arfo to 28 years imprisonment for engaging in an N86.1 million contract fraud.

Arfo who was sentenced to jail by Justice Haruna Mshellia of Borno State High Court 3 when he was the General Manager of the state-owned Maiduguri Flour Mills Limited where he committed the fraud.

He was charged on a six-count by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission for offences bordering on abuse of office and conferring undue advantage on himself.

The charge sheet showed that Arfo while acting as the General Manager of the Flour Mill between 2014 and 2020 engaged in multiple fraud in violation of Sections 12 and 19 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2000 punishable under relevant sections of the same Act.

One of the counts on which he was convicted revealed that he awarded multiple contracts to Falkwat Multilinks Limited a private company where he was a director to supply diesel and maize to Maiduguri Flour Mills.

Meanwhile his appeal hit a brick wall because ain a unanimous judgement yesterday the court found Arfo guilty of all the charges against him and held his appeal to be unmeritorious.",,,,,,

On the positive side the volume and market share increased sequentially for the third consecutive quarter.

The number includes 387582 Chevrolet vehicles (down 10.5% year-over-year) and 132055 GMC (down 13.7%).

The two brands sold in the US a total of 7217 plug-in electric vehicles (over 7300 including BrightDrop Zevo 600) which is 36% less than a year ago and represents about 1.2% of the total GM's volume.

While GM's EV sales remain lower than they should be it's rebounding and ramping up so we expect nothing but better results every quarter.

In the long term the plan is to increase EV sales in North America to more than 1 million by the end of 2025.

General Motors says that Cadillac Lyriq production is accelerating (it started in March) ""with initial deliveries in process"". The ramp-up will continue in the second half of 2022.

Another positive sign is that Ultium Cells (a joint venture with LG Energy Solution) ""begins producing cells in Ohio to support expanded EV manufacturing starting in August"".

It means that soon GM should have a strong stream of Ultium batteries to support the rollout of new Ultium-based EVs including GMC Hummer EV Pickup Cadillac Lyriq and BrightDrop Zevo 600.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9nbXMtbmV3LWFwcC13aWxsLW1ha2UtY2hhcmdpbmctYXMtZWFzeS1hcy1nZXR0aW5nLWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM's New App Will Make Charging As Easy As Getting Gas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9nbXMtbmV3LWFwcC13aWxsLW1ha2UtY2hhcmdpbmctYXMtZWFzeS1hcy1nZXR0aW5nLWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wNy9nbWMtaHVtbWVyLWV2LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tdG8taW5jcmVhc2UtaW4tc2Vjb25kLWhhbGYtb2YtMjAyMi_SAWVodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMDcvZ21jLWh1bW1lci1ldi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXRvLWluY3JlYXNlLWluLXNlY29uZC1oYWxmLW9mLTIwMjIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GMC Hummer EV Production To Increase In Second Half Of 2022,"Production of the GMC Hummer EV Pickup began at the GM Factory Zero plant late last year but with this being a relatively advanced vehicle GM has not rushed itself in ramping up production of the truck. It will soon begin producing the GMC Hummer EV at a more rapid rate though with the company set to increase production at Factory Zero in the second half of 2022.

In its second-quarter earnings report published Friday GM indicated that it would increase production of the GMC Hummer EV at Factory Zero in the second of this year after it delivered just 99 units of the “electric supertruck” in Q1 and 272 units in Q2 for a total of 371 units in the first six months of 2022.

GM said earlier this year that it had received more than 70000 pre-orders for the GMC Hummer EV across both the Pickup and SUV model variants. GM said previously that it planned to produce roughly 23000 examples of the GMC Hummer EV Pickup at Factory Zero this year meaning the vast majority of vehicles produced there in 2022 will be built over the next six months.

GM said previously that it expects the GMC Hummer EV SUV to outsell the Hummer EV Pickup with the SUV expected to account for roughly 60 percent of Hummer EV sales and the pickup taking the remaining 40 percent. The 2024 GMC Hummer EV SUV will be built alongside the pickup at Factory Zero however it won’t enter production until next year. Roughly 75 percent of the people that have reserved a GMC Hummer EV are new to the GMC brand the automaker recently revealed while about 70 percent of these reservation holders say they are s first time EV buyer as well.

So far the only GMC Hummer EV Pickup units that have been built are of the range-topping Edition 1. Less well-equipped versions of the Hummer EV Pickup will begin to hit the market once production of the Edition 1 concludes starting with the EV3X this fall the EV2X in the spring of 2023 and the entry-level EV2 in early 2024.

General Motors Co surpassed Toyota Motor Corp in second-quarter U.S. car sales data on Friday showed even as persistent chip shortages and supply chain disruptions crimped automakers' ability to meet pent-up demand.GM which lost its crown as the U.S. sales leader last year for the first time since 1931 to Toyota said it sold 582401 vehicles in the quarter through June 15% lower than a year earlier.Toyota which has been one of the worst hit automakers this year from supply chain disruptions and China's COVID-19 lockdowns sold 531105 vehicles down 22%.The U.S. auto industry is struggling to keep up with pent-up consumer demand for new cars.This was again evident on Friday when GM said it had nearly 100000 vehicles waiting for more parts which forced it to offer a weak second-quarter profit forecast.""Second-quarter vehicle wholesale volumes were impacted by the ongoing semiconductor supply shortage and other supply chain disruptions mostly in June"" GM said.The Detroit automaker however kept its full-year profit outlook as it expects to sell those vehicles to dealers before the year-end.The company expects second-quarter net income of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion below analysts' expectations of $2.56 billion as per Refinitiv data.GM sold over 7300 electric vehicles in the quarter including the GMC Hummer pickup truck whose production is set to gradually rise in the second half.The company is expected to sell the most new vehicles in the quarter according to Cox Automotive as industry-wide disruptions crimp inventory at other major automakers.South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co reported quarterly sales of 184191 vehicles down 23%.Ford Motor Co which reports on Tuesday is expected to post a rise in quarterly sales as it has managed its inventories better than most others and is also recovering from last year's struggles as per Cox Automotive.Tesla Inc will be the only major brand to increase sales in the first half of the year Cox added.U.S. new-vehicle sales in June finished at 1.13 million units with an annual sales rate of 13 million according to Wards Intelligence data.Industry observers are concerned about the potential impact of a multi-decade high inflation and rising gas prices on the auto industry though they point out that demand remains strong at present an unusual situation.A bigger impediment to increasing auto sales at present still appears to be industry-wide shortages of cars and trucks which have led to analysts cutting their full-year sales forecasts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hNDA0OTIyMDAvZ20tZXYtZW1lcmdlbmN5LXRyYWluaW5nLWZpcnN0LXJlc3BvbmRlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Expands EV Emergency Training for First Responders,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a40492200/gm-ev-emergency-training-first-responders/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hNDA0OTIyMDAvZ20tZXYtZW1lcmdlbmN5LXRyYWluaW5nLWZpcnN0LXJlc3BvbmRlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

“Users can now enjoy a user-friendly experience and purchase crypto with one of the lowest payment fees and success rate. In addition the instant transaction offers both speed and convenience to users” the company said in its update.

MEXC Global stated in a post on its Telegram account that the cryptocurrency purchases with Visa and Mastercard will be possible in 180 countries with a cap of $5000.

Anthony Guo head of payment at MEXC Global said in a news release that company took the step of allowing Visa and Mastercard purchases to simplify transactions for customers.

“By enabling crypto purchase through Visa and Mastercard directly MEXC Global is delivering a faster simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier for users to convert fiat into crypto assets which opens up the ownership of cryptocurrency to millions of people where bank card is the dominant medium of transaction” he said according to a CoinRivet report Sunday (July 3).

On its website MEXC Global formerly known as MXC Exchange described itself as “the exchange of high performance and mega transaction matching technology.”

The company which was founded in 2018 said that it has more than 6 million users in more than 200 countries. The company is licensed in Australia Estonia and the United States and MEXC Global said its system can handle 1.4 million transactions per second.

According to the Head of Payment at MEXC Global Anthony Guo the decision is because they want to simplify and create a “connected user experience”.

“By enabling crypto purchase through Visa and MasterCard directly MEXC Global is delivering a faster simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier for users to convert fiat into crypto assets which opens up the ownership of cryptocurrency to millions of people where bank card is the dominant medium of transaction.”

MEXC Global is actively opening up more channels for fiat holders to acquire their favorite crypto assets using an easy-to-use and familiar payment method they are comfortable with. Despite the explosion of crypto and blockchain-enabled payment and remittance ramps Visa MasterCard and other traditional payment options are used by fiat holders spread across the globe.

These payment processors have refined their operations over the years. Notably they have a more robust global network of partners primarily financial institutions. On the other hand crypto solutions are still being developed and lagging. MEXC Global is filling this gap by linking the crypto and fiat worlds to fast-track the adoption of digital assets. This specifically considers the massive cost benefits associated with digital asset infrastructure.

MEXC Global and its newfound partners MasterCard and Visa realize what’s at stake. They are now committing to driving crypto adoption in a win-win arrangement. While MEXC Global will increase its user base and Visa and MasterCard profit from fees end-users on the other hand can quickly shuttle between the fiat and crypto worlds without necessarily learning or familiarizing themselves with complex systems.

The partnership follows the successful launch of the Global Bank Transfer Program that allows MEXC Global clients in Europe and the U.S. to deposit and withdraw using SWIFT and FedWire networks. Users who purchase crypto through the program also don’t pay trading fees.

MEXC Global has also launched an OTC payment service and activated P2P trading.

When the OPEC-led oil price shocks hit the global economy in the 1970s balance of payments in many Latin American countries deteriorated. US money-center banks encouraged by the US government stepped in to lend vast sums to the tune of $327 billion to Latin American countries struggling with trade deficits. This only set them up for another shock: Steep rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve starting in 1979 to “slay the inflation dragon” ended in loan defaults and a “lost decade” on the continent owing to rising unemployment rates declining per capita incomes and stagnant or negative growth rates.

The sensitivity of poor countries to dynamics beyond their control is perhaps nowhere clearer than in international finance. Financial liberalization preached by the IMF in the 1970s and 1980s enforced through conditional lending ushered in an era of financial instability in the 1990s. The more industrialized countries in the Global South (let’s call them emerging capitalist economies ECEs) began to experience financial crises thanks to volatile short-term capital flows. The ability of international investors to withdraw capital on a whim had devastating consequences on domestic economies as was seen in the 1994 Mexican peso crisis and 1997 Asian financial crisis. These crises produced deep and prolonged downturns in the real economy: In Mexico real GDP fell between 1994 and 1995 with the unemployment rate settling at three to six percentage points higher than the previous year. In East Asia average annual GDP growth fell by over 50 percent in Indonesia and Thailand and by over 40 percent in Malaysia and South Korea.

Against this background financial stability – via currency stability – has become an important often an overriding policy objective in ECEs. But such policy prioritization comes at a cost. Not only does it elevate technocratic institutions like the central bank to a position of power it also subordinates democratically-determined objectives like social welfare high employment and fair wages to the interests of a globalized capitalist class. More broadly the prominence of a financial stability objective indicates the acceptance of a deeply problematic status quo in international monetary arrangements that places countries of the Global South in a structurally subordinate position.

Central Banks and Financial Stability

In a global financial system characterized by liquidity tsunamis the problem of maintaining stability presented itself with new urgency. But how to achieve this in an era of capital mobility and floating exchange rates? The answer: stockpile vast amounts of international reserves as insurance against future crises (Feldstein 1999). Reserve accumulation which is the purchase of hard currency usually in the form of US dollar Treasury securities allows ECE central banks to lean against the direction of rapid currency movements. So for example when a currency is in free fall thanks to investors pulling out the central bank uses reserves to push up the “price” of its currency vis-à-vis the US dollar. Of course holding reserves is nothing new but in an era of rapid global financial integration the level of reserves central banks held increased exponentially. The rate at which ECE central banks accumulated reserves prompted one observer to mark it as “one of the most robust empirical regularities in modern international economics” (Landau 2014).

When the 2008 global financial crisis hit and financial markets were roiling in core economies ECEs showed remarkable resiliency thanks to their stockpiles of international reserves. Similarly during the 2013 “taper tantrum” countries averted financial crises by intervening heavily in forex markets (Eichengreen and Gupta 2014). In the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic ECE central banks once again pumped a massive volume of reserves into forex markets to keep exchange rate volatility in check. The popularity of active reserve accumulation as a bulwark against financial crises notwithstanding this tool alone has not been sufficient to deliver financial stability in the South. In addition to intervening heavily in forex markets ECE central banks like their counterparts in rich economies also made large domestic asset purchases in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Central Banking and Development

The above summary of central bank activities suggests financial stability to be the primary goal of central banking. However central banking was not always defined by a stability mandate in the Global South. In fact when central banks came into their own in the postwar era they privileged credit intermediation over conventional central bank goals such as price stability or external balance. This was in part a reflection of historical circumstances. Colonies and newly independent nations lacked the kind of financial infrastructure that could nurture domestic industries; colonial financial infrastructure promoted trade over industry creating “trading economies” that facilitated the export of raw materials to the metropolis and the importation of finished goods to the satellites (Koddenbrock Kvangraven and Sylla 2020).

Imperial powers tightly controlled credit in the colonies. While the colonies often had visually distinct currencies backed by their own reserves their hands were tied when it came to expanding the money supply: the currency of the colonies was held at parity with and readily convertible to the currency of the ruling power. The problems that colonies faced thanks to this restrictive monetary environment were acute. As primarily agricultural economies with seasonal fluctuations elasticity and mobility in currency and credit were paramount for trade and commerce to thrive (Hopkins 1970). And yet that was exactly what colonial monetary arrangements denied. The overarching goal of imperial powers was to facilitate world commerce by ensuring that currencies of the colonies were compatible with the gold or gold-exchange standard that guided international payments in the 1800s and the early 1900s.

Underdeveloped or fragmented credit structures in the colonies and in the periphery resulted in insufficient and expensive credit. The first task for central banks was then to build national banking systems that would ease credit into growing sectors. But conventional tools for credit expansion were off the table; the interest rate structure in these countries remained largely unintegrated which meant that interest rates in the broader economy were relatively insensitive to adjustments by the central bank (Bloomfield 1957). To influence the volume and direction of credit central banks had to go beyond interest rate adjustments to increasing the availability of credit. In fact in many countries central banks took on the role of direct credit provision. In India for example the 1934 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act called on RBI to study problems of agricultural credit to coordinate with provincial co-operative banks and to create a special Agricultural Credit Department to ease credit conditions in the agricultural sector. While the Agricultural Credit Department was set up in 1935 upon the inauguration of the Bank RBI’s involvement in agricultural finance did not take off until the mid 1950s (RBI 1998). By 1954 RBI was making medium-term credit available by rediscounting bills and advancing loans for periods up to five years for agricultural purposes. RBI was also heavily involved in industry financing in the 1960s. Such practices rendered central banks key institutions of development supplying credit where needed and ensuring an effective payments system to facilitate commerce. In this early period then central banks were protagonists of development a far cry from the purveyors of financial stability that they are now.

The development mandate of central banks fell by the wayside with the end of the Bretton Woods monetary system in the 1970s. Tradeoffs between developmental goals and financial deepening argued policymakers were too hefty; Non-performing loans destabilized the financial system and the allocation of credit created inflationary pressures (Chandavarkar 1990). According to the World Bank’s 1989 World Development Report directed credit programs “damaged financial systems” (WB 1989). Monetary interventions celebrated in the 1950s and 1960s as a necessary developmental tool in the context of financial underdevelopment (Bloomfield 1957; Brimmer 1971) came to be disavowed as “financial repression” in the 1980s. In this context policymakers no longer assumed a positive link between directed credit and economic growth and measured performance based more on the development of financial markets and less on macroeconomic indicators.

Notwithstanding differences in the level of industrialization economic diversification and credit systems between the industrialized North and the fledgling South the neoliberal revolution was successful in rallying peripheral central banks around the twin goals of external balance (balance of trade) and internal stability (internal supply of money). The neoliberal agenda advocated a monetary regime fixated on stabilizing inflation by cutting government spending privatizing state resources and liberalizing trade and financial accounts. This was also referred to as the holy trinity of the notorious “Washington Consensus” (see Williamson 1993). Thus the scale tipped from developmentalism to price stability (inflation-targeting) and financial stability (minimizing volatility in the exchange rate).

Instead of facilitating long-term credit to productive sectors the goal now was to provide liquidity to the financial system so as to ease market transactions for investors. In today’s complex financial system liquidity is king. Central banks in rich economies provide liquidity to maintain the “plumbing of finance” (Braun and Gabor 2019) while in ECEs central banks do so to ensure that global investors (whether foreign or domestic) can enter and exit ECE assets without fear of a currency slide or inflation. The resources that ECE central banks pour into reserve accumulation the opportunity cost of holding low-yielding securities between 1–3 per cent of GDP (Rodrik 2006; Gallagher and Shrestha 2012) and the cost of sterilizing reserve purchases are significant. As I demonstrate in my own work central banks in the Global South have become more concerned with de-risking crossborder transactions for investors than facilitating genuine development. Credit intermediation which ought to be the primary goal of a financial system has come to be replaced by the more immediate and short-term objective of liquidity provision that ensures financial gains for investors (Musthaq 2021).

The evolving mandates of central banks and the costs that ECEs incur in maintaining access to international capital markets are important subjects of study but they need to be supplemented with critical inquiries into the broader monetary and financial arrangements within which central banks are embedded. The recent literature on “subordinate financialization” pays heed to these dynamics (Powell 2013; Kaltenbrunner and Painceira 2018; Bonizzi Kaltenbrunner and Powell 2019). Given the hierarchy in the international monetary system ECE central banks and much less their counterparts in poorer countries have little latitude in changing the current course (of privileging a financial stability mandate over credit provision) in any meaningful way. Add to this the fact that central banking is largely organized around preserving whatever system is in place and designed to adapt only to financial innovations and not to democratic mandates. In order to understand the limitations and possibilities for the Global South the ways in which historical legacies and structural arrangements condition the path to economic prosperity must be made clear.

The International Monetary System and Development

In today’s development discourse two policy prescriptions have gained axiomatic status: good governance and private finance. Underlying these prescriptions is an assumption that poor countries remain so because of causes internal to it such as political failures and bad economics. Thus to unlock development potential all policy elites had to do was create an environment that enforced the rule of law and property rights which would draw in foreign investors bringing in the much-needed resources for development.

This neoliberal approach to development which focuses almost exclusively on the agency and rationality of the immediate actors involved would have deeply offended the intellectuals policy elites and politicians of the Third World who led the development agenda from the 1950s through the 1980s. For intellectuals like Raúl Prebisch and politicians like Julius Nyerere of Tanzania the problem of development was not internal but structural. Dependency theorists have long reminded us that former colonies and peripheral countries are integrated into the global economy on uneven terms and serve as hinterlands for resource extraction. Poor countries export primary commodities whose prices are volatile whilst importing value-added manufactured products from the core that manifests in a perpetual balance of payments deficit. To sustain trade peripheral countries end up importing capital at considerable cost from the core which then ensnares them in a debt trap.

While dependency theory went out of vogue in the 1980s it has continued to provide inspiration for new research agendas in development. A recent project in this regard is Isabella M. Weber’s work on productive capabilities. Drawing on a new global commodity-level export database Weber and her co-authors find that a country’s initial productive capabilities (defined as production activities validated in market exchange) have a bearing on its current performance that is productive capabilities are path-dependent. Thus countries’ productive capabilities at the turn of the 20th century are a significant predictor of their income levels today (Weber et al. 2021). In their words: “Rather than catching up to high-value exporters countries that started off as raw material exporters are likely to maintain low productive capabilities in the long run. On the other hand early industrializers are expected to remain at the top of the global productive capabilities hierarchy” (Weber 2021).

Another important structural factor is the international monetary system that governs how countries settle their commercial and financial debts with one another. The impact of international monetary arrangements on development outcomes has long been recognized and in fact constituted the target of critical inquiry and policy reform in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1980 Arusha Initiative a document penned by participants at the South-North conference held in Arusha Tanzania in June/July 1980 effectively summarized the Third World’s position on monetary arrangements. What inspired the conference was disillusionment with the IMF’s engagement with Third World nations specifically Jamaica and Tanzania. IMF assistance to Jamaica in the mid 1970s to address its external payments crisis resulted in the Jamaican government undertaking severe structural adjustments that did little to address the country’s economic woes. In Tanzania President Nyerere rejected IMF’s assistance in 1979 primarily owing to the demand by the IMF to devalue the national currency. He called the IMF an “International Ministry of Finance” that sought to take away policy determination from newly sovereign countries (Nyerere 1980).

Participants at the conference levied a blistering critique of the IMF. They challenged the notion that the IMF was a “neutral” “objective” and “scientific” institution (The Arusha Initative 1980). The IMF was not neutral because it rejected alternative development models; the only legitimate model for it was market-based. The IMF was not objective because it failed to treat all countries equally. Those who were in geopolitically stronger positions received favorable treatment whether or not they abided by the Fund’s rule. A case in point was the US which ran a balance of payments deficit and yet escaped admonishment by the IMF the very same institution that sternly rebuked and withheld assistance to Third World nations for the same reason.

Finally the IMF was not scientific because of its “unscientific” treatment of trade imbalances. Participants challenged the IMF’s position that trade deficits were a temporary phenomenon that could be corrected with short-term liquidity infusions. Instead Arusha participants saw trade deficits as “structural deficits” resulting from the process of development itself: “to try to ‘correct’ the development deficit is to halt the development effort itself” (Abdalla 1980). The IMF then was born with an original sin: “the Fund’s financial mechanisms were designed to cope with a typical problem of industrialized economies: to provide short-term breathing space to enable countries to work their way out of payments deficits and thus avoid unwarranted devaluations which would threaten the system of relatively stable exchange parities” (ibid). The need to design new institutions equipped with the tools to accommodate the needs and aspirations of Third World nations could not be clearer.

The Initiative called for the creation of a new international monetary system. Since the fall of the Bretton Woods system monetary arrangements had been in disarray bringing steep inflation to Northern economies and even worse inflation to the Global South. The Initiative called the existing monetary structure a “monetary ‘non’system” that privileged the interests of the North over that of the South. The ability of one nation to anoint its currency as the international means of payment (as the U.S. did at Bretton Woods) conferred on it exorbitant privileges: countries that held reserves would do so in the form of interest-yielding instruments such as treasury bills which meant they would be lending to the country that issued the reserve currency in this case the US.

The new monetary system had to be democratic and universal encompassing the interests of the North as well as that of the South. It had to be capable of achieving monetary stability acceptable levels of employment and sustainable growth and above all it had to support the process of global development by design. Demands were made for an international currency unit that no one country could control and whose supply would be regulated and made readily available to countries in need. The Initiative also called for a mechanism of international arbitration independent from the IMF that could resolve disputes between the Fund and member countries. Finally a demand was also made for significant resource transfers (beyond the capacity of the IMF) from the North to the South. One of the ways in which this could be done according to participants was by instituting an international tax (for example on oil consumption in industrialized countries) that could be used to mobilize funds for resource transfers. In order to realize their vision of a truly democratic and universal monetary system and to meaningfully escape the legacy of colonial exploitation the Initiative called for a UN Conference on Money and Finance that unfortunately never came to pass.

The Arusha Initiative evinced a deeply political understanding of a highly technical system. It incisively dissected the distributional implications of a monetary system that privileged the currencies and interests of a few core economies. Those very countries the G7 (U.S. U.K. Canada Italy Japan Germany France and the recently added European Union as a ‘non-enumerated’ member) continue to hold the reins at key global governing institutions making reform near impossible. The deficiencies with the existing system were brought home yet again in the Covid-19 pandemic. Of the US $650 billion of SDRs distributed by the IMF a mere 3 percent went to low-income countries 30 percent to middle-income and the majority (60 percent) went to high-income countries; more than 17 percent went to the US alone (Eichengreen 2021). The system is based on two principles that badly need reform: SDRs are allocated based on automatic borrowing rights (quotas) which are in turn determined largely by aggregate GDP and second it is based on voluntary transfers between countries. Indeed one of the demands of the aforementioned Arusha Initiative was to base access to SDRs on the size of deficits rather than IMF quotas. This was a modified version of a demand that was made at the conception of SDRs in 1965 – to allocate SDRs based on development needs and not on a quota system that perpetuated colonial legacies.

The Only Game in Town

The Covid-19 pandemic threatens another “lost decade” in the Global South (United Nations 2022). While all countries suffered damaging economic contractions owing to lockdown measures and supply chain disruptions the ability to recover from the crisis has been uneven. Rich countries borrowed record sums at ultra-low interest rates to finance their pandemic recovery an option that was not available to the poorest nations; in fact the latter group spent billions servicing debt paying 14 per cent of revenue for interest on their debt almost four times higher than rich economies (United Nations 2022). Countries that enforced strict shut downs such as Sri Lanka plunged into severe debt crises. Sri Lanka is currently in negotiations with the IMF for a bailout. Meanwhile Pakistan is seeking an IMF loan of about US $6.4 billion to address its own economic crisis.

From the 1980s to the 2020s very little has changed in the architecture of the global economy. Institutions like the IMF the World Bank and the WTO remain at the apex of the global economy writing the rules of the game and perpetuating existing vulnerabilities and power asymmetries in the system. The IMF still remains the “only game in town” when it comes to peripheral countries in distress.

Debates about democratizing and politicizing central banking are gaining momentum in policy and academic circles driven by the twin challenges of the pandemic and climate change. From the perspective of the Global South however the debate needs to be much broader. The critique has to go beyond central banks to problematize the broader set of relations – trade financial and monetary – that condition what countries (or even central banks) can and cannot do. The problem with much of the mainstream development discourse today is that it focuses on factors internal to countries and proposes good governance and a turn to private finance as panacea for development woes. None of these touches on the systematic causes of development challenges and as long as these remain intact the aspirations of the Global South will be kept in check.

I have to believe that mine is not an uncommon situation. What are other ways I can prove to a prospective landlord that I can pay the rent?

A: Landlords have a huge amount of discretion when they choose tenants so long as they do not discriminate. In a competitive rental market like this one renters with nontraditional assets — including retirees recent graduates students and people who are self-employed — are at a disadvantage simply because the vetting process is more competitive.

Open houses are packed and bidding wars are rampant. Some prospective renters are even bribing brokers and landlords with Gucci discounts tickets to shows and French cheese according to Brick Underground. If your application shows nontraditional assets and income streams a landlord might simply move down to the next name on the list.

“In a market like this if you don’t have active income you’re at a severe disadvantage” said Keyan Sanai a salesman with Douglas Elliman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvbWluaXN0ZXItc3JpLWxhbmthLXN0cnVnZ2xpbmctdG8tcGF5LWZvci1mdWVsLXNoaXBtZW50cy82NjQzMzEyLmh0bWzSAWBodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbWluaXN0ZXItc3JpLWxhbmthLXN0cnVnZ2xpbmctdG8tcGF5LWZvci1mdWVsLXNoaXBtZW50cy82NjQzMzEyLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minister: Sri Lanka Struggling to Pay for Fuel Shipments,"Sri Lanka is struggling to raise $587 million to pay for about half a dozen fuel shipments a top minister said Sunday as the cash-strapped country tries to cope with its worst financial crisis in decades.

The country of 22 million people is unable to pay for essential imports of food items fertilizer medicines and fuel — due to a severe dollar crunch.

Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said new fuel shipments were being lined up but the country is struggling to raise enough funds to pay as the central bank can supply only about $125 million.

Sri Lanka only has 12774 tons of diesel and 4061 tons of petrol left in its government reserves he told reporters in Colombo the commercial center of the island nation.

""This week we will need $316 million to pay for new shipments. If we add two crude oil shipments this amount shoots up to $587 million"" Wijesekera said.

The first shipment of 40000 tons of diesel from Coral Energy is expected to arrive around July 9 and partial payment of $49 million must be made for a second one from Vitol by Thursday.

Faced with severely limited diesel and petrol stocks Sri Lanka last week closed schools asked public employees to work from home and restricted government fuel supplies to essential services.

The minister said the country will have to attempt to raise funds from the open market and seek more flexible payment options from suppliers.

Plans to settle the $800 million owed to seven suppliers for purchases made this year were being discussed he said.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials will continue to hold talks with Sri Lanka for a possible $3 billion bailout package the global lender said last week after wrapping up a 10-day visit to Colombo.

However the immediate release of funds from the IMF is unlikely because the country has first to get its debt on to a sustainable path."

Together they Ubered from downtown to the residential neighborhood across the harbor and entered through a multi-step process: Customers must find Next Door’s cloaked doorway lift the knocker and share the password they get with their reservation (tonight’s was “Bing” as in Chandler Bing from “Friends”). Only then was Douglas allowed to sip rum and eat ceviche in the chic lounge.

SOMEWHERE IN EAST BOSTON — With one hand on the bar at Next Door Speakeasy  Patricia Douglas announced gleefully and admittedly tipsy: “This is the place to be tonight.”

Her clubbing adventure in a town with a distinctly buttoned-down reputation could be “a sign that Boston night life is changing” Douglas said becoming swankier sexier more diverse.

A legion of city officials and entrepreneurs certainly hope so.

Long viewed as “boring” Boston after dark is incomparable to New York or Miami let alone the rowdy staples of Europe: Amsterdam Berlin and Barcelona.

Of course there have always been pockets of a scene: The clubs that once populated alleys off Boylston Street near the Common; shuttered queer spots like Machine and Ramrod; college bars in Allston; and favorites felled by COVID including Eastern Standard The Fours and the original Great Scott. But Boston bars and nightclubs have historically been cloistered downtown a hike from many corners of the city. Happy hour is banned. And nearly nothing — save South Street Diner — stays open past 2 a.m.

To top it off “the fact that our public transit closes two hours before last call is wild” added Chris Jamison CEO of COJE the hospitality management group behind Yvonne’s Lolita and the Mariel Underground.

Now as the city emerges from the pandemic there’s a push underway to change that old story.

A wave of low-lit cocktail bars and lounges have opened recently — not just downtown but in outer enclaves such as Eastie Brighton and Hyde Park. Established evening hubs are busy with pandemic-weary partygoers too “eagerly and endlessly looking for things to do” said Sheena Collier the self-proclaimed “super-connector” and founder of Boston While Black.

Segun Idowu the city chief of economic opportunity and inclusion is thinking broadly about what the future of late-night Boston could be. In May he announced the creation of a cabinet position dubbed the director of strategic initiatives — or “late-night czar” — who will help expand night life with equity in mind.

Chief among his objectives: Make the scene inviting for everyone everywhere. Longtime denizens of Roxbury and Roslindale should have the same breadth of options as college kids in Allston and newcomers to the Seaport. It’s an economic issue too. More vibrant night life could also help Boston attract talent and keep it here Idowu added.

“Downtown is the lifeblood of our city” he said. “But while that may be how other folks look at our city we care about all of it. Our neighborhoods should be destinations.”

That’s an ambitious goal for a city that has never gotten far down that track.

In 2014 the T expanded late-night service for a limited pilot program but did not extend the experiment citing low ridership and budgetary reasons. Over half a dozen bar and lounge owners who spoke to the Globe criticized how difficult it remains to open inventive spaces in Boston particularly for first-time entrepreneurs and people and color. City processes are opaque and expensive they said. Victor Hwang CEO of the business advocacy group Right to Start wrote in Inc. that it takes 92 steps 22 forms and $5554 in fees to launch a Boston restaurant.

“The city just pays lip service to this idea that they’re going to do more to support night life” Jamison said. “Nothing has ever happened.”

Then there’s the lifeblood of late night: Liquor licenses which are costly and clustered in whiter neighborhoods according to a report released last week. (Over 170 establishments with liquor licenses operate downtown. In Mattapan there are seven.)

It’s a disparity with roots in archaic city policies that failed to adapt to business’ needs said Boston attorney Kristen Scanlon. Another huge impediment is the price tag of around $400000 per license on the secondary market.

“If you have a small place it’s going to take a long time doing the equation on seats and turnover to make you whole again after you dole out half a million dollars for a license” Scanlon added.

Reform Idowu promises is on the way though expanding the number of licenses requires the blessing of Beacon Hill.

Despite the obstacles night life proprietors have found success even amidst a painful pandemic that kept customers home for months.

Among them are restaurant owners who used the comparatively quiet season of COVID to modify liquor licenses they already owned to add a bigger hipper bar.

That’s what Raffaele Scalzi did in East Boston tucking Next Door speakeasy inside Pazza on Porter his Italian-American establishment with red leather seats and a portrait of the Mona Lisa eating spaghetti. The fashionable lounge serves cocktails that arrive in a lockbox (Lock & Key) or with bubbles on top (Citrus & Smoke). Since opening in March business has been brisk Scalzi said and largely local.

“Instead of trying to open the next big restaurant downtown we’ve found a place where a bunch of people live in Eastie” Scalzi said.

There’s also fresh glitz downtown. At the behest of his bar manager Chris Campbell transformed the private dining room in Troquet on South in the Leather District into Offsuit a “small bar with big dreams” where patrons have to phone a number typed on a scrap of paper on the door to enter. The Flamingo took over the former Four Winds space in the North End to sell Bacardi in pink floaties. East Boston’s Tall Ship serves mai tais on an actual boat docked at Pier One. And Hecate a moody black-and-gold bar named after the Greek goddess of crossroads opened in April inside Krasi in Back Bay. Its imaginative drink menu is a rarity in Boston said owner Demetri Tsolakis.

“Other cities get national attention for their cocktail bars” he said. “Boston needs to realize there’s more to a drink than a vodka soda.”

Customers shared glasses of sake at The Koji Club the only sake bar in Boston. Owner Alyssa DiPasquale said her spot and others like it are a sign that city nightlife is becoming more neighborhood-centric. Carlin Stiehl for The Boston Globe

Then there’s what’s going on beyond downtown. With thousands working remotely during COVID many are looking to go out closer to home said Alyssa DiPasquale who recently opened The Koji Club at the Speedway a popular dining and drinking cluster in Brighton.

Much of her clientele is from the neighborhood or from concertgoers from Roadrunner a nearby music venue that opened in March who stop in to drink before the opening act.

Historically in Boston “you choose your evening by going to a different place and exploring whereas now I feel like people are anchored to their neighborhoods” DiPasquale added.

The question though is where those “neighborhood” spaces are. The parts of East Boston and Brighton where bars like Koji and Next Door have landed have changed dramatically in recent years with high-end apartment buildings housing more affluent arrivals who may be able to afford $17 cocktails.

A Next Door hostess Bel Carillo commended the lounge but noted the clientele doesn’t much resemble the people she grew up around in the traditionally working-class neighborhood.

“Yes this is for the people who live in Eastie” she said. “But who is living here now?”

RC Smith the cofounder of the Boston Black Hospitality Coalition added that every neighborhood deserves attention — not just those seeing rapid (and expensive) expansion. He’s hoping that changes in city policy can spread the growth of neighborhood-friendly night life to places like Mattapan and Roxbury where he runs a tavern called District 7.

“In a perfect world I want Nubian Square to look like Lower Mills” with a smattering of watering holes and nighttime restaurants Smith said. “Because if more people came to Roxbury Roxbury people will thrive. Once you get money in the door you grow.”

Still a sobering reality persists. The public perception is dismal with 88 percent of respondents to a Boston.com survey faulting the city for closing too early and having too few late-night restaurants food trucks and clubs. One person called Boston “a liberal city whose night life is imprisoned in a chastity belt.”

But a resurgence is coming if it’s not already here DiPasquale added.

“The pandemic should be the beginning of the opportunity not the end. The city of Boston excels at having fun and certainly deserves it.”

The fintech startup hired Oneal Bhambani who was American Express' Vice President Chief Financial Officer and Head of Capital Markets at Kabbage to lead its financial team. Former Kabbage Controller Rebecca Mendel and former Kabbage Head of Treasury and Tax Daniel Eidson have also joined the company and will report directly to Oneal.

💡 Kabbage is one of the world’s largest fintech platforms offering credit banking and payments solutions.

Following its $250 million in Series D funding valuing the company at over $3 billion—the most valuable African tech startup Flutterwave is going through a period of rapid growth. ""As Chief Financial officer Oneal will serve a key function in enabling the company’s expansion with best-in-class discipline operational controls and financial rigour"" Flutterwave stated.

Oneal appointment is coming a few months after the fintech company was accused of financial misconduct. An analyst said that ""the appointment is so necessary as most of the issues raised in the scandal were financial and an experienced CFO would have prevented or at least controlled the issues better.""

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has amplified supply chain challenges and commodity squeezes. Beyond the broader economic impact it will create particular challenges in the months and years ahead for banks active in and with exposure to Russia and Ukraine as they grapple with operational challenges and the beefed-up sanctions regime.

But even before the war began in February there were already rumblings of global inflationary pressures and incoming economic turbulence. And with central banks including the US Federal Reserve European Central Bank and the Bank of England now engaged in a clear programme of interest rate increases while beginning to wind down stimulus it is evident we are entering a new economic phase.

For banks this is not necessarily bad news; indeed profitability in the era of low interest rates has been a major challenge. The data for 2021 (the full-financial year data the 2022 Top 1000 World Banks ranking is based on) points to a significant recovery in profitability compared to last year when banks collectively booked hundreds of billions of dollars in impairment charges expecting significant loan losses due to Covid-19 disruption.

Bounceback

Aggregate return on assets in the Top 1000 now stands at 0.75% compared to 0.51% last year broadly in line with where it was in 2020’s Top 1000 results (based on full-year data from 2019). Profits as a percentage of Tier 1 capital has also jumped from 7.57% last year to 11.09% this year higher than the figure for 2020. In dollar-and-cents terms aggregate pre-tax profits reached $1.44tn — the highest figure ever recorded in the Top 1000. This shows a 53.7% year-on-year increase and a 24.1% increase on 2020.

However as our analysis shows it is unclear to what extent profitability has improved in a meaningful sense. The impact of Covid-19 economic disruption on banks’ loan books has been less severe than expected in large part due to major central bank and fiscal stimulus packages. As a result banks have benefitted from lower-than-expected impairment charges which has boosted their profits. But it remains to be seen what shape banks are truly in following the pandemic and what kind of springboard that will offer in responding to current market conditions as stimulus packages are unwound.

Tier 1 capital grows

Looking beyond profits and profitability the overall resilience of the global financial system continues to look secure with aggregate Tier 1 capital continuing its upwards march. The minimum Tier 1 capital of a bank within the Top 1000 now stands at $556m up from $547m last year. Aggregate Tier 1 capital topped $10tn for the first time hitting $10.38tn — a 4.7% increase compared to last year. Aggregate Tier 1 assets also hit their highest-ever level growing 3.8% year-on-year to hit $154.21tn. However the growth rate of both Tier 1 capital and assets has slowed significantly compared to last year. Between 2020 and 2021 aggregate Tier 1 capital rose by 12.7% and assets by 16.0%.

There are some significant regional disparities. While Tier 1 capital grew by 9.1% for Asia-Pacific to hit $5.19tn (the first time it has topped $5tn for any one region) in western Europe it decreased by 3.6% to $2.37tn. In North America Tier 1 capital increased by 6.2% to hit $1.95tn. In Africa the Middle East and South America Tier 1 capital grew by 9.3% 11.1% and 7.6% respectively.

Increases for Asia-Pacific continue to be driven by China which accounts for $3.38tn of the region’s Tier 1 capital with aggregate Tier 1 capital for the country’s banks growing by 14.4% year-on-year. This is in stark contrast to Japan which saw its Tier 1 capital decrease by 10.3% to $642.6bn — its lowest value since 2017. Japan’s figures however have been skewed by the yen’s slumping exchange rate against the US dollar. All data in the Top 1000 is converted into US dollar values (if not already provided in that currency) to enable aggregation and international comparison.

In western Europe just seven of the 22 countries saw their aggregate Tier 1 capital increase year-on-year and this only includes two major banking economies — Switzerland and the UK which had increases of 3.4% and just 0.9% respectively. France which has the highest aggregate Tier 1 capital of any western European country in the Top 1000 saw an annual decrease of 4.6%; Spain saw a decrease of 0.9% and Germany a decrease of 4.1%. Turkey and Greece both saw particularly substantial decreases in percentage terms of 30.0% and 26.2% respectively. In Turkey’s case it was negatively impacted by the currency devaluation.

Chinese dominance continues

Chinese banks have continued to consolidate their increasingly dominant position within the Top 1000. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has now made it a full decade at the top of the Top 1000 rankings. Its Tier 1 capital has continued to swell growing by $68.9bn since last year to hit a massive $508.85bn — a 15.7% increase and the first time an individual bank in the Top 1000 has held more than $500bn in Tier 1 capital on its balance sheet. It has more than twice the Tier 1 capital of JPMorgan the highest non-Chinese bank in the rankings in fifth position. It also holds a mammoth $5.52tn in assets on its balance sheet.

Four other Chinese banks join ICBC in the top 10 with China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China each maintaining their second third and fourth positions respectively in the ranking. Bank of Communications has also moved from 11th to 10th position. This marks the first time that Chinese banks have made up half of the top 10.

China also now makes up half of the top 20 — increasing its share from nine of the 20 in 2021 — with China Citic Bank entering the top 20 for the first time. Its 18.0% increase in Tier 1 capital saw it leapfrog from 24th to 19th position.

At an aggregate level Chinese banks are also increasingly dominant — accounting for a third of Tier 1 capital across the whole Top 1000. This is a slight increase from last year when they accounted for 30%. Within Asia-Pacific Chinese banks account for 65% of aggregate Tier 1 capital up from 62% last year. Japan the next nearest this year accounts for just 12% — down from 15% last year.

China’s aggregate pre-tax profits increased by 15% year-on-year to reach $400bn. Its relative share of global net income has fallen from 37% last year to 27%; although similar to last year it continues to account for two-thirds of Asia-Pacific pre-tax profits.

Compared to last year Asia-Pacific overall also accounts for a smaller total of global profits. In 2021 its share of total global net income was 55.1% compared to 43.0% this year. North America and western Europe have picked up that slack. North American banks represented 28.5% of net income this year compared to 23.9% last year and for western Europe its share has increased from 10.3% to 17.3%.

Although China has by far the most dominant position by size of banks the number of Chinese banks in this year’s Top 1000 has decreased by four to 140. But China remains second only to the US in total banks in the Top 1000 which has 186 — an increase of eight from last year.

European changes

It is a year of significant change for Europe for this year’s rankings. In western Europe merger and acquisition (M&A) activity was the main driver behind a reduction of seven banks in this year’s Top 1000.

The central and eastern Europe (CEE) region has 13 fewer banks than last year. We have been unable to gather data from the two Ukrainian banks — PrivatBank and State Savings Bank of Ukraine — which were part of the ranking last year. There are also fewer Russian banks in our ranking this year just six banks compared to 21 in 2021 as we have not been able access the necessary data.

US holds steady

There has been little change for the US’s biggest three universal banks — JPMorgan Chase Bank of America (BofA) and Citi — with them retaining their fifth sixth and seventh positions in the Top 1000 ranking respectively. Their Tier 1 capital levels have generally remained relatively stable although JPMorgan’s has increased by 4.8% compared to last year to hit $246.16bn while BofA’s Tier 1 capital decreased by 1.8%.

The most significant US mover and shaker in the top 20 is Goldman Sachs which saw its Tier 1 Capital increase by 15.1% to hit $106.77bn — the first time it has surpassed $100bn.

In recent years Goldman has been expanding outside of its traditional investment banking focus. Its Marcus digital banking platform for retail customers has now grown to a customer base of more than 10 million with more than $110bn in deposits since its 2016 launch in the US and 2018 launch in the UK. The bank plans to push this expansion much further with the launch of a digital chequing account by the end of this year. It is also pushing ahead with further expansion of its transaction banking services which it launched in the US in 2020 and in the UK in 2021. It already has more than $50bn in deposits in this division and is targeting $100bn by 2024.

Goldman Sachs also succeeded in increasing its pre-tax profits by 116.2% building on a relatively strong performance last year where it was one of the few large US banks to achieve growth in pre-tax profits compared to 2020 (16.1%).

Overall it was a good year for pre-tax profits across the US banks with aggregate pre-tax profits increasing by 97.7% compared to last year. Just nine of the 186 US banks in the Top 1000 had smaller profits compared to last year.

Wells Fargo the US’s fourth-biggest bank in particular saw its pre-tax profits jump from just $581m last year to $28.82bn this year — a 4860% increase. It was able to benefit from a $4.1bn reduction in its provision for credit losses compared to last year when it recorded a $13.4bn provision for credit losses.

The bank also benefited from gains in areas such as in its affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and sales of its student lending asset management and corporate trust businesses. It remains subject to the $1.95tn asset cap imposed on it by the federal reserve in 2018 (with some limited exemptions for Covid-19-related lending). Although CEO Charlie Scharf has commented that the bank is “making significant progress” in addressing regulatory concerns he says “there is still work to do” which will take time.

JPMorgan Citi and BofA recorded pre-tax profit increases of 68.4% 78.9% and 96.2% respectively.

Top 20 shake-up

HSBC is once again the only European bank in the top 10; it has reversed its one position gain of last year returning to ninth position with its Tier 1 capital decreasing by 2.4%. It was able to boost its pre-tax profits by 115.4%; this was largely driven by a reversal in impairment charges. The bank is likely to see further adjustments in its assets and capital as it continues to progress its plans to withdraw from the US mass-market retail banking.

In February this year HSBC completed sales of 80 branches to Citizens Bank and 10 branches to Cathay Bank along with associated deposits and loans; these sales will be reflected in its 2022 annual report. In March it also announced it had entered into a deal to sell its Greek retail operations covering 15 branches to local bank Pancreta although this deal is not expected to be completed until the first half of 2023.

However the changes are part of its wider strategy to pivot towards Asia and the Middle East and it is likely to make new investments in that region. For instance HSBC Insurance subsidiaries in Asia-Pacific are currently pursuing plans to take full ownership of HSBC Life China (from the current 50%) and to increase ownership in Indian life insurer Canara HSBC Oriental Bank of Commerce Life Insurance Company from 26% to 49%.

Turning to the other banks in the top 20 France’s two largest banks Crédit Agricole and BNP Paribas have also slipped down the rankings from 12th and 13th last year to 14th and 15th positions this year with their Tier 1 capital falling by 3.6% and 6.6% respectively and assets by 3.6% and 2.6%. It is important to note the euro has fallen in value against the US dollar so if considered in local currency there is not the same fall. Each increased their pre-tax profits by 55.5% and 27.8%.

Japan now has just one bank remaining in the top 20 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group which shifted from 10th to 12th position its Tier 1 capital dropping by 12.4%. However its pre-tax profits grew by 29.3%. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group with its Tier 1 capital falling 9.7% has dropped from 16th to 21st position. The Tier 1 values have been negatively impacted by the falling value of the yen.

Profits recovery

This was a year when several banks had an impressive turnaround in fortunes with their pre-tax profits. Santander which last year recorded its first loss in its 160-year history of $2.56bn has recorded pre-tax profits of $16.5bn this year.

In 2020 the bank made a non-cash adjustment to the valuation of goodwill and deferred tax assets on its balance sheet which had a significant negative impact. Much of this adjustment applied across its subsidiaries Santander UK Santander Bank Polska and Santander Consumer Nordics and US businesses Santander Bank National Association and Santander Consumer USA. It attributes its improved performance to growth in loans and deposits and an improvement in credit quality.

NatWest which last year made a pre-tax loss of $468m recorded pre-tax profits of $5.82bn. This was in part down to an impairment release of $1.7bn but the UK lender also attributes the results to growing its lending cost reductions and digital transformation.

UniCredit has also moved from a $3bn loss to pre-tax profits of $1.41bn. The bank which gained its new CEO Andrea Orcel in April 2021 is currently engaging in a major strategic plan UniCredit Unlocked to deliver growth and long-term profitability. However the bank faces some risk given its exposure to Russian markets.

Germany’s Commerzbank which last year made the second-largest loss in the Top 1000 at $3.2bn has also moved back into the black albeit with modest pre-tax profits of $119m. Last year was the first year of its major restructuring programme which included planned staffing cuts of 10000 people as well as the closure of 340 of its 790 branches. It has benefitted from a significant year-on-year reduction in impairment charges.

This year the biggest loss in the Top 1000 was Greece’s Alpha Bank which made a pre-tax loss of $3.37bn closely followed by Piraeus Bank also of Greece which made a loss of $3.07bn. Both banks have been undergoing restructuring within their balance sheets to improve asset quality.

Impairment charge falls

Global pre-tax profits at an aggregate level reached $1.44tn a 53.7% increase compared to last year. This is in stark contrast to previous year when pre-tax profits fell by 19.2% year on year. At a regional level South America saw the biggest annual increase in profits at 128.8% followed by western Europe at 102.8% and North America at 90.2%. Spain was the country with the biggest annual increase in pre-tax profits at 621% followed by Poland at 464%.

In many cases this reversal in fortunes for pre-tax profits reflects the opposite trend for provisions and impairment charges. Impairment charges are costs that recognise the diminishing value of assets (for instance loans where there is a reasonable expectation of it not being paid back) and are included on bank-income statements — as such increased impairment charges have a direct impact on profits. Last year aggregate global impairment charges ballooned from $472bn to $754bn. This year they have fallen back down to $411bn.

North America saw the biggest regional fall in impairment charges with an annual decrease of 124.2% followed by western Europe at 63.9% and CEE with a decrease of 56.1%. At an individual country level some of the biggest reductions were seen in the US with a 129.0% fall in impairment charges the UK with a 114.6% drop and Australia with a 102.5% fall.

Interestingly China’s impairment charges only fell by 1.5% year-on-year but unlike many other countries its banks did not see significant increases in the year prior. Last year impairment charges at Chinese banks had increased by 22% compared that to its next nearest peer by size of banks the US which last year had a 157% increase.

A similar trend is visible when comparing China’s pre-tax profits to the US’s. China’s banks had by far the largest aggregate pre-tax profits of any country at more than $400bn this year. Yet this was just a 15% year-on-year increase. This compares to the US which had pre-tax profits of $342.73bn this year an increase of 97.7% compared to last year.

At first glance it may appear the US banks are more profitable based on these figures; however the significant increase in US pre-tax profits is largely attributable to the annual fall in impairment charges following a one-off major increase whereas China’s pre-tax profit growth has been more stable in recent years.

Post-crisis performance

Indeed China’s bank did not suffer a drop in pre-tax profits between 2008 and 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Looking across the period since then as an overall trend its aggregate pre-tax profits have gradually climbed.

For western European banks even 13 years later their pre-tax profits have never recovered to 2008 levels. In 2008 western European pre-tax profits stood at $355bn and they fell the following year by $390bn to a loss of $35bn. Since then they have been up and down and this year’s figure of $258.75bn is the highest level they have reached since 2008.

North American banks experienced an even bigger loss in 2009 with pre-tax profits falling by $216bn from $140bn in 2008 to a loss of $76bn. Unlike western Europe however aggregate pre-tax profits at North American banks had been consistently increasing until last year. They recovered to 2008 levels in 2011 overtook western European profits in 2012 and this year stand at $408.27bn. For Asia-Pacific it is clear the extent to which China has come to dominate the region’s banking industry in the post-crisis period. In 2008 China’s aggregate pre-tax profits were $77bn compared to $121bn for Asia-Pacific excluding China. As of this year China’s pre-tax profits stand at $400bn compared to the rest of the region at $206bn.

Lending activity

In order to benefit from rising interest rates banks will need to boost their lending particularly to customers they can be confident will not default during potentially challenging economic circumstances. This year’s Top 1000 figures (although not reflective of current market activity) suggest that banks in most regions have remained relatively cautious. For instance although gross total loans in Africa increased by 10.2% year-on-year their gross total deposits increased by 11.0%. Similarly gross total loans in the Middle East increased by 10.2% but total deposits also grew by 10.6%.

In North America deposit growth has far outstripped loan growth with gross total loans increasing by 7.4% and total deposits increasing by 11.8% year on year. In western Europe this trend is even more pronounced with gross total loans decreasing year-on-year by 3.0% and gross total deposits increasing by 0.4%. However the overall health of western European banking loan books appears to have improved. Aggregate allowances fell by 19.8% year-on-year and allowances as a percentage of the total loan book fell by 30.25 basis points (bps). In North America the decrease was even greater with aggregate allowances falling by 27% and allowances as a percentage of the total loan book falling by 62bps.

Big M&A deals

Although only 12 M&A transactions were completed within the Top 1000 during the 2021 financial year there were some major deals. The largest by far was the merger between Samba Financial Group and National Commercial Bank to create Saudi National Bank. The combined bank is now the largest banking entity in the Middle East with Tier 1 capital of $32.62bn. It is in 67th position in the rankings leapfrogging Qatar National Bank (77th this year) which was previously the region’s largest bank.

The next largest deal was Spain’s CaixaBank’s acquisition of Bankia which was completed in March 2021 having first been announced in September 2020. CaixaBank says the combined bank now has almost 20 million customers in Spain making it the largest retail bank in the domestic market by share of customers (Santander is Spain’s largest bank by Tier 1 capital and assets). The combined entity is Spain’s third-largest bank by Tier 1 capital and second-largest by assets at $772.77bn. Western Europe was the most active region for M&A accounting for five of the 12 deals taking place in 2021.

For comparability and consistency we convert all the data used in the Top 1000 into US dollar values. However year-on-year depreciation in the value of some currencies can have the effect of suppressing the position of some banks within the ranking. For transparency the table ‘The Foreign Exchange Effect’ lists the 50 banks within the Top 1000 that would move up rankings the most if the effects of the depreciation were recalibrated. Typically smaller banks are affected the most. This year the largest bank affected is TC Ziraat Bankasi which could have been in 111th position in the rankings rather than 177th without the effects of currency depreciation.

The result is a show of varying quality but when it’s good it’s truly exceptional. Cinematographer Kirstin McMahon and camera operator Jo Hellier make extensive use of the camera technique of “forced perspective” in which figures close to the camera look like giants and those further away look like well puppets. The scale distortion is amplified by sequences in which a character walking against a blank red backdrop is transposed on screen into a miniature theatre filmed by another camera. As a result what you see happening on stage very rarely looks like what’s on the screen hanging in the middle of it; the result is simultaneously discombobulating and enchanting.

From the Seventies to the Noughties Forkbeard Fantasy set the tone for the humorous combination of theatre and film with their dark wit and visual invention. Today Cade and MacAskill make their impact with a more playful whimsical style. What results can sometimes be ravishingly beautiful. Not least the opening in which we see MacAskill walk over to a small box lined with red fabric and adjust the camera so that – to the accompaniment of violins – a jewel-like live cricket is revealed on the screen.

However there are other times when you feel that a sequence that started off as a good idea goes on for far too long. When the couple morph into a ""pantomime"" donkey with several orifices (pictured above) while complaining what it’s like to become heterosexual/normal it’s funny at first but loses impact after a couple of minutes.

Still I’d rather see this level of experiment than a script that plays it safe and this is – as you’d expect from a LIFT production – one of the most unusual and inventive shows I’ve seen for a while. When it works it works. It’s an understatement to say the trans-debate is one of the most highly-politicised of this generation yet here Cade (they/them) and MacAskill (he/him) make it personal other-worldly and humorous.

One of the more comic themes is Cade’s jealousy that MacAskill is going to steal the limelight through his gender transition. As a result they repeatedly attempt to lure him off stage so we can focus on them again. Another is Cade’s disappointment that they got together as a lesbian couple and have ended up in a heterosexual relationship. At one point they propose a pleasure island full of boobs to which MacAskill quips “Do you miss my breasts?”

While there’s plenty of light and humour in this show there’s plenty that is profound too. One stunning sequence talks about the evolution of the whale 50 million years ago from land mammal to submarine giant; as MacAskill describes this we see how physical transition is etched into the story of our world. At another point Cade describes watching his transition as being like a parent watching a child develop. Though sometimes they confess they wonder if they're more like a parent or an evil puppet master.

The most moving sequence of all is the one in which after stripping to reveal his new transforming body MacAskill sings a duet with his filmed pre-transition self who we see also naked with breasts. His pre-transition self is soprano while he is now more of a tenor; together poignantly they perform ""When you wish upon a star"". It’s an extraordinary moment in an evening of many extraordinary moments heightened by Yas Clarke’s sensitive mesmerising sound design. Yes the show could have benefited from a rigorous edit yet there is more than enough wonder to keep it playing in your mind for days afterwards.

“My husband said ‘Are you crazy?'” Spunberg said.

Apparently not. The business Healthy is the Way is going strong today with about 70 weekly subscriptions. In 2021 she delivered about 400 meals per week.

Her husband Eric Spunberg once the naysayer now helps deliver the fresh meals early two days a week before his day job as an insurance actuary begins.

“I wanted to help people struggling with diet sensitivities” she said. “I love that I’m able to make a difference in people’s lives. It’s not just a business to me.”

Spunberg modified her diet to be free of gluten and dairy in 2016 after developing eczema along with her infant son after giving birth. She also had a hard time losing weight Spunberg said.

The new diet took care of it all. She also felt less bloated and tired. Although careful with her diet she doesn’t enjoy cooking and purchased prepared gluten- and dairy-free meals at a grocer until they stopped the offering.

Jill Spunberg manages the kitchen — renting space at Hands on Hartford — and delivers to customers throughout Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. (Douglas Hook / Hartford Courant)

Spunberg started the business in July 2020 when food delivery services took off during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spunberg hired a chef to devise recipes and do the cooking. She rented commercial kitchen space at Hands on Hartford where she oversees the kitchen and helps prep package and creates the menu of fresh food items.

Now Spunberg uses chefs on a rotating schedule.

“I really don’t like to cook. Isn’t that funny?” Spunberg said.

The business delivers fresh meals all over Connecticut and parts of Western Massachusetts.

Brenda Holian of West Hartford a nutritionist who sometimes recommends the service to clients said she started using Healthy is the Way about a year ago when the family’s sports schedule got busy.

“It’s delicious. It’s convenient. It’s healthy. I love it” Holian said. “When you finish the meal you don’t feel like it’s too heavy but you feel satisfied.”

Allison Taylor of Canton said she recently took a more intensive job and with two young children “It’s difficult to prepare food let alone healthy food.” She found herself spending all of Sunday preparing food for the week and the other food prep services she tried required work and time.

“It just seemed like a home run” Taylor said. “It’s so much food. It’s healthy food.”

Taylor said with what the cost of a grocery delivery would be the service is worth the money. She orders three family-sized meals a week at about $150 with delivery charges and there are leftovers for lunches.

Taylor said the salmon is the best she’s tasted and loves that at 6 years old her daughter loves “the pink chicken” — referring to the salmon.

Customer Erica Manchester of Rocky Hill said she follows a gluten-free diet because of allergies and has three meals a week delivered to use as lunches.

“It saves me time because I don’t have to meal prep and I can enjoy a variety of delicious and tasty food at a reasonable price” Manchester said.

Spunberg does the shopping selecting the freshest ingredients. She said she uses locally sourced fruits and vegetables as well as organic when possible.

“I’m getting good at knowing what I want on the menu” she said of rotating the offerings in single double and family sizes.

One of the most popular fresh meals is pan-seared salmon or chicken with roasted vegetables and sweet potatoes. Beef teriyaki and broccoli is another big seller along with salads where customers pick their protein. Then there are the popular cranberry walnut mini-muffins. All dressings and sauces are made from scratch in-house Spunberg said.

She said some customers don’t have diet allergies or sensitivities but just order to be healthy.

She said she is actually doing a little less business than she was during the pandemic but that’s OK because with two young children “It gives me a life balance” she said.

Spunberg who eats her own company food said she feels “great” since changing her diet in 2016.

“I don’t feel bloated anymore. I have more energy. My body feels strong” she said. Many of the symptoms of her polycystic ovary syndrome disappeared too.

“I’ve had customers say they feel so much better” she said. “This really is something I’m passionate about. I’m so passionate about it it’s really not like a job to me.”

Joe HISS Tank Reveals First Stretch Goal Add-ons,"As has often been the case since Hasbro launched G.I. Joe Classified demand turned out bigger than anticipated. Not only did the HasLab Cobra HISS tank easily make its “early bird” special of 8000 backers in the first weekend but now at 12000 and rising it’s unlocked two more add-on tiers. The mystery two left to go in the remaining 44 days seem like shoo-ins.

First Hasbro revealed the bonus HISS Tactician figure. Once the project ends fans will vote on one of six color schemes which include two red-on-black designs as well as blue black purple and gray.

The first tier stretch goal unlocked consisted of two side missile launchers each bearing six rockets. The second retro-style track tread side covers and canopy. So should buyers prefer a more classic-looking HISS with the all-clear canopy they may have it. Though this also seems like an army building tactic to encourage the purchase of more than one. There’s a strong likelihood future add-ons may do likewise — the previous HasLab Skystriker included three variant sticker sets.

Take a look through the images below to see all the details. If they make you want one go to HasLab at Hasbro Pulse to preorder. Do you like the extras so far? Let us know in comments.

The new location is located on East Main Street on property owned by the Milton Hershey School Trust near Grace United Methodist church.

The nonprofit which was founded in 2015 says it assists more than 1300 children year-round in central Pennsylvania and officials said that the model it has developed provides the capacity to assist many more children. But they said that the operational and logistical challenges presented by currently operating various aspects of services from numerous locations are not sustainably efficient.

The nonprofit’s drive-thru location warehouse/clothing closet and food rescue all operate out of three different locations in the Hershey area.

One of the locations Cocoa Packs currently operates from is for weekly drive-thru distribution. That operation has been forced outside year-round due to pandemic-related restrictions and the volume of assistance being provided. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the organization said it has seen an increase in enrollment of nearly 300%.

“Our vision for the next chapter of Cocoa Packs is a space where we can ensure all of the children we assist have what they need to succeed in a safe and handicap accessible place by providing all services under one roof” Cocoa Packs founder and president Christine Drexler said in a news release. “This facility will also enable us to maximize the impact of the thousands of volunteers and volunteer groups who faithfully serve our organization.”

The new facility will house all of Cocoa Packs operations which will include warehouse space for assembly of food packs allow for distribution to children multiple days each week provide access to the Cocoa Packs Clothing Closet expand the Cocoa Packs Food Rescue program add additional educational programming in a teaching kitchen and café and host a learning center and a lending library. The property will also have a garden to provide opportunities for children to plant and grow fresh produce for distribution.

The public phase of the Cocoa Packs Capital Campaign began on June 30. Cocoa Packs said that the Hershey Company will donate $500000 to the project. Cocoa Packs has also received three other donations of $100000.

The land for the facility will be acquired through a long-term lease with an option to purchase from the Milton Hershey School Trust.

Matt Luttrell of Thynk Design is the architect and JEM Group is building the facility.

The shelves at Villa Market were stocked with American brands. Katie Lockhart

I'm an American citizen who's been traveling around Asia for nearly four years.

Whenever I explore a new place I'm eager to dive into the local cuisine and typically make a beeline for the street-food markets. But there are moments when I crave a familiar taste of home like Tostitos chips dipped in a pint of Ben & Jerry's Phish Food.

Luckily I found upscale grocery stores that carry classic American foods during my trip to Bangkok.

Many of the items were priced considerably higher in Thailand than they are in the US but I was happy to shell out the extra Thai baht for them.

Here's what the American food selection looks like in Villa Market an international grocery-store chain in Bangkok.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpZ2h0LmNvbS9mb29kL2JjLXN1cHJlbWUtY291cnQtanVkZ2UtY2VydGlmaWVzLWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi1sYXdzdWl0LWFnYWluc3QtaGVyc2hleS1jYW5hZGEtaW5jLWFuZC1oZXJzaGV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B.C. Supreme Court judge certifies class-action lawsuit against Hershey Canada Inc. and the Hershey Company,"The defendants have denied that child labour and slavery are part of their supply chain

1 of 1 2 of 1

A global chocolate food-products company has failed in its bid to thwart a class-action lawsuit in B.C. Supreme Court.

On June 29 Justice Jasmin Ahmad granted plaintiff Scott Leaf's application against Hershey Canada Inc. and the Hershey Company which manufacture market and distribute chocolate confectionary projects.

The companies have insisted that they oppose the use of child labour and slavery.

""Mr. Leaf alleges that contrary to those representations 'child labour and slavery' are present in the defendants’ supply chain. He asserts claims against the defendants in misrepresentation at common law and under the Competition Act"" Ahmad wrote in her decision.

At this point none of Leaf's allegations have been proven in court. The decision means that if the case goes to trial judge will address certified issues that apply to all class members.

The Hershey Company argued that the plaintiff did not establish that he received or relied on any of the pleaded misrepresentations outlined in the notice of civil claim.

In the alternative the company maintained that ""the plaintiff has failed to particularize the alleged misrepresentations contained in the 'advertising marketing or packaging' which Mr. Leaf and [affiant] Mr. [[Michael] Pucci received and on which they relied"" according to the ruling.

The Hershey Company also claimed that the claim did not state expressly that it carries on business in B.C.

Ahmad on the other hand stated in her decision that she's ""satisfied that the plaintiff has met the low burden imposed on it to show a good arguable case that THC and HCI operate in joint enterprise in respect of manufacturing marketing and sale of Hershey products in British Columbia as alleged in the Claim"".

""That being the case I am satisfied that for the purposes of this application THC carries on business on British Columbia"" the judge stated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL25ld3MuYWJwbGl2ZS5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9zYWxtb25lbGxhLWZvdW5kLWluLXdvcmxkLWJpZ2dlc3QtY2hvY29sYXRlLWZhY3Rvcnktd2hhdC13ZS1rbm93LXNvLWZhci13aWV6ZS1iZWxnaXVtLWJhcnJ5LWNhbGxlYmF1dC1oZXJzaGV5LW1vbmRlbGV6LW5lc3RsZS11bmlsZXZlci0xNTQwNTcw0gGzAWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnBsaXZlLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlL3NhbG1vbmVsbGEtZm91bmQtaW4td29ybGQtYmlnZ2VzdC1jaG9jb2xhdGUtZmFjdG9yeS13aGF0LXdlLWtub3ctc28tZmFyLXdpZXplLWJlbGdpdW0tYmFycnktY2FsbGViYXV0LWhlcnNoZXktbW9uZGVsZXotbmVzdGxlLXVuaWxldmVyLTE1NDA1NzAvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salmonella In Chocolate? Production Stopped In World's Biggest Chocolate Factory. What We Know So Far,"Salmonella bacteria have been discovered in the biggest chocolate factory in the world following which production was stopped news agency AFP reported. The factory run by Swiss giant Barry Callebaut in the Belgian town of Wieze produces liquid chocolate in wholesale batches for 73 clients making confectionaries.

Barry Callebaut is a Belgian-Swiss cocoa processor and chocolate manufacturer that has an average annual production of 2.2 million tonnes of cocoa and chocolate. Hershey Mondelez Nestle and Unilever are the multinational customers to which the plant supplies chocolate products. Barry Callebaut is the largest cocoa and chocolate company in the world.

Salmonella was detected in a batch in the Wieze plant on June 26.

What Are Salmonella?

Salmonella are dreaded bacteria which cause infections such as salmonellosis typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever. The bacteria were first discovered by American scientist Dr Daniel E Salmon in 1885.

Salmonella can cause diarrhoea fever and stomach cramps in the infected host. The bacteria are the most frequently reported cause of food-borne illnesses in the United States.

All Products Manufactured Since Salmonella Detected In Plant Have Been Blocked

According to an AFP report Korneel Warlop a company spokesperson said June 30 that all products manufactured since the test have been blocked. He also said that Barry Callebaut is currently contacting all customers who may have received contaminated products and that chocolate production in Wieze remains suspended until further notice.

He added that most of the products discovered to be contaminated are still on the site.

Clients Asked Not To Ship Products Made Using Chocolate Produced In Plant Since June 25

The Wieze plant is in Flanders northwest of Brussels. All the firm's clients have been asked not to ship any products made using chocolate produced in the plant since June 25 the report said.

The Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA) Belgium's food safety agency has been informed. The agency has opened an investigation.

According to the report the Wieze plant does not make chocolates which are sold directly to consumers. Therefore the firm believes that no contaminated goods made by clients have been sent to shops yet.

Similar Incidents Reported In The Past

A few weeks before this incident a case of chocolates contaminated with Salmonella was reported in the Ferrero factory in Arlon in southern Belgium. The factory manufactures Kinder chocolates. Following this incident in the Ferrero factory in Arlon families in the United Kingdom were asked to throw out any Kinder Eggs they had at home due to Salmonella risk.

As many as 70 children in the UK fell ill with food poisoning an article published by Metro said.

On June 17 Belgian health authorities announced that they had given the green light to restart the chocolate factory in Arlon for a three-month test period.

The samples of the salmonella strain discovered in the Ferrero factory matched those found in a separate factory in Belgium last year.

Dame Jenny Harries the chief executive of the United Kingdom Health Security Agency had warned at that time that salmonella infection 'can be very severe and many children affected in this outbreak have been very unwell and hospitalised' the Metro report said.

Barry Callebaut is the world number one in the chocolate sector. During the 2020-2021 financial year the annual sales of Barry Callebaut amounted to 2.2 million tonnes.

Barry Callebaut is headquartered in Zunich. The Swiss group generated a net profit of 384.5 million Swiss francs ($402 million) for 7.2 million francs in turnover over the past financial year the AFP report said.

Barry Callebaut employs more than 13000 people and has more than 60 production sites worldwide."
HES,Hess Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFicm9la25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvZmVhdHVyZXMvdGhlLXJvYWQtdG8tZmlyc3Qtb2lsL3Rva2VuLWdyYS10YXgtcmVjZWlwdC1oZWxwcy1oZXNzLWF2b2lkLXBheWluZy10YXhlcy1pbi10aGUtdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Token GRA tax receipt helps Hess avoid paying taxes in the US,"Introduction

In this Part 99 we address our attention to the 2021 audited financial statements of Hess Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (the branch) which despite its name is in fact a branch of a Cayman Islands incorporated subsidiary of the American oil major Hess Corporation headed by John Hess. Of the heads of the three contractors under the 2016 Petroleum Agreement Mr. Hess is by far the most open even garrulous when it comes to Guyana. But not without reason.

Guyana is the jewel in Hess’ crown its cash cow its redemption and its future. From ground zero two years ago Guyana accounted for more than 25% of the Corporation’s global crude oil production in 2021 even as Hess has seen its North American production decline by more than 20% between 2019 and 2021. And of the Corporation’s gross and net undeveloped acreage Guyana represents 45.9% and 43.7% respectively while 25% of the proved reserves of the Corporation is situated in Guyana.

Malaysia and JDA: Malaysia – Thailand Joint Development Authority.

That elusive tax

The taxation information is at once revealing and a vindication of the fears of commentators. The Statement of Consolidated Income shows a tax charge of US$600 million but that includes the amount of US$113 million “paid” by the Government of Guyana on behalf of the local branch for which Hess gets a token receipt. In a discussion on taxes the Report informs the reader that the tax charge in 2021 was “primarily due to higher pre-tax income in Libya and Guyana”. The report also shows that income tax attributed to Guyana and Libya accounted for 92% of the taxes shown as a charge in Hess’ report for 2021. It is unclear whether the amount of US$436 million shown as paid in Libya in 2021 was a paper transaction as is the case with Guyana but given Libya’s sensible and logical position with oil companies it is unlikely that that country’s political leaders would be as shamelessly obsequious to the oil companies as leaders Guyana and its leading politicians have always been.

It would be ironic but not surprising if in the near future the lion’s share of taxes payable in the Hess world comes from Guyana! Note 15 to the Report leaves no room for speculation or deduction – Hess paid no taxes in its home country from which it derives two-thirds of its crude oil production! Yet the oil companies are willing to argue in the Guyana courts that if they have to pay tax in Guyana their business will suffer.

But things are so good for John Hess and the shareholders that in his letter to them he confidently predicted that all four of the Corporation’s production assets would be free cash flow generative in 2022 and is positioned to grow its cash flow at a “compound rate of 25% per year out to 2026”. It only gets better: with Liza Phase 2 beginning production in February 2022 at capacity Hess is expected to add more than $1 billion of net operating cash flow annually having repaid the remaining $500 million of its term loan; distributed a 50% increase in quarterly dividend; and committed to return up to 75% of its adjusted free cash flow annually to shareholders by increasing dividends and accelerating share repurchases.

And to think that Hess has less than one-third interest in the Stabroek Block. But Hess and even more so Exxon enjoy such confidence and respect of this country’s Government and the Opposition that they are proud to boast of their cooperative relationship with the oil companies and defend the iniquitous contract.

Let us now turn to the financial statements of the Guyana branch in which all figures are in Guyana Dollars unless otherwise stated.

Table of Income Statement

Crude contract crude share

Using information in the Hess Corporation’s report on average price earned from Guyana crude the branch sold approximately 11.4 million barrels in 2021 compared with about 6.1 million barrels in 2020. The financial statements of the branch state that it had no related party transactions in 2021 suggesting that those who direct the sale of the branch’s production bypassed the Group’s marketing subsidiary and chose other outlets to sell its share of profit oil and recoverable costs.

From the $163474 million deductions are made for Cost of Sales ($28222 million or 17% of sales revenue) and Depreciation depletion and amortisation (DPA) ($20918 million or 13% of sales revenue) leaving a gross margin of $114334 million or a staggering 70%. A separate note shows that cost of sales is made up of production expenses of $25635 million royalty of $$3923 million and change of inventory of $1337 million. Royalty as a percentage of sales works out at 2.40% compared with 2% provided under the Petroleum Agreement. The DPA is made up of $20874 million in respect of development assets representing approximately 5% of development assets and $44 million on Leasehold assets representing 4% of those assets.

Note 5 states that additions to Property plant and equipment include the impact of new provisions and revisions for decommissioning obligations.

Deductions are also made for General and Administrative expenses of $10859 million up from $4292 million in 2020 and include pre-development costs of future projects and Exploration expenses of $4609 million up from $1360 million suggesting multiple cases of the productive operations carrying the cost of exploration activities. This violation of accounting taxation and petroleum principles activities would not be tolerated anywhere except Guyana.

The insane Petroleum Agreement

The income statement also shows financing cost of $822 million up from $520 million in 2020 a sum which also appears in the note on provisioning in the balance sheet. After all these costs are deducted from revenue the Branch reports net income before taxation of $98013 million (2020 – $6877 million) which but for the Petroleum Agreement would be subject to Corporation tax (25%) and to withholding tax (20%) on the deemed distribution branch profit tax (BPT). A deemed distribution is the balance of profit after the Corporation tax less any re-investment of such profits subject to the approval of the Commissioner General.

The Agreement also states that such tax must be included in the taxable income of the Contractor meaning that the $98013 million has to be treated as if it is a post-tax amount requiring grossing up.

Since the Agreement exempts the oil companies from the BPT the Branch then deducts the 25% from the profit or $24503 million (2020 – $1725 million) as though it is an actual sufferance rather than a benefit to be grossed up under Article 15.4 of the Petroleum Agreement. Hess the parent then gets a double benefit by claiming it as overseas tax paid in its US financial statements.

Using its own brand of accounting which treats a benefit as a charge Hess records a Net Income after tax of 45% instead of 70%.

Balance Sheet

The total value of assets of the Branch at yearend was $$679631 million ($469363 million) of which Property plant and equipment accounted for 92% with the remainder spread fairly evenly over cash receivables and advances to operator (Esso). At December 31 the amount of such advance was $14834 million while Trade and other payables of $31346 million (2020 – $14879 million) “mainly relate[d] to amounts owing to [Esso]”.

The Branch’s cash resources stood at $17260 million a substantial increase from the $66 million at December 31 2020 while its commitments for capital expenditure on the Stabroek Block was “approximately $607000 million (US$2900 million) up from G$544000 million (United States Dollars: $2.6 billion) “to be incurred over the next several years”.

Conclusion

As it was in 2020 the financial statements reveal very little by way of disclosure. Readers are no better informed of what makes up exploration operating costs and the less significant general and administrative. Even the most ordinary company in Guyana produces financial statements that are more informative reader-friendly and superior to those of Hess’ Guyana branch. What is particularly noticeable is that the financial statements of the Hess branch are neither consistent with those of its parent abroad or of any of its joint venture partners locally.

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade major corporations are adding abortion travel costs to their employee benefits.

The goal is to ensure their employees can seek abortion care if they live in states where the procedure is now or will soon be illegal. About 26 U.S. states are expected to swiftly outlaw abortion following the overturn of the landmark 1973 ruling according to the Guttmacher Institute which researches reproductive issues.

A trickle of companies announced abortion travel coverage earlier this year after states including Texas introduced restrictive abortion laws. But more corporations have followed in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on Friday with dozens of companies representing millions workers now pledging to cover travel costs in case their employees need abortion care.

Here's a rundown companies that have expanded coverage:

Amazon.com

Whether you're trying to figure out where to go this summer to beat the heat or looking ahead to make plans that will hopefully yield more affordable prices (fingers crossed) we've pulled together a list of the hotels opening up in the next few months that we're most excited about.

From the launch of an entirely new brand from Hyatt in Memphis and two mega hotel openings in New York City to a chic Scandinavian property in Oslo Norway and an ultra-luxe resort in Cancun Mexico here's where to go this summer to catch a whiff of that fabulous brand-new hotel smell.

Aman New York

The strange fate of being a hotel reporter is that hotels ironically keep my brain twisting and turning all night. But of all the incredible properties set to open none have a hold on me quite like what's sure to be one of the most incredible hotels in New York City: the Aman New York. After years of pushing back its opening date the hotel is set to open reservations on July 25 as we previously reported with stays beginning Aug. 2 — and you know we'll be there ASAP.

Set in the historic Crown Building a spot on Fifth Avenue dating back to 1921 that was designed by one of the architecture firms linked to Grand Central Terminal the Aman New York will have 83 suites and 22 private residences. Designed to bring a taste of the brand's Southeast Asia resorts to action-packed midtown Manhattan the property will have suites with working fireplaces marble showers and free-standing soaking tubs plus Japanese murals printed on rice paper.

Amenities you can expect to find at this wellness-focused urban resort include a 25000-square-foot spa a 65-foot indoor swimming pool surrounded by fire pits and private outdoor terraces with hot and cold plunge pools. If that's not enough there will also be restaurants serving Italian and Japanese fare as well as a jazz club with live music.

Long story short: We're counting down the days until Aman New York finally opens. Know that this reporter won't get some shut-eye until he's resting his head on what he imagines will be the fluffiest pillows in all the boroughs.

How to book: Unfortunately rates for the Aman New York are not currently available but we know it'll cost a pretty penny to stay here. We expect rooms will be at least $1000 a night. However there's a solid chance the property will eventually be listed on American Express Fine Hotels + Resorts. If that's the case folks with The Platinum Card® from American Express should be able to use the hotel program to get perks like daily breakfast for two an on-property credit of some sort late checkout at 4 p.m. check-in at noon (when available) and potential room upgrades.

New hotel brands portfolios and collections are popping up left and right these days but one we're keeping a close eye on is Caption by Hyatt a brand that seems similar to more affordable options like Moxy and CitizenM. However Hyatt claims Caption will be different by placing an emphasis on integrating the local culture building functional and inviting public spaces and being tech-forward and convenient.

At the first location in Memphis which opened at the end of June guests will find 136 rooms and suites most of which are compact but manageable at 285 square feet. Historical architectural elements dating back to 1879 have been incorporated into the design while celebrated local brands like Bluff City Fungi Grit Girls Grits Home Place Pastures Joyce Chicken and Grind City Brewing all add a touch of local flavor to the hotel's food and beverage offerings.

The hotel will serve as a great spot to recover from a busy day in the Tennessee summer heat though its location near Beale Street and the South Main Arts District makes it an equally appealing option for a night (or two) out on the town should you want to immerse yourself in Memphis's music scene.

How to book: At this affordable hotel cash rates are available for as low as $136 per night. Award nights for World of Hyatt members are usually 12000 points per night though off-peak rates can be found for 9000 points a night; there are also some peak rates for 15000 points per night. With the World of Hyatt Credit Card you can easily score a few nights at the first Caption property by earning 30000 bonus points after you spend $3000 on purchases in your first three months from account opening. Plus up to 30000 More Bonus Points by earning 2 Bonus Points total per $1 spent in the first six months from account opening on purchases that normally earn 1 Bonus Point on up to $15000 spent.

Nashville never takes a break — seriously. Between live music mouthwatering barbecue and raucous bachelorette parties there's no shortage of fun. Now the city is adding another noteworthy hotel to its constantly expanding selection of properties: the Conrad Nashville.

Set back from the booze and bustle of lower Broadway the now-open Conrad Nashville is serving a quieter form of luxury in its 234 guest rooms and suites. Accommodations feature floor-to-ceiling windows that let in plenty of light while showcasing views of the city plus an airy design that will instantly put you at ease.

Home to eating and drinking establishments like Blue Aster The Lounge at Blue Aster and Thistle & Rye the hotel offers numerous ways to satiate your appetite and quench your thirst. There's also a large rooftop pool deck which is the perfect place to stop for a dip and take in views of Middle Tennessee's rolling hills on a hot summer day.

How to book: Part of Hilton Honors Conrad Nashville is bookable starting at $285 per night for a room with a king-size bed. Award nights will set you back a minimum of 80000 points per night at the moment.

Park Hyatt Chicago

After more than 40 years of welcoming guests the Park Hyatt Chicago has finally gotten the renovation it deserves — to the tune of about $60 million. With the refurbishment officially complete the very first Park Hyatt is now accepting guests as of July 1.

Some of the new features you'll find here include 146 reimagined guest rooms that have a neutral color palette with hints of green and 36 brand-new suites a few of which offer jaw-dropping views of Lake Michigan or Chicago's historic water tower. There's also a new art program and ""thoughtful enhancements"" to the lobby and on-site library.

For dining there's NoMI Kitchen where you'll have your pick of American dishes with a French flair. The eatery also has a lounge and a rooftop terrace the latter of which remains the place for locals and visitors alike to relax with a cocktail on a warm sunny day.

How to book: A World of Hyatt Category 6 hotel the Park Hyatt Chicago currently shows award nights for between 21000 and 29000 points per night depending on whether you choose peak or off-peak dates. Meanwhile cash rates for July start at around $600 a night.

Hilton Maldives Amingiri Resort & Spa

Ah the Maldives. We've all dreamed of visiting but now Hilton Honors members have one more reason to go: the new Hilton Maldives Amingiri Resort & Spa located on the North Malé Atoll.

Here guests can indulge at six restaurants and bars including Eden Champagne & Gin Bar (which sounds like my kind of place) and the waterfront seafood restaurant Origin when they're not enjoying a moment of Zen at the Amingiri Spa.

As far as accommodations go there are 109 to choose from such as overwater bungalows (some with pools) and one- and two-bedroom villas with private pools and beach access. Every option is spacious too offering at least 1485 square feet.

While there are plenty of incredible resorts in the Maldives including the iconic Conrad Maldives Rangali Island which Hilton recently gave a head-to-toe makeover this one looks like it just might check all the boxes for us without quite the sky-high prices of its competitors.

How to book: Cash rates for a one-bedroom overwater villa with a pool are as low as $793 per night while award nights in the same overwater bungalow start at 110000 points per night.

Sommerro — Oslo Norway

(Photo by Chris Aadland)

TPG named Norway one of the best destinations to visit in 2022 for good reason. With new flight routes to the Nordic country and an impressive list of exciting hotels in the pipeline now is the time to plan a trip to Norway.

One hotel opening in the country's capital that we have our eye on is Sommerro a 231-room property that's expected to open in September 2022. The hotel sits within a reborn art deco building that was previously home to the city's electric company. The transformation is the largest preservation project Norway has ever taken on.

Inside the hotel guests will find four restaurants and three bars plus art from Norwegian artists like Per Krohg and both subtle and obvious odes to the local community and its history. However the real star here is what's on top of the building: Oslo's very first year-round (heated) rooftop pool where you can enjoy a winter dip or lounge with a cocktail by the water once summertime rolls around.

How to book: Cash rates at Sommerro start at $188 per night if booked as a member of Preferred Hotels & Resorts' loyalty program I Prefer Rewards.

The Ned NoMad — New York City

Remember earlier when I said NoMad is one of the most transformative neighborhoods in New York City? One of the reasons why is The Ned NoMad a membership club and hotel from the folks behind Soho House that opened in late June with a celebrity-filled party that we were lucky enough to attend.

On the hotel side of The Ned nonmembers can check into one of the club's 167 ""bedrooms"" which are all designed to transport you back to the gold-and-glam era of the roaring 1920s — only a hundred years later. Expect classic touches like club chairs and mahogany desks plus modern amenities such as walk-in rainforest showers and flat-screen TVs.

Regardless of membership status all guests have access to two on-site restaurants: Cecconi's (an Italian-inspired eatery) and Little Ned (a bar with American staples). Should you decide you want to become a member of Ned's Club which costs $2500 per year for existing Soho House members or $4000 to $5000 plus a $350 or $1500 joining fee (depending on age) for non-Soho House members you'll enjoy access to the private parts of the club beyond the hotel rooms and two restaurants.

How to book: Cash rates for an entry-level room at The Ned NoMad start at $500 a night.

Rosewood Vienna

Set to be the fifth Rosewood property in Europe when it opens its door on Aug. 1 Rosewood Vienna will bring the brand's signature elegance and chic design to Vienna's historic Petersplatz.

With 99 rooms and 27 suites the hotel combines the best of European Belle Époque design and modernness throughout including in the stunning 1800-square-foot Presidential Suite. The hotel will have a spa 24-hour room service and even a complimentary house car to help guests get around town.

While the hotel has yet to announce what exactly its food and beverage options will be we do know there will be a restaurant with Austrian flair as well as a bar that will overlook the city's rooftops.

How to book: Cash rates for Rosewood Vienna start at about $794 per night.

Ace Hotel Toronto

Toronto has been a major player in the hotel world lately offering a handful of options that would be worthy of inclusion on this list. But the one property that just really has us going is the Ace Hotel Toronto the first Canadian outpost from New York's Atelier Ace.

Located in Toronto's Fashion District the hotel itself is a work of art created by Shim-Sutcliffe Architects to have a playful but industrial feel. With 124 rooms featuring exposed joints and bricks the design of the hotel we expect will fit right in with other Ace properties in places like Brooklyn New Orleans Sydney and Kyoto Japan.

One thing we love about the Ace brand is its commitment to building community spaces that are chic comfortable and inviting to both the local community and temporary guests visiting the neighborhood and we expect nothing less from this exciting project in Toronto.

How to book: Cash rates at the Ace Hotel Toronto start around $364 per night.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9hcnRpc2Fucy9uZXdzL2VsdmlzLWNpbmVtYXRvZ3JhcGh5LW1hbmR5LXdhbGtlci1iYXotbHVocm1hbm4tMTIzNTMwODAzNi_SAWVodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjIvYXJ0aXNhbnMvbmV3cy9lbHZpcy1jaW5lbWF0b2dyYXBoeS1tYW5keS13YWxrZXItYmF6LWx1aHJtYW5uLTEyMzUzMDgwMzYvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Elvis’ Cinematographer on Recreating the King’s Vegas Showroom for Baz Luhrmann Biopic,"In recreating Elvis Presley’s famous ’68 Comeback Special “Elvis” cinematographer Mandy Walker spent hours watching and examining old footage to faithfully reproduce certain shots and lighting changes for Baz Luhrmann’s biopic.

Walker’s set replicating the Vegas showroom at the International Hilton where Presley had his residency is her proudest accomplishment from the film. “That set was gigantic. We had a full-on concert lighting set-up that we had to reproduce” Walker says.

At one point Walker and the film’s gaffer had considered bringing in professional concert lighting to program and order the lights but she decided it was a job they could pull off. So Walker had traditional single-lamp par can lights flown to the film’s set in Australia.

“We reproduced it all right down to the follow spots and the backdrop colors” Walker says with pride. “There was a stills photographer Alfred Wertheimer who traveled with Elvis during the 1950s. I looked at his work and had all these images in the back of my mind. When you add in all these other elements — the art department costumes and hair and make-up — they all come together in harmony to become the visual language of the film.”

To finish the lighting Walker says she “added modern LED lighting to smooth it out and make sure you could see Austin’s face properly or we’d use LED to complement what we had.”

Popular on Variety

Luhrmann and Walker spent a long time in prep discussing not just the script but the emotional journey of the characters and how the filmmaker wanted to present that to the audience. Walker says Luhrmann liked to keep the camera moving — a lot. But when there were scenes with Presley and his mother Gladys (Helen Thomson) the camera slowed down. Says Walker “In those scenes with Elvis and his mother the camera settles and the two are centered in the frame. We push the depth of field to be more shallow.”

Shooting on the Alexa 65mm helped Walker achieve that intimacy. Walker says “It’s the best format… for intimacy because you can narrow the depth feel down to be very close to a character and not feel what’s going on behind. It’s about focusing the audience on them.”

Toward the end of the film things start to take a dramatic turn as Elvis realizes he is stuck with manager Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks) and must stay in Vegas to complete the residency. When his father and business manager Vernon (Richard Roxburgh) comes to visit Walker shifted the lighting drastically. “We hardly had any light on [Austin] and we wanted it darker to feel how closed in he was” she explains.

With a focal length of up to 160mm the Petzval lens was key for flashback scenes. Walker had one custom-made for the film. “Especially with the morphine-related retelling of stories we would use that to put the audience in the center and the outside would drop out of focus. It would create that feeling of disorientation” Walker says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2J1c2luZXNzL2NlbGVicml0aWVzLXdoby1qdW1wZWQtb24tdGhlLW5mdC1jcmF6ZS1oYXZlLW1peGVkLWZvcnR1bmVzL3NlcmVuYS13aWxsaWFtcy1wYXJpcy1oaWx0b24tL3NsaWRlc2hvdy85MjYyODYxNy5jbXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Serena Williams Paris Hilton... - Celebrities who jumped on the NFT craze have mixed fortunes,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pZGRsZWVhc3Rtb25pdG9yLmNvbS8yMDIyMDcwMy1zZWNvbmQtd29tYW4ta2lsbGVkLWluLXNoYXJrLWF0dGFjay1pbi1lZ3lwdHMtcmVkLXNlYS_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWRkbGVlYXN0bW9uaXRvci5jb20vMjAyMjA3MDMtc2Vjb25kLXdvbWFuLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1zaGFyay1hdHRhY2staW4tZWd5cHRzLXJlZC1zZWEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Second woman killed in shark attack in Egypt's Red Sea,"Two women were killed in shark attacks in Egypt’s Red Sea south of the city of Hurghada the Egyptian Ministry of Environment said on Sunday Reuters reported.

Holidaymakers are returning to ports and airports as travel restrictions are eased and the travel business slowly returns to its old routes.

But tourists won’t always be satisfied with the same old destinations - where will the holidays of the future take us?

There are already hotels under the sea there’s talk of nuclear-powered hotels that will cruise the skies 24/7 and maybe even one day a hotel on the Moon.

Mark Smith head of business development at Simplexity Travel said: “As the world shrinks and long-haul travel experiences become the norm holidaymakers are going to want more unusual experiences with extreme tourism set to grow”.

(Image: AFP via Getty Images)

There’s nothing more extreme than holidays in space and the first space tourists have already undertaken brief orbital flights - and soon we could go further.

“Whether one day we will build a hotel off the moon which is something that I’ve always dreamed of or whether we’ll leave that to my children to do we’ll have to see” says Richard Branson.

The dream of a Moon hotel predates the first Moon landing.

In 1969 shortly before Neil Armstrong first set foot on the lunar surface hotel entrepreneur Conrad Hilton said: “I firmly believe that we are going to have hotels in outer space perhaps even soon enough for me to officiate at the formal opening of the first.""

(Image: Orbital Assembly)

Hotelier Robert Bigelow promised in 2017 that the would have an inflatable Moon hotel operational by 2022. We’re still waiting.

Patron Moon a nuclear-powered lunar resort was announced in late 2019. At the time the Russian corporation behind the project hoped to have its Moon hotel taking bookings within ten years.

Each trip – expected to last around three days – was set to cost between $10million and $30million.

The underground moon base has been delayed by the pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine – but a dirty weekend in orbit might be a possibility in the near future.

(Image: bigelowaerospace.com)

Orbital Assembly Corporation a new construction company run by former pilot John Blincow plans to open a luxury space hotel by 2027.

""We're trying to make the public realise that this golden age of space travel is just around the corner. It's coming. It's coming fast"" Blincow told CNN.

China could also soon be a major player in space tourism.

While its primary purpose of the Tiangong space station is said to be scientific the Chinese space agency is eyeing space tourism as a possible way to finance the project with an announcement of plans to open Tiangong up to tourism within the decade.

(Image: Orbital Assembly)

With Chinese industrial growth producing record numbers of new billionaires there are plenty of potential customers for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Tiangong which translates to “Palace in the Sky”.

Holidays in space aren’t a realistic prospect for most people though. Instead for an ""out of this world"" experience you could consider a hotel under the sea.

The Hilton Muraka – a micro-hotel submerged 16 feet below the sea in the Maldives offers spectacular floor-to-ceiling glass walls to take in the Indian Ocean's marine life.

The underwater suites at the Atlantis Palm in Dubai offer views of the legendary sunken city – with sharks and rays swimming idly among the mocked-up ruins.

But with each room costing around $7000 (just under £6000) for a single night perhaps we’ll have to accept that we will have to make so with the same old holiday resorts for a few more years after all.

Meanwhile a wildly ambitious design for a “flying hotel” that could carry 5000 passengers in unparalleled luxury has been featured in a new video.

(Image: Hashem Al-Ghaili/ Youtube)

The AI-piloted Sky Cruise – which has 20 engines powered by nuclear fusion – is designed never to land.

Instead conventional airliners would ferry passengers to and from the Sky Cruise and even all running repairs would be carried out in-flight.

Hashem Alghaili who created the incredibly detailed mock-up of the monster aircraft says the nuclear-powered sky cruise “could be the future of transport”.

Home Depot is the world’s largest home improvement retailer with about 490600 employees and more than $151 billion in revenue. Home Depot’s stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: HD) and is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

A brief history of Home Depot

Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank the two founders of Home Depot worked as president and chairman of the board and CFO respectively in Handy Dan Home Improvement Centers — one of the first home improvement retailers in the U.S. In the late ‘70s Handy Dan found itself in the midst of a brutal corporate takeover which led to the sack of Marcus and Blank.

Then they both decided to establish a kind of store that did not exist at that time a one-stop-shop for the do-it-yourself-er. At that time a big project might require a customer to go shopping in two or more stores to get everything they need. With help from investment banker Ken Langone and merchandising guru Pat Farrah they opened their first two Home Depot stores on June 22 1979 in Atlanta Georgia.

Though they were much smaller in comparison to today’s stores the first stores at around 60000 square feet each dwarfed the competition and stocked 25000 products much more than the average hardware store at that time. On September 22 1981 Home Depot went public on NASDAQ and raised $4.093 million.

Who Owns Home Depot:

Home Depot’s stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “HD” and is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. It has been traded on the NYSE since April 19 1984. According to CNN Business its top shareholders include the Vanguard Group (8.66%) BlackRock Fund Advisors (4.54%) SSgA Funds Management Inc. (4.44%) Capital Research & Management Co. (3.91%) and Geode Capital Management LLC (1.69%).

Home Depot’s Mission Statement

“To provide the highest level of service the broadest selection of products and the most competitive prices”.

His father's unusual murder conviction has now been thrown out,"CNN —

On the final morning of his short life 22-month-old Cooper Harris was up early at 5:15 an hour before sunrise in the Atlanta suburb where he lived with his parents.

His father Justin Ross Harris a 33-year-old web developer brought the still-groggy toddler into the bed he shared with Leanna Taylor his wife of eight years. Just under three feet tall with wisps of blond hair framing his cherubic face Cooper snuggled with mom and dad – and nodded out again.

Before the sun rose over the Cobb County city of Marietta that morning on June 18 2014 Harris had already sent or exchanged online messages – some sexual in nature – with at least four young women one of them 17.

At 9:26 a.m. after a leisurely “daddy/son breakfast” at Chick-fil-A – his son’s belly “full of sausage biscuit” in the words of Cooper’s mom – Harris closed the door of his Hyundai Tucson SUV.

Carrying a Chick-fil-A cup and his work bag Harris walked to his cubicle at the Home Depot offices leaving Cooper – who he was supposed to drop off at a day care center as usual that morning – strapped in a rear-facing car seat for the next seven hours.

This detailed recounting of Cooper’s last hours and his father’s actions that day are gleaned from a June 22 Georgia Supreme Court ruling which meticulously chronicled the evidence presented at Harris’ murder trial in its decision to overturn his conviction for deliberately leaving his son to die of hyperthermia in the hot SUV.

The ruling came in a month in which at least five heat-related car deaths involving children were reported in the United Sates according to the NoHeatStroke.org data website as temperatures soared and parts of the country endured heat waves.

These nightmarish cases often draw national attention. But they rarely lead to murder charges from prosecutors who must weigh the intent of grieving parents who insist they simply forgot leaving their child in a hot car.

At least seven heat-related car deaths reported this year

Cooper’s death was heartbreakingly familiar: 31 children died of vehicular heatstroke in the United States in 2014 the year the boy died according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

At least nine deaths have been reported this year and more than 900 since 1998 – or 38 per year on average according to the NHTSA and NoHeatStroke.org which is run by San Jose University’s Department of Meteorology and Climate Science.

July is usually the deadliest month and it started with a death on Friday. A 1-year-old child died in a hot car while their father was at work in Mebane North Carolina police said. The death is being investigated and no charges had been filed. Mebane police said they were conferring with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office.

In Danielsville Georgia on Thursday a 1-year-old child died after being left in a hot vehicle by their mother according to the Madison County Sheriff’s Office. The death appeared accidental and the Northern Judicial Circuit District Attorney’s Office will review the case.

On Tuesday an 18-month-old boy died after being left in a car in Virginia for several hours police in Chesterfield County said. The father who accidentally left the boy in the car later took his own life.

Last Sunday in southern Georgia a 3-year-old boy died after being left in a hot SUV for nearly three hours. The preliminary cause of death is asphyxiation according to Muscogee County Coroner Buddy Bryan. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation was performing an autopsy and results could up to five months to complete Bryan said.

In Texas on June 20 a 5-year-old died after he was left in a car outside the family’s Houston home while his mother prepared her daughter’s birthday party. Child welfare authorities were investigating and it’s unclear if the mother will face charges CNN affiliate KTRK reported.

Most pediatric hot-car deaths occur because the child is forgotten by a caregiver according to Jan Null a lecturer in meteorology and climate science at San Jose State.

Monica McCoy a psychology professor at Converse College in South Carolina who has studied prosecutions following the death of children in hot cars said her unpublished research of 508 cases showed that serious charges such as homicide are unusual – filed in 9.6% of the cases.

“Murder charges are fairly rare and convictions are even less likely” she said in an email. “Sometimes harsh charges are filed immediately following the death but they are later reduced or dropped… Parents are also much more likely to be charged in cases when drugs or alcohol are involved.”

Georgia Supreme Court decision reignites sensational case

The case surrounding Cooper Harris’ death stood out in particular because murder charges were brought against his father with the prosecution asserting Harris killed the boy to free himself of the burdens of fatherhood.

Harris is serving a sentence of life without parole after prosecutors in 2016 convinced a Cobb County jury that he lived a “double life” – a loving and involved dad in one a philanderer and sexual predator in the other.

His extramarital affairs the state argued motivated his decision to leave his only son to “die a slow and painful death” in the hot SUV.

The Georgia Supreme Court ruling reignites at least for the moment a sensational criminal case that was tried about 300 miles from Cobb County because of intense pretrial publicity.

READ: Georgia Supreme Court overturns hot car death conviction

The state’s highest court ruled 6-3 that extensive evidence presented to the jury “convincingly demonstrated” Harris was “a philanderer a pervert and even a sexual predator” but “did little if anything to answer the key question” of his intent when he walked away from his son.

“Because the properly admitted evidence that Appellant maliciously and intentionally left Cooper to die was far from overwhelming” the court’s opinion said “we cannot say that it is highly probable that the erroneously admitted sexual evidence did not contribute to the jury’s guilty verdicts.”

Harris was convicted of three counts of murder for his son’s death two counts of cruelty to children and three counts related to electronic exchanges of lewd material with a minor.

The high court reversed the convictions related to the crimes against his son ruling that the extensive evidence about his sexual activities was “extremely and unfairly prejudicial.”

The court left in place the charges related to his exchanges with an underage girl.

Harris was sentenced to a total of 12 years on those three charges: Ten years for one count of attempt to commit sexual exploitation of a child and one year each for two counts of dissemination of harmful material to a minor according to the ruling.

CNN has sought comment from Harris’ attorneys.

The Cobb County District Attorney’s Office said it plans to file a motion for the court to reconsider the ruling but declined further comment.

Leanna Taylor testifies at her ex-husband's murder trial. John Bazemore/AP

Cooper’s mother Leanna Taylor said after the Georgia Supreme Court ruling that she hoped it helps change the way her son is remembered.

“That he was wanted that he was loved and that he is missed every single day” she said in a statement released by her attorney Lawrence Zimmerman.

She reiterated her belief that Harris did not intend to kill their only child that hot day. That’s what she told police that day in 2014 – and what she testified at Harris’ trial two years later.

She stands by those words.

“While this will not change anything about my day-to-day life I do hope it shows people what those closest to the case have been saying from the beginning” Taylor said in the statement.

“Ross was a loving and proud father to Cooper. At the same time Ross was being a terrible husband. These two things can and did exist at the same time.”

‘I love my son and all but we both need escapes’

Harris spent a lot of time sending messages on a dating website or communicating with women via the Whisper messaging app which encourages users to share intimate secrets online.

The hours before his son died were no different according to the state Supreme Court’s recounting of the trial evidence.

Just after midnight on June 18 2014 Harris messaged a then 17-year-old girl he began contacting when she was 16. There were also exchanges with a 21-year-old woman about their previous sexual encounter in his SUV earlier that year.

At 12:48 a.m. Harris also conducted a Google search for child passport fees – apparently related to a family cruise that Taylor later told jurors they were planning with in-laws and their children.

Between 5:46 and 5:49 that morning Harris sent or exchanged more online messages with at least three women.

Taylor left for work about 7:15 a.m. Cooper played and watched cartoons at home for the next 45 minutes while dad responded to four Whisper posts – three of them sexual in nature.

Cooper and his father left home about 8:30 a.m. Harris strapped the toddler in the red car seat in the middle of the SUV’s back row – less than four inches from the driver’s seat but facing the tinted rear windows.

Harris would later tell police that they were running late that morning. The day care center stopped serving kids breakfast at 8:45 a.m. Harris responded to two Whisper posts and an email from a co-worker on the way to Chick-fil-A where he and Cooper spent about 20 minutes having breakfast.

In the restaurant Harris responded to a Whisper post that read: “I hate being married with kids. The novelty has worn off and I have nothing to show for it.”

“I miss having time by myself and going out with friends” Harris wrote.

He followed with two other messages: “My wife is upset when I want to go out with friends” and “I love my son and all but we both need escapes.”

Harris and Cooper left the restaurant about 9:20 a.m.

“Ready let’s go” Harris said after putting his son back in the car seat and giving him a kiss according to the lead detective on the case.

Cooper gave his dad a kiss.

After a traffic light Harris continued driving straight to his office – about four minutes away – rather than making a left turn to the day care center. He pulled into the office parking lot found a space and walked to his cubicle.

At work Harris exchanged various messages with people.

A travel agent sent him information on the family cruise. He looked up one cruise line. There were messages with a paramour and responses to various Whisper posts – including telling one user that his son woke him at 5:30 that morning.

“He’s awesome” Harris wrote back referring to his son.

At 11:38 a.m. Harris went out to lunch with coworkers at a Publix. They also stopped at a Home Depot store where Harris purchased light bulbs. They dropped Harris off at the parking lot where surveillance video showed him leaving a bag with the bulbs on the front seat of the Tucson at 12:42 p.m.

A test showed car seat temperature reached 125 degrees

The temperature at 12:58 p.m. that day was about 88 degrees according to the ruling by the state’s highest court.

An expert tested temperatures on the car seat in the SUV parked in the same space three weeks after Cooper’s death. The outside temperature was similar on both days. The car seat temperatures ranged from 88 degrees at 11:35 a.m. to 125 degrees at about 3:30 p.m.

At his cubicle that afternoon Harris messaged women for a few hours including one in which he asked a woman for a picture of her breasts. She sent a photo. He also asked the minor for a picture of her breast – which she sent.

“Yummy” Harris wrote back.

There were other messages sexual in nature with at least two other women. Harris sent one woman a picture of his penis.

At 3:16 p.m. Harris wrote Taylor: “When are you getting my buddy.”

During a subsequent phone conversation Taylor agreed to pick up Cooper at the day care center. Harris was going to a movie with his friends after work.

At 4:16 p.m. Harris got into the SUV. He drove off a few seconds later. He later told police that he saw Cooper sitting in the back seat while looking to change lanes on his way to the movie theater.

Harris pulled into a parking lot about two miles from where he worked. He removed Cooper from the car seat and put him on the pavement.

“What have I done?” he yelled repeatedly according to witnesses.

“I’ve killed my son.”

“She’s going to kill me.”

One witness testified at trial that Harris tried to do CPR but did it incorrectly.

The witness performed CPR though “it was almost immediately clear to him that Cooper was dead” according to the state Supreme Court ruling.

Harris walked away and paced while on his phone. Two witnesses called 911. Police arrived at 4:24 p.m.

One officer tried CPR. Another officer described Harris as going from “calm to shrieking to calm again.”

“It just seemed very random and very odd” the officer said.

Yet another officer testified that Harris alternated between a calm state and a “monotone yelling” she said seemed “real forced” according to the ruling.

Harris was asked for identification.

“Shut the f**k up my son just died” he told one officer. Harris was handcuffed and taken to the back of a police car.

Harris later told police he had forgotten to drop off Cooper at day care. He had also forgotten to take a “second look” at the car seat before leaving the SUV.

“I swore I dropped him off” Harris insisted.

A crime scene technician described the back of the SUV as reeking of a “hot musty urine-soaked diaper.”

Prosecuting parents ‘not the answer’ mom says

During questioning by detectives that day Harris at one point began to cry.

“Oh god.”

“My boy.”

“Why?”

Harris told police that despite ordinary “ups and downs” his marriage with Taylor was good. He said leaving Cooper in the SUV was “an accident” and that he had seen a news report about a man who had left his child in a car and then became an advocate.

“The … worst fear for me is to leave my son in a hot car” Harris told detectives.

After being told that he was being arrested for felony murder and cruelty to children Harris was allowed to speak with Taylor. He cried and insisted the death was an accident. Harris told her Cooper was “in Heaven and his time on earth is done.”

An autopsy showed Cooper died of hyperthermia. The toddler likely would have had suffered nausea a headache anxiety and possibly seizures a medical examiner testified at the trial.

Cooper likely struggled as he became more uncomfortable. Small abrasions on his head hands and feet were likely caused from the painful rubbing against hot parts of the car seat according to the medical examiner.

Taylor day care teachers relatives and friends of both Taylor and Harris testified that he was “a loving caring and involved father” the Supreme Court ruling said. There was no evidence he had previously abused the boy.

On November 14 2016 Harris was found guilty on all charges after nearly three and half days of jury deliberations.

The following month he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for malice murder and consecutive sentences of 20 years for first-degree child cruelty 10 years for attempt to commit sexual exploitation of a child and one year for each count of dissemination of harmful material to a minor.

Georgia’s Supreme Court ruled that evidence submitted by prosecutors of Harris’ extramarital sexual relationships – which the state portrayed as the motivation for killing his son – had unfair prejudicial impact on the jury.

The day after the ruling Taylor said “overreaching” Cobb County prosecutors and “their misuse of power” ultimately led to the court’s decision.

“It’s been 8 years since Cooper died and children have continued to die the same way every year” she said in her statement. “Wasting precious resources prosecuting the parents that this happens to is not the answer.”

Taylor urged legislators to “put the money into what could actually save the lives” with laws requiring devices that can “stop these tragedies.”

In late June 2014 Taylor told mourners at her son’s funeral that Harris was “a wonderful daddy” and that “Cooper meant the world to him.”

Taylor said she had worried about not being able to have a child. She recalled the joy she felt the day Cooper was born – “a 6-pound 8-ounce perfect baby.”

“As children do he turned our lives upside down” she said. “I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”

The last two nights of Cooper’s life Taylor said he had trouble sleeping and ended up in bed between her and Harris.

“I remember turning over in the middle of the night his mouth was open and his full toddler lips just breathing right into my face” she said. “I will cherish that moment forever.”

Harris was allowed to call the funeral service in Tuscaloosa Alabama from the Cobb County Jail outside Atlanta. He briefly addressed the crowd by speaker phone.

“Thank you for everything you’ve done for my boy” he said.

“I’m just sorry I can’t be there” he added.

After the service Taylor followed her son’s casket out of the church while still on the phone with Harris.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ncmFuZC1yYXBpZHMvMjAyMi8wNy90cnVlLWNyaW1lLXR2LXNob3ctbG9va3MtYXQtd2VzdC1taWNoaWdhbi1tYW4tanVkZ2UtY2FsbGVkLW1vbnN0ZXItYWZ0ZXItMi1zbGFpbi5odG1s0gGUAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dyYW5kLXJhcGlkcy8yMDIyLzA3L3RydWUtY3JpbWUtdHYtc2hvdy1sb29rcy1hdC13ZXN0LW1pY2hpZ2FuLW1hbi1qdWRnZS1jYWxsZWQtbW9uc3Rlci1hZnRlci0yLXNsYWluLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,True crime TV show looks at West Michigan man judge called ‘monster’ after 2 slain,"GRAND RAPIDS MI -- In October 2020 a Kent County judge described George Yzaguirre as “clearly a monster” for stabbing two people to death including a roommate stabbed 70 times.

Yzaguirre’s brutal and heinous crimes are now being examined in a true crime TV show. Yzaguirre ended up committing suicide in prison about seven months after he was sentenced to life in prison. He was 37.

The “Evil Lives Here” show on the Investigation Discovery channel will look at Yzaguirre’s case in a broadcast set to air Sunday July 3 at 9 p.m. The episode can be seen the same day on the Discovery+ streaming service.

Yzaguirre was living with 34-year-old David Isner Jr. at a Kentwood duplex in November 2019. They had been longtime friends.

Kentwood police said Yzaguirre told detectives he was upset at something Isner said to him. So he waited for Isner to go to sleep before attacking him.

Evidence showed he stabbed Isner more than 70 times. He then dumped the body in an open area near Lake Michigan Drive and Wilson Avenue NW.

Police think Isner died Nov. 28 2019.

Officers responded to the duplex on Dec. 2 2019 on a missing persons report filed by Isner’s family who had not seen him in several days. Officers found “an alarming amount of blood” inside the unit but no sign of anyone.

Related: ‘An alarming amount of blood’ in Kentwood duplex prior to double-homicide discovery: police

The following morning Yzaguirre went to a Home Depot near 54th Street and Division Avenue and asked a worker to call police because he wanted to turn himself in “for killing two of his friends.”

It was then that they learned in interviewing Yzaguirre where to find Isner’s body.

Yzaguirre also told them he killed another man 63-year-old Ed Fuller at Fuller’s home in the Pinegate Village Mobile Home Park off Division Avenue south of 76th Street. He intended to rob Fuller. Police went there and found the body.

Yzaguirre ended up pleading guilty in August 2020 to two counts of murder.

At his sentencing Kent County Circuit Judge Mark Trusock described his crimes as “an extremely disturbing set of circumstances.”

““You sir clearly are a monster and a threat to society” Trusock said.

Yzaguirre’s attorney said his actions were fueled by drug and alcohol abuse and that the “demons won out.”

Isner was a father to three including a son just a few months old.

“This historic agreement represents a unique opportunity to return traditional homelands back to Indigenous people to steward for the benefit of their community” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in a Wednesday news release.

“We look forward to drawing upon the Onondaga Nation’s expertise and Indigenous knowledge in helping manage the area’s valuable wildlife and habitat. Consistent with the President’s America the Beautiful initiative all of us have a role to play in this Administration’s work to ensure our conservation efforts are locally led and support communities’ health and well-being.”

The land transfer includes the headwaters of Onondaga Creek more than 45 acres of wetland and flood plains and approximately 980 acres of forest and fields says the Department of Interior. The area is also home to a variety of wildlife including brook trout in the creek great blue heron songbirds waterfowl hawks bald eagles frogs bats and white-tailed deer.

Onondaga Nation Chief Tadodaho Sidney Hill expressed joy at the milestone land return.

“It is with great joy that the Onondaga Nation welcomes the return of the first substantial acreage of its ancestral homelands” said Hill in the release. “The Nation can now renew its stewardship obligations to restore these lands and waters and to preserve them for the future generations yet to come.”

“The Nation hopes that this cooperative government-to-government effort will be another step in healing between themselves and all others who live in this region which has been the homeland of the Onondaga Nation since the dawn of time” Hill continued.

The land was previously owned by Honeywell which was ordered to sign over the title and full ownership of the property to the Onondaga Nation by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as part of a settlement reached over Honeywell’s contamination of the environment.

For years Honeywell contaminated the Onondaga Lake parts of its tributaries and the surrounding wetlands with mercury and other dangerous substances according to a 2017 release from the Department of Justice. A 2018 settlement through the Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration (NRDAR) Program required Honeywell to turn the land over to the Onondaga Nation and to implement 18 restoration projects on the affected land according to the Department of Interior.

Honeywell which operated several manufacturing plants in Onondaga County is currently working on several of those restoration programs including grassland restoration preservation of wetland habitat and improvement of public services like hiking trails and a public boat ramp says the Department of Interior.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc3B5LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9oYWNrcy9ob21lLWhhY2tzL2FtYXpvbi1zbWFydC10aGVybW9zdGF0LXJldmlldy0xMjAyODY1MzAwL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vc3B5LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9oYWNrcy9ob21lLWhhY2tzL2FtYXpvbi1zbWFydC10aGVybW9zdGF0LXJldmlldy0xMjAyODY1MzAwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Smart Thermostat Review: A Phenomenally Affordable Nest Alternative,"Perhaps more than any other piece of smart home tech smart thermostats are some of the more ubiquitous products on the market. In fact it feels like the thermostats pioneered by the likes of Nest and others were one of the very first steps into making large portions of smart home technology more consumer-friendly.

Now pretty much every major company offers a smart thermostat which means making a selection both easier and more difficult due to the sheer amount of options around. Naturally Amazon has its own take on a smart thermostat offering a plentiful amount of features for what seems to be a pretty compelling price. SPY was sent a unit for review so we could test how Amazon’s product measures up. Read on for our full Amazon Smart Thermostat review below.

Amazon Smart Thermostat: Setup

Depending upon your existing HVAC/Thermostat setup the Amazon Smart Thermostat will likely go one of two ways with one more complicated than the other. If you don’t currently have a C-Wire adaptor you’ll need to purchase a version of the thermostat that includes this adaptor. I can’t speak to how long that process will take to install but most newer homes and newer HVAC systems should have them included already. The good news is that if you have an existing C-Wire setup is super easy.

In my rental the existing system was pretty well set for a simple swap; I didn’t need to install any new mounts or rewire any existing wires. Instead I just removed my existing Honeywell thermostat and clicked in the new one. From there I walked through the install process on the Amazon Alexa app (keep the packaging handy as you’ll need to scan a QR code) which prompted me to map a diagram of my wire setup and do some tests to ensure the heat and A/C were functioning properly and that was it.

The entire process took about 15 minutes or so making it extremely easy — especially for someone with no experience with replacing or even installing thermostats to begin with. I was worried I’d mess something up in the process but didn’t encounter that issue here in any way. At least for now. We’ll see if my next electric bill says differently. If you have any questions about installing your unit definitely call an HVAC professional.

Amazon Smart Thermostat: Design

The Amazon Smart Thermostat is pretty minimal. It doesn’t overwhelm you with elegance like a Nest thermostat might but it’s a step up from an existing digital unit I previously had looking and feeling really nice. I would sometimes encounter issues where I’d need to get right up to the old unit to see the temperature but that’s not the case with this new unit. The digital temperature display is always slightly backlit so even just a passing glance will let you know what you need to know with ease.

Tapping the bottom left or right sides of the unit allows you to toggle the temperature and the center button cycles through different temperature settings with corresponding icons displaying on the unit itself. For example A/C is designated as a blue snowflake. Overall it’s pretty simple but that’s more than fine with me.

Amazon Smart Thermostat: Coolest Features

Upon the completion of the installation the unit operates in a few different ways. You can manually change the temperature on the unit itself through the Amazon Alexa application through voice control or Hunches. The first three sort of speak for themselves; the touch display on the thermostat itself is responsive thanks to those up and down arrows on either side of the main control button. The Amazon Alexa app uses your smartphone’s touch screen to present more of a dial-like control which allows you to either use a slider or arrows at the bottom to control it. You can also ask Alexa to set a temperature for you by using voice control. The app also allows you to set customized schedules check on the overall energy usage of your system and toggle between heat and AC.

Hunches is a little more complicated — but only slightly so. Essentially Hunches operate on a pre-determined schedule you can set in the app. For example you can set a designated home away and sleep temperature and the Amazon Smart Thermostat will react accordingly. If you turn on GPS the unit will sense you’re away and adjust the temperature to that pre-determined setting. Additionally the unit can sense when you’ve gone to sleep and raise or lower that temperature accordingly. You can add additional users to this if you live with someone — I learned this the hard way after I left for the evening and my partner texted me asking why it’d gotten warmer in the house — so definitely be sure to add them into the mix.

Amazon Smart Thermostat: Performance

Without question the Amazon Smart Thermostat works exactly as advertised. Whether controlling it on the unit itself using Hunches voice control or using the app everything works as intended. Hunches in particular is good at sensing when I was in bed and adjusting accordingly. As I mentioned Hunches seemingly worked too well noticing when I was gone and adjusting while my partner was still at home. The ability to adjust on the fly is good if you’re coming back home from somewhere and want to cool or heat the house accordingly. Voice control is just as sharp allowing you to even tell Alexa that you’re heading out which will prompt the Smart Thermostat to go ahead and adjust to that temp.

The one slightly annoying thing is how long it takes you to get into the actual thermostat control in the Alexa mobile app. It’s not a dealbreaker (especially for the outstanding price of the unit) but it is just annoying. More often than not I found myself just walking over to the unit to adjust the temp instead of opening the app. Setting the unit as a shortcut in your devices helps but it’s not quite as quick as I’d hoped or liked.

I’ve also seen some feedback around multi-zone control needing some work; that’s not an issue I ran into here as I just have the one thermostat so you may need to do your own research into that if your setup leverages multiple zones. The other thing is that the unit doesn’t work with Apple HomeKit or Google Home so this one may not be for you if you’re currently using those services.

The Verdict: Finally A Nest Alternative for the Amazon Ecosystem

The Amazon Smart Thermostat is well worth it for those who haven’t made it into the smart thermostat space and are looking to get a unit that offers strong features for a good price. It’s simple yet powerful and makes a really strong impression because of it.

So Should You Buy It?

If you don’t have one already yes without a doubt. It’s a bargain at $60 and works well even if you don’t have an Amazon Alexa unit in your home. It’s kind of a bummer you can’t use it with other smart home services but if you don’t mind that or don’t have those well it’s a slam dunk.

Pros:

Easy to set up and use

Fantastic price

Great value

Hunches work well

Cons:

Mobile app needs to be streamlined

No use with Apple/Google smart home interfaces

What Are Some Alternatives?

While we’re pretty happy with the Amazon Smart Thermostat we realize that it never hurts to shop around. Here are some alternatives to consider.

1. Honeywell Home Wi-Fi Color Smart Thermostat

Honeywell’s smart unit has a vivid color display and provides a real-time look at the humidity and temperatures both inside and outside your home.

2. Google Nest Learning Thermostat

Nest is the smart thermostat that started it all and continues to be among one the best in the market. Can’t go wrong with a classic.

3. Ecobee3 Lite SmartThermostat

Ecobee’s third iteration of their lite smart thermostat is a good mid-level option to consider if you’re looking to upgrade over an existing unit or just have a little more money on hand to invest in something right out of the gate.

And it's not just bigger and better versions of the classic V8 engine that are packing a punch.

The transition from gas to electric has unlocked another level of performance and automakers are taking full advantage of the technology.

Here's where things stand among volume models for 2022:

2022 Lucid Air Dream Edition Performance 1111 hp

The Lucid Air may be a luxury sedan but it's powered by a dynamo. The top version of the all-wheel-drive Arizona-built car is rated at 1111 hp and can accelerate to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds while providing one of the roomiest interiors in its class. And while the $169000 model is sold out an Air Grand Touring with 1050 hp is still available for $154000.

2021 Tesla Model S and Model S Plaid: 1020 hp

The Tesla Model S sedan and Model X SUV are both available with a Plaid powertrain that's a reference to the movie ""Spaceballs"" and uses three electric motors to provide 1020 hp in the $135900 and $138900 vehicles.

2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon: 808 hp

The resurrected Demon is so extreme that one leading automotive publication has called for it to be banned (and was promptly shouted down by the muscle car's fans.) The beast came with drag radials a transmission brake just one seat and can pop a wheelie. Its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 makes 808 hp on pump gas and if somehow you don't think that's enough Dodge can make it compatible with 100 octane race gas that bumps it up to 840 hp.

2020 Dodge Challenger SRT Super Stock: 807 hp

Dodge only built 3300 Demons and promised owners it wouldn't make any more. It kept that promise but only just. The 2020 Challenger SRT Super Stock checks in with 807 hp from its Hellcat V8. It doesn't have a transmission brake and can't pop a wheelie but it will cover a quarter-mile in 10.5 seconds and Dodge will build as many as the market wants.

2022 Dodge Challenger SRT and Charger SRT Jailbreak

Dodge offers a motor on par with the Challenger SRT Super Stock's in the Challenger and Charger Jailbreak models which allow customers to mix a wide variety paint trim and packages to create truly unique cars starting at $87120 and $89190.

2019 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye: 797 hp

Dodge says the Hellcat Redeye is possessed by the Demon. We don't know about that but its 797 hp engine does scream like a banshee.

2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500: 760 hp

The Shelby GT500 has always been a drag racing special but Ford promises this upcoming edition will be able to take turns as well as go in a straight line.

2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1: 755 hp

The 2019 ZR1 is the most powerful front-engine Corvette in history and will likely be for eternity because the Corvette was replaced an all-new mid-engine version in 2020.

2019 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat 717 hp

To celebrate its fourth anniversary the standard Challenger SRT Hellcat got a 10 hp boost. It really didn't need it.

2015 Dodge Challenger/Charger SRT Hellcat: 707 hp

Dodge's original Hellcat bros seem tame compared to their successors but are still serious forces to be reckoned with. If you can't decide between the two here's something to keep in mind: while the Challenger can hit 199 mph the Charger's slightly more aerodynamic body is good for 204 mph.

2022 CADILLAC CT5-V BLACKWING: 668 hp

The $84940 CT5-V Blackwing is a luxury sedan powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 that has just two less horsepower than a NASCAR Cup Series car and a top speed over 200 mph. Don't expect to see something like it again because Cadillac has vowed to go all-electric by 2030.

2014 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500: 662 hp

When it was new the last Shelby GT500 was the most powerful American car ever but it looks like a 98-pound weakling today. Still there's no denying the potency of its 5.8-liter supercharged V8. And who's going to complain about a Mustang that can go 202 mph?

2020 Ford GT: 660 hp (up from 647 hp in 2017)

What a world we live in where a Mustang is more powerful than a $450000 supercar but the carbon fiber GT has a 216 mph top speed to go with it so it's got nothing to be ashamed of.

2018 Chevrolet Corvette Z06/Camaro ZL1: 650 hp

Two high performance cars from the same company with 6.2-liter supercharged V8s? Hmmm sounds familiar. But while the power outputs of these two are identical their engines are a little different. The Corvette gets a dry sump oiling system that's better for the track while the ZL1 uses a tried and true wet sump design. The 'Vette also beats the Camaro on manual transmission gear count 7 to 6. But the ZL1 automatic comes back strong with an all-new 10-speed automatic while the one in the Z06 makes do with just eight.

2017 Dodge Viper: 645 hp

The Viper's 8.4-liter V10 was the largest engine in any car of its day.

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade major corporations are adding abortion travel costs to their employee benefits.

The goal is to ensure their employees can seek abortion care if they live in states where the procedure is now or will soon be illegal. About 26 U.S. states are expected to swiftly outlaw abortion following the overturn of the landmark 1973 ruling according to the Guttmacher Institute which researches reproductive issues.

All you need to know | Mint,"In a bid to give relief to Delhi residents the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has made the vehicle loan process simpler. The Delhi government has integrated 62 banks and NBFCs with its Hypothecation (HP) services. With this the Delhites can avail hypothecation services which include addition continuation and termination of hypothecation of vehicle loans at the convenience of their doorstep.

Delhi government said that through this initiative citizens will no longer be required to submit any physical documents or visit any establishment for any HPT-related services which see nearly 2 lakh transactions yearly.

""Hypothecation services in Delhi go completely faceless. With 62 Banks & NBFC onboarded no more going to RTO for Hypothecation services. Once a loan is completed your updated RC will automatically be available on m-parivahan and Digi locker"" Delhi Transport Department wrote on Twitter.

Delhi Transport Minister has issued directions to the department to block manual HPT services on all banks/ NBFCs. HDFC and ICICI Bank which comprise 70-80% of all vehicle loans in Delhi have already been integrated into the system the city's transport department said.

As per a circular dated October 4 2021 the Delhi Transport Department had instructed vehicle loan-providing banks financial institutions and NBFCs to integrate their hypothecation services with Vahan Portal so that the no-objection certificate (NOC) for HP termination can be received in digital format at the Vahan platform of the National Informatics Centre (NIC) directly.

For this all the banks/NBFCs which are in the business of financing vehicles in Delhi have been issued APIs and user credentials for integration with Vahan for online sharing of hypothecation termination data.

Banks/NBFCs were also directed to complete the integration of Hypothecation Addition (HPA) services with Vahan portal so that full integration could be completed.

Since the launch of faceless services in February 2021 more than 2.62 lakh HP-related services have been availed.

As a result there is no requirement for the applicants to obtain Form 35/NOC from their banks and apply to the Transport Department for HP termination by uploading these documents.

After the auto-termination of HP the updated Registration Certificate (RC) has been made available on mParivahan and DigiLocker platforms. The vehicle owners are also informed of the automatic termination of their HP through SMS.

Jack John released a new LP Meet The Moonlight on Friday June 24th. Just two and a half hours later he announced via social media that he had tested positive for COVID and would need to reschedule his concerts Hartford CT; Camden NJ; Cuyahoga Falls OH; and Columbia MD. Those shows are now scheduled to take place July 11th 12th 14th and 15th. (Support act Durand Jones & The Indications will not perform at the rescheduled dates).

Having made a full recovery Jack Johnson returned to the road on the road on Thursday less than a week after sharing his COVID diagnosis.

Durand Jones & The Indications opened the show with a 45-minute set that featured a cover of the Beatles‘ “Don’t Let Me Down”. The R&B/soul ensemble previously opened for Jack Johnson at Jones Beach Theatre on June 22nd and were scheduled to provide support on the dates that were postponed but the band is unavailable on the rescheduled dates “due to prior engagements.”

Jack Johnson then took the stage and removed any doubt about his health with a riveting 21-song set and five-song encore. The main set began with “If I Had Eyes” from 2007’s Sleep Through The Static. He then performed a familiar combination of his song “Sitting Waiting Wishing” and The Cars‘ “Just What I Needed” before playing “Taylor” off of 2003’s On and On. Next came “Upside Down” which Johnson recorded in 2006 for the soundtrack to the Curious George movie and “Flake” from 2001’s Brushfire Fairytales.

He then finally offered a selection from his new album with “One Step Ahead” which was followed by a seasonally appropriate cover of Mungo Jerry‘s “In the Summertime”.

After a few more originals that included crowd favorites “Bubble Toes” and “Banana Pancakes” Johnson played a mashup of “Don’t Look Now” and the Cure‘s “Just Like Heaven”. He then welcomed Durand Jones and company to join him on a cover of Stevie Wonder‘s “A Place in the Sun” which was a major highlight of the set.

The end of the main set featured a few songs off the new album including “Costume Party” and the title track “Meet the Moonlight”.

After a brief encore break Jack Johnson returned to close out the show with a five-song encore that began with “Do You Remember” “I Got You” and “Gone”. He then recounted getting high and losing money to Willie Nelson in a poker game with “Willie Got Me Stoned” and finished the encore with his most streamed song “Better Together”.

If a heart attack isn’t documented did it really happen? For an artificial intelligence program the answer may very well be “no.” Every year an estimated 170000 people in the United States experience asymptomatic — or “silent” — heart attacks. During these events patients likely have no idea that a blockage is keeping blood from flowing or that vital tissue is dying. They won’t experience any chest pain dizziness or trouble breathing. They don’t turn beet red or collapse. Instead they may just feel a bit tired or have no symptoms at all. But while the patient might not realize what happened the underlying damage can be severe and long-lasting: People who suffer silent heart attacks are at higher risk for coronary heart disease and stroke and are more likely to die within the following 10 years.

But if a doctor doesn’t diagnose that attack it won’t be included in a patient’s electronic health records. That omission can come with dangerous consequences. AI systems are trained on health records sifting through troves of data to study how doctors treated past patients and make predictions that can inform decisions about future care. “That’s what makes a lot of medical AI very challenging” says Ziad Obermeyer an associate professor at the University of California Berkeley who studies machine learning medicine and health policy. “We almost never observe the thing that we really care about.”

Read More About AI in Medicine:

The problem lies in the data – or rather what’s not in the data. Electronic health records only show what doctors and nurses notice. If they can’t see an issue even one as serious as a heart attack then the AI won’t be able to see it either. Similarly doctors may unwittingly encode their own racial gender or socioeconomic biases into the system. That can lead to algorithms that prioritize certain demographics over others entrench inequality and fail to make good on the promise that AI can help provide better care.

One such problem is that medical records can only store information about patients who have access to the medical system and can afford to see a doctor. “Datasets that don’t sufficiently represent certain groups — whether that’s racial groups gender for certain diseases or rare diseases themselves — can produce algorithms that are biased against those groups” says Curtis Langlotz a radiologist and director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging at Stanford University.

Beyond that diagnoses can reflect a doctor’s preconceptions and ideas — about say what might be behind a patient’s chronic pain — as much as they reflect the reality of what’s happening. “The dirty secrets of a lot of artificial intelligence tools is that a lot of the things that seem like biological variables that we’re predicting are in fact just someone’s opinion” says Obermeyer. That means that rather than helping doctors make better decisions these tools are often perpetuating the very inequalities they ought to help avoid.

Decoding Prejudice

When scientists train algorithms to operate a car they know what’s out there on the road. There’s no debate about whether there’s a stop sign school zone or pedestrian ahead. But in medicine truth is often measured by what the doctor says not what’s actually going on. A chest X-ray may be evidence of pneumonia because that’s what a doctor diagnosed and wrote in the health record not because it’s necessarily the correct diagnosis. “Those proxies are often distorted by financial things and racial things and gender things and all sorts of other things that are social in nature” says Obermeyer.

In a 2019 study Obermeyer and colleagues examined an algorithm developed by the health services company Optum. Hospitals use similar algorithms to predict which patients will need the most care estimating the needs of over 200 million people annually. But there’s no simple variable for determining who is going to get the sickest. Instead of predicting concrete health needs Optum’s algorithm predicted which patients were likely to cost more the logic being that sicker people need more care and therefore will be more expensive to treat. For a variety of reasons including income access to care and poor treatment by doctors Black people spend less on health care on average than their white counterparts. Therefore the study authors found that using cost as a proxy measure for health led the algorithm to consistently underestimate the health needs of Black people.

Instead of reflecting reality the algorithm was mimicking and further embedding racial biases in the health care system. “How do we get algorithms to do better than us?” asks Obermeyer. “And not just mirror our biases and our errors?”

Plus determining the truth of a situation — whether a doctor made a mistake due to poor judgment racism or sexism or whether a doctor just got lucky — isn’t always clear says Rayid Ghani a professor in the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University. If a physician runs a test and discovers a patient has diabetes did the physician do a good job? Yes they diagnosed the disease. But perhaps they should have tested the patient earlier or treated their rising blood sugar months ago before the diabetes developed.

If that same test was negative the calculation gets even harder. Should the doctor have ordered that test in the first place or was it a waste of resources? “You can only measure a late diagnosis if an early diagnosis didn’t happen” says Ghani. Decisions about which tests get run (or which patients’ complaints are taken seriously) often end up reflecting the biases of the clinicians rather than the best medical treatment possible. But if medical records encode those biases as facts then those prejudices will be replicated in the AI systems that learn from them no matter how good the technology is.

“If the AI is using the same data to train itself it’s going to have some of those inherent biases” Ghani adds “not because that’s what AI is but because that’s what humans are unfortunately.”’

Addressing Inequality

If wielded deliberately however this fault in AI could be a powerful tool says Kadija Ferryman an anthropologist at Johns Hopkins University who studies bias in medicine. She points to a 2020 study in which AI is used a resource to assess what the data shows: a kind of diagnostic for evaluating bias. If an algorithm is less accurate for women and people with public insurance for example that’s an indication that care isn’t being provided equitably. “Instead of the AI being the end the AI is almost sort of the starting point to help us really understand the biases in clinical spaces” she says.

In a 2021 study in Nature Medicine researchers described an algorithm they developed to examine racial bias in diagnosing arthritic knee pain. Historically Black and low-income patients have been significantly less likely to be recommended for surgery even though they often report much higher levels of pain than white patients. Doctors would attribute this phenomenon to psychological factors like stress or social isolation rather than to physiological causes. So instead of relying on radiologists’ diagnoses to predict the severity of a patients’ knee pain researchers trained the AI with a data set that included knee X-rays and patient’s descriptions of their own discomfort.

Not only did the AI predict who felt pain more accurately than the doctors did it also showed that Black patients’ pain wasn’t psychosomatic. Rather the AI revealed the problem lay with what radiologists think diseased knees should look like. Because our understanding of arthritis is rooted in research conducted almost exclusively on a white population doctors may not recognize features of diseased knees that are more prevalent in Black patients.

It’s much harder to design AI systems like the knee pain algorithm that can correct or check physicians’ biases as opposed to simply mimicking them — and it will require much more oversight and testing than currently exists. But Obermeyer notes that in some ways fixing the bias in AI can happen much faster than fixing the biases in our systems — and in ourselves — that helped create these problems in the first place.

And building AIs that account for bias could be a promising step in addressing larger systemic issues. To change how a machine operates after all you just need a few keystrokes; changing how people think takes much more than that.

IBM’s Failed Revolution

In 2011 IBM’s Watson computer annihilated its human competitors on the trivia show Jeopardy!. Ken Jennings the show’s all-time highest-earning player lost by over $50000. “I for one welcome our new computer overlords” he wrote on his answer card during the final round.

But Watson’s reign was short-lived. One of the earliest — and most high-profile — attempts to use artificial intelligence in health care Watson is now one of medical AI’s biggest failures. IBM spent billions building a vast repository of patient information insurance claims and medical images. Watson Health could (allegedly) plunder this database to suggest new treatments match patients to clinical trials and discover new drugs.

Despite Watson’s impressive database and all of IBM’s bluster doctors complained that it rarely made useful recommendations. The AI didn’t account for regional differences in patient populations access to care or treatment protocols. For example because its cancer data came exclusively from one hospital Watson for Oncology simply reflected the preferences and biases of the physicians who practiced there.

In January 2022 IBM finally dismantled Watson selling its most valuable data and analytics to the investment firm Francisco Partners. That downfall hasn’t dissuaded other data giants like Google and Amazon from hyping their own AIs promising systems that can do everything from transcribe notes to predict kidney failure. For big tech companies experimenting with medical AI the machine-powered doctor is still very much “in.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd1bmRlcmdyb3VuZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zdG9ybXMvaHVycmljYW5lL25ld3MvMjAyMi0wNy0wMi10cm9waWNhbC1zdG9ybS1jb2xpbi1jYXJvbGluYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remnants of Tropical Storm Colin Moved Into the Atlantic,"Published:

The 12900KS comes to market on April 5 but we snagged a chip to put it to the test ahead of the final launch.



But that isn't the final word yet: AMD has its $449 Ryzen 7 5800X3D waiting in the wings. The 5800X3D comes with the first 3D-stacked SRAM for desktop PCs granting the chip a whopping 96MB of L3 cache that AMD says will take back the crown of the best CPU for gaming when it arrives on April 20.



Make no mistake Intel's goal with the 12900KS is to cement itself atop the performance charts to cut off the 5800X3D before it even arrives on the market. Intel aims to accomplish this feat by leveraging the 12900K's existing 16-core 24-thread design but with a higher binning that supports speeds up to 5.5 GHz on two cores and up to 5.2 GHz for all-core boosts both enabled by adding in Intel's most advanced boosting tech.

That comes at the cost of extra power though: The Core i9-12900KS comes with a 150W processor base power (PBP) a record for a mainstream desktop processor. As we'll show below it's an understatement to say the 12900KS runs hot so it requires the beefiest of cooling solutions. However as we'll detail some of that tendency to run hot is by design to enable a new level of performance for desktop PCs.



The speedy 12900KS is sure to satisfy deep-pocketed performance addicts and it comes with the same overall feature set as the 12900K like support for DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 on the desktop. AMD can't match that type of connectivity until its 5nm Ryzen 7000 ‘Raphael’ Zen 4 CPUs arrive later this year. The 12900KS also comes with Alder Lake's new hybrid x86 design that combines eight big and fast Performance cores (P-cores) with two four-core clusters of small and powerful Efficiency cores (E-cores) that chew through background processes.



Intel's Core i9-12900K catapulted the company back to the top of the performance and value charts after the beating it took at the hands of AMD's Ryzen 5000 family but AMD is finally firing back with seven new chips of its own that will come to market this month. Intel's Core i9-12900KS is Intel's brazen 'power and price be damned' attempt at keeping the performance crown at all costs just like we saw with Intel's only other 'Special Edition' chip the Core i9-9900KS.



All of this means that while Intel's 12900KS delivers strong performance that leads our CPU benchmark hierarchy its hefty $739 premium might not be as good of a buy for gaming as AMD's $449 5800X3D. However the eight-core 5800X3D won't be able to keep pace in any other type of work as the 16-core Core i9-12900KS has a core count and frequency advantage. Here's how Intel's latest Special Edition stacks up.

Intel Alder Lake-S Core i9-12900KS Specifications and Pricing

The Core i9-12900KS is a Special Edition chip but Intel hasn't said if it will only produce a limited number as it did for the 'Limited Edition' Core i7-8086K. However we do know that the 12900K's thousand-unit price (effectively the wholesale MSRP) lands at $739 so we can expect to see these chips at retail for around $775 to $800 at launch.



That's a surprising premium over the 16-core 32-thread Ryzen 9 5950X that now retails for around $600 and it's also much more expensive than the $449 Ryzen 7 5800X3D that AMD says will be faster at games. This means there's a good chance we could see the Core i9-12900KS sell for lower than its suggested pricing after the initial demand is satisfied.

The Core i9-12900KS is functionally the same as the Core i9-12900K which you can read much more about here. We also have deep-dive coverage of the Alder Lake SoC design and core microarchitectures here along with a broader overview in our Alder Lake all we know article.

The 12900KS has eight P-cores just like the 'K' version but they now boost up to 5.5 GHz (300 MHz increase) if certain conditions are met. The chip also features eight E-cores that also receive an extra 100 MHz of clock speed. Intel has a total of five boost technologies (deeper explanation here) but the standard Core i9-12900K only supports two of them. The 12900KS supports all five to deliver higher clock speeds.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Core i9-12900KS All-Core Thermal Velocity Boost Frequencies Row 0 - Cell 0 Above 90C 70-90C Below 70C Core i9-12900K - All-Core Boost 5.0 GHz 5.1 GHz 5.2 GHz

Intel's single-core Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) tech allows the two fastest favored cores to boost to 5.5 GHz if they are below 70C while the all-core TVB supports 'up to' the frequencies in the table above. The 12900KS also has Adaptive Boost Technology allowing dynamic all-core turbo frequency adjustments when four or more cores are active. This feature doesn't have a guaranteed boost threshold — it will vary based on chip quality your cooler and power delivery. Think of Intel's Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT) much like a dynamic auto-overclocking feature that applies to all-core boosts but using it doesn't void the warranty.



These higher clock speeds require more power. As a result Intel has increased the Processor Base Power (PBP) to 150W an increase of 25W over the Core i9-12900K. However the Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) value which represents the highest power level during boost activity remains the same at 241W. Naturally all bets are off when you remove the power limits which happens by default on most high-end motherboards.



All Alder Lake chips support DDR4-3200 or up to DDR5-4800 memory but caveats apply. Alder Lake chips expose up to 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 (technically for storage and graphics only no networking devices) and an additional four lanes of PCIe 4.0 from the chip for M.2 storage. The 12900KS also comes armed with the UHD Graphics 770 engine with 32 EUs that run at a 300/1550 MHz base/boost just like the standard 12900K. However there is no graphics-less F-series variant.

Test Setup

We tested the 12900KS's boosting power and thermal characteristics extensively finding that the chip easily and frequently boosts to 5.5 GHz. It also sustains up to a 5.2 GHz boost clock on all P-cores though not under all conditions. The peak 305W of power consumption we recorded has an impact on thermals which regularly stay at 100C under heavy multi-core loads. That's because Intel's auto-overclocking ABT feature is designed to extract the full performance available within the spec'd temperature range. You can find that testing after the game and application benchmarks below.



Alder Lake's Thread Director technology steers threads to the correct type of cores. This tech works best with Windows 11 so we use that for testing. It's important that you know that these chips can suffer in very few multi-threaded workloads in Windows 10. You can correct those issues either via command-line utilities or third-party software like Process Lasso and receive the full expected performance.



Aside from a few errant programs the overall trends between Windows 10 and 11 are similar. As such we're not going to post the redundant Windows 10 benchmarks in this article. We also stuck with DDR4 for this round of testing as overall performance trends are generally the same between DDR4 and DDR5. We have a deeper dive into what that looks like in our initial 12900K review. We tested in the following two configurations:

Intel Core i9-12900KS Gaming Benchmarks — The TLDR

As usual we're testing with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 to reduce GPU-imposed bottlenecks as much as possible and differences between test subjects will shrink with lesser cards or higher resolutions. Because most of the titles below show little meaningful differentiation at higher resolutions we only tested four of the seven titles at 1440p.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Core i9-12900KS is now the fastest gaming chip in the world but only by a slight 2.7% gain over the vanilla 12900K in our cumulative 1080p performance measurement. However we do see a larger 6.9% gain in the 99th percentile framerates implying a smoother gaming experience. It is noteworthy that a few of our tested titles are approaching a GPU bottleneck at 1080p so we might see larger performance deltas when new more powerful GPUs arrive later this year. However due to the GPU bottleneck the difference between the two chips is imperceivable at QHD.

It's noteworthy that we typically test with the power limits fully removed for our standard measurements so the 12900K in the above charts is running beyond Intel's 'recommended' power settings but remains within warranty. The 12900KS's 5.5 GHz boost frequently engages in any configuration contributing to a dead tie between the two KS configurations in our cumulative measurement of performance at 1080p.

Moving over to 1440p brings a GPU bottleneck into the equation so the performance deltas between the chips shrink tremendously. However those results provide good perspective if you game at higher resolutions and don't plan to upgrade your GPU before buying your next CPU.

Flipping through the 99th percentile charts for both resolutions also shows larger deltas but we have to view those with caution as Windows 11 is still young and suffers from more framerate variability than our Windows 10 test platform. This could result from yet-to-be-updated game code the relatively new graphics drivers for Windows 11 or some other combination of factors that could be smoothed out in the future.



The Core i9-12900KS carves out a win in our game testing but that 2.7% of extra performance at 1080p comes with a 25% price increase. The 12900KS also can't circumvent the general laws of the universe and make the GPU any faster so you won't see any noticeable gain at higher resolutions or with games that are already bottlenecked by the GPU. That lack of improvement is disappointing given that most folks that purchase this expensive chip won't be gaming at lower resolutions.



The competition between Intel and AMD is much closer now so it's best to make an informed decision based on the types of titles you play frequently. Be sure to check out the individual tests below.

Synthetic benchmarks don't tend to translate well to real-world gaming but they do show us the raw amount of compute power exposed to game engines. It's too bad most games don't fully exploit it.

Intel Core i9-12900KS Application Benchmarks — The TLDR

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. These slides show the geometric mean of performance in several of our most important tests in each category but be sure to look at the expanded results below.

With the power limits removed the Core i9-12900KS is 4% faster in our cumulative measure of threaded performance than the 12900K (which also has its limits removed) and 6.8% faster in the single-threaded measurement.

The Ryzen 9 5950X is more competitive in some specific types of threaded work like rendering but the 12900KS is 7.9% faster overall. That gap grows significantly with lightly-threaded applications where the 12900KS is a whopping 25.9% faster than the 5950X. So while the 12900KS does hold the lead you're paying quite a premium for the additional performance over the vanilla 12900K.

The 12900KS takes the lead in several rendering benchmarks but the Ryzen 9 5950X leads in Corona V-Ray and C-Ray showing that both chips could be a good choice for different types of multi-threaded rendering workloads. The 12900KS leads the entire Ryzen lineup in the single-threaded rendering benchmarks showing that the Thread Director places those tasks perfectly onto the faster P-cores.



The 12900K is very close to the 12900KS in most threaded rendering tasks but there's a much larger delta between the two in single-threaded work.

The ubiquitous web browser is one of the most frequently used applications. These tests tend to be lightly-threaded so a snappy response time is critical. As an extra challenge for Alder Lake placing these bursty and latency-sensitive workloads directly onto the P-cores requires an ultra-snappy response time from both the Thread Director and the Windows scheduler. That tandem obviously works extremely well as Alder Lake dominates these benchmarks not to mention the office workloads too.

This grab bag of various tests finds the Core i9-12900KS notching several more important wins. From the exceedingly branchy code in the LLVM compilation workload to the massively parallel molecular dynamics simulation code in NAMD the Core i9-12900KS is impressive. AMD continues to benefit in the SHA3 AES and HASH benchmarks from its cryptographic optimizations.

Intel Core i9-12900KS Overclocking Power and Thermals

We often don't include Prime95 power measurements in our standard CPU reviews largely because there is a massive disconnect between this extremely rigorous stress test and the power consumption and thermal load generated by most real-world applications. But given that the 12900K has a higher power rating (and thus heat) than any other mainstream Intel chip we tested with Prime 95 in several scenarios.



We normally use a 280mm Corsair H115i AIO with the fans cranking away at 100% but given the 12900KS's heavy power consumption and thermal load we also tested with our 720mm custom loop as a comparison point. As you can see the chip peaked at 300W with the 720mm loop but only reached 275W with the H115i AIO.



Removing the power limits causes the chip to run at 100C during extended all-core workloads but this is at least partially by design. The high thermal load is due to the chip's Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT) which functions much like a dynamic auto-overclocking feature that pushes the clock rates/power to the very limits of your cooler yet still keeps the cores below the 105C throttle point. Remember ABT is designed to push the cores right to 100C extracting the full amount of performance available within the tolerated temperature range.



As expected the cooling capability and thus the ABT-enabled clock ceiling are much lower with the AIO. After lifting the power limits the chip dropped to an all-core ~4.7 GHz on the P-cores and 3.2 GHz on the E-cores. In contrast the 720mm configuration stayed at ~4.9 GHz on the P-cores and was mostly steady at 4.0 GHz on the E-cores although we did see a few sporadic periods of 3.9 GHz.

We also tested Prime 95 with the Intel-recommended 150/241W power limit with a 128-second Tau duration (third slide) and here we can see that the chip respected those power limits perfectly. However that came at the cost of a drop to a 4.0 GHz all-core frequency on the P-cores and 3.2 GHz for the E-cores.

These Prime 95 stress tests are brutal and you often won't see this type of power consumption during even the heaviest 'normal' use. The last three images in the album show the 12900KS running through a spate of standard heavily threaded applications (Cinebench HandBrake AVX-heavy y-cruncher) to measure power and thermals during the more standard fare. Here the custom 720mm loop provides nearly the same peak frequencies and power consumption as the 280mm AIO.



Ultimately thermal density appears to be the biggest challenge during these benchmarks not silicon quality or ability — there's just too much heat concentrated in the small die for the coolers to extract it from the heat spreader efficiently. As a result air cooling is completely unusable and you will reach a rapidly diminishing point of returns if you choose to go beyond a 280/360mm AIO.



However the Core i9-12900KS will run at the very limits of your cooler assuring that you get close to the same performance as a heavy overclock but without the hassle of manual tuning. Manual tuning will provide slightly higher peak performance but it also comes with much more waste power and heat generation. You also lose the peak 5.5 GHz boost clocks on two cores.

We tested performance in lightly-threaded work with the H115i cooler and both of our power limit settings. To assess peak boost speeds we ran through our standard series of lightly-threaded tests (LAME PCMark10 Geekbench VRMark and single-threaded Cinebench).



As you can see the chip readily and frequently jumped to 5.5 GHz regardless of the power settings. Overall the 12900K stayed below 70C for most of these tests though we can see the threaded portions of the PCMark 10 (~900 to 1200 seconds) and three Geekbench runs (~1500 to 1800 seconds) push temperatures and power draw higher during parts of the test run. As you can see those threaded workloads don't always result in a lower peak boost clock rate. That's because we're plotting the overall CPU temperature but the chip monitors temps for each core and modulates frequency on a per-core basis. Overall the 12900KS more than delivers on its 5.5 GHz promise though your mileage could vary based on your cooler.

As we covered in-depth here the Alder Lake chips are easily the best overclocking chips we've seen from Intel in several generations. The higher binning of the 12900KS implies that you'll get a cherry overclocking chip but that is certainly not guaranteed. Unfortunately due to another important time-sensitive project we didn't have enough time to manually overclock the 12900KS for our first round of testing. We will circle back and add overclocking testing in an update soon. Much of the attraction of the 12900KS centers on the fact that you don't have to overclock to get close to the pinnacle of performance so we have more than enough data to work with to give concrete advice.

Intel Alder Lake Core i9-12900KS Power Consumption Efficiency and Thermals

Yes the Intel Alder Lake chips still suck more power than AMD's Ryzen 5000 series chips but pairing the Intel 7 process with the hybrid architecture has resulted in big improvements particularly in threaded work.



Alder Lake's reduction in peak values goes out the window with the performance-at-all-costs Core i9-12900KS. However although the chip sucks more power it is much faster than the 12900K. Surprisingly the 12900KS delivers better power efficiency in our renders-per-day measurements showing that the extra power consumption comes paired with faster performance and higher-quality silicon that delivers more performance-per-watt.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Here we take a slightly different look at power consumption by calculating the cumulative energy required to perform x264 and x265 HandBrake workloads respectively. We plot this 'task energy' value in Kilojoules on the left side of the chart.

These workloads are comprised of a fixed amount of work so we can plot the task energy against the time required to finish the job (bottom axis) thus generating a really useful power chart.

Bear in mind that faster compute times and lower task energy requirements are ideal. That means processors that fall the closest to the bottom left corner of the chart are best. As you can see the Core i9-12900KS rivals the Ryzen 9 5950X with the standard power settings in the HandBrake workloads.

The Rare Few

Intel's Alder Lake pricing has been incredibly competitive against AMD's Ryzen 5000 chips forcing its competitor to slash prices but the Core i9-12900KS bucks that trend with a $739 price tag that will probably manifest as $800 at retail. Given the slight gains in gaming the chip simply isn't worth the premium for the overwhelming majority of gamers and enthusiasts. However we're sure the chip will find an audience with deep-pocketed productivity-minded users those building all-out performance-oriented machines with the Nvidia GeForce 3090 Ti or professional users.



Below we have the geometric mean of our gaming test suite at 1080p and 1440p and a cumulative measure of performance in single- and multi-threaded applications. Remember that we conducted the gaming tests with an RTX 3090 so performance deltas will shrink with lesser cards and higher resolution and fidelity settings. However it is noteworthy that a few of our tested titles are approaching a GPU bottleneck at 1080p so we might see bigger performance deltas when new more powerful GPUs arrive later this year.

The Core i9-12900KS carves out a 2.7% win in our 1080p game testing but its biggest problem is the Core i9-12900K's lower price point — the 12900KS' additional 2.7% of performance comes with a 25% price increase. Additionally GPU bottlenecks mean you won't see any perceivable gains at higher resolutions at least not with the current crop of GPUs.

In applications the Core i9-12900KS is 4% faster than the 12900K in threaded work and 6.8% faster in single-threaded work. That expands the lead over the Ryzen 9 5950X too: The 12900KS is 7.9% faster in multi-threaded and a whopping 25.9% faster in single-threaded work than AMD's finest.

The improved application performance particularly in Adobe workloads makes the 12900KS an attractive chip for professionals where time is money and expensive parts are merely a business expense. Intel now allows pairing its Alder Lake consumer chips with ECC memory on motherboards with the workstation-geared W680 chipset so the Core i9-12900KS could make for a very potent workstation machine that supplants the entry-level Xeon E series. It will also drive workstation GPUs quite nicely and is the only entry-level workstation game in town with connectivity features like DDR5 and PCIe 5.0. Unlike previous Special Edition chips the 12900KS has a full three-year warranty.

The 5.5 GHz clock speed might leave you more gas in the tank for future GPU upgrades too. We tested the 12900KS's boosting power and thermal characteristics extensively finding that the chip easily and frequently boosts to 5.5 GHz with conventional cooling. It also sustains up to a 5.2 GHz boost clock on all P-cores though not under all conditions.

The peak 305W of power consumption we recorded has an impact on thermal output which regularly stays around 100C during heavy multi-core loads. However it is important to remember that this is enabled by the auto-overclocking ABT feature that's designed to extract the most performance possible out of the available thermal headroom so it consumes power right up to the limit of your cooler. That means you could see improvements with beefier cooling. You'll also need a robust power supply and a hefty motherboard so plan on spending handsomely to build out a Core i9-12900KS rig. It is mentionable that the 12900KS will not reach its peak temperatures during the majority of games as they aren't demanding enough to push the chip to high all-core boost frequencies.

The 12900KS is simply a higher-binned 12900K with some extra boost tech added. Although it isn't guaranteed this implies you'll get cherry silicon and a better chance at scoring a highly-overclockable chip. Due to time constraints we haven't had a chance to manually overclock the 12900KS but we'll add that testing to this article in the coming week.

The Core i9-12900KS is obviously planned to hold the line against AMD's upcoming Ryzen 7 5800X3D. AMD's new chip uses the tried-and-true Zen 3 architecture paired with an astounding 96MB of L3 cache courtesy of its new 3D chip stacking tech. AMD says the 5800X3D will be the fastest gaming chip in the world but we suspect it might be a very close race.



However the race isn't close when it comes to pricing — the 5800X3D is only $449 and drops into affordable AM4 motherboards. You might sacrifice some of the leading-edge connectivity but the 5800X3D will probably offer far more bang for your gaming buck even if it isn't the absolute fastest. The eight-core 5800X3D won't be able to keep pace with the 16-core 12900KS in any other type of work though.



Additionally AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X now sells for around $600 so it will also be a better value than the 12900KS for some types of work — but don't forget that the more reasonably-priced 12900K is still better than the 5950X for just about everything.

In the meantime the Core i9-12900KS represents Intel throwing value and power consumption out the window in a no-holds-barred attempt to retain the performance crown particularly in gaming. The chip likely won't find broad acclaim outside of the professional market and its price-to-performance ratio certainly doesn't justify its price tag for the average enthusiast.



However the Core i9-12900KS might allow Intel to cling to the title of having the fastest gaming chip in the world a nearly priceless distinction for the Alder Lake brand. Make no mistake: the Special Edition Core i9-12900KS is the fastest desktop PC chip ever built. At least for now. The Core i9-12900KS goes on sale on April 5 but we won't know if Intel succeeded in its mission to retain the gaming crown until AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X3D arrives later this month.

When she first joined Intel in 1985 Bryant now 60 tells CNBC Make It she had to quickly adopt the same habits as her males colleagues like drinking scotch and swearing to ""fit in"" at the office.

""I realized that the only way I'm going to get them to collaborate with me and be successful in this team is if I make these men more comfortable by embracing their direct aggressive style"" she says. ""I thought 'You either adapt or you die.'""

The California native spent 32 years at Intel serving in various roles including chief information officer and the group president of Intel's Data Center Group. After leaving Intel Bryant spent a year as Google Cloud's chief operations officer and served as an advisor and board member to several smaller start-ups before joining NovaSignal a medical device start-up as chairman and CEO in 2020.

Many of these opportunities she adds have come from the mentors who rooted for her and invested in her success: A customer at the restaurant Diane worked at throughout college recommended her for her first internship at Aerojet and when a colleague saw her struggle with a tough manager at Intel he recruited her for a better role on a different team.

The additional 692 acres to service Intel Corporation's $20 billion computer chip manufacturing facility would extend the Columbus Regional Facility Planning Area to the southwest corner of the Mink Street-Green Chapel Road intersection which is the boundary of the Intel project site south of Johnstown.

The land has already been annexed into New Albany which has a contract to use Columbus water and sewer within its city limits. A portion of the Intel site is already in the Columbus utility area.

The state's water quality management plan or 208 plan identifies how wastewater treatment needs will be met while protecting existing and future water quality in a defined geographic area. Ohio EPA reviews and updates the state's 208 Plan.

New Albany Community Development Director Jennifer Chrysler and Southwest Licking Water and Sewer District attorney Andrew King met with the commissioners Thursday seeking approval for the petition.

“In order for the city to be able to service the site with water and sewer through our contracts with the city of Columbus it has to be within the Columbus utility planning area and in order to be in the planning area the 208 line needs to be modified"" Chrysler said. That’s required with the EPA.”

Intel plans to begin construction later this year on two factories called fabs a few miles south of Johnstown. The company expects production to start in 2025 and employment to reach 3000 with an average wage of $135000. The project is also expected to create 7000 construction jobs and 10000 indirect jobs. It could be the beginning of a $100 billion investment by the company.

In preparation for the Intel development New Albany planned to annex 3190 acres of Jersey Township land generally bordered by Green Chapel Road to the north Mink Street to the east Jug Street Road to the south and the county line to the west.

Soon after the Jan. 21 Intel announcement the commissioners received a petition accompanied by an annexation agreement from 117 property owners for 1689 acres within the Intel project area. The commissioners recently received another petition to annex 509 more Jersey Township acres bisecting Beech Road and bordered on the west by the county line.

King said of the Columbus water area extension “The critical fact is it’s annexed into the city of New Albany and the city of New Albany has its contractual obligations to have water and sewer served by Columbus. So we’re not interested in interfering.”

The commissioners approved the petition contingent on Southwest Licking Water and Sewer District also approving at its board meeting Thursday night which King said it did.

King and Chrysler said Mink Street will be the new boundary between the Columbus and Southwest Licking service areas.

“The city of New Albany and our city council do not have any desire to annex ground east of Mink"" Chrysler said. ""So we don’t anticipate that area would be developed or annexed into the city. Mink Road is going to be the eastern boundary for the city’s growth.”

King said Southwest Licking will extend water north along the east side of Mink Street.

“There’s a desire for water to run up Mink and we’ll make that a somewhat permanent boundary” King said. “When and if we get all the way to Green Chapel is to be determined but there is active planning to get water and sewer up Mink.

“I think it’s fair to say to the west (of Mink) will be New Albany/Columbus and to the east will be Southwest Licking.”

Commissioner Duane Flowers asked Chrysler how long Mink Street will remain the boundary for New Albany expansion. Many years ago Harrison Road was the boundary.

Chrysler said “I think the conversations that are occurring right now between the city of New Albany and Jersey Township suggest that border is going to be memorialized in more ways in future agreements so that everybody’s clear and has the understanding that this is where it will stay.”

Asked how long the boundary will remain Commissioner Rick Black said “For the time being.”

Tim Bubb responded “They still own land on both sides of the line of demarcation. I’ll be kind of curious if that really happens.”

Chrysler said there is one area east of Mink Street around the Jug Street intersection that is within both the Columbus and Southwest Licking service areas.

“Nothing is changing with that"" Chrysler said. ""Either provider can provide service in that area if they so choose to.""

Intel Core i9-13900K will be the flagship chip of the 13th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop CPU family that will feature support on the LGA 1700/1800 socket platform. Just like its predecessor Alder Lake the Raptor Lake chip will adopt a similar hybrid architecture design composed of P-cores and E-cores but with more cores higher clocks and a larger cache for faster performance.

Intel Core i9-13900K CPU: The 13th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop Flagship With 24 Cores & 5.8 GHz Clock Speeds

[Updated- 20/10/22]

While we have already detailed what Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake and Z790 platform brings to the table over here I believe that the fastest chip in the lineup deserves its own roundup. Intel's Raptor Lake isn't a massive architectural upgrade but a refinement of the existing Alder Lake design that'll entice gamers and content creators with more of virtually everything. The Core i9-13900K being the flagship of this lineup will have to prove that it's the real deal by not only showcasing a decent CPU performance gain over the Core i9-12900K but also against AMD's Ryzen 7000 flagship chip based on the Zen 4 core.

Intel 13th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop CPUs Expected Features:

Up To 24 Cores & 32 Threads

Brand New Raptor Cove CPU Cores (Higher P-Core IPC)

Intel hasn't officially confirmed the Core i9-13900K CPU part yet but there are multiple leaks that confirm its existence and also the fact that the chip will get an even faster 'Special Edition' variant with even higher clock speeds. So with that said let's get on with the specifications.

Intel Core i9-13900K 'Raptor Lake' CPU Specifications

In terms of specifications the Intel Core i9-13900K CPU will offer a total of 24 cores and 32 threads. These are divided into an 8+16 configuration which includes 8 P-Cores based on the Raptor Cove and 16 E-Cores based on the Gracemont core architecture. All of these cores are fabricated on the 10nm ESF or 'Intel 7' process node. Given that the chip will feature more cores and cache using the same process node the overall die size would be a bit bigger than Alder Lake's C0 desktop die.

As for cache the Intel Core i9-13900 Raptor Lake CPU carries 16 MB of L2 cache for the P-Cores (2 MB per core) and 16 MB of L2 cache for the E-cores too (4MB per cluster of 4 cores). This gives us a total of 32 MB of L2 cache which combined with the L3 cache will offer us a total of 68 MB of cache which is rumored to be labeled as 'Game Cache'.

The Core i9-13900K will carry some impressive clock speeds of 3.0 GHz base 5.5 GHz (all-core) boost and a massive 5.8 GHz single-core boost clock. The CPU will feature a based TDP of 125W (PL1) and PL2 TDP (or MTP - Maximum Turbo Power) of 253W. The actual figure is said to be around 350W at max which will be 100W higher than the Core i9-12900KS.

Just like Alder Lake the Intel Raptor Lake CPUs including the Core i9-13900K won't feature any AVX-512 support since that has been removed from the current and future mainstream processors. The CPU will also offer improved DDR5 memory support while retaining DDR4 support too. The DDR5 memory will be natively supported with speeds of up to 5600 MT/s and one can expect over 8000 MT/s speeds once Raptor Lake comes to the market.

On the other hand the CPU will get some enhanced overclocking features such as the following:

Added per-core OC TVB support

Added package OC TVB support

Added Efficient TVB support

Intel will also be launching its first 6 GHz CPU the Core i9-13900KS at CES 2023. This would make Raptor Lake the first x86 CPU family to offer a clock frequency that's going to breach the 6 GHz barrier. Knowing that AMD is going all-out with their own Zen 4-powered Ryzen 7000 chips in the clock department with 5.5 GHz+ being achieved across several threads and rumors of 5.6-5.8 GHz single-core clocks in the air it looks like Intel will just unleash everything it is capable of with Raptor Lake.

Intel Core i9-13900K 'Raptor Lake' CPU Performance

Coming to the performance section Intel has officially stated that the Raptor Lake CPUs bring up to a double-digit performance boost. They haven't stated if this is single-core or multi-core but based on recent leaks we can tell that the performance bump mostly comes in the multi-threaded section thanks to the increased core count but single-core performance also gets a decent bump thanks to the increased clocks and cache.

Intel's Core i9-13900K Raptor Lake ES1 CPU is mostly on par with the Intel Core i9-12900K with a 4.0 GHz clock speed but the ES3 CPU ends up 7% faster in single and 28% faster in multi-thread tests. It also delivers a 34% higher single-threaded and 21% higher multi-threaded performance versus the AMD Ryzen 9 5950X. Now AMD is expected to gain an additional >15% single-threaded IPC uplift and an overall >35% multi-threaded uplift which comes through a combination of architectural & clock improvements gen-over-gen with Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 CPUs so it will be a really close battle in between the two flagships.

In terms of gaming performance the Intel Core i9-13900K CPU has been said to be the better chip when it comes to running games. We have been told that the CPU will reclaim the gaming crown from AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X3D for a short amount of time before AMD fires back with its 3D V-Cache lineup which is expected to debut this year too.

Intel's pricing strategy starting its 12th Gen Alder Lake lineup has been very aggressive and that has definitely helped them sell enough units to start making a dent in AMD's Ryzen market share & its revenue. Segments such as the Core i5 and Core i7 are showing up in the 'Top 10 Sellers' on several NA & EU-based retailers but the top Core i9 parts are what enthusiasts settle for.

It is likely that Intel will retain the prices of its chips moving forward. Intel only bumped the pricing up by $50 US when they doubled the core counts from 8 on Core i9-11900K ($539 US SEP) to 16 on the Core i9-12900K ($589 US SEP). Since Raptor Lake isn't a doubling and is mostly a refinement of Alder Lake we can expect the pricing to remain the same and at most hit the $599 US mark. AMD's flagship is likely to cost around $700-$800 US which means that Intel may have a big edge in price to performance segment.

As for launch and availability the Intel 13th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop CPUs are expected to launch alongside the 700-series chipset family on 20th October for a price of $599.00 US (RCP)."

Futures are among the most commonly used financial instruments in the world. Retail and institutional investors use futures contracts for hedging and speculating on the future performance of assets including equities commodities and fixed income.

These contracts allow traders to use leverage in a bid to maximise profits although this can increase the risk of oversized losses.

The Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index also known as the UK100 is one of the most widely quoted benchmark indices in the world. It gives investors exposure to some of the biggest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

In this article we explore what a futures contract is and look at FTSE 100 Index and FTSE 100 Index futures.

What is the FTSE 100 Index?

Occasionally referred to as the ‘Footsie’ the FTSE 100 Index is a blue-chip index that tracks the performance of the 100 largest companies listed on the LSE. Alongside the FTSE All-Share index and the FTSE 250 Index the Footsie is one of the leading benchmark indices in the UK widely regarded as the best performance indicator of large-cap UK companies.

The FTSE 100 Index is market cap-weighted index which means price movements of an index component with higher market capitalisation will have a larger effect on the index than a smaller market cap company.

Constituents of the FTSE 100 are ranked by their full market capitalisation. Any company that falls below the 110th position is automatically deleted from the FTSE 100. Once a company leaves the index the highest ranking company on the FTSE 250 will enter the FTSE 100 Index.

As of 31 May 2022 oil and gas giant Shell (RDS) was the biggest constituent of the FTSE 100 with an index weight of 9.1%. Pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca (AZN) multinational bank HSBC Holdings (HSBC) Dove shampoo and Hellmann mayonnaise seller Unilever (ULVR) and healthcare company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) made up the remaining top five constituents.

Energy healthcare and financial services sectors were the highest weighted sectors representing over 30% of index weightage.

The FTSE UK indices are managed by FTSE Russell a wholly-owned unit of London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).

FTSE 100 futures overview: What is futures contract?

Futures are derivative financial contracts that represent an agreement to buy or sell a specific quantity of an asset at a predetermined price and date.

Unlike options contracts where the buyer or seller has the right to buy or sell a certain asset at a specified price in the future parties of a futures contract are obligated to buy or sell the asset. Both these financial products are used by investors for hedging and for speculating future price movements.

According to the LSEG FTSE 100 Index futures and options are the most commonly used instruments for banks brokers specialist traders and market makers to manage risk on the UK equity market.

How do FTSE futures work? A FTSE 100 futures contract is priced at £10 ($12.01) per index point and has a tick size of $0.5. FTSE 100 futures are cash-settled upon expiration meaning no physical asset is exchanged.

FTSE 100 Index futures order book trading hours start at 8:00 and end at 16:40 (GMT). FTSE 100 futures attract an order-book fee of £0.20 per contract a clearing fee of £0.02 and an expiration fee of £0.17 according to the FTSE 100 Index Futures & Options factsheet.

It is important to note that futures contracts are leveraged financial instruments that can maximise a trader’s profits or losses. Moreover if the market begins to trade against the position of a trader’s futures contract the trader may receive margin calls requiring additional funds to be deposited to their account to cover potential losses.

What drives the value of FTSE futures?

The value of a futures contract is based on the value of its underlying asset. In the case of FTSE 100 futures the performance of the FTSE 100 will determine the gains and losses from future contract trades.

Stock prices in equity markets are dependent on supply and demand. Usually the factors that affect stock market performance can be categorised into three groups: fundamental factors macroeconomic factors and market sentiment.

Fundamental factors mainly refer to the financial health of a company or the viability of its revenue-earning and profit-generating capacity. Financial metrics like earnings per share (EPS) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio are among the widely used indicators of determining whether a stock is worth investing in. In the case of the FTSE 100 it is important to remember that the index is a market-cap weighted index so its biggest constituents will have significant influence over its performance.

Macroeconomic factors refer to the external factors like competition global economic growth inflation supply chain dynamics demographics and geo-political conditions that alter the supply and demand for a company’s stock.

Market sentiment refers to the psychology of investors both individually and collectively. Fear and greed greatly influence the movements of stock prices. Market cycles are known to go through peaks and troughs of optimism euphoria anxiety panic capitulation and depression.

Behavioural economics has gained prominence in the 21st century as a means of studying decision-making processes of investors.

Where are FTSE 100 index futures traded?

FTSE 100 Index futures are traded on the LSE and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

According to the ICE FTSE 100 futures trading hours outside the UK are between 8:00 to 16:00 in New York and Singapore. In essence FTSE 100 Index futures are open for trade throughout the day across the world on open trading days.

It is important to note that this article does not constitute financial or investment advice. Before you choose to invest in FTSE 100 futures always do your own research and remember that your decision should be based on your attitude to risk your expertise in this market the spread of your portfolio and how comfortable you feel about losing money.

There are no guarantees. Markets are volatile. You should conduct your own analysis on FTSE futures price and take into account your existing portfolio and risk tolerance. And never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.

It is already clear that the Russian war machine is changing the fate of the region for good and the impact of the conflict reaches far beyond Europe’s borders. The war has turned the localized struggle against Ukraine and the Ukrainians into an intense geopolitical and ideological struggle that is reaching well past Europe’s borders.

It has morphed into a global violent and uncompromising struggle between Russia and the West; between an authoritarian regime and democratic countries; between freedom and a dictatorship whose purpose is to alter the current world order. This brutal struggle is sharpening the enormous gaps that exist between conflicting values and between Washington and Moscow’s opposing stances and interests.

While the struggle unites and consolidates NATO and the European Union countries it also reinforces the laxity of the Biden administration and the weakness of American policy. This lax stance is undoubtedly the main catalyst influencing Putin’s aggressive policies and one of the critical factors spurring him to carry out murderous actions to defeat Ukraine without fearing Western intervention.

And thus even though it’s not easy to admit the head of the Kremlin is the person currently directing events in Europe and influencing trends and processes taking place around the world. All of this is happening despite Russia’s international isolation the shrinking of its economy and the Russian military’s strategic and logistical failures.

Putin is driven by a tremendous passion for power dark desires Russian sentiment and a megalomaniacal yearning to return to the days of the czars and the Russian Empire. He is sowing hatred and pushing to create divisiveness and polarization within Europe and across the globe. While the governments in Europe and around the world are condemning or flattering him and showing signs of fatigue and indifference to his moves the head of the Kremlin is redrawing the map of relations interests and the balance of power in the international arena.

At the same time we cannot ignore the strategic gaps misjudgments and the destructive effects of the war as well as its long-term geopolitical security and economic consequences. The cold truth must be spoken out loud. The war in Europe is not a war of occupation nor is it limited to the issue of security in Ukraine and the other countries in the region. It is a war of attrition that Putin is leading against American hegemony and its global domination and influence that is taking place simultaneously on several fronts.

This is a blatant violation of international law that is seriously undermining the foundation of democracy and aims to alter the status quo and existing world order on which the international community is based.

President of the European Commission Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen addressed this matter last month at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos Switzerland. Moreover she declared at the end of the session with the leaders of Germany France and Italy and with President Zelensky in Kyiv that the EU would officially be providing support for Ukraine as well as recognizing its candidacy for EU membership.

THE FACTS speak for themselves. As the war escalates and Russia continues to wipe out entire cities and provinces and kill tens or even hundreds of thousands of people millions of Ukrainian citizens have fled the country (so far 6.5 million refugees and 7 million displaced persons have fled their homes indefinitely totaling one-third of the country’s population). This shatters Ukraine’s neutral stance which it has held since achieving independence in 1991.

This is a catastrophic geopolitical security and humanitarian crisis of the highest proportion the likes of which we haven’t seen since 1945. It threatens the stability of international relations as defined by the UN. It has reached a historic point of no return in which many European countries including Georgia and Moldova have applied to join the EU and countries like Sweden and Finland are preparing to join NATO.

It’s important to explain that beyond the deep paradigm shift in the traditional perception of European countries we’re dealing with an extremely strategic domino effect. This war has triggered an accelerated militarization and deployment of arms which has led to increased defense budgets which have risen to 2% of the GDP in all of these countries totaling €200 billion in military expenditures.

Moreover this military intensification is leaking outside of the continent’s borders and is leading to an escalation of the global nuclear arms race as seen in the nuclear tests being conducted by North Korea in an effort to draw international attention.

Strong effects on world markets

The invasion of Ukraine and the intensification of international sanctions imposed on Russia are having a strong effect on world markets and have inflicted significant harm on weaker countries in Europe and Central Asia.

According to data published by the World Bank in April instead of recovering from the COVID-19 crisis and growing at a rate of 3% these economies are expected to shrink at an average rate of 4.1% this year. This is in addition to the contraction of Ukraine’s economy which is projected to fall 45% due to the extensive killing of its citizens destruction of its cities industrial centers and critical infrastructure.

In contrast due to the important strategic role Russia plays in the global commodity markets including oil gas metal and agricultural products coming out of Ukraine the Russian economy has shrunk by 8.5% and entered a deep recession due to severe restrictions on energy sources including a 60% reduction in the volume of oil exports to Europe.

Nonetheless Russia is the world’s third-biggest oil producer and the dominant supplier of natural gas for all of Europe. Its revenue from these energy sources and from coal during the first one hundred days of the war which according to a recent publication in Finland reached €93 billion is enough to fund the continuation of Russia’s lethal war machine.

The vast tension and volatility in financial and commodity markets due to the war have led to soaring prices. Thus while the stock market is reacting sharply to Putin’s aggressive policies there is great volatility in the global energy market and oil and natural gas prices are skyrocketing. The price of a barrel of oil in March rose to $139 a record high not seen since 2008. Moreover because the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project was halted gas prices are currently five times higher than normal levels.

It’s important to note that the disruption of the supply of oil and gas along with changes in production quotas due to the tightening of sanctions will not just have an effect in the short term or affect only the Russian economy. These raw materials are being used as a means of blackmail by Russia against European countries and the US which is searching for alternative energy sources including efforts to improve ties with the Persian Gulf states namely Saudi Arabia.

It’s not for nothing that President Biden is scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who until recently was persona non grata in Washington.

Furthermore the continuation and escalation of the war are leading to an increase in uncertainty and intense fear of a sharp global slowdown which is in turn leading to a rise in prices a jump in inflation rates and poverty around the globe. All of these factors will likely lead to a further decline in growth rates in countries in Europe and around the world and to surges due to supply disruptions of Russian gas and the cessation of its flow to European countries namely Germany France and Italy.

AS FEARS of disruptions in energy supply and soaring prices amass Putin continues to bomb and pulverize Ukraine. He’s now taken control of 20% of Ukrainian territory and is blocking its strategically important ports on the Black Sea which are integral for exporting grain including wheat corn and sunflower seeds.

Russia and Ukraine play a key role in the global food market. Russia is responsible for 17% of world wheat exports and Ukraine supplies 80% of all cooking oils such as corn and canola as well as 17% of world corn exports. Ukraine is also the world leader in grain exports with a market share of 12%. As a result in addition to harming the region’s agricultural output the conflict between Ukraine and Russia is creating upheaval in global food markets which could disrupt the supply of more than one-quarter of the wheat worldwide.

This turmoil which is reflected in rising prices and logistical disruptions at ports is also causing a spike in transportation costs as well as affecting the global food chain and the distribution of grains throughout the world. As a result poor countries in South Asia Africa and the Middle East such as Egypt Syria and Lebanon which import 90% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine cannot afford to pay these inflated prices and are facing tangible food shortages which could lead to country-wide hunger and food insecurity.

According to UN data there has been an overall 30% price increase which is mainly affecting developing countries and weakened communities. This will lead to an even wider gap and polarization between these and Western countries and thus lead to further price increases and higher inflation rates.

Russia is winning and benefiting

The processes and trends discussed above leave no room for doubt. It’s not easy to admit but on the question of which side is winning the war in Europe and benefiting from the fact that no end to the struggle is in sight the answer is clearly Russia. And thus as part of the discussions surrounding the Russians’ military invasion of Ukraine the West must intensify and significantly increase the volume of resources it is allocating to the security and military fortification of Ukraine.

But – and this is a big but – we’re not talking about simple conventional arithmetic in which you can just calculate the number of tanks cannons and artillery barrels alongside advanced cyber capabilities that will be made available to the countries. Neither is this a history lesson examining the political moves and military maneuvers that have taken place over the last few decades which could shed light on the current situation.

WHAT WE have is a new situation in the international arena that compels the West to amend its approach toward Russia and adopt a new more pragmatic view that will provide an appropriate response to the new threats and opportunities alongside the complex interests and relationships in the international arena. The US and the West must pay attention to and learn from Putin’s conduct. They must take action so that they no longer appear weak in comparison with Russia. They absolutely cannot ignore the existence and importance of Russia or underestimate its capabilities.

Russia is an enormous country that is rich in resources and spread out over 11 time zones. It has the largest military in Europe and the second largest in the world. It has the largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world with 6000 nuclear warheads. Moreover it is one of the few countries that up until the breakout of the current war had good relations with almost all of the countries in the Middle East including Syria Iran the Gulf states and the Levant.

In recent years Russia has amplified its military presence in the Middle East especially in Syria where it has deployed 60000 troops built military bases adjacent to ports stationed fighter jets and missiles and deployed air defense systems. Furthermore it has developed military and diplomatic ties with countries throughout the region regardless of their ideological differences and disagreements between them.

Russia has also established relations with Israel and countries throughout Africa including Egypt Libya and Sudan. These connections have helped it position itself as a source of military power that is growing stronger just as the US is reducing its presence and activity in the Middle East.

Therefore from a broad geopolitical point of view the time has come to wake up and understand that although Russia is located on the outskirts of Europe and is experiencing powerful economic and military failures Putin – who advocates a ruthless realpolitik – is the one who is setting the tone and pace of events in the international arena. He is taking a nihilistic and predatory approach and is not seeking to wage a brutal war of attrition without a humane and rational price tag.

Meanwhile the war which highlights the huge gaps between the sides the conflicts of interest and the contradiction between their positions and values is a wake-up call that sharpens the West’s need to recalculate a path and formulate a coherent clear and flexible policy toward the Kremlin and its leaders.

On the one hand this policy must take into account these gaps as well as Russia and Putin’s strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand it must also take into consideration Russia’s global position which has support from China as well as the two countries’ joint struggle to overcome American hegemony. Neither can we ignore Russia’s status and importance in the Middle East in light of the continuing withdrawal of the US from the region.

A combination of sober thinking military skill and accurate intelligence will help the West formulate a sophisticated and appropriate policy that is a mixture of avoidance of violent confrontation with the Moscow regime and a coming to terms with the spread of Russia’s influence across the globe. All this while projecting an image of authority and a strong cohesive front that has the power to weaken and even block Russia and to prevent the situation from deteriorating and the war from having a destructive effect on Europe and the entire world.

Michael Ashner a longtime corporate activist who bought a stake in parent company Unilever after the boycott announcement and led a group opposed to move said other conglomerates should take heed of the repercussions suffered by the UK multinational since Ben & Jerry’s announced a boycott of the “occupied Palestinian territories” last year.

The boycott move — which was set to come into effect at the end of this year when Ben & Jerry’s contracts with its Israeli licensee Avi Zinger were due to expire — triggered massive financial blowback for Unilever as a number of US states enacted laws requiring them to divest from companies that boycott Israel. The Securities and Exchange Commission also launched an investigation into Unilever’s response to the boycott. Ben & Jerry’s made the boycott decision independently from Unilever which it was able to do under its acquisition agreement with the corporate behemoth.

On Wednesday Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s Israel announced a deal resolving a federal court case filed by the Israeli vendor that produces and distributes Ben & Jerry’s in the country. The agreement grants the Israeli licensee independence to continue operating in Israel and the West Bank essentially quashing the boycott.

“Other multinational companies will think twice before they engage in BDS activities in the future. That’s the lesson from this” Ashner told The Times of Israel on Thursday.

Ashner has a history of corporate activism with the Winthrop Capital Partners investment group in New York. He said he saw the boycott as a threat to the Jewish state a place the US-based investor feels connected to.

“If multinational companies could start cutting off Israel because of BDS that was as dangerous to the existence of Israel as Iran. It’s a very bad slippery slope” he said. “The first and loudest to do it was Unilever and somebody had to confront Unilever not just because what Unilever was doing was wrong but to send a message to all the other multinationals that this is not a good idea.”

Shortly after the Ben & Jerry’s boycott announcement Ashner acquired an undisclosed stake in Unilever and began pressuring the board and pushing for legal action in the US. He formed an organization called the Coalition to Hold Unilever Accountable with a number of law firms lobbying groups and scholars.

Ben & Jerry’s is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unilever despite its board’s independence on some matters. Unilever is a UK-based conglomerate and one of the largest consumer goods companies in the world with some 400 brands and a market value of around $116 billion.

They wanted to send the message that the repercussions would be severe from a financial perspective a corporate standpoint and for the company’s shares.

“It wasn’t over ice cream. What if Nestle decided to cut Israel off? What if Nike all these other companies? What would that do to Israel’s standing in the world? What would it do to it economically?” Ashner said.

The group started pressuring US states to go through with laws requiring them to divest from companies that support BDS. A number of states pulled close to a billion dollars from Unilever and the company’s value plummeted over $20 billion in the months after the boycott announcement at a time when the market was on the rise. Over 30 states have anti-BDS legislation and 12 state attorneys general and treasurers from seven states also called on Unilever to reconsider the boycott.

Separately Ashner and his partners also pushed the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Unilever claiming the company did not properly disclose to investors the risks stemming from the boycott.

Four US House Representatives signed onto a letter to the SEC including New York’s Ritchie Torres and Josh Gottheimer from New Jersey where Unilever’s US headquarters is located. Ashner warned Unilever of the SEC response in correspondence with Unilever’s leadership that was viewed by The Times of Israel.

On another track Ben & Jerry’s Israel and its owner Avi Zinger sued Unilever in US federal court in New Jersey saying the company was violating US and Israeli laws and illegally terminating their business relationship. The dispute ultimately came to a close when Zinger and Unilever resolved that case this week.

“This case became about so much more than just Avi Zinger. This became a case really for the Jewish people at large” said Alyza Lewin president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law which represented Zinger. “It was a case that they all felt as a people so what it did was it motivated people from far and wide to step up and do whatever they could do.”

“A lot of people were watching a lot of people were paying attention a lot of people were unhappy or angry” she said. “It’s like a machine with lots of different moving parts.”

Ashner said Unilever will likely change its business approach going forward. The company has a progressive corporate ideology with commitments to causes including the environment nutrition and living standards. Ben & Jerry’s has long pitched itself as a liberal activist company and when Unilever acquired the ice cream maker in 2000 it allowed the Ben & Jerry’s board to make those decisions independently. Unilever long maintained it had no control over the boycott decision.

“I think they’re going to have to modify their business model” Ashner said of Unilever. “Shareholders want profitable companies that are non-controversial. They’re not here to buy into investing controversy like this.”

He said prominent investor Nelson Peltz joining Unilever’s board in late May was likely a step in that direction that the firm was under pressure on other issues and that it had reached out to states that had divested because many may be able to reverse the move.

He gave Unilever credit for the agreement announced Wednesday but said the “real hero” was Zinger who inadvertently became a face in the struggle against BDS.

“I think Unilever believed that it was just going to go away and it would be able to deal with Avi in a quiet matter and it did not go away” Ashner said. “He dug his heels in and stayed the course all the way through and I think in his own way he’s heroic for what he did.”

Under the terms of his deal with Unilever Zinger has independence to produce and sell Ben & Jerry’s products in Israel and the West Bank in perpetuity. He has the exclusive rights to the Hebrew and Arabic branding but will cease using the English logo.

Ben & Jerry’s said it did not agree with the decision and will no longer profit from ice cream sales in Israel or the West Bank.

The BDS movement said Thursday that Unilever had “succumbed to bullying” and that the agreement was “further implicating the company in Israel’s decades-old system of oppression against Palestinians.”

Ashner and his family have previously been involved in philanthropy in Israel and founded the Beit Ruth therapeutic school for vulnerable women and girls in Afula.

The dispute began after last year’s May war between Israel and Gaza terror groups when Ben & Jerry’s said it would no longer allow its ice cream to be sold in Israeli settlements and also appeared to refer to East Jerusalem. The boycott announcement came after a heavy pressure campaign from anti-Israel and progressive activists. The decision sparked uproar in Israel and among some US Jewish groups many of whom called it antisemitic since the company has no boycotts against any other area of the world.

Zinger and his company refused to comply. Their license to sell the ice cream was set to expire at the end of 2022 meaning the boycott had not yet come into effect.

Critics of the attempted West Bank boycott note that Ben & Jerry’s allows its products to be sold in states with atrocious human rights records including Russia Saudi Arabia Syria Iran and China. The company has not taken action regarding other disputed territories including Tibet Crimea Western Sahara and Kashmir.

Supporters of the boycott Israel movement say that in urging businesses artists and universities to sever ties with Israel they are using nonviolent means to oppose unjust policies toward Palestinians. Israel says the movement masks its motives to delegitimize and destroy the Jewish state.",,,,,,

ith its sleek glass facades and Lego-like design it would look right at home on the grounds of an elite major university. But in truth the sprawling new building known as “Communiversity” graces the campus East Mississippi Community College (EMCC) described by its president as “a small rural” school in the town of Scooba in Mississippi’s Golden Triangle. Built at a cost of $42 million and also known as the Center for Manufacturing Technology Excellence 2.0 it serves as a bold symbol of the region’s commitment to advanced manufacturing.

Major manufacturers that have landed in the Golden Triangle the loosely defined economic region driven by the trio of Starkville Columbus and West Point include Yokohama Tire Paccar Steel Dynamics Airbus Aurora Flight Sciences and International Paper according to Dr. Scott Alsobrooks EMCC’s president. Their influence has driven a post-NAFTA renewal of regional manufacturing that’s been likened to a renaissance. The handsome new facility in Scooba is all about sustaining that surge Alsobrooks says.

“We’ve got to keep the talent pipeline going” he explains. “It’s up to us to heighten awareness and to bring in state-of-the-art training programs and to get more young people into advanced manufacturing and its auxiliary fields that are needed to run advanced manufacturing plants. And that extends” he says “into IoT and those professions.”

The Appalachian Regional Commission which invested $10.7 million toward Communiversity led a coalition of supporters that included the state legislature and the eastern counties of Clay Lowndes and Oktibbeha. Opened in the summer of 2019 the 135000-sq.-ft. facility features laboratory space a robotics lab 21 high-bay training stations for advanced machining technology incubation bays for startups and meeting and administration space. Composites research performed in conjunction with nearby Mississippi State University has led to a training arrangement with Aurora a division of Boeing one of EMCC’s growing list of workforce development partners.

As a potentially lucrative career with multiple pathways to entry advanced manufacturing says Alsobrooks continues to “fly under the radar” among potential workers a tendency that EMCC is addressing head on. Communiversity’s museum-like “Imagination Center” is open to the public and features displays from Aurora and other regional manufacturers.

“Young people” he says “still don’t know of the fabulous careers that are available in advanced manufacturing. We can bring them in and not only show them the educational facilities but also show them the products that are built. The Imagination Center can open their minds and help them to imagine career possibilities in manufacturing in our area and maybe get them to choose some of these really cool degree programs and short-term training programs we have that help prepare them to go into the world of manufacturing. It’s really the hot thing in jobs.”

Innovations such as these have landed EMCC on the Aspen Institute’s list of Top 150 Community Colleges in the nation five times since 2015. Alsobrooks says that 75% of EMCC’s student population of about 3500 qualifies for and receives financial aid.

“Some of our students come from poverty” he acknowledges. “And our goal is to help them out of that low end low skill low wage or no job situation. Help them into a situation where they can support a family. That’s what we’re all about. Trying to move them in that direction. Move them up and elevate them.”

Keeping the Goods Flowing

Just below the state line with Tennessee a cluster of counties in northern Mississippi rests within the gravitational pull of Memphis and its massive logistics hub. The concomitant growth of distribution centers leveraging Mississippi’s lower operating costs is generating tremendous demand in the region for workers with the training to keep those increasingly high-tech facilities up and running.

“We’re the distribution capital of the United States” says Dwayne Casey associate vice president for workforce solutions and career and technical education at Northwest Mississippi Community College which has locations in Senatobia Oxford and DeSoto County. “The biggest skillsets these companies are looking for” he says “are those of industrial maintenance technicians.”

“You come out of our program and you can do very very well.”

— Dwayne Casey Northwest Mississippi Community College

Winchester Ammunition William-Sonoma and Helen of Troy are among the major brands with logistics operations in DeSoto County. The DeSoto campus’s Industrial Electronic Engineering and Technology program a hybrid apprenticeship model is designed to serve the needs of employers such as those and to jump start careers in northern Mississippi.

“It’s a two-year associates degree” Casey says. “First semester they are with us seven hours a day Monday through Friday. If they have good grades and good attendance they interview with our employer partners and then for the next three semesters they go to school Monday Wednesday Friday and intern with the company on Tuesdays and Thursdays.”

The companies guarantee interns 16 hours a week in an industrial maintenance position and pay them at least $16 an hour. It is says Casey “the best possible setup and it’s worked very well for our employers and for our students. We have some great equipment and instructors” he says “but you can’t possibly teach them everything in the classroom alone.” The school he says has plans to offer a similar program in industrial automation. It also is adding programs in trucking and diesel technology.

“Right now” he says “we have students coming out of our electronic engineering program making $30 an hour to start. That’s very good money here in northern Mississippi. These jobs are in high demand. You come out of our program” says Casey “and you can do very very well.”

Enviva Partnership

In the spring of 2022 Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College’s George County Center some 40 miles north of Pascagoula launched a workforce development program with Maryland-based Enviva which recently opened its second of three planned biomass pellet facilities in Mississippi. The $140 million plant in Lucedale is producing some 750000 metric tons of wood pellets a year. The pellets are taken by rail to the Port of Pascagoula from which they are shipped around the world as a renewable energy source.

The new program offered in partnership with Accelerate MS the state’s lead office for workforce development strategy and coordination provides training to current and prospective Enviva employees. Running 18 weeks it is designed to enhance safety awareness and preparedness strengthen on-the-job skills and to promote continuous improvement and advancement.

“Through this workforce training initiative these students will be prepared for a career in their hometown with an outstanding company” says MGCCC president Mary S. Graham.

Enviva associates at the company’s new Lucedale plant can receive paid time off to attend training classes twice a week at the George County campus. Areas of instruction include critical plant continuity functions including transmitter operations hydraulics and pneumatics chain belt tension and alignment and preventative maintenance project training. Participants emerge from the program with certificates of completion.

“Successful workforce development happens when we build and nurture collaborative partnerships between Mississippi employers and community colleges like MGCCC that so ably serve our state” said Ryan Miller Executive Director of Accelerate MS. “Employee centered investment is a hallmark of great companies and I’m appreciative that Enviva has shown such a strong commitment to its employees and to George County as a whole.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFya2FuYWdhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9qdWwvMDIvaXRzLWhhcmQtdG8tZmluZC1wZW9wbGUtbGlrZS10aGVtLW5vdy1yb2JlcnQtYnVjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘It’s hard to find people like them now’ | Robert ‘Buck’ Hunter remembered for commitment to young people sports ...,"TEXARKANA -- Robert ""Buck"" Hunter was known as a coaching legend who made an impact on the lives he touched not only in sports but in the community as a whole.

Hunter died June 8 at age 82. The proud graduate of Dunbar High School and International Paper retiree was such an active member in his community that he and his late wife Betty Faye Hunter had a park in the Liberty-Eylau/Grandview community named after them.

Buck Hunter first established his role in the community coaching softball and baseball through Dixie Leagues at Grandview Park and Spring Lake Park from the early 1970s through about 2006.

Known as a compassionate yet disciplined leader Hunter valued education and made sure his players had good grades before they stepped on the field.

Betty Faye a teacher would tutor some of his players in their home.

""The respect factor that everybody had for Buck was universal"" said Liberty-Eylau High School baseball coach Zach Fowler who grew up playing baseball with Hunter's grandson Justin Coats. ""He went by Coach Buck whether you played for him or not. Everybody had that same mentality.""

Fowler said a lot of Hunter's coaching philosophies are ingrained in Liberty-Eylau's baseball program to this day.

""He had a deal where he let his kids make out the lineup. He would always say 'The kids know who the best players are.' So we start every year with that"" Fowler said.

Hunter's impact was felt off the field as well. He and Betty Faye took underprivileged children under their wings and provided them with opportunities they would otherwise miss.

Some of those children are now famous athletes like Byron Williams.

Williams played at L-E High before receiving a football scholarship to the University of Texas at Arlington where he studied business management. The Green Bay Packers drafted him in 1983 and he joined the New York Giants later that season. Williams played wide receiver for a total of 12 seasons in the NFL CFL and World Football League.

Williams attributes a lot of his success to Buck and Betty Hunter.

""When I made it to the NFL part of that success came from being around Buck and Betty Faye"" Williams said. ""You knew to act right and be accountable for your actions when you were around them.""

Williams a former member of the NFL Players Association advisory board holds an annual football camp at Liberty-Eylau. He said the Hunters were like family to him and his nine siblings.

""They always did the little things for us. (Buck) would pull me to the side and keep me focused on goals and things I should have. We had some awesome conversations"" he said.

The Hunters also mentored Craig Monroe would go on to play Major League Baseball for nine years primarily with the Detroit Tigers. Monroe lived with the family on and off while he was coached by Buck.

Kimberly McCoy who played ball under Hunter for almost 20 years said the Hunters were a constant presence in the Grandview community.

""I called (Buck) dad"" she said. ""You couldn't find a better person to take you under their wing.

""Him and Betty would take kids under their wing and they were just two great people. You didn't see one without the other. They was like two peas in a pod and they had the biggest hearts. It's hard to find people like them now.""

Hunter was also a key contributor to the integration of many softball teams in the early 1970s fielding what he would call ""colorless"" teams.

""In (1969) when they integrated they still didn't really integrate teams until the '70s"" Hunter told the Gazette in an April 2021 interview. ""I was probably one of the first coaches in Texarkana who integrated. I had white girls and black girls playing for me.""

James Keeton who has been an L-EISD Board member for about 26 years and was integral in getting the Grandview Park named after the Hunters praised Buck's social contributions.

""During that time we were coming into integration pretty good"" he said. ""And a lot of people were in poverty areas and we were working poverty programs where he was instrumental in helping us to establish community organizations so that we could find what the people's needs were.""

Keeton spoke of Buck and Betty as one because they were inseparable he said.

""A lot of people may not know but they played a great part in the integration of the Texarkana area as well as bridging the gap with whites Blacks Hispanics and just making people's lives better in this area.""

Hunter is survived by four sons two daughters two brothers five sisters two aunts four sisters-in-law and a host of grandchildren great-grandchildren extended family and other relatives.

""The legacy of Betty and Buck Hunter will live forever"" Keeton said.

Grandview Park in the Liberty-Eylau community of Texarkana Texas was renamed to honor Robert and Betty Hunter. The Hunters were known for their to devotion to the community especially its young people. (Submitted photo)

In response to the Supreme Court’s ruling to do away with the legal abomination that was

Roe v. Wade many misguided corporations have jumped at the virtue-signaling opportunity of a lifetime and announced that they are willing to pay thousands of dollars for employees to travel to a state where abortion is still legal in order to end the life of their pre-born child.

Pro-life investors have flooded our inbox in the few days since the SCOTUS decision asking how they can find out if they own stocks in these “abortion travel” companies through their mutual funds 401k or other investment accounts and if so how they can push back. The good news is that it is a simple task to align your investment portfolio to support life and together pro-life investors are sending a strong message that is making waves in corporate board rooms. The bad news is that if you have never looked at your investments through this lens before you are in for a shock.

Step 1: Find abortion travel companies in your investment portfolio

The first step in pushing back on abortion travel companies in your investment portfolio is to find out which ones you own. This is the hardest part but with the free investment screening technology at inspireinsight.com anyone can quickly identify the companies that are profiting from and supporting abortion in their portfolios simply by typing in the ticker symbols of their investment holdings.

Below is a list of companies that have already made public announcements of their abortion travel employee “benefits.” This is a rapidly evolving topic and our research team at Inspire will be updating this data on a regular basis and publishing it at inspireinsight.com so that pro-life investors can be empowered with the data to align their portfolios to support life and make it uncomfortable and unpopular for companies to continue paying their employees to terminate the life of their pre-born children. If you become aware of a company that should be on this list and is not please email us at inspire@inspireinvesting.com so we can investigate and add them; we appreciate the additional eyes and ears on this important and quick-moving issue.

Step 2: Send a message through shareholder activism

Once you find out what companies in your investment portfolio are supporting abortion by paying for employees to travel for an abortion procedure among other pro-abortion policies and donations you should send a message (literally and figuratively) to those companies. An easy way to do this is to find the investor relations email or phone number on the corporate website and make contact. Here are some bullet points for you to consider in your message to these abortion-supporting businesses:

Abortion ends the life of a pre-born child and you are deeply opposed to your shareholder dollars being used to pay for such a procedure.

Abortion travel reimbursements are rife with tax and legal liabilities and as a shareholder you are concerned that the company is not acting responsibly with shareholders’ best interests in mind.

Abortion travel policies present a significant financial liability that may materially erode your returns as a shareholder.

Abortion travel policies open the door for costly abuse and fraud as companies likely will not be able to receive proof that employees actually used the money to have an abortion rather than just a free trip to sunny California on your shareholder dime.

Inform the company that if they refuse to stop payments for abortion travel you will be divesting of your shares – or – if you own individual shares (rather than a mutual fund) and it is possible with that particular company that you will be supporting a shareholder resolution to end that policy.

Step 3: Divest from or engage with abortion-supporting companies

If you own abortion-supporting companies through a mutual fund or ETF you do not have many options other than selling that fund and buying a different one that does not invest in abortion stocks so you need to research your options. You can find out about your pro-life investment options at inspireinvesting.com and if you want professional guidance from pro-life financial advisors specially trained and resourced to invest to support life you can connect with our team there.

If you own individual stocks rather than funds you also have the ability to file or join a shareholder resolution to oppose corporate abortion funding. This is a more complicated process but if there is a resolution being filed by our team at Inspire Investing or our pro-life allies it is exceedingly simple to support the effort with your shareholder proxy vote. To find out if there is a resolution in the works with the problem companies in your portfolio email us at inspire@inspireinvesting.com and also be sure to sign up for our newsletter at inspireinvesting.com to be informed of new resolutions and action plans you can participate in.

Pro-life investors making an impact

By God’s grace we have seen major corporations including Exxon Chevron Costco and others change their corporate policies in response to our engagement efforts. Working together pro-life investors have a uniquely powerful avenue to advance the protection of life at conception.

Roe v. Wade is overturned and a goliath encumbrance has been removed from the pro-life movement. The battle to save the lives of millions of pre-born babies is in full force. Now more than ever is the time to lean into this good work and end abortion in every state forever.

INTU,Intuit,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL2NvbmdyZXNzLW1lbWJlcnMtY2FsbC1mb3ItaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1pbnRvLWludHVpdC1sb2JieWluZy10dXJib3RheC1zY2FuZGFscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Congress Members Call for Investigation Into Intuit Lobbying TurboTax Scandals,"Members of Congress are calling for an investigation of Intuit the company that owns TurboTax after it failed to adequately respond to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in an April letter citing OpenSecrets’ reporting on the tax preparation company’s lobbying.

Intuit has spent decades lobbying against free government-sponsored tax filing services and the tax prep company’s lobbying efforts have ramped up significantly in recent years.

Along with its subsidiary Credit Karma Intuit spent $840000 during the first quarter of 2022 — more than any prior first quarter.

Even without the $60000 in spending by Credit Karma Intuit’s $780000 in direct first quarter spending is more than the tax prep company has spent in the first quarter of any prior year up from $650000 during the same period in 2021 and $750000 in 2020.

The company along with its subsidiary spent nearly $3.3 million in 2021. Intuit first broke $3 million in annual lobbying spending in 2020 with $3.4 million.

Following scrutiny of the tax prep company’s lobbying and escalating tensions around its marketing practices members of Congress are calling for an investigation into what they describe as Intuit’s “revolving door scheme.”

Citing reporting by OpenSecrets in April Warren sent a letter to Intuit CEO Sasan K. Goodarzi in April. Warren accused the company of “extensive lobbying and adroit influence peddling” and requested a response to questions about their activities.

On June 21 Warren joined with Reps. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) to send a letter calling on the Acting Treasury Department Inspector General Richard K. Delmar Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George and Acting Inspector General at the Federal Trade Commission Andrew Katsaros to mount an in-depth investigation into Intuit’s “use of the revolving door to influence policy decisions” and the “extent to which Intuit — and other Free File Alliance members — have used the revolving door to exert undue influence on department and agency policies particularly Free File.”

But the lawmakers contend that “Intuit’s response [to the initial letter] was inadequate failing to dispel any of the concerns about its unethical behavior or to provide information on any employee that had made a trip through the revolving door despite the extensive reporting on specific egregious cases” highlighting “troubling reports of Intuit’s abuse of the revolving door and the company’s hiring of former federal regulators and influence-peddlers to defend its shady business practices.”

In the June 21 letter the lawmakers also asked the inspectors general to “assess whether the codes of conduct and ethics policies of Intuit and other Free File Alliance members are sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest and abuse of the revolving door.”

The tax prep company’s current K Street contingent boasts an impressive slate of “revolving door” lobbyists with 41 of Intuit’s 55 lobbyists previously holding federal government positions. Intuit has spent more than $41 million on lobbying since 1998 and enlisted dozens of revolving door lobbyists including multiple former members of Congress. They have included former Reps. Randy Forbes (R-Va.) Charles Boustany (R-La.) Albert Wynn (D-Md.) and former Sen. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.).

Lawmakers are not the only ones putting Intuit in the hot seat.

In April the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint accusing Intuit of deceptively advertising their paid tax preparation services as free filing.

On May 4 ​​Intuit announced that the company agreed to pay $141 million in restitution to 4.4 million low-income customers who were charged for using the TurboTax Free Edition.

And on June 28 law firm Pomerantz LLP announced it is investigating Intuit investors’ claims about concerns about Intuit its officers or directors engaging in “securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.”

Debate Continues Over The Mpemba Effect,"Does hot water freeze faster than cold water? On its face this idea seems like it should be ridiculously simple to test and even easier to intuit but this question has in fact had physicists arguing for decades.

There’s a name for the phenomenon of something hot freezing faster than something cold: the Mpemba effect named for Erasto Mpemba (pictured above) who as a teenager in Tanzania witnessed something strange in high school in the 1960s. His class was making ice cream and in a rush to secure the last available ice tray Mpemba skipped waiting for his boiled milk-and-sugar mixture to cool to room temperature first like everyone else had done. An hour and a half later his mixture had frozen into ice cream whereas the other students’ samples remained a thick liquid slurry.

Puzzled by this result Mpemba asked his physics teacher what was going on. He was told “You were confused. That cannot happen.” Mpemba wasn’t convinced by that answer and his observations ultimately led to decades of research.

What makes this question so hard to nail down? Among many of the issues complicating exactly how to measure such a thing is that water frankly has some odd properties; it is less dense as a solid and it is also possible for its solid and liquid phases to exist at the same temperature. Also water in the process of freezing is not in equilibrium and how exactly things act as they relax into equilibrium is a process for which — physics-wise — we lack a good theory. Practically speaking it’s also a challenge how to even accurately and meaningfully measure the temperature of a system that is not in equilibrium.

But there is experimental evidence showing that the Mpemba effect can occur at least in principle. How this can happen seems to come down to the idea that a hot system (having more energy) is able to occupy and explore more configurations potentially triggering states that act as a kind of shortcut or bypass to a final equilibrium. In this way something that starts further away from final equilibrium could overtake something starting from closer.

But does the Mpemba effect actually exist — for example in water — in a meaningful way? Not everyone is convinced but if nothing else it has sure driven a lot of research into nonequilibrium systems.

Why not try your own hand at investigating the Mpemba effect? After all working to prove someone wrong is a time-honored pastime of humanity surpassed only in popularity by the tradition of dismissing others’ findings observations or results without lifting a finger of your own. Just remember to stick to the scientific method. After all people have already put time and effort into seriously determining whether magnets clean clothes better than soap so surely the Mpemba effect is worth some attention.",,,,,,,,,

INVH,Invitation Homes,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL2Jlem9zLWxhdGVzdC1wcm9qZWN0LWFycml2ZWQtaG9tZXMtY291bGQtYmUtYS1wYWluLWluLXRoZS1hc3MtZm9yLXJlbnRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bezos' Latest Project Could Be a Pain in the Ass for Renters,"From the outside it is a remarkably plain three-bedroom home in Tuscaloosa Alabama. Nicknamed “The Peanut” it is 15 years old fronted with brick and within shouting distance of the Tuscaloosa Nazarene Church. If that house of prayer isn’t of interest there are at least another 19 within 4 miles.

The Peanut is notable because of its owners—all 251 of them. Together they pooled their funds this year to buy and then rent the $215000 property putting in as little as $100 apiece.

The deal was facilitated by Arrived Homes a startup that has raised more than $160 million in funding and debt financing including two infusions from Jeff Bezos’ personal investment arm Bezos Expeditions and at least one from Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Salesforce billionaire Marc Benioff’s investment fund.

Its goal is to give retail investors access to the lucrative rental market mimicking the institutional investors that have spent tens of billions of dollars snapping up properties across the country—and which have massively disrupted the home-buying landscape in the process.

Arrived Homes is still small but judging by its war chest it has plans to become a major player. In May after the company posted a new batch of homes on its platform prospective investors crashed the website; the company said it received 100 times the site traffic it had projected. Weeks later another half-dozen of its homes reportedly sold out in eight minutes. Other companies such as Roofstock Fundrise Fintor and Fractional are operating with variations of the same model.

But what looks like a win for retail investors may pose a big issue for the average American who wants to buy a home and for the renters who send in their lease checks to a faceless startup or profit-seeking investor—potentially making it harder to address problems with an actual human.

While the rental industry is opaque and hard to study “there are reasons to think that investor owners might be more interested in short-term profits more apt to charge [the] maximum rents possible less likely to scrutinize purchases and less engaged in day-to-day management of buildings” said Professor Ingrid Gould Ellen faculty director at the NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.

And Arrived is scaling up as the housing market is already mired in an affordability crisis. Low inventory (fueled at least in part by institutional buyers) and a flurry of activity during the pandemic have helped drive prices to record highs.

In Tuscaloosa for instance the price for a single-family house has skyrocketed 40 percent over the past five years according to Zillow data cited by Arrived.

Increasingly there are signs that home-buying has begun shifting from a vehicle for accruing generational wealth to a sexy asset class for Wall Street and the technology class.

“There is some worry that these kinds of purchases are going to crowd out the homeowners that are trying to purchase homes” Ellen said though she noted that single-family home rentals are not a new phenomenon. What really has changed she said is the financial scale of the buyers.

In a statement Arrived’s CEO and cofounder Ryan Frazier defended the company’s business model. “Our primary goal is to open up the real estate market for those who might not otherwise have access to it” he said arguing that average investors now have the “wealth-building potential that was previously only available to the rich and powerful.” Several thousand investors on its platform now own property for the first time he added. Bezos’ firm did not respond to requests for comment.

Wall Street started hoovering up single-family homes in the wake of the Great Recession. As ProPublica reported earlier this year “more than 3.7 million households went through foreclosure.” Government policies then helped encourage private equity firms to buy up houses en masse including by letting firms deal directly with Fannie Mae the federally sponsored mortgage giant.

In retrospect there is debate about whether policymakers should have acted sooner—before a housing glut existed—“so that people didn't lose their homes” said Amanda Kass associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois Chicago.

Large companies like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent eventually consolidated and emerged as rental giants. According to a memo prepared last month by staff of the House Committee on Financial Services as one example in the third quarter of 2021 “institutional investors bought 42.8 percent of homes for sale in the Atlanta metro area and 38.8 percent of homes in the Phoenix-Glendale-Scottsdale area.”

The memo also noted that corporate buyers operate disproportionately in areas “with significantly larger Black populations than the national average” and that institutional money holds major advantages when buying new property including closing deals rapidly and entirely in cash.

Multiple housing experts emphasized to The Daily Beast that data about institutional landlords is messy and difficult to fully parse. And there is nuance within the numbers. Oren Ziv assistant professor at Michigan State noted that higher numbers of rental units could theoretically push rent prices down.

Whatever the effect of Wall Street’s money the potential returns are tantalizing—as evidenced by the tech startups mirroring its playbook.

For now Arrived Homes and its cohort have barely made a dent in the broader industry. But if they can execute their ambitions—and generate big returns for their venture capitalists—that will surely change.

In the process Bezos—currently worth $132 billion—will get a little bit richer too.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We used databases of varying size type and provenance to eliminate the possibility of discordance caused by mere database choice. The results of this study as shown in Fig. 1 indicate the methods are generally inconsistent with each other with discordance observed in 60 to 80% of time series across 10 databases. As Tables 3 4 and 5 reveal the methods exhibit considerable within-database variation even when only considering the proportion of time series classified as seasonal. The existence of this variation on all databases and significance levels indicates that the source of the variation is not the data but the methods themselves.

Sources of discord

Ultimately the source of discord stems from the different ways in which the methods assess seasonality. While there do exist similarities each method focuses on a different aspect of a time series to assess seasonality (Table 2). For instance half the methods (ET AA AR ED) fit a time series with a hypothetical model and test the model for seasonality while the other half (FR KW WE QS) test different aspects of a time series directly without using a hypothesized model. To take the discussion further and generalize where we can we make distinctions between types of concordance and types of peaks. Regarding concordance we define “positive concordance” to be unanimous agreement among the methods that a time series is seasonal while “negative concordance” to be unanimous agreement that a time series is non-seasonal. Therefore for a given time series the methods are discordant when there is neither positive concordance nor negative concordance. Regarding peaks we say that peaks are “persistent” if they occur year after year and they are “consistent” if they occur in the same month. We make this distinction because peaks relate to important aspects of time series analysis relevant to seasonality; specifically variation and autocorrelation. Peaks can of course come in different sizes. Time series with large peaks suggest greater variation than those with small peaks. Persistent peaks (be they small or large) suggest the possibility of underlying cyclical behavior in the time series. Consistent peaks to the extent that they are consistent indicate autocorrelation in the time series. We’ll use Figs. 2 and 3 to navigate the remainder of the discussion.

From Fig3.ts1 (N = 2809) and Fig3.ts9 (N = 1498) we learn that the methods exhibit concordance only 4307/11137 = 38.7% of the time. Figure 2 provides valuable insight into the extent of discord among the methods. Of the 40 unique combinations we observe that some combinations occur more frequently than others and this is due to similarities in the testing procedure (Table 2). For instance methods that group time series data by month and test for differences among the groups are assessing seasonality differently than methods that fit a hypothetical model and then determine seasonality by minimizing forecast error. Acknowledging the differences in how the methods assess seasonality is important not only for understanding the amount of observed discord but in recognizing that these differences indicate a disagreement with regards to how seasonality is defined. Indeed if the methods were highly concordant despite their contrasting approaches we would have to concede that the contrasting approaches are ultimately just different ways of expressing the same aspect of a time series. This can be observed more clearly by exploring Fig. 3. In Fig3.ts1 … Fig3.ts4 we observe time series that to the human eye seem seasonal and very similar. Identifying such time series as seasonal is a very old idea in time series analysis with Beveridge [24] and Yule [25] employing harmonic functions to model time series with cyclical behavior. However despite an obvious cyclical pattern and visual similarities Fig3.ts2 Fig3.ts3 and Fig3.ts4 all exhibit discord. The reason being except for the ED method the methods are not testing for seasonality by fitting the data with harmonic functions. Thus the different methods of seasonality assessment ultimately result in different definitions of seasonality.

As we’ve mentioned previously the behavior of peaks plays an important role in concordance. We’ll use Fig. 3 further to explore the relationship between peaks variation and discord and provide general principles as to when a method would be more likely to classify a time series as seasonal rather than non-seasonal.

Positive concordance

Since each method assesses seasonality differently positive concordance is only achieved when multiple conditions are simultaneously present. Persistent and consistent peaks are most important for ED AA AR and ET. Peaks will result in a seasonal classification by ED so long as there exists a sufficient difference between the peaks and troughs in the data. However even with persistent and consistent peaks variation (particularly among the peaks) over time can lead to a non-seasonal classification by AA AR or ET (Fig3.ts2 Fig3.ts3 and Fig3.ts4). Indeed we have confirmed experimentally that we can achieve positive concordance for the time series in Fig3.ts2 Fig3.ts3 and Fig3.ts4 by removing the data prior to 2016. Since time series with persistent and consistent peaks will have high correlation between seasonal lags they will be classified seasonal by QS. For FR KW and WE most important is variation. In the absence of the prominent peaks we see in Fig3.ts1 … Fig3.ts4 sufficient variation in the time series data can lead FR KW and WE to a seasonal classification (Fig3.ts6). Therefore with regards to positive concordance we see tension among the methods in that variation may cause some methods to classify seemingly seasonal time series as non-seasonal (Fig3.ts2 Fig3.ts3 and Fig3.ts4) and seemingly non-seasonal time series as seasonal (Fig3.ts5 … Fig3.ts8).

Negative concordance

The relationship between negative concordance and variation is more straightforward. The time series in Fig3.ts5 … Fig3.ts9 are similar in that one cannot determine the results of the methods by visual inspection alone (recall that any linear trend in each of the original series have been removed prior to method application). Given the similarity of the time series in Fig3.ts5 … Fig3.ts9 it’s reasonable to wonder why they all do not exhibit negative concordance. Ultimately time series that are constant or stationary around a constant mean with minimal variation will result in negative concordance among the methods. However a time series with both large peaks and variation will exhibit negative concordance if there is no monthly or yearly autocorrelation (for instance a time series generated from N(μσ2)). As was noted in the Results section the 1498 time series for which the methods exhibit negative concordance report a mean variance of 0 to four decimal places.

Generalization and limitations

We’ve explained general scenarios in which we can expect negative and positive concordance but further generalization is more difficult. As Fig. 3 reveals there are thousands of different combinations of discord (M = 2168 … 1267) for each time series making it difficult to predict which particular combination of discord to expect based on visual inspection of the time series alone. However an immediate consequence of this study is that researchers using different methods are implicitly defining seasonality differently. Given the discordance between the methods researchers relying on different methods are likely to encounter different results thus leading to conflicting understanding of the seasonality of a time series.

Finally we note that the study and evaluation of methods was limited to 10 observational databases and eight methods of binary seasonality classification. Different results may have been observed by modifying one or more of the design choices. As was explained in the Discussion section aspects of a time series that influence seasonality classification include variance autocorrelation peak persistence and peak consistence. Time series constructed to influence one or more of those aspects could influence concordance. We chose 10 observational databases.

It will begin at 1 p.m. at their home 31610 60th St. in Salem.

Ralph Myers and Joyce Olson went on their first date to a Milwaukee Braves baseball game and was arranged by friends. They rode the same bus to Central High School but it was not until this “arranged date” that they started dating.

Ralph and Joyce were married on June 30 1962 at Bristol United Methodist Church in Bristol and held their reception at Central High School in Paddock Lake. They have lived in Kenosha County for more than 80 years.

They have five children: Marcia (Dan) Peterson of Iron Mountain Mich.; Melissa (Dan) Riddell of Salem; Jeffrey (Jeanette) Myers of Kenosha; James (Linda) Myers of Arlington Heights Ill.; and Jerome (Kirsten) Myers of McKinnie Texas. They have 10 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Ralph graduated from La Cross College with a degree in education. He taught 1 year in Manitowoc 4 years at Wheatland Center School and 32 years at Paris Consolidated School. All of the time he taught physical education and math. Ralph retired from teaching in 1998. Since retiring he has worked at two greenhouses: first at Zirbel’s in Racine and now and for the last 20 years has worked at Anton’s Greenhouse in Pleasant Prairie.

Joyce graduated from Racine Kenosha Teacher’s College and taught for one and a half years at Highland School in Kenosha. She then took time off to stay at home and raise their children. Joyce did volunteer during her “time off” at Bristol Grade School but when their youngest child was in 8th grade she was given the opportunity to work full time at Bristol Grade School in their Title 1 reading program. She was working full time in the Bristol School Library before retiring in 2007.

Ralph and Joyce are active members of the Bristol United Methodist Church. They are both officers and leaders of the church. Joyce has belonged to HCE for over 50 years. Ralph and Joyce are founding members of the Paddock Lake Area Lions Club working to serve the community and the world. They led the family in service for 10 plus years by hosting hundreds of Naval Recruits on Christmas Day a family endeavor that brought comfort and holiday spirit to the many recruits who could not be with their family on Christmas Day.

Their advice for a successful and lasting relationship? Their faith in God first and foremost. Ralph and Joyce are never far apart; whether attending church together watching ball games together working on their flower garden together attending meeting and activities together most everything is done together. And also very important is telling each other “I love you” each and every day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWhlcmFsZC9uYW1lL3BhdHJpY2lhLWVja2VyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM1NTM0ODA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PATRICIA ECKER Obituary (1935 - 2022) - ROLLING MEADOWS IL - Daily Herald,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dailyherald/name/patricia-ecker-obituary?id=35534807 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWhlcmFsZC9uYW1lL3BhdHJpY2lhLWVja2VyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM1NTM0ODA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

*The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. **The tax impact of adjustments is calculated using a tax rate of 24% for the three and nine month periods of fiscal 2024 and for the three and nine month periods of fiscal 2023. Our tax rate for non-GAAP adjustment items takes a broad look at our recurring tax adjustments and applies them to non-GAAP revenue that does not have its own specific tax impacts.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

Jacobs’ latest book is perfect for puzzling times,"In 2019 bestselling author A.J. Jacobs traveled to Spain with his wife Julie and two of their children to compete in the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship.

Jacobs an “immersion journalist” often wrangles his wife and sons into helping him with his wacky professional projects. This time he even made them wear special T-shirts. The witty Jacobs had their Team USA shirts printed with the motto “E pluribus unum pictura” (Out of many one picture).

It was part of the writer’s research for his new book “The Puzzler: One Man’s Quest to Solve the Most Baffling Puzzles Ever from Crosswords to Jigsaws to the Meaning of Life.”

And while the family may have put their shirts on reluctantly once the action started Julie and the boys took the competition very seriously.

“I love that Julie once skeptical has fully committed. She’s trash-talking the puzzle. She has also sworn not to take a bathroom break for the entire eight hours. This is a first in the 20 years we’ve been together” Jacobs writes.

Given the incredibly stiff competition and the Jacobs family’s relatively meager preparation the author was pleased with the outcome.

“My prayers have been answered. We did not finish last” he writes.

Team USA came in second to last. Along the way they picked up some great tips for doing better next time such as sorting puzzle pieces by shape instead of color and bringing a sharp tool to avoid the rookie mistake of wasting precious time opening plastic-wrapped puzzle boxes with a fingernail.

This is the kind of fun laced throughout “The Puzzler” in which however the author takes puzzles and the benefit of solving them very seriously.

In conversation with The Times of Israel Jacobs argues that approaching life’s challenges as puzzles to be solved — rather than problems to be eradicated — makes us better thinkers and even better people.

“Delving into the world of puzzles was a natural for me” Jacobs said in a recent interview from his home in New York.

The book turned out to be a real passion project because as Jacobs writes in its introduction “I’ve been crazy for puzzles all my life.”

The author inherited a particular love of crosswords from his parents who would solve them jointly through the mail.

“When my dad was in the army in Korea and my mom was stateside they’d keep in touch by sending a puzzle back and forth each filling out a clue or two per turn. Not the most efficient method but certainly romantic” Jacobs writes.

Jacobs is a long-time practitioner of what is known as immersion or experimental journalism. For example for “The Know-It-All” he spent 18 months reading through the entire Encyclopedia Britannica. For “The Year of Living Biblically” the secular Jacobs tried to follow every rule and commandment in the Torah. For “Drop Dead Healthy” he worked to whip his “mushy” body into shape and good health with the help of a team of expert medical advisers researchers nutritionists and trainers.

Accordingly for “The Puzzler” Jacobs spent the last two and a half years researching 17 different types of puzzles and solving countless examples. He may not have come away the world’s expert on every type of puzzle but he has a better grasp than most of Rubik’s Cubes sudokus riddles mazes chess problems cryptics anagrams rebuses Japanese puzzle boxes and more.

Jacobs said he wanted “The Puzzler” like his other books to combine elements of memoir adventure interesting characters history science and self-help. But this book would have something extra.

“With this one I wanted to write a book that was not only about puzzles but that was also a book of puzzles” he said.

To that end he includes many historical examples of puzzles as well as a whole section of original puzzles created by puzzle maestro Greg Pliska founder of Exaltation of Larks a company that creates puzzle hunts for corporate and private clients.

“I initially thought about creating the puzzles myself but I realized I needed a professional to do it. I learned by writing this book that creating puzzles is a real art” Jacobs said.

To make things even more challenging Jacobs and Pliska embedded a secret passcode in the book’s introduction that provides access to a contest made up of a series of puzzles on the book’s website (thepuzzlerbook.com).

The $10000 prize for being the first to solve the puzzle hunt has been claimed. However the puzzles remain available on the website for those who want to try their hand at them.

“Four hundred people got to the finals of the contest. Unbelievably [winner] Benji Nguyen and a group of his friends completed the final level in only an hour” Jacobs marveled.

“The Puzzler” readers will enjoy Jacobs’ signature self-deprecating humorous recounting of his research and reporting but they will also get a real brain workout especially if they attempt to solve all the puzzles in the book.

You might want to pace yourself reading one or two chapters at a time. Those who want to skip the solving can breeze through Jacobs’ engaging prose and still get a sense of how each kind of puzzle came to be and how it works — and of course learn a lot of quirky facts.

Who wouldn’t want to know that there are 43252003274489856000 (let’s round it to 43 quintillion) possible arrangements of the colored squares making up a Rubik’s Cube? Or that a Chinese teenager named Yusheng Du can solve the twisty puzzle in a record-holding 3.47 seconds? Or that the largest twisty cube is 33x33x33 making it much harder to solve using your feet as has been done with some of the smaller cubes.

“My personal best is two minutes and fifty-eight seconds. Not great. Sort of like bench-pressing twenty-five pounds” Jacobs writes.

Jacobs always meets interesting individuals and communities while writing his books. He said he enjoyed getting to know puzzlers all over the world including those who have worked steadily since 1990 to crack the code embedded in the “Kryptos” sculpture by artist Jim Sanborn installed at CIA headquarters.

Unlike most people who have to try to decode Kryptos from photos and drawings Jacobs got permission to see it in person. Upon hearing that the author was on his way to Langley Virginia Kryptos enthusiasts inundated him online with hints suggestions clues and requests.

Although Jacobs was warmly welcomed into the puzzler community he discovered that its members can be sticklers for exactitude.

“For instance when I posted the intended image [of a crossword] for the book’s cover on my Twitter feed I got tons of comments saying ‘That is not a puzzle!'” the author recounted.

It turns out that the crossword included two big no-no’s: It was asymmetrical and it had two-letter words. Fortunately there was time to correct the image before publication and avoid further uproar.

Jacobs said that of all his books this one took him the longest to write. He chalked that up to the COVID-19 pandemic which prevented or delayed some of his research trips. He also had a lot of unexpected family time which turned out to be both good and bad for a writer trying to make a deadline. On one hand three teenage boys cooped up at home did not make for a quiet working environment. On the other Jacobs had a captive group to help him try out a variety of puzzles.

At the end of his quest and after the lockdown restrictions were lifted Jacobs ordered a custom generational puzzle from Dutch puzzle creator Oskar van Deventer to keep the momentum going… for an unimaginably long time.

Generational puzzles are just what they sound like — puzzles that are so difficult that they take generations to solve. The appropriately named “Jacobs’ Ladder” tower-like puzzle ordered by the author requires the twisting of a series of pegs to remove a metal rod. It will take 1.2 decillion moves to solve. Jacobs can only hope that his great-great-grandchildren will love puzzles as much as he does.

As challenging as puzzles can be Jacobs claims that the certainty of their solutions can provide us comfort. The sense of flow that connects the solver with the puzzle can lead to a transcendent spiritual experience. Who wouldn’t want to feel that dopamine hit?

While each type of puzzle is unique there is much we can learn from puzzles as a whole. Jacobs is adamant that the skills we use to solve puzzles with their platonic ideal of a single solution can help us navigate our messy world.

He suggested that this approach can be applied to tackling climate change the culture war AI safety and pandemic preparedness for example.

“In real life there may be multiple possible solutions from which to ultimately choose but puzzle-solving skills such as breaking things down into smaller chunks or looking at things from all sides and reverse angles can help us arrive at good options” Jacobs said.

“It’s about that very Jewish trait of asking lots of questions” he said.

You would be correct! However this is a prime example of how a common word like “THE” can become a trademark. Ohio State’s path to registration was not without hurdles however and they teach important lessons.

First why did the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) allow Ohio State to register “THE” even though it’s a common word in the English language? Well as applied to the clothing for which Ohio State uses the mark “THE” doesn’t describe any features of the goods so it’s not a descriptive designation that cannot be registered. And Ohio State had its reasons for wanting to register “THE.” The University wanted to differentiate itself from (and avoid confusion with) others that use the acronym OSU such as Oregon State University and Oklahoma State University. Ohio State found the solution to this by adding the word “THE” in front of “Ohio State University.” (See photo below.)

Now come the lessons in trademark law. Ohio State wouldn’t have received a registration for “THE” unless it used the mark prominently as it did in a way that created a separate commercial impression from the school’s name. Lesson one: use any trademark often in close proximity to other words (as THE is to OHIO STATE) in a different typeface or more prominent lettering and always separately from the other words.

Second the USPTO rejected Ohio State’s application for “THE” trademark. The USPTO reasoned that the mark was merely a decorative or ornamental feature of Ohio State’s clothing and did not function as a trademark to indicate its source or to identify and distinguish the clothing from those of others. Specifically Ohio State’s original specimen (pictured above) which it submitted to the USPTO to demonstrate its use of the mark shows “THE” in prominent lettering on the upper-center area of the front of the shirt. The specimen shows “THE” used in a merely decorative manner leaving consumers with little or no understanding of its source-identifying significance. Lesson two: for any goods but especially those like clothing on which the mark could be mistaken for ornamentation use the mark on packaging a hangtag or label that will be associated by consumers with the source of the goods not just on the visible parts/surface of the goods.

Ohio State faced another hurdle because Marc Jacobs had also applied for the “THE” trademark. Like Ohio State Marc Jacobs submitted a specimen showing “THE” on the front of a shirt (see below).

The USPTO rejected Marc Jacobs’ application for the same reason it rejected Ohio State’s. Jacobs’ “THE” was merely a decorative or ornamental feature of the clothing and thus did not function as a trademark to indicate the source of Marc Jacobs’ clothing and to identify and distinguish Jacobs’ clothing from others.

As noted above there is a simple solution to this dilemma and both parties’ counsel followed it obviating the USPTO refusal. Ohio State simply converted its application from use-based to intent to use enabling it to submit a specimen showing “THE” on the label of the shirt as depicted below.

Marc Jacobs deployed the same strategy giving it the opportunity to submit a new specimen (which to date it has not done but will no doubt before the three-year period to do so expires).

You may be wondering if Ohio State faced any rejection based on Marc Jacobs’ application or vice versa. In fact since Marc Jacobs filed its trademark application first the USPTO rejected Ohio State’s application because it was likely to cause confusion with Marc Jacobs’ as the parties’ marks were identical and both applications covered clothing. Ohio State opposed Jacobs’ application but the issue was resolved when the parties reached a coexistence agreement which Ohio State submitted to the USPTO. The Agreement recited that there was no likelihood of confusion between the “THE” marks given the parties’ different trade channels (e.g. consumers wishing to “show affinity for a power five collegiate athletic program in the case of Ohio State on the one hand and consumers wishing to show affinity to a high-end/contemporary fashion brand in the case of MJT on the other hand”).

Ostensibly both parties jumped a lot of hurdles simply to register trademarks in the common word “THE” but this leads us to the third and final lesson: don’t underestimate the value they took away—or any party can– by registering trademark rights with the USPTO. In the end both Ohio State and Marc Jacobs came out on THE top!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21hcnRpbi1rb3NraS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNTUzOTY2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Martin Koski Obituary - Jacobs-Lundholm Funeral Home and Crematory - Florence - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/martin-koski-obituary?id=35539667 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21hcnRpbi1rb3NraS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNTUzOTY2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXJrc2hpcmVlYWdsZS5jb20vYXJ0c19hbmRfY3VsdHVyZS9iZXJrc2hpcmVsYW5kc2NhcGVzL2JvZHl0cmFmZmljLWphY29icy1waWxsb3ctZGFuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZV9jOTYyYjE1Mi1mOTRjLTExZWMtYWM5Yy1lMzBiYjA4MTk5ZTYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DANCE REVIEW: Eloquently-trained bodies speak volumes in BODYTRAFFIC's triple-bill performance at Jacob's Pillow,"BECKET — Matthew Neenan’s 2018 dance “A Million Voices” opens the triple bill performed by the Los Angeles-based BODYTRAFFIC at Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival this week reminding us instantly of how terrific this contemporary dance company is. Set to songs sung by the iconic mid-20th century singer Peggy Lee the dance is at once winkingly hip and charmingly nostalgic retro in all the right ways. It’s all kinds of other things too — well-constructed exceptionally danced witty yet earnest — and curiously soothing. The program notes that Lee’s music “in response to the political climate of her time reminds us that even during dark times life is worth enjoying.”

Indeed the cast of eight dancers offers up snapshots of individual lives experiencing some of the universal joys of life. (Along with the ups however there are a few downs; this is life after all.) Dancers fall in and out of love dream big dreams fret and play. Like whimsical figures emerging from a Chagall painting they become a circus troupe high-stepping like elegant elephants; or they become a human train their lower legs moving rhythmically like wheels and rods.

Although they’re telling their tales in the most abstract way — through the physical language of dance — their eloquently-trained bodies speak volumes. And Neenan’s choreography based in ballet contemporary and modern is an uncannily seamless mix of performative and pedestrian movements: a smart and sensitive correspondent with the lyrics rather than a rote follower. Neenan’s staging is likewise expert; one moment the dancers are scattered about the stage moving or pausing or posing individually before joining on a dime without a formal set-up in a tightly-knit group phrase. Duets form organically as if pulled into sharp focus by a movie camera the rest of the group still in the frame but now receded. It’s all superb — whether ensemble solos or duets — although particular sections stand out such as Ty Morrison’s slightly melancholic delicate yet expansive solos and the endearing on again/off again/on again duet set perfectly to “Is That All There Is?” and performed with both deadpan yearning and sincere love-fire by Jordyn Santiago and Joan Rodriguez.

The other ensemble piece on the program Micaela Taylor’s 2019 “SNAP” also mining aspects of the human condition is an exuberantly eccentric call to action. The task? For individuals to celebrate their uniqueness to as the program states “‘snap out of’ social pressures to conform’ and at the same time to buck the potential isolation of modern life and—channeling E.M. Forster— to connect with others. The dancers morph easily between Taylor’s blend of rubbery-kneed playfulness and funky staccato-accented movements. The perils of social disharmony are briefly enacted—two men end up in a faux fist fight—and just as quickly discarded: the heartfelt message is clear that violence is a waste of our time and spirits.

BODYTRAFFIC is performing this week on the Pillow’s outdoor stage and some of the production elements for “SNAP” felt out of balance in this setting.

I suspect that this piece was expressly designed to rely on the scenic and dramatic effects created by theatrical lighting while the music SHOCKEY’s thickly-scratched and layered score — with delicious bits of James Brown in the mix — was occasionally and uncomfortably screechy on this sound system.

This famously “bucolic” setting — the stage is surrounded by the sublime trees and sky of the Berkshire Hills — serves Brian Brooks’ 2021 hushed “Notes on Fall” set to four sections from Leoš Janáček’s piano cycle “On an Overgrown Path” beautifully. This now-passive now-passionate deceptively-difficult duet (Brooks’ choreography is composed of a tricky combination of loose contact improvisation and smooth weighted-yet-silent descents to the floor) is performed with unwavering focus and full command by Tiare Keeno and Guzmán Rosado. Again though the work is abstract the dancers through their bodies through Brooks’ movement seem to be telling a tale familiar to many humans: whether it’s companionship friendship or love our close relationships are at times work at times works-in-progress but sometimes if we are fortunate they are works of art too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3ZpY29uc29ydGl1bS5jb20vdmktY29tbXVuaXR5X2NlbnRlci92aXJnaW4taXNsYW5kcy1zdGFubGV5LWphY29icy1yZWNlaXZlcy1uYXRpb25hbC1oZXJpdGFnZS1mZWxsb3dzaGlwLWF3YXJkLWZyb20tbmF0aW9uYWwtZW5kb3dtZW50LWZvci10aGUtYXJ0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Jacobs Receives National Heritage Fellowship Award From National Endowment for the Arts,"Delegate to Congress Stacey Plaskett on Wednesday announced the National Heritage Fellowship award for Stanley Jacobs from the National Endowment for the Arts.

Ms. Plaskett said Mr. Jacobs is one of the ten fellows chosen from 180 who will receive a $25000 one-time honorific grant.

""The NEA Fellowship is our nation’s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts that celebrates artistic excellence and supports continuing contributions to our traditional arts heritage"" she said.

“Mr. Jacobs is known to thousands of Virgin Islanders for sharing the artfulness of ""quelbé"" music. Born in Vieques Puerto Rico to Crucian parents Jacobs is a master musician historian and preservationist within this music and dance tradition that is distinct to the Virgin Islands"" she added.

According to the release in 1970 Mr. Jacobs formed the band Stanley Jacobs and The Ten Sleepless Knights (TSK) which would become the island's premiere quelbé band. The group is still a very prominent musical representation of the local traditions of quelbé music and tunes derived from 19th-century European dances such as the quadrille waltz and two-step. Jacobs and TSK perform for numerous functions across the island each year including senior citizen functions and Christmas celebrations. In recognition of the tradition's centrality to the islands' identity the government recently declared it the official music of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

“The NEA National Heritage Fellowship was created in 1982 to highlight the artistic excellence of people like Stanley. To date 458 individuals and groups have received this prestigious honor including BB King Mavis Staples and fellow Virgin Islander Sylvester McIntosh in 1987"" Ms. Plaskett said.

“A master musician historian and preservationist thank you to my cousin Stanley Jacobs for sharing and preserving the beauty quality tradition and artfulness of quelbé music. You and the Ten Sleepless Knights continue to be a prominent musical representation of our beloved quelbé music and the best of the Virgin Islands.”"
JNJ,Johnson & Johnson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtc3BlYWtlci1qb2huc29uLXRydW1wLTdiYmU3MWI3ZmMyYWVmMjZkZTMwMzZhMzU0YWYwZDEz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene Speaker Johnson meet for second day,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Embattled House Speaker Mike Johnson and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3Mvam9obnNvbi1ncmVlbmUtbWVldC1ncmVlbmUtdm93cy1mb3JjZS12b3RlLXdlZWsvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTA5OTU4MzQ40gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvUG9saXRpY3Mvam9obnNvbi1ncmVlbmUtbWVldC1ncmVlbmUtdm93cy1mb3JjZS12b3RlLXdlZWsvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTA5OTU4MzQ4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene says she'll meet with Speaker Mike Johnson again Tuesday amid threat to oust him,"Johnson said he had ""a lengthy constructive meeting"" with Greene and Massie.

Marjorie Taylor Greene says she'll meet with Speaker Mike Johnson again Tuesday amid threat to oust him

House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie met privately on Monday amid Greene's looming threat to try to oust him.

Emerging from a nearly two-hour meeting inside the speaker's office Greene said on camera they will have another meeting with Johnson on Tuesday afternoon.

""I just want to thank you all for waiting -- we just had a very long discussion with the speaker. We are going to be meeting again tomorrow based on the discussion that we've had. And so we really don't have any news to report at this time"" Greene said Monday.

When pressed by ABC's Rachel Scott if Greene still plans to move forward with a motion to vacate the congresswoman said: ""Again we had a very long discussion with Speaker Johnson. We will be meeting with him again tomorrow based on the discussion that we had and then I'll have more information for you.""

Asked again if she plans to force a vote on a motion to vacate Greene said: ""I have been patient. I have been diligent. I have been steady. And I have been focused on the facts. And none of that has changed.""

Greene said the meeting Monday afternoon was about ""ways to move forward for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.""

Johnson said he had ""a lengthy constructive meeting"" with Greene and Massie Monday afternoon.

""We have discussed some ideas and we are going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said.

Johnson said he told Greene and Massie he understands their frustration saying ""I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin.""

""We are going to keep this team together and work for the American people"" Johnson added.

The meeting comes as Greene has said she will force a vote to remove Johnson from the leadership post this week.

The timing of when Greene plans to trigger the motion to vacate however remains unclear. The House held votes later Monday evening and Greene did not act on the motion to vacate.

The Georgia congresswoman said last week she was moving ahead with her ouster effort despite pushback from many Republicans and a statement from Democrats that they would step in to help save Johnson.

""Mike Johnson is not capable of that job"" Greene said in a fiery press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on May 1 alongside her co-sponsor Massie of Kentucky. ""He has proven that over and over again.""

Greene and Massie continued their criticisms of Johnson publicly on social media on Monday.

""This week we vote on whether Mike Johnson should remain as Speaker"" Massie said in a statement on X. ""If you're happy with what he's done this year and if you're looking forward to what he will do the remainder of the year you should join the Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries in supporting Mike Johnson.""

Greene has dangled the motion to vacate the speaker's chair for more than a month. Johnson's defended himself from her criticism -- namely that he's worked with Democrats to keep the government open provide foreign aid and more -- by emphasizing that he's a lifelong Republican but must do his job to serve the entire House with an extremely thin Republican majority.

""This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference wrong for the institution and wrong for the country"" Johnson said last week of the ouster threat.

Johnson also received a boost over the weekend from former President Donald Trump who brought Johnson on stage at the Republican Nation Committee's spring retreat luncheon at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump praised Johnson ""for his leadership and work in the US House"" emphasizing ""the need for party unity collaboration and expanding the GOP's House Majority"" according to Trump's campaign.

Last week Greene denied she was defying Trump in pushing ahead against Johnson.

""I'm the biggest supporter of President Trump and that's why I fight every single day. And that's why I'm fighting here against my own Republican conference to fight harder against the Democrats"" she told ABC News Correspondent Elizabeth Schulze.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) aimed at defusing her efforts to oust him. Why it matters: Democrats have already vowed to protect Johnson from Greene's motion – leading many of them to ask why he's still trying to appease her.

""He has to be careful here"" said one senior House Democrat telling Axios that ""if he looks like he's just simply going to try to capitulate to her that could affect [the way] some Democrats see him.""

House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said Tuesday: ""When Speaker Johnson meets with her for hours the American people should be asking 'what is Marjorie Taylor Greene extracting from the speaker?'""

Driving the news: Greene met with Johnson for several hours this week laying out demands that include no more aid to Ukraine and defunding special counsel probes.

Johnson told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday: ""It's not a negotiation okay this is how I've operated as speaker.""

After their meeting on Tuesday Greene said ""the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" and that she doesn't have a ""specific timeline."" She previously promised to force a vote this week.

What they're saying: ""I don't know what in the world they could be talking about for hours on end and I don't know why he would waste his time there. We have given enough indication we can help him get back to business"" Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.) told Axios.

Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) told Axios: ""You cannot placate her. The minute you try to appease her she's going to have new demands.""

""I worry that the Republicans are focused more on their internal battles and their culture wars than trying to do what's right for the American people as a whole"" said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.).

Zoom in: House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) compared Johnson's talks with Greene to the deal former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) struck with hardliners last January.

Included in the deal was a rule allowing any member to force a vote on removing the speaker which led to McCarthy's ouster and now has empowered Greene to bring Johnson to the table.

Between the lines: Democrats are still broadly committed to saving Johnson said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) but ""three months from now that doesn't necessarily [have to] be the case"" for some of his less committed colleagues.

Another House Democrat told Axios: ""It's fine – sit listen it doesn't cost you anything. But at some point you say: discussion's over shit or get off the pot. This has already consumed way too much attention.""

The other side: Some Democrats see Johnson as just doing what he needs to do.

""What I saw that I liked is he put bills in front of the House to vote on ... if he keeps doing that my only complaints will be policy"" said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.).

""The concessions that I've heard about they're meaningless ... I don't think she's a threat to anyone"" said Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.).

What to watch: One House Republican predicted Johnson won't give Greene any concessions telling Axios he's ""just trying to give her an exit ramp.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9wb2xpdGljcy9qb2huc29uLWdyZWVuZS1vdXN0ZXItdm90ZS1zcGVha2VyL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L3BvbGl0aWNzL2pvaG5zb24tZ3JlZW5lLW91c3Rlci12b3RlLXNwZWFrZXI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson and Greene meet again as speaker faces threat of ouster vote,"Washington CNN —

House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene met again Tuesday as the Georgia congresswoman continues to dangle the threat of an ouster vote against the speaker – but it remains unclear if they will reach a resolution that will hold off the vote.

Following their second meeting Greene would not specify when she may force the vote and wouldn’t commit to moving to oust the speaker this week but she said that Johnson has a “pretty short” window to act on a list of demands. A vote to remove the speaker is certain to fail however since House Democrats have announced they would vote to kill her motion.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” Greene told CNN’s Manu Raju. “We’re interested to see his actions not his words.”

The demands she referenced include Johnson committing to the so-called Hastert Rule which states that a majority of the majority have to support every bill that comes to the floor; defunding special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into former President Donald Trump; no more aid for Ukraine; and a 1% slash to the federal budget if they can’t process 12 separate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.

Greene said that they are waiting for the speaker to reach back out to them with a response. She added that they didn’t give him a deadline to get back to them.

“We didn’t give a specific timeline but it’s pretty short” she said.

Asked if she still plans to force an ouster vote this week – as she previously had said that she would – Greene said “Well we’ll see. It’s up to Mike Johnson.”

Later on Tuesday Johnson would not say if he would meet the asks.

“We are having discussions. That’s all” Johnson told CNN.

Johnson also called the talks “productive” and said he is “optimistic” they can get to a resolution.

“We’re working through a lot of ideas and suggestions as I said as I do with all members of the conference. That’s part of the process here” he told reporters. “And so I’m optimistic that we can get to some resolutions.”

Johnson and Greene met for around two hours on Monday and after that meeting Greene declined to provide details about what was discussed or say if she would still force a vote seeking his ouster this week.

Johnson has defended his leadership against the threat saying that he will not resign and warning that a vote to oust him could cause chaos in the House.

On Tuesday ahead of the meeting Johnson emphasized close his ties to Trump and projected confidence saying he intends “to lead this conference in the future” and that he is “glad to have the support of President Trump.”

Johnson insisted his meetings are not a negotiation and that he seeks input from all his members.

“It’s not a negotiation” he said. “Everybody knows I have lengthy discussions detailed discussions on a daily basis with members across the conference there are 217 of us it takes a lot of time” he told reporters.

Trump and Greene have spoken on the phone about her motion multiple sources with knowledge of the call told CNN.

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky one of the three Republicans publicly pushing for Johnson’s ouster said he and Greene are giving Johnson “one last chance” to agree to several “suggestions” ahead of Tuesday’s meeting.

“I think Marjorie has been very measured and reasonable about this and logical and she and I decided to give Speaker Johnson one last chance to say he’s going to be with the Republicans and not with the Democrats” Massie told CNN. “And there are sort of some litmus tests on that but these are things that matter to the conference.”

Republicans voice concerns over empowering Greene

Many Republicans oppose the push to oust Johnson not wanting to see the conference devolve into bitter infighting like it did after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic and unprecedented vote last year.

Johnson briefly addressed his ongoing conversation with Greene during a news conference but declined to give any specific details.

Some Republican House members voiced concerns Tuesday about empowering Greene any further by giving into any demands.

“I think if you negotiate with two members who want something you are going to lose 30 members of the conference who want something else and I think he knows that” Rep. Kelly Armstrong a North Dakota Republican said. “I would always hesitate to agree to anything when you know the goal posts are going to move within five minutes.”

Rep. Carlos Gimenez a Florida Republican said “I don’t deal with terrorists.”

“I don’t deal with people who are threatening me. Never have Never will” Gimenez said. “If I don’t I don’t think he should either.”

But a narrow majority has given Johnson few options in this moment as the speaker wants to avoid the spectacle on the floor months ahead of the election.

“The speaker is dealing in practical arts here not philosophical ones so I am going to stand by him in his decisions” said Rep. John Duarte a California Republican. “I think it is utterly regrettable that these very small minority of members are putting the speaker in this very difficult spot at a time when we should be focusing on the things that matter to the American people.”

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that the speaker simply has “an open door policy” and meets with anybody who has an issue they want to bring to him.

Scalise didn’t want to get into specifics of what Greene and Massie were asking for. But when asked about potentially vowing not to bring up additional Ukraine aid Scalise said that more aid for Ukraine probably wasn’t coming up soon anyway.

“If you look at the last Ukraine bill it took months for that coalition to come together” he said.

Asked if he had any concerns that agreeing to anything with Greene could empower her Scalise said “All our members are empowered right now. It is a time where everybody knows we either all move in the same direction or we are not going to be able to advance our agenda for that particular week. We’ve got to stay united.”

Meanwhile Johnson has been taking steps to reach out to his right flank. Johnson met with the conservative House Freedom Caucus Monday night according to a source familiar. Greene was booted from the caucus in July 2023.

When you have a litany of hits plenty of established superstar status and thousands of fans clamoring to see you perform there’s not much that you have to do as a performer to get over with the crowd at a festival. 2 Chainz was well aware of that on Friday night at Summerfest delivering plenty of music at the USCellular Connections Stage and letting his fans provide much of the energy.

As one of the higher profile names on Friday night’s lineup the crowd filled the entirety of the Connections Stage area of the grounds pushing into the neighboring Johnson Controls World Sound Stage as well as the main foot traffic of the festival. Even before the night’s headliner took the stage much of the crowd were ready for a party milling through the outside of the bleachers while the touring DJ ran through a short set of songs to bring the energy up around the stage. After about five minutes 2 Chainz emerged to the sound of a bomb drop and wasted no time running through a set that would feel like a summary of his greatest hits.

× Expand Photo Credit: Allen Halas 2 Chainz

In the late stages of his roughly hour-long set 2 Chainz would confess “I got a lot of shit man” to the Summerfest crowd. In fairness he’s not wrong. Just about everything that the Atlanta rapper has put out has racked up millions of streams. Not one song reached its completion on Friday but that was never really the plan. The setlist would feature a pair of Drake-assisted tracks early on with “No Lie” and “All Me” the latter being a song that 2 Chainz has a guest verse on. The bleachers played the role of the Canadian rapper delivering every bar back to the stage on cue. In fact that would be the case for much of the night with 2 Chainz splitting the time with the mic to his mouth and pointed towards the crowd about evenly. When he wanted to though he proved that he could spit verses with the sharpest of deliveries. His microphone was mixed fairly high which made that delivery loud and clear to the crowd. Unfortunately though it also exposed how much time he wasn’t on the microphone.

The brightest spots of Friday night’s set though were when 2 Chainz could lock into performing at his peak. Certain songs could perk up the energy from the rapper including Pretty Girls Like Trap Music cuts “Good Drank” and “4 AM” which sent the crowd into a frenzy. He also tapped into his previous alias Tity Boi of group Playaz Circle for his first hit “Duffle Bag Boy” which was delivered with more heart than much of the set. When speaking to the crowd he was especially light-hearted and proceeded to mention his fondness for Atlanta strip clubs before a group of backup dancers assisted him for “I Luv Dem Strippers.” He would also inform the crowd that at his shows he liked to keep things mellow. “Have some drinks smoke your weed and have a good night” he quipped to the crowd to a roaring response. The show closed on the Kanye West-assisted “Birthday Song” in which 2 Chainz asked the crowd to shine phone flashlights on anyone with a birthday that night. Seemingly all of the crowd was born on Friday and everyone in attendance partied like that was the occasion.

There is some benefit of the doubt to be had. On his Instagram story earlier in the day probably from his home the rapper disclosed that Friday was the 10-year anniversary of his father’s passing. That doesn’t bode well for having to entertain thousands of people later in the night. It also implies that his set was a one-off performance which was corroborated by a lack of any sort of stage design. Friday night featured just a DJ a performer and a lively crowd that was able to carry 2 Chainz over the threshold of a contractually-obligated hour with the patrons at the US Cellular Connections Stage leaving overwhelmingly positively at the end of the night. It may not have been a standout performance but it wasn’t one that left the people dissatisfied either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMixQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZmVzdGl2YWxzL3N1bW1lcmZlc3QvMjAyMi8wNy8wMi9waG90b3MtbWFjaGluZS1ndW4ta2VsbHktYXZyaWwtbGF2aWduZS0yLWNoYWluei1kZWFuLWxld2lzLW1vcmUtc3VtbWVyZmVzdC0yMDIyLWRheS1maXZlLW1pbHdhdWtlZS83NzE2NTU1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos of Machine Gun Kelly Avril Lavigne more Summerfest 2022 Day 5,"SUMMERFEST

Summerfest 2022 wrapped up its second weekend Saturday with some familiar faces and yet another day of surprisingly good weather.

Here's some of the best and worst of what festgoers heard on the grounds Saturday.

Third Eye Blind

Celebrating the 25th anniversary of its self-titled debut album Third Eye Blind started with the visual at the UScellular Connection Stage Saturday night: lots of lights drummer Brad Hargreaves on a very high drum riser and lead singer Stephan Jenkins dressed all in white.

Perhaps trying to be an American variation on David Bowie’s Thin White Duke or a California variation on a K-pop star Jenkins was definitely the center of the quintet’s set and something to stare at when the vaguely alt-rock music couldn’t hold the attention.

And it frequently couldn’t whether the approach was a three-guitar riff-o-rama not reminiscent enough of Drive-By Truckers a basic pop cookie like “Never Let You Go” or the third-rate Foo Fighters overdrive of “Narcolepsy.” Badly pacing the more stimulating songs like “Graduate” within a regularly decelerating performance Third Eye Blind showed its age badly.

Lupe Fiasco

By this point Lupe Fiasco is a Summerfest staple.

The Chicago-born rapper is a tried and true headliner known for his energetic sets and ability to work a crowd — and his Saturday night performance at the Miller Lite Oasis was no exception.

As the show began the hitmaker asked the audience a simple question: “How many old-school Lupe Fiasco fans we got out here tonight?” Hundreds of woos happily answered as he started working the crowd.

Fans were already moving and grooving at the start of the show but “Touch the Sky” really got people going. After all old-school pre-crazy Kanye West is always a crowd-pleaser. Fiasco fanatics continued to turn up to “Superstar” “Daydreamin’ ” and “The Show Goes On.”

Midway through his set Fiasco gave the spotlight (and microphone) to Milwaukee artist and activist Fatima Laster who encouraged local fans to visit 5 Points Art Gallery on Milwaukee's north side.

Fiasco’s 70-minute performance was short but sweet and we already know he’ll be back next year. At this rate he’ll likely headline the Big Gig for as long as he’s making music.

Mt. Joy

An overflowing crowd hopped up on the benches and picnic tables in front of the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard as the members of Mt. Joy emerged from an orange fog and frontman Matt Quinn began strumming out the chords of “Lemon Tree.”

The song soon swelled to a stomping rocker as the five-piece rock band built out a multilayered melody in front of a stage set with glowing orbs. Quinn’s vocals wandered from a delicate line of psychedelia to a growling crescendo. It was quite an energetic and exciting journey.

And that was just the first song.

“How’s everybody doing?” Quinn said mentioning it was their first Big Gig stop. “You’re looking pretty good Summerfest. Let’s have fun.”

With the creative joy-filled set list that followed it would have been hard not to.

The chorus of “Jenny Jenkins” teased a slow turn before a sparse guitar strum gave way to a bouncing swell of music and the bouncing heads in the crowd. “Let Loose” was a building bluesy burn that drove atop Jackie Miclau’s organ runs and Sam Cooper’s soulful impassioned guitar lines before building to a raucous crescendo on the back of Sotiris Eliopoulis’ thundering drums that marked just the beginning of extended jam.

As the large crowd roared and a big grin beamed from Quinn’s face it was clear Mt. Joy’s first Big Gig won’t be its last.

The Commodores

Purveyors of 1970s funk and soul the Commodores went on at the daunting hour of 9:30 p.m. at the Uline Warehouse. Many of Summerfest's baby boomer and Gen-X acts noticeably have been moving to earlier performance times to attract said groups to their shows.

But the Commodores still played to a full Uline audience. The nine-piece band with only three of the group's original members bombarded the exceptionally diverse audience with hit after hit.

By the second song everyone was standing; by the third ""Easy"" nearly everyone was dancing.

Shiny sequined suits and original choreography hit everyone right in their nostalgic hearts. There was an overwhelming amount of crowd participation and general rambling but everyone seemed to love it.

— Damon Joy Special to the Journal Sentinel

KC and the Sunshine Band

It was the atmosphere of a Saturday night party at the BMO Harris Pavilion and KC and the sprawling 14-piece Sunshine Band provided the soundtrack.

Sequined and feather-boa-wrapped dancers twirled across the stage the horn section blasted out a brassy melody and dual percussionists pounded out a funky groove.

“Are you ready to do a little dance? Ready to make a little love? Ready to get down?” Harry Wayne Casey the band’s frontman and namesake asked. The large boisterous crowd answered loudly in the affirmative and shook their booties as the band played 1976’s appropriately titled “(Shake Shake Shake) Shake Your Booty.”

In a spangled vest Casey stood at the center of the stage as master of ceremonies pounding at a keyboard below a sparkling disco ball. The Florida native danced and strutted vigorously as he belted out “Boogie Shoes” and told the crowd he had had a cold all week that couldn’t stop him from making it to Summerfest:

“I’m 71 years old. What the hell happened? Getting down tonight is not so hard but getting back up isn’t so easy.”

It was the first of a litany of yuks that accented a mostly bright and boisterous set only occasionally slowed down for an indulgent ballad like “It Happens Every Night” and “Please Don’t Go” both of which revealed the vocal affects of Casey's current illness. But soon the band was rocking again and the crowd was back dancing in the aisles.

The Village People

It was 45 years ago that two New York record producers asked Broadway actor Victor Willis to record four songs for a project they were starting. That project was The Village People and at the time Willis was the only Village Person when stardom struck and the cheekily costumed group needed to be built to fill a dance card of TV and concert appearances.

Saturday night at the BMO Harris Bank Pavilion Willis — now playing the role of the group’s police officer after regaining the rights to the band’s name through legal disputes — led the newest lineup of that group through a disjointed cavalcade of disco songs that have become pop-culture icons.

Performing in front of a tight five-piece band the five supporting vocalists danced and harmonized behind Willis who paced around the stage singing a cover of “All Night Thing” as the music thumped.

“Macho men say ‘Yeah!’ ” Willis shouted before asking the band if they were ready. Despite a bit of a collective and aloof shrug in response the group lurched writhed and flexed with vigor to the similarly named familiar disco track.

The crowd did scream when the group’s construction worker removed his shirt to reveal rippling abs. But that didn’t last as he quickly put the shirt back on when the song ended. (The breeze is always cooler by the lake after all.)

Willis’ voice was still powerful when he sang but he often seemed like he was going through the motions. The full act was dated in a not-so-nostalgic way.

Like so much of the familiar-sounding music of The Village People’s catalog the show was monotonous. If you saw Willis singing in front of his five costumed compatriots on one song you saw everything they had up their sleeves — or in this case lack of sleeves. After a way-too-extended band introduction segment the crowd was rewarded with a chance to dance along to “In the Navy” and the ubiquitous “Y.M.C.A.” with the group who made it famous.

But honestly at this point it’s more fun at a ballgame.

BoDeans

When BoDeans were introduced at the Johnson Controls World Sound Stage Saturday evening one smart aleck bellowed “There’s only one BoDean!”

He wasn’t entirely wrong: Of the two guys who founded the Waukesha-originated originated rock ’n’ roll outfit in the 1980s only Kurt Neumann was there.

The other guy Sam Llanas departed in 2011; in 2018 Llanas denied assertions by Neumann's stepdaughter that he had repeatedly molested her when she was a child. But Llanas' reedy presence remained a missed shadow amid songs that were the roots-rock equivalents of burgers and fries served by moderately motivated counter jockeys.

Even so the crowd was large enough to make a bystander question the wisdom of putting this band at one of Summerfest's less-spacious side stages. And fan favorites like “Dreams” and “Only Love” hadn’t gone particularly stale or soggy with the passage of decades. Whether they were being played by BoDeans or BoDean and Co. didn’t matter.

Buffalo Nichols

Carl Nichols was too good to restrict his talents to Milwaukee.

The Houston native didn’t even display the full potential of his gifts when he first lived here only showcasing his gravelly soulful voice and cutting lyrics in folk duo Nickel & Rose long after he’d already supplied his guitar services for multiple bands in town.

These days he’s a solo blues artist in Austin Texas — Buffalo Nichols — with an album on Fat Possum Records several tour dates with the Drive-By Truckers and a “Late Show With Stephen Colbert” appearance under his belt.

Saturday afternoon he came home to play Summerfest’s Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard showing that his skills have gotten even sharper since he left.

That self-titled album is striking but rather sparse — some of the recordings were actually demos. Aside from some occasional accompaniment from a jazz-seasoned drummer Saturday Nichols created a sonic feast on his guitar for the grim and gripping “Sick Bed Blues” “Living Hell” and a more haunted rendition of “Another Man” a song incorporating some personal experience about the impact of the tragic generational cycle of violence on Black people first written when he was in Nickel & Rose.

Songs like that one — and a damning criticism of police as he left the stage — demonstrated his unflinching determination to speak truth to power. And as his talent and profile grow so too will his impact.

JPMorgan Chase analysts fear the 'stratospheric' rise which would almost quadruple the current price of a barrel of Brent crude could be fuelled by a retaliation against continued US and European penalties levied against Russia.

Despite efforts from G7 leaders to place a market cap on the price of Russian oil the eastern state could drop daily crude production by five million barrels without excessive damage to their economy financial analysts have concluded.

The impact of such a severe drop in the supply of oil would have a devastating ripple effect for both global markets and consumers.

JPMorgan warned a three million barrel cut to daily supplies would push London's prices of crude to around $190 a barrel with the doomsday scenario of a reduction of five million a day meaning prices surge to $380 a barrel reports Bloomsberg.

'The most obvious and likely risk with a price cap is that Russia might choose not to participate and instead retaliate by reducing exports' the analysts argued.

'It is likely that the government could retaliate by cutting output as a way to inflict pain on the West. The tightness of the global oil market is on Russia's side.'

Motorists can currently expect to pay around 191p per litre according to data from the AA

The International Energy Agency (IEA) stated Russia's crude oil output rose to around 10.55 million barrels a day in May.

Despite western sanctions Vladimir Putin's coffers were given a $20billion boos that month as surging prices saw Russia generate an extra $1.7bn compared to April.

The IEA further warned that global oil supplies could 'struggle to keep pace with demand' in 2023 if sanctions tightened on Russia.

The price of a barrel of crude oil currently sits just shy of $120 a barrel which is almost double the price it was this time last year.

The OPEC oil cartel and allied producing nations decided Thursday to increase production of crude oil but the amount will likely do little to relieve high prices at the pump and energy-fueled inflation plaguing the global economy.

U.S. crude oil prices fell 2.4 percent on the day but are still up 42 percent in 2022.

It comes as the latest numbers show that the average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts reached a new high of 191.4p on Thursday while diesel rose to 199.1p.

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the rise in the price of petrol illustrates 'the biggest retailers' resistance to reduce their pump prices in line with the lower wholesale cost of unleaded'.

He went on: 'Rather than passing on some of the savings they are benefiting from they are clearly banking on the wholesale market moving up again which is disappointing for drivers who are desperate to see an end to ever-rising prices.

'Sadly there no longer seems to be any appetite among the big four supermarkets to drive customers into their stores with lower pump prices.

'We question whether we will ever see much competition between supermarkets over fuel again let alone a so-called 'price war''.

The wholesale price includes product cost and fuel duty. The retail price includes product cost fuel duty delivery and distribution retail margin (forecourt costs and retailer’s profit) and VAT.

Petrol retailers have come in for sharp criticism for a 'classic example of rocket and feather pricing' with pump prices not mirroring wholesale costs.

Despite efforts from G7 leaders to place a market cap on the price of Russian oil the eastern state could drop daily crude production by five million barrels without excessive damage to their economy financial analysts have concluded

Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development from April 2021 until April 2022 shows U.S. inflation has been rising steadily above all other nations

The concept of rocket and feather pricing for fuel involves retailers quickly hiking pump prices when the cost of oil rises but being slow to pass on the benefits of decreases in oil prices.

The RAC claimed significant reductions in wholesale costs for petrol mean companies have a 'clear opportunity' to stop continuously hiking pump prices.

And drivers across Britain have been letting front line workers know about their feelings towards the retailers' unwarranted price hiking.

Jack Cousens head of roads policy at the AA said: 'With Wimbledon well under way drivers may be forgiven for borrowing the iconic rant from John McEnroe as they pull up to the pump - 'You cannot be serious!'.

Asked yesterday if another fuel duty cut could be on the cards a spokesman for Boris Johnson highlighted the 5p cut in March 'which we've repeatedly called on all retailers to pass on to consumers'.

Pressed on the subject he added: 'Well as the Chancellor said before we obviously keep the support we provide to the public under review. And that obviously remains the case.'

The Competition and Markets Authority launched a 'short and focused review' of fuel prices earlier this month after a request by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.

Prices at UK forecourts reached a new high of 191.4p on Thursday while diesel rose to 199.1p the latest 24-hour period figures are available for. Pictured: BP Petrol station at Reading Services this week

A 5p per litre reduction in fuel duty implemented by the Treasury in March has not stopped prices from soaring.

Retailers hit back at accustions of 'rocket and feather pricing' claiming to have been 'unfairly scapegoated' for the price rises and arguing that the 5p saving had been passed on.

Gordon Balmer executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association commented: 'The briefings provided by Government spokespeople to the media indicate that ministers do not understand how fuel prices are set.

'We have contacted the secretary of state for business on multiple occasions offering to meet and explain fuel pricing. However we are yet to receive a response.'

The furore over petrol pricing has prompted fuel thefts at forecourts to surge by up to 61 per cent as drivers struggle to afford spiralling pump prices.

Industry bosses revealed the worrying trend yesterday with about 50000 ‘drive-offs’ and ‘no means to pay’ incidents happening monthly across the UK.

The average value of each fuel theft has surged from £53.28 to £78.19 and Mr Balmer said that it could cost the industry £25 million a year.

He said ‘drive-offs’ – where a motorist fills up and makes no attempt to pay – and people being unable to pay had collectively surged 61 per cent this year compared with the same period last year. He said: ‘In terms of fuel thefts it’s going through the roof.

‘We also then have “no means to pay” incidents when somebody fills up and then they say they have left their wallet or purse at home and can’t pay. That comes in at about another £16 million.

He said police refuse to deal with the incidents valued at less than £100.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJhbmtlci5jb20vVG9wLTEwMDAtV29ybGQtQmFua3MtMjAyMi0xNjU2ODg5NjE10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 1000 World Banks 2022,"If banks along with everyone else were hoping the disruption wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic would give way in 2022 to a steady global economic reopening and recovery the events of recent months have decisively put paid to that notion.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has amplified supply chain challenges and commodity squeezes. Beyond the broader economic impact it will create particular challenges in the months and years ahead for banks active in and with exposure to Russia and Ukraine as they grapple with operational challenges and the beefed-up sanctions regime.

But even before the war began in February there were already rumblings of global inflationary pressures and incoming economic turbulence. And with central banks including the US Federal Reserve European Central Bank and the Bank of England now engaged in a clear programme of interest rate increases while beginning to wind down stimulus it is evident we are entering a new economic phase.

For banks this is not necessarily bad news; indeed profitability in the era of low interest rates has been a major challenge. The data for 2021 (the full-financial year data the 2022 Top 1000 World Banks ranking is based on) points to a significant recovery in profitability compared to last year when banks collectively booked hundreds of billions of dollars in impairment charges expecting significant loan losses due to Covid-19 disruption.

Top 1000 aggregates

2022 ($bn) 2021 ($bn) Change from previous year (% bps) Aggregate Tier 1 10383 9913 4.74 Aggregate Total Assets 154211 148583 3.79 Aggregate Pre-Tax Profits 1439 936 53.73 Profits/Tier 1 (%) 11.09 7.57 352.07 Return on Assets (%) 0.75 0.51 23.67

Bounceback

Aggregate return on assets in the Top 1000 now stands at 0.75% compared to 0.51% last year broadly in line with where it was in 2020’s Top 1000 results (based on full-year data from 2019). Profits as a percentage of Tier 1 capital has also jumped from 7.57% last year to 11.09% this year higher than the figure for 2020. In dollar-and-cents terms aggregate pre-tax profits reached $1.44tn — the highest figure ever recorded in the Top 1000. This shows a 53.7% year-on-year increase and a 24.1% increase on 2020.

However as our analysis shows it is unclear to what extent profitability has improved in a meaningful sense. The impact of Covid-19 economic disruption on banks’ loan books has been less severe than expected in large part due to major central bank and fiscal stimulus packages. As a result banks have benefitted from lower-than-expected impairment charges which has boosted their profits. But it remains to be seen what shape banks are truly in following the pandemic and what kind of springboard that will offer in responding to current market conditions as stimulus packages are unwound.

Tier 1 capital grows

Looking beyond profits and profitability the overall resilience of the global financial system continues to look secure with aggregate Tier 1 capital continuing its upwards march. The minimum Tier 1 capital of a bank within the Top 1000 now stands at $556m up from $547m last year. Aggregate Tier 1 capital topped $10tn for the first time hitting $10.38tn — a 4.7% increase compared to last year. Aggregate Tier 1 assets also hit their highest-ever level growing 3.8% year-on-year to hit $154.21tn. However the growth rate of both Tier 1 capital and assets has slowed significantly compared to last year. Between 2020 and 2021 aggregate Tier 1 capital rose by 12.7% and assets by 16.0%.

There are some significant regional disparities. While Tier 1 capital grew by 9.1% for Asia-Pacific to hit $5.19tn (the first time it has topped $5tn for any one region) in western Europe it decreased by 3.6% to $2.37tn. In North America Tier 1 capital increased by 6.2% to hit $1.95tn. In Africa the Middle East and South America Tier 1 capital grew by 9.3% 11.1% and 7.6% respectively.

Increases for Asia-Pacific continue to be driven by China which accounts for $3.38tn of the region’s Tier 1 capital with aggregate Tier 1 capital for the country’s banks growing by 14.4% year-on-year. This is in stark contrast to Japan which saw its Tier 1 capital decrease by 10.3% to $642.6bn — its lowest value since 2017. Japan’s figures however have been skewed by the yen’s slumping exchange rate against the US dollar. All data in the Top 1000 is converted into US dollar values (if not already provided in that currency) to enable aggregation and international comparison.

In western Europe just seven of the 22 countries saw their aggregate Tier 1 capital increase year-on-year and this only includes two major banking economies — Switzerland and the UK which had increases of 3.4% and just 0.9% respectively. France which has the highest aggregate Tier 1 capital of any western European country in the Top 1000 saw an annual decrease of 4.6%; Spain saw a decrease of 0.9% and Germany a decrease of 4.1%. Turkey and Greece both saw particularly substantial decreases in percentage terms of 30.0% and 26.2% respectively. In Turkey’s case it was negatively impacted by the currency devaluation.

Chinese dominance continues

Chinese banks have continued to consolidate their increasingly dominant position within the Top 1000. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has now made it a full decade at the top of the Top 1000 rankings. Its Tier 1 capital has continued to swell growing by $68.9bn since last year to hit a massive $508.85bn — a 15.7% increase and the first time an individual bank in the Top 1000 has held more than $500bn in Tier 1 capital on its balance sheet. It has more than twice the Tier 1 capital of JPMorgan the highest non-Chinese bank in the rankings in fifth position. It also holds a mammoth $5.52tn in assets on its balance sheet.

Four other Chinese banks join ICBC in the top 10 with China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China each maintaining their second third and fourth positions respectively in the ranking. Bank of Communications has also moved from 11th to 10th position. This marks the first time that Chinese banks have made up half of the top 10.

China also now makes up half of the top 20 — increasing its share from nine of the 20 in 2021 — with China Citic Bank entering the top 20 for the first time. Its 18.0% increase in Tier 1 capital saw it leapfrog from 24th to 19th position.

At an aggregate level Chinese banks are also increasingly dominant — accounting for a third of Tier 1 capital across the whole Top 1000. This is a slight increase from last year when they accounted for 30%. Within Asia-Pacific Chinese banks account for 65% of aggregate Tier 1 capital up from 62% last year. Japan the next nearest this year accounts for just 12% — down from 15% last year.

China’s aggregate pre-tax profits increased by 15% year-on-year to reach $400bn. Its relative share of global net income has fallen from 37% last year to 27%; although similar to last year it continues to account for two-thirds of Asia-Pacific pre-tax profits.

Compared to last year Asia-Pacific overall also accounts for a smaller total of global profits. In 2021 its share of total global net income was 55.1% compared to 43.0% this year. North America and western Europe have picked up that slack. North American banks represented 28.5% of net income this year compared to 23.9% last year and for western Europe its share has increased from 10.3% to 17.3%.

Although China has by far the most dominant position by size of banks the number of Chinese banks in this year’s Top 1000 has decreased by four to 140. But China remains second only to the US in total banks in the Top 1000 which has 186 — an increase of eight from last year.

European changes

It is a year of significant change for Europe for this year’s rankings. In western Europe merger and acquisition (M&A) activity was the main driver behind a reduction of seven banks in this year’s Top 1000.

The central and eastern Europe (CEE) region has 13 fewer banks than last year. We have been unable to gather data from the two Ukrainian banks — PrivatBank and State Savings Bank of Ukraine — which were part of the ranking last year. There are also fewer Russian banks in our ranking this year just six banks compared to 21 in 2021 as we have not been able access the necessary data.

US holds steady

There has been little change for the US’s biggest three universal banks — JPMorgan Chase Bank of America (BofA) and Citi — with them retaining their fifth sixth and seventh positions in the Top 1000 ranking respectively. Their Tier 1 capital levels have generally remained relatively stable although JPMorgan’s has increased by 4.8% compared to last year to hit $246.16bn while BofA’s Tier 1 capital decreased by 1.8%.

The most significant US mover and shaker in the top 20 is Goldman Sachs which saw its Tier 1 Capital increase by 15.1% to hit $106.77bn — the first time it has surpassed $100bn.

In recent years Goldman has been expanding outside of its traditional investment banking focus. Its Marcus digital banking platform for retail customers has now grown to a customer base of more than 10 million with more than $110bn in deposits since its 2016 launch in the US and 2018 launch in the UK. The bank plans to push this expansion much further with the launch of a digital chequing account by the end of this year. It is also pushing ahead with further expansion of its transaction banking services which it launched in the US in 2020 and in the UK in 2021. It already has more than $50bn in deposits in this division and is targeting $100bn by 2024.

Goldman Sachs also succeeded in increasing its pre-tax profits by 116.2% building on a relatively strong performance last year where it was one of the few large US banks to achieve growth in pre-tax profits compared to 2020 (16.1%).

Overall it was a good year for pre-tax profits across the US banks with aggregate pre-tax profits increasing by 97.7% compared to last year. Just nine of the 186 US banks in the Top 1000 had smaller profits compared to last year.

Wells Fargo the US’s fourth-biggest bank in particular saw its pre-tax profits jump from just $581m last year to $28.82bn this year — a 4860% increase. It was able to benefit from a $4.1bn reduction in its provision for credit losses compared to last year when it recorded a $13.4bn provision for credit losses.

The bank also benefited from gains in areas such as in its affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and sales of its student lending asset management and corporate trust businesses. It remains subject to the $1.95tn asset cap imposed on it by the federal reserve in 2018 (with some limited exemptions for Covid-19-related lending). Although CEO Charlie Scharf has commented that the bank is “making significant progress” in addressing regulatory concerns he says “there is still work to do” which will take time.

JPMorgan Citi and BofA recorded pre-tax profit increases of 68.4% 78.9% and 96.2% respectively.

Top 20 shake-up

HSBC is once again the only European bank in the top 10; it has reversed its one position gain of last year returning to ninth position with its Tier 1 capital decreasing by 2.4%. It was able to boost its pre-tax profits by 115.4%; this was largely driven by a reversal in impairment charges. The bank is likely to see further adjustments in its assets and capital as it continues to progress its plans to withdraw from the US mass-market retail banking.

In February this year HSBC completed sales of 80 branches to Citizens Bank and 10 branches to Cathay Bank along with associated deposits and loans; these sales will be reflected in its 2022 annual report. In March it also announced it had entered into a deal to sell its Greek retail operations covering 15 branches to local bank Pancreta although this deal is not expected to be completed until the first half of 2023.

However the changes are part of its wider strategy to pivot towards Asia and the Middle East and it is likely to make new investments in that region. For instance HSBC Insurance subsidiaries in Asia-Pacific are currently pursuing plans to take full ownership of HSBC Life China (from the current 50%) and to increase ownership in Indian life insurer Canara HSBC Oriental Bank of Commerce Life Insurance Company from 26% to 49%.

Turning to the other banks in the top 20 France’s two largest banks Crédit Agricole and BNP Paribas have also slipped down the rankings from 12th and 13th last year to 14th and 15th positions this year with their Tier 1 capital falling by 3.6% and 6.6% respectively and assets by 3.6% and 2.6%. It is important to note the euro has fallen in value against the US dollar so if considered in local currency there is not the same fall. Each increased their pre-tax profits by 55.5% and 27.8%.

Japan now has just one bank remaining in the top 20 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group which shifted from 10th to 12th position its Tier 1 capital dropping by 12.4%. However its pre-tax profits grew by 29.3%. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group with its Tier 1 capital falling 9.7% has dropped from 16th to 21st position. The Tier 1 values have been negatively impacted by the falling value of the yen.

Profits recovery

This was a year when several banks had an impressive turnaround in fortunes with their pre-tax profits. Santander which last year recorded its first loss in its 160-year history of $2.56bn has recorded pre-tax profits of $16.5bn this year.

In 2020 the bank made a non-cash adjustment to the valuation of goodwill and deferred tax assets on its balance sheet which had a significant negative impact. Much of this adjustment applied across its subsidiaries Santander UK Santander Bank Polska and Santander Consumer Nordics and US businesses Santander Bank National Association and Santander Consumer USA. It attributes its improved performance to growth in loans and deposits and an improvement in credit quality.

NatWest which last year made a pre-tax loss of $468m recorded pre-tax profits of $5.82bn. This was in part down to an impairment release of $1.7bn but the UK lender also attributes the results to growing its lending cost reductions and digital transformation.

UniCredit has also moved from a $3bn loss to pre-tax profits of $1.41bn. The bank which gained its new CEO Andrea Orcel in April 2021 is currently engaging in a major strategic plan UniCredit Unlocked to deliver growth and long-term profitability. However the bank faces some risk given its exposure to Russian markets.

Germany’s Commerzbank which last year made the second-largest loss in the Top 1000 at $3.2bn has also moved back into the black albeit with modest pre-tax profits of $119m. Last year was the first year of its major restructuring programme which included planned staffing cuts of 10000 people as well as the closure of 340 of its 790 branches. It has benefitted from a significant year-on-year reduction in impairment charges.

This year the biggest loss in the Top 1000 was Greece’s Alpha Bank which made a pre-tax loss of $3.37bn closely followed by Piraeus Bank also of Greece which made a loss of $3.07bn. Both banks have been undergoing restructuring within their balance sheets to improve asset quality.

Impairment charge falls

Global pre-tax profits at an aggregate level reached $1.44tn a 53.7% increase compared to last year. This is in stark contrast to previous year when pre-tax profits fell by 19.2% year on year. At a regional level South America saw the biggest annual increase in profits at 128.8% followed by western Europe at 102.8% and North America at 90.2%. Spain was the country with the biggest annual increase in pre-tax profits at 621% followed by Poland at 464%.

In many cases this reversal in fortunes for pre-tax profits reflects the opposite trend for provisions and impairment charges. Impairment charges are costs that recognise the diminishing value of assets (for instance loans where there is a reasonable expectation of it not being paid back) and are included on bank-income statements — as such increased impairment charges have a direct impact on profits. Last year aggregate global impairment charges ballooned from $472bn to $754bn. This year they have fallen back down to $411bn.

North America saw the biggest regional fall in impairment charges with an annual decrease of 124.2% followed by western Europe at 63.9% and CEE with a decrease of 56.1%. At an individual country level some of the biggest reductions were seen in the US with a 129.0% fall in impairment charges the UK with a 114.6% drop and Australia with a 102.5% fall.

Interestingly China’s impairment charges only fell by 1.5% year-on-year but unlike many other countries its banks did not see significant increases in the year prior. Last year impairment charges at Chinese banks had increased by 22% compared that to its next nearest peer by size of banks the US which last year had a 157% increase.

A similar trend is visible when comparing China’s pre-tax profits to the US’s. China’s banks had by far the largest aggregate pre-tax profits of any country at more than $400bn this year. Yet this was just a 15% year-on-year increase. This compares to the US which had pre-tax profits of $342.73bn this year an increase of 97.7% compared to last year.

At first glance it may appear the US banks are more profitable based on these figures; however the significant increase in US pre-tax profits is largely attributable to the annual fall in impairment charges following a one-off major increase whereas China’s pre-tax profit growth has been more stable in recent years.

Post-crisis performance

Indeed China’s bank did not suffer a drop in pre-tax profits between 2008 and 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Looking across the period since then as an overall trend its aggregate pre-tax profits have gradually climbed.

For western European banks even 13 years later their pre-tax profits have never recovered to 2008 levels. In 2008 western European pre-tax profits stood at $355bn and they fell the following year by $390bn to a loss of $35bn. Since then they have been up and down and this year’s figure of $258.75bn is the highest level they have reached since 2008.

North American banks experienced an even bigger loss in 2009 with pre-tax profits falling by $216bn from $140bn in 2008 to a loss of $76bn. Unlike western Europe however aggregate pre-tax profits at North American banks had been consistently increasing until last year. They recovered to 2008 levels in 2011 overtook western European profits in 2012 and this year stand at $408.27bn. For Asia-Pacific it is clear the extent to which China has come to dominate the region’s banking industry in the post-crisis period. In 2008 China’s aggregate pre-tax profits were $77bn compared to $121bn for Asia-Pacific excluding China. As of this year China’s pre-tax profits stand at $400bn compared to the rest of the region at $206bn.

Lending activity

In order to benefit from rising interest rates banks will need to boost their lending particularly to customers they can be confident will not default during potentially challenging economic circumstances. This year’s Top 1000 figures (although not reflective of current market activity) suggest that banks in most regions have remained relatively cautious. For instance although gross total loans in Africa increased by 10.2% year-on-year their gross total deposits increased by 11.0%. Similarly gross total loans in the Middle East increased by 10.2% but total deposits also grew by 10.6%.

In North America deposit growth has far outstripped loan growth with gross total loans increasing by 7.4% and total deposits increasing by 11.8% year on year. In western Europe this trend is even more pronounced with gross total loans decreasing year-on-year by 3.0% and gross total deposits increasing by 0.4%. However the overall health of western European banking loan books appears to have improved. Aggregate allowances fell by 19.8% year-on-year and allowances as a percentage of the total loan book fell by 30.25 basis points (bps). In North America the decrease was even greater with aggregate allowances falling by 27% and allowances as a percentage of the total loan book falling by 62bps.

Big M&A deals

Although only 12 M&A transactions were completed within the Top 1000 during the 2021 financial year there were some major deals. The largest by far was the merger between Samba Financial Group and National Commercial Bank to create Saudi National Bank. The combined bank is now the largest banking entity in the Middle East with Tier 1 capital of $32.62bn. It is in 67th position in the rankings leapfrogging Qatar National Bank (77th this year) which was previously the region’s largest bank.

The next largest deal was Spain’s CaixaBank’s acquisition of Bankia which was completed in March 2021 having first been announced in September 2020. CaixaBank says the combined bank now has almost 20 million customers in Spain making it the largest retail bank in the domestic market by share of customers (Santander is Spain’s largest bank by Tier 1 capital and assets). The combined entity is Spain’s third-largest bank by Tier 1 capital and second-largest by assets at $772.77bn. Western Europe was the most active region for M&A accounting for five of the 12 deals taking place in 2021.

For comparability and consistency we convert all the data used in the Top 1000 into US dollar values. However year-on-year depreciation in the value of some currencies can have the effect of suppressing the position of some banks within the ranking. For transparency the table ‘The Foreign Exchange Effect’ lists the 50 banks within the Top 1000 that would move up rankings the most if the effects of the depreciation were recalibrated. Typically smaller banks are affected the most. This year the largest bank affected is TC Ziraat Bankasi which could have been in 111th position in the rankings rather than 177th without the effects of currency depreciation.

In response to the Supreme Court’s ruling to do away with the legal abomination that was

Roe v. Wade many misguided corporations have jumped at the virtue-signaling opportunity of a lifetime and announced that they are willing to pay thousands of dollars for employees to travel to a state where abortion is still legal in order to end the life of their pre-born child.

Pro-life investors have flooded our inbox in the few days since the SCOTUS decision asking how they can find out if they own stocks in these “abortion travel” companies through their mutual funds 401k or other investment accounts and if so how they can push back.

Step 2: Send a message through shareholder activism

Once you find out what companies in your investment portfolio are supporting abortion by paying for employees to travel for an abortion procedure among other pro-abortion policies and donations you should send a message (literally and figuratively) to those companies. An easy way to do this is to find the investor relations email or phone number on the corporate website and make contact. Here are some bullet points for you to consider in your message to these abortion-supporting businesses:

Abortion ends the life of a pre-born child and you are deeply opposed to your shareholder dollars being used to pay for such a procedure.

Abortion travel reimbursements are rife with tax and legal liabilities and as a shareholder you are concerned that the company is not acting responsibly with shareholders’ best interests in mind.

Abortion travel policies present a significant financial liability that may materially erode your returns as a shareholder.

Abortion travel policies open the door for costly abuse and fraud as companies likely will not be able to receive proof that employees actually used the money to have an abortion rather than just a free trip to sunny California on your shareholder dime.

Inform the company that if they refuse to stop payments for abortion travel you will be divesting of your shares – or – if you own individual shares (rather than a mutual fund) and it is possible with that particular company that you will be supporting a shareholder resolution to end that policy.

Step 3: Divest from or engage with abortion-supporting companies

If you own abortion-supporting companies through a mutual fund or ETF you do not have many options other than selling that fund and buying a different one that does not invest in abortion stocks so you need to research your options. You can find out about your pro-life investment options at inspireinvesting.com and if you want professional guidance from pro-life financial advisors specially trained and resourced to invest to support life you can connect with our team there.

If you own individual stocks rather than funds you also have the ability to file or join a shareholder resolution to oppose corporate abortion funding. This is a more complicated process but if there is a resolution being filed by our team at Inspire Investing or our pro-life allies it is exceedingly simple to support the effort with your shareholder proxy vote. To find out if there is a resolution in the works with the problem companies in your portfolio email us at inspire@inspireinvesting.com and also be sure to sign up for our newsletter at inspireinvesting.com to be informed of new resolutions and action plans you can participate in.

Pro-life investors making an impact

As Kellogg’s prepares to split its business in three could the glory days of the multi-category consumer mega-corps be behind them?

The cereals and snacks giant is spinning out its problematic North American cereals division and its nascent plant-based division to focus on its higher-growth global snacking arm. The plan marks a shift of strategy from its fellow consumer food and drink giants which have typically prioritised growth by selling off lower-growth or non-core divisions. Kellogg’s will create three distinct publicly listed companies by the end of 2023: Global Snacking Co containing 80% of its current business including its international cereals portfolio; North American Cereal Co; and Plant Co the latter anchored by its US MorningStar Farms brand. The rationale is similar to that behind Unilever’s sale of its spreads division and Nestlé’s sale of its US ice cream and waters business – to shift away from non-core lower-growth assets and invest in categories of higher growth. For Kellogg’s this means its snack brands such as Pringles Pop-Tarts Cheez-It Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats. Its traditional cereals have suffered from the structural decline in traditional breakfasts as consumer habits shift while the division has also suffered in recent times from strikes supply chain disruptions and mounting commodity price pressures. Kellogg’s CEO Steve Cahillane who will lead the main snacking business said the split means the cereal division “will not have to compete for resources against a high-growth snacking business”. Meanwhile the much smaller Plant Co division will be an innovation-driven pure-play plant-based player. With sales of $340m the North America-focused business remains in growth phase but crucially – unlike other listed players in the space such as Beyond Meat – it generates a profit. Notable consumer spin-offs Consumer health: Last year pharma giants GSK and Johnson & Johnson both pledged to spin off their consumer health arms to become separate standalone companies. GSK rebuffed a £50bn raid from Unilever to plough ahead with its plan to split out ‘Haleon’ and IPO it in July. Johnson & Johnson is hoping its offshoot will list by November 2023.

Kraft/Mondelez: Pre-Heinz merger Kraft Foods span off confectionery arm Mondelez including the Cadbury brand in 2012. The split followed Kraft’s controversial takeover of Cadbury in 2010. Separately Mondelez has thrived now boasting annual revenues of $26bn. Kraft’s more troubled path saw revenues shrink before its mega-merger with Heinz.

Cadbury Schweppes: Under the urging of activist investor Nelson Peltz the chocolate and drinks arms split in 2007. While the split was welcomed strategically it left Cadbury vulnerable to the Kraft takeover. Schweppes – which became Dr Pepper Snapple Group – was acquired in 2018 by Keurig Green Mountain to become Keurig Dr Pepper. Cahillane said the independent companies would be “better positioned to focus on their distinct strategic priorities”. In reality this is Kellogg’s grasping the nettle of the key issue many other consumer giants face: looking after the bottom line while prioritising growth. GlobalData’s Nidhi Chauhan suggests prevailing chaotic market conditions have intensified the need to address underperforming divisions. “With the snacks business growing at a faster rate than the cereal and plant-based product divisions these smaller companies may be able to move quicker and smarter than the heavy Kellogg brand” he says. While global giants have historically benefited from scale this restructure is driven by the belief that category focus outweighs back office synergies. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson notes: “Whilst there may be security in size and savings to be made by sharing back room operations strategically there’s a gulf between family favourites and pushing plant-based boundaries.”

Best of both worlds

A break-up rather than sell-off theoretically enables the company to benefit from the best of both worlds – reliable cash generation from its mature categories and the benefit of structural growth opportunities in more on-trend areas.

This isn’t a new approach just one rarely seen in food and drink in recent years which has focused on portfolio management through M&A and tended to retain relatively diverse product categories.

Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard notes the move could be seen as an “admission that turning around the US cereal business is proving tough” but it is also reminiscent of the Mondelez split from Kraft a decade ago.

Howard suggests shedding the problematic cereals business – as well as shedding debt on to it – could propel Kellogg’s to trade more in line with other snacking companies like Mondelez’s EBITDA multiples of 14-15 times compared with its current level of around 12 times.

How investors and customers will take to the split-off cereal business is less clear. But clean splits may become increasingly attractive to consumer giants.

The past decade has seen little such activity but in recent months GSK turned down Unilever’s mega-billions approach for its consumer health arm to instead spin it out via a London IPO next month. Johnson & Johnson announced a similar consumer split in November 2021. Bernstein’s Howard suggests Campbell Soup Co or Conagra Brands may also follow suit.

Of course it could still be that Kellogg’s announcement is precursor to a more traditional divestment.

OC&C managing partner Will Hayllar comments: “The debt markets are not as open for big ticket debt at the moment and therefore they may feel like public market rather than selling to a buyout group provides the cleaner path forward.

“I suspect this gives them certainty where they can lay out the future strategy of these divisions as separate companies and if someone wants to come in and make an offer they are still able to do so.”

In particular the plant-based division would seem to offer opportunities for an investor to scale up off-market. Notably Kellogg’s even floated that a sell-off of the division remained a possibility.

Even the cereals business could attract buyer attention now Kellogg’s has announced its intention to demerge it with its reliable cash generation and potential for margin-focused restructure appealing to buyout firms in particular.

Shareholders were broadly supportive last week with shares up around 6% and remaining up a week later.

It provides more evidence that the City has grown impatient with slow-growth mature businesses. The post-Covid period has already seen General Mills and Danone diversify their portfolios while Unilever is under pressure to move much faster with Nelson Peltz set to take his board seat in a few weeks.

Kellogg’s bold move is certainly unlikely to be the last consumer spin-out as unprecedented economic pressure puts more business models under the microscope.",,,,,,,,,,,,

GLC acquired the existing 12-unit industrial building just south of its main project meeting in hopes of using the site for “overflow truck trailer parking” not originally included at the main site. They demolished the building a few days before the Planning Commission vote. Most of the former tenants moved out of Fullerton to be able to afford current rental rates.

The parking overflow site was approved once before as a Minor Site Plan by the City’s former Community and Economic Development director Greg Pfost acting as the city’s Zoning Administrator (ZA). Community activist Jane Reifer filed an appeal claiming that the project should have gone before the City’s full Planning Commission. City staff concurred voided the ZA decision and brought the item directly before the Planning Commission. At the Planning Commission Reifer stated that accompanying Environmental Impact Report (EIR) Addendum didn’t properly analyze or mitigate many environmental issues including the fact that there are two elementary schools within ¼ mile of the truck route serving the site potentially exposing students to hazardous emissions. In addition no offsite truck trip numbers were analyzed even though California environmental law requires full public disclosure of a project’s anticipated truck trips. The Commission approved the expansion eliminating one of the 4 driveways and adding a small air quality mitigation to post signage referring to the existing state law that prohibits truck engine idling for more than five minutes. Reifer has appealed this decision to the City Council asking for:

Better Analysis: 1) Show combined impacts not the new project’s impacts in comparison with those of the much larger original project. 2) Analyze off site mobile travel emissions including truck trips. The stated operational emissions are in error and refer to paving emissions with no analysis of cumulative impacts; 3) There is no documentation for construction emissions for the proposed project only for the original project and only for paving (excluding demolition grading and worker travel trips); 4) The Addendum only mentions Building 4 but there’s a clear driveway to Building 3.

Better Mitigations / Conditions of Approval: 1) Prohibiting any use of the facility from off-site warehouses 2) Provide electric hookups rather than just signage so that heavily-polluting refrigerated trucks (TRUs) that can’t turn their motors off without spoilage to their cargo can actually comply (included in new 2022 air quality guidelines) 3) Provide “sensitive receptors” with air monitors and air filtration devices; 4) Provide mitigation for the removal of the mid-block Orangethorpe bus stop; 5) Restrict the parking area from becoming a driveway to the warehouses 6) Condition the use based only on using Building 4 (deny the driveway to Building 3); 7) Require designation of an air quality compliance officer.

Miscellaneous Issues: 1) The demolition prior to approval of the project poses some unique issues regarding mitigations particularly for: construction solid waste recycling paleontology Migratory Bird Treaty Act; 2) Removal of seeming pre-approvals “This Addendum covers all federal State local government and quasi-government approvals which may be needed to construct or implement the proposed Project whether or not they are explicitly listed……in this Addendum” and a dangling word that just says “Approval” followed by blank spaces which is open to any interpretation; 3) The 34 new truck spaces are active truck parking and weren’t contemplated or analyzed properly in the original EIR. This is not a small amount; they represent significant impact because of the correlated new truck trips which could be substantially over 100 per day. It’s not a surface parking area to store truck trailers. It’s added parking and active staging and parking overflow and may even require a CUP. 3) Although the document used for this project was an EIR Addendum the paperwork was filed with the state as a Mitigated Negative Declaration a much lower level of analysis.

The Fullerton City Council will meet Tuesday July 5 at 5:30pm. The Appeal is item 11 which is the 1st regular item of business.

More Warehouses Coming

“The City is not prepared for the new onslaught of warehouses” Reifer said “Within a month of GLC approval Rexford Industrial was granted a project directly across the street from hundreds of low-income multi-family homes and in less than a week Rexford announced a new warehouse project tearing down the Fullerton Hotel on Raymond Ave. With several Inland Empire cities declaring moratoriums on new warehouses even more companies are coming to Fullerton. We should be prepared to ask them to reduce the impacts they cause.” The local area had a high pollution burden even prior to any of the new warehouses.

Interment will be in St. Peter Catholic Cemetery in Carencro. The Rev. Kenneth Domingue pastor of St. John Berchmans Catholic Church will officiate at the services.

Ed Blanchard who is better known as Nootsie in the Houma area grew up there playing baseball and working alongside with his siblings in their father’s electrical contract business. Once old enough he entered barber school and after a short stint cutting hair and a few ears he decided to get into the oilfield business eventually hiring on as an offshore operator with Amoco Corporation which later was bought by BP Oil Co. Eventually he would get moved into the measurement department and later into the pipeline department making it all the way to Superintendent of Pipeline Operations.

Ed and his wife Rachel moved around quite a bit as a result of work. So he left BP settling down in the Sunset LA area and taking on supervisory jobs requiring less time away from home. Ed was not afraid to tackle any tasks big or small. Some of the projects he supervised was a Kinder Morgan Drumming Facility in Geismar La. a compressor station installation in Pennsylvania while with Danos LLC and for O’Brien Oil Pollution Services a spill on the Kalamazoo River where he was in charge of approximately 1000 workers.

But these are not the things for which Ed will be remembered. If and when available which seemed like always if there was something a friend or family member was working on such as replacing a bathroom fixing a leaking line in the wall replacing light fixtures in the storage shed painting the garage……you name it Ed was there. And he would literally get hurt if you had a project and didn’t call him to help!

Ed wasn’t all work as attested by the show he’d put on every year for the Houma Mardi Gras. If it wasn’t setting up a big tent it was arranging a flatbed trailer on the parade route complete with food food and food. Family and friends and anyone looking to have a good time were invited or could just drop in. My God he knew how to throw a party!!

Ed would return to Houma often to participate in benefit functions and/or to be with his children and grandchildren who he loved and missed very much. It seemed you could take Ed out of Houma but you could never take Houma out of Nootsie. It can best be said that Ed Blanchard was all about family and friends…...he’d do anything for you. With him Ed takes the hearts and admiration of all he’s been so much a part of………he will be missed dearly!!!

The family would like to thank all of the wonderful staff at Fresenius Dialysis Center in Sunset who according to Ed took such wonderful care of him three times a week these past several years. And they would like to also thank the doctors and staff at Opelousas General Hospital for their professionalism and compassion in not only assisting Ed in his final moments but also for helping those of us at the hospital make it through this very difficult time.

Survivors include his wife Rachel Leblanc Blanchard of Sunset; one son Cody Blanchard; one daughter Kristi B. Duplantis and her husband Scott of Raceland; five grandchildren Luke Westmoreland Easton Plaisance John Duplantis Cohen Blanchard and Charli Blanchard; four brothers Kirby Blanchard Sr. and his wife Lori of Chauvin Terry Blanchard and his wife Mona of Chauvin; Perry Blanchard and his wife Dawn of Houma and Jody Blanchard and his wife Lizzie of Bourg; two sisters Tina Leblanc and her husband Dwayne of Chauvin and Angie Foret and her husband Mark of Bourg; and numerous nieces and nephews and cousins.

He was preceded in death by his parents Edmond Joseph Blanchard Jr. and the former Doicy Cavalier.

A rosary will be prayed at 6:30 p.m. Friday in the funeral home.

The family requests that visiting hours be observed from 3:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. Friday and will continue from 8:00 a.m. until service time on Saturday.

The family requests that donations be made in Nootsie’s honor to the American Kidney Foundation.

Pallbearers will be Kirby Blanchard Terry Blanchard Perry Blanchard Jody Blanchard Cody Blanchard and Luke Westmoreland. Honorary pallbearers will be his nephews Kyle Blanchard Brax Guidry and Gavin Royer.

He was six at the time and had an exciting career as an Army officer ahead of him but that moment of connection with those magnificent beasts has stayed with him.

Morgan-Greenville has had an affinity for cows since he was young

Now after many years travelling the world in the service of his country the ex-Royal Green Jackets captain has reinvented himself as a passionate environmentalist and author. And his latest book Taking Stock pays homage to an animal we all take for granted even though it plays a significant part in our everyday lives. Roger sets out a new template for dairy farming that is more sustainable greener and puts the cow in charge. It came about after the author at the age of 61 and with no farming experience signed on as a labourer on a beef cattle farm to tell the bovine side of the story. He deliberately sought out smaller farms which are leading a slow revolution where animal welfare and biodiversity promotion are a priority. The result is a lyrical and evocative book. “Whether we know it or not the cow is almost as tightly woven into our daily lives as the air that we breathe” he explains today.

“How many people have milk in their tea or coffee? You’d also be surprised how many vegans wear leather belts or shoes. I don’t think there is any animal which plays a bigger part in our lives.” Sadly Roger believes what he terms “de-naturing” – the distance many of us today have from the countryside and the source of our food – means we have lost touch with this animal that humanity has relied on from time immemorial. Neolithic man started domesticating cows some 10000 years ago to carry loads and pull carts or ploughs. But in the past 100 years while the productivity of cows has doubled their life expectancy has more than halved.

Treated well the cow can live for two decades but few make it past six years because of the strains of intensive farming. Many only manage three years of lactation cycle before stressed and worn out they are sent for slaughter for beef. “In the old days they were giving 15 litres of milk a day and now they are giving 60” explains Morgan-Grenville. “It’s not natural and they are exhausted.” Roger took the Daily Express to Buddington Farm near Midhurst West Sussex to show how the future could look for what is arguably civilisation’s most useful animal. There farmer James Renwick has 350 cattle including 120 Holstein Friesians for milking. He also grows potatoes and hay to be as self-sufficient as he can.

“Rather than round the cows up to be milked twice a day he has the technology to let them decide when they want to be milked” explains Roger. “The cows enjoy eating grass in the fields and then they walk up to the milking machine when they feel ready. They even queue. They know where to stand to let themselves be milked automatically.” James is delighted with the results. “Some of them like to be milked three times a day” explains the 58-year-old farmer. “They come and go as they please day or night and that seems to suit them and it suits us too.”

Pipes take the milk from the automatic milker to a pasteurisation room where it is heated to about 66 C entigrade for half an hour cooled and sent to a churn which is taken to a vending machine in a nearby building that dates back to the 1700s. Customers then drop in and use the self-vending machinery to pour themselves a litre of milk for £1.20 just a few pennies more than comparable supermarket prices. Reusable glass bottles are provided at £2 each. “What I love about this farm is that everything is done to give the animals the best lives possible with as little stress as possible” says Roger. “Consumers cannot buy fresher milk so everyone is benefiting. I would like more farms to be like this.”

Trending

While researching his new book he discovered that many farms were ignoring fashionable management consultant advice to get bigger and bigger. “Farmers want to get smaller so they have lower input and lower output” he says. “They say their costs will be lower they won’t sell as much but their animals will have happier better lives and they will make money. Buddington Farm is proof of this new way of thinking which is actually turning the clock back 100 years way before intensive farming.”

Clearing vast swathes of Brazilian rainforest to grow soybean for feeding barn-bred cows on intensive farms – instead of simply letting them roam around and eat grass – defies logic continues Roger. “It’s just bizarre. There is a movement here in the UK Pasture for Life which gives certificates to farmers for rearing their cattle on pasture. Consumers can identify meat and dairy produced this way. I think this is a fantastic development and the way forward. “A lot of farm shops are selling their own beef which is another positive sign for the future. Consumers can see that their sirloin steak came from a Dexter which was reared on pasture in Petworth or wherever.”

Cattle arrived in the UK about 4000 years ago. Selective breeding over centuries has produced a wide range of breeds such as the Angus Herefords Galloways and Red Devons. “We are very lucky in this country to have so many exceptional breeds among the 200 breeds but they need protecting” insists Roger. “Ironically the best way of protecting a breed is by eating it so we have to support our home-grown meat industry. ""A lot of people in this country want to try cattle farming but the biggest barrier to entry is the price of land. I’ve met some inspirational landowners who are prepared to give a small piece of land for starter farms to help. This is the kind of creative thinking we need for the future.”

Back at his country cottage home in the West Sussex ­village of Upperton Roger – part of the team that launched the veterans’ charity Help For Heroes – and his artist wife Caroline are gradually going back to nature themselves. A one-acre field has been turned into a wild meadow where he keeps three bee hives. A wild peacock has made its home in the garden much to the delight of their dogs a mongrel called Boris and a spaniel Kiwi. “I hardly cut the grass any more” says Roger. “It’s better to leave nature alone to get on with it. I am not a scientist or a naturalist but I am a ­storyteller and what’s happening to our bees birds and cows is something people should know about.”

Morgan-Grenville in South Georgia after the Falklands war during his army days

With an insatiable curiosity and boundless energy Roger has just finished walking 930 miles from Lymington in Hampshire to Cape Wrath in the far north of Scotland for his next book to see for himself what is going on in the countryside. Roger’s great-great-grandfather was the last Duke of Buckingham. When the aristocratic family ran out of male heirs and faced huge debts they had to sell the family home which is now Stowe School in Buckingham. After attending Eton Roger joined the Royal Green Jackets as a private and rose to the rank of captain serving in the Falklands and administering South Georgia.",,,,,,,,,

A humbling time for Klarna

Welp I had a whole other topic planned for my intro today and then the Klarna news hit.

In case you missed it on July 1 the Wall Street Journal reported that the Swedish buy now pay later behemoth and upstart bank is reportedly raising $650 million at a $6.5 billion valuation giving new meaning to the phrase “down round.” The news was shocking to say the least. Why you ask? Well in June of 2021 Klarna was valued at $45.6 billion after closing on a $639 million round of funding — making it the highest-valued private fintech in Europe at that time.

When Klarna confirmed that raise on June 10 2021 CEO and founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski sat down with me (via Zoom) in an exclusive interview detailing why he was so excited about the company’s “explosive growth” in the U.S. and how it planned to use its new capital in part to continue to grow there and globally. He also said that an IPO was still in its sights “but not anytime soon.” The company then had 18 million users in the U.S.

Fast-forward to 2022. As of February Klarna had 23 million monthly active users in the U.S. and 147 million globally. It reported 32% higher revenue of $1.42 billion for 2021.

By May Klarna had laid off 10% of its workforce or 700 people.

As TC’s Romain Dillet reported the company didn’t name a single reason for the layoffs. Instead Siemiatkowski listed different macro and geopolitical factors that led to the decision.

“When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year it was a very different world than the one we are in today” he said. “Since then we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold a shift in consumer sentiment a steep increase in inflation a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession.”

Now the company could be slashing its valuation by an astounding 1/7 to $6.5 billion. Notably Klarna has not confirmed this but startlingly the projection for the company’s alleged latest funding round and new valuation has steadily declined in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal reported on June 16 that Klarna was considering raising capital at a valuation of around $15 billion. Even that new figure represented both a dramatic decline from Klarna’s mid-2021 valuation of more than $45 billion and the $30 billion figure it was reported to be targeting earlier this year as our own Alex Wilhelm noted here. So from $45 billion to $30 billion to $15 billion to $6.5 billion. It’s hard to imagine it going even more downhill from here.

It’s also important to note though that Klarna is not the only BNPL provider that has seen a decline in valuation. As another tech enthusiast tweeted on Friday competitor Affirm’s stock is also down significantly. On July 1 alone shares were down 5% to $17.13 at the time of my writing this at about 2:30 p.m. CT giving Affirm a market cap of $4.9 billion. That’s down from a 52-week-high of $176.65. Ouch.

Weekly News

Speaking of valuations Alex examined how after financial technology startups saw their fortunes rise during the venture capital boom in 2021 they’re now suffering from a slump of a similar scale. The damage he wrote is not unidimensional. Instead pain around the fintech sphere is varied and multifactorial.

The layoffs in fintech continue. Amount a company that reached unicorn status last year recently laid off 18% of its workforce. The exact number of how many people were affected is not known but when TechCrunch reported on its last raise in May of 2021 the company said that it had 400 employees. If that is still the case then about 72 people were let go. Amount was spun out of Avant — an online lender that has raised over $600 million in equity — in January of 2020 to provide enterprise software built specifically for the banking industry. It partners with banks and financial institutions to “rapidly digitize their financial infrastructure and compete in the retail lending and buy now pay later sectors” CEO Adam Hughes told TechCrunch last year.

The Federal Trade Commission is suing Walmart for sitting by while scammers bilked customers out of more than $197 million the agency alleged in a statement. It’s seeking a court order that would force Walmart to give money back to customers on top of civil fines. In a brief response Walmart described the lawsuit as both “factually flawed and legally baseless.” Money transfer scams are widespread and they can involve everything from promises to share an inheritance to lies about a family emergency. They happen just about everywhere from Zelle Venmo and Cash App to crypto ATMs and popular dating apps. In this case the FTC alleges that Walmart “turned a blind eye to fraud” that went down inside its stores.

Robinhood made headlines three times over the past week. First Taylor looked at how the stock trading and investing app was blindsided by the surge in interest from the first big “meme stock” after Redditors and other retail investors rallied around $GME and sent its price into the stratosphere. Jacqueline Melnik then addressed the rumors that FTX is looking to acquire Robinhood in this piece. And then Alex broke down for us why a crypto exchange might want to buy Robinhood in the first place.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) less than 2% of financial institutions’ CEOs are women and for executive board members the figure is less than 20%. Why does this matter? Apart from the obvious lack of opportunities for talented women there are broader implications for business resilience as well as economic policy at national and international levels.

Cash App last week launched Round Ups allowing customers to invest their spare change into a stock of their choice or bitcoin every time they use their Cash Card. Cash App said the product would allow Cash Card users “to seamlessly accumulate bitcoin and stock investments through everyday purchases.”

The shelves at Villa Market were stocked with American brands. Katie Lockhart

I'm an American citizen who's been traveling around Asia for nearly four years.

Whenever I explore a new place I'm eager to dive into the local cuisine and typically make a beeline for the street-food markets. But there are moments when I crave a familiar taste of home like Tostitos chips dipped in a pint of Ben & Jerry's Phish Food.

Luckily I found upscale grocery stores that carry classic American foods during my trip to Bangkok.

Many of the items were priced considerably higher in Thailand than they are in the US but I was happy to shell out the extra Thai baht for them.

Here's what the American food selection looks like in Villa Market an international grocery-store chain in Bangkok.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvZml2ZS10aW1lcy1icmFuZHMtYW5kLXRoZWlyLWJ1eWVycy1mZWxsLW91dC1zMnYwczJnd2TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five times brands and their buyers fell out,"Heinz pulled its baked beans and ketchup brands from Tesco last week after the supermarket giant refused to allow it to raise prices. The move quickly led to gaps on Tesco’s shelves although it urged shoppers to switch to Branston baked beans made by Japan’s Mizkan Group or its own-brand versions. Kraft Heinz the US conglomerate 26 per cent owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway investment empire said it was facing big increases in commodity and production costs. Tesco meanwhile is fighting to keep down prices in the face of competition from the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Analysts said that while shoppers may be inconvenienced by having to use other beans and ketchup the row would cement Tesco’s reputation for value in their minds.

As Kellogg’s prepares to split its business in three could the glory days of the multi-category consumer mega-corps be behind them?

The cereals and snacks giant is spinning out its problematic North American cereals division and its nascent plant-based division to focus on its higher-growth global snacking arm. The plan marks a shift of strategy from its fellow consumer food and drink giants which have typically prioritised growth by selling off lower-growth or non-core divisions. Kellogg’s will create three distinct publicly listed companies by the end of 2023: Global Snacking Co containing 80% of its current business including its international cereals portfolio; North American Cereal Co; and Plant Co the latter anchored by its US MorningStar Farms brand. The rationale is similar to that behind Unilever’s sale of its spreads division and Nestlé’s sale of its US ice cream and waters business – to shift away from non-core lower-growth assets and invest in categories of higher growth. For Kellogg’s this means its snack brands such as Pringles Pop-Tarts Cheez-It Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats. Its traditional cereals have suffered from the structural decline in traditional breakfasts as consumer habits shift while the division has also suffered in recent times from strikes supply chain disruptions and mounting commodity price pressures. Kellogg’s CEO Steve Cahillane who will lead the main snacking business said the split means the cereal division “will not have to compete for resources against a high-growth snacking business”. Meanwhile the much smaller Plant Co division will be an innovation-driven pure-play plant-based player. With sales of $340m the North America-focused business remains in growth phase but crucially – unlike other listed players in the space such as Beyond Meat – it generates a profit. Notable consumer spin-offs Consumer health: Last year pharma giants GSK and Johnson & Johnson both pledged to spin off their consumer health arms to become separate standalone companies. GSK rebuffed a £50bn raid from Unilever to plough ahead with its plan to split out ‘Haleon’ and IPO it in July. Johnson & Johnson is hoping its offshoot will list by November 2023.

Kraft/Mondelez: Pre-Heinz merger Kraft Foods span off confectionery arm Mondelez including the Cadbury brand in 2012. The split followed Kraft’s controversial takeover of Cadbury in 2010. Separately Mondelez has thrived now boasting annual revenues of $26bn. Kraft’s more troubled path saw revenues shrink before its mega-merger with Heinz.

Cadbury Schweppes: Under the urging of activist investor Nelson Peltz the chocolate and drinks arms split in 2007. While the split was welcomed strategically it left Cadbury vulnerable to the Kraft takeover. Schweppes – which became Dr Pepper Snapple Group – was acquired in 2018 by Keurig Green Mountain to become Keurig Dr Pepper. Cahillane said the independent companies would be “better positioned to focus on their distinct strategic priorities”. In reality this is Kellogg’s grasping the nettle of the key issue many other consumer giants face: looking after the bottom line while prioritising growth. GlobalData’s Nidhi Chauhan suggests prevailing chaotic market conditions have intensified the need to address underperforming divisions. “With the snacks business growing at a faster rate than the cereal and plant-based product divisions these smaller companies may be able to move quicker and smarter than the heavy Kellogg brand” he says. While global giants have historically benefited from scale this restructure is driven by the belief that category focus outweighs back office synergies. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson notes: “Whilst there may be security in size and savings to be made by sharing back room operations strategically there’s a gulf between family favourites and pushing plant-based boundaries.”

Best of both worlds

A break-up rather than sell-off theoretically enables the company to benefit from the best of both worlds – reliable cash generation from its mature categories and the benefit of structural growth opportunities in more on-trend areas.

This isn’t a new approach just one rarely seen in food and drink in recent years which has focused on portfolio management through M&A and tended to retain relatively diverse product categories.

Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard notes the move could be seen as an “admission that turning around the US cereal business is proving tough” but it is also reminiscent of the Mondelez split from Kraft a decade ago.

Howard suggests shedding the problematic cereals business – as well as shedding debt on to it – could propel Kellogg’s to trade more in line with other snacking companies like Mondelez’s EBITDA multiples of 14-15 times compared with its current level of around 12 times.

How investors and customers will take to the split-off cereal business is less clear. But clean splits may become increasingly attractive to consumer giants.

The past decade has seen little such activity but in recent months GSK turned down Unilever’s mega-billions approach for its consumer health arm to instead spin it out via a London IPO next month. Johnson & Johnson announced a similar consumer split in November 2021. Bernstein’s Howard suggests Campbell Soup Co or Conagra Brands may also follow suit.

Of course it could still be that Kellogg’s announcement is precursor to a more traditional divestment.

OC&C managing partner Will Hayllar comments: “The debt markets are not as open for big ticket debt at the moment and therefore they may feel like public market rather than selling to a buyout group provides the cleaner path forward.

“I suspect this gives them certainty where they can lay out the future strategy of these divisions as separate companies and if someone wants to come in and make an offer they are still able to do so.”

In particular the plant-based division would seem to offer opportunities for an investor to scale up off-market. Notably Kellogg’s even floated that a sell-off of the division remained a possibility.

Even the cereals business could attract buyer attention now Kellogg’s has announced its intention to demerge it with its reliable cash generation and potential for margin-focused restructure appealing to buyout firms in particular.

Shareholders were broadly supportive last week with shares up around 6% and remaining up a week later.

It provides more evidence that the City has grown impatient with slow-growth mature businesses. The post-Covid period has already seen General Mills and Danone diversify their portfolios while Unilever is under pressure to move much faster with Nelson Peltz set to take his board seat in a few weeks.

Kellogg’s bold move is certainly unlikely to be the last consumer spin-out as unprecedented economic pressure puts more business models under the microscope.",,,

All stores have marketing tactics to get you in the door — stylish mannequins elaborate display windows posters screaming about all the discounts you can find inside.

But some are far more subtle so much so that chances are you’ve hardly ever noticed them. Picture your local grocery store for example. What do you see when you first walk in?

Most likely: Flowers. Big bright bouquets of fresh-cut blooms greet shoppers inside just about every major grocer from Whole Foods to Kroger to innumerable New York City bodegas.

That’s no coincidence — there’s a strategic decision behind those flowers’ placement.

“It is very very simple” says Paco Underhill the founder and CEO of behavioral research and consulting firm Envirosell. “If you can get someone’s nose and saliva glands working they become a much less disciplined shopper.”

That’s right: Flowers fire up the senses getting you ready to spend. Sure they’re aesthetically pleasing. And as you get closer your nose picks up on their aroma which tells your brain “this place has good stuff.”

“You’re signaling freshness you’re signaling ‘natural’… all the good things that make food good” said Ashwani Monga a professor of marketing at Rutgers Business School.

“If I’m a grocery store then that’s how I want you to see my store — logistically if this person can manage fresh flowers and sell them this person isn’t going to sell stale food.”

That psychological priming is just one way stores indirectly influence your behavior and encourage you to part more readily with your money. (Holiday music is another effective strategy.)

Psychologists call the effect misattribution — you’re in a good mood and ready to shell out for the holiday season for example not fully realizing that it’s because of the music and twinkly lights.

What makes flowers so effective is that they’re a high-margin item. They may account for only 1% to 3% of total sales but in 2019 stores reported an average gross margin of 47% on cut flowers according to a report from the International Fresh Produce Association. In other words that bouquet you bought for $15 likely cost the store just $7.50. That’s because most of the stems for sale in US grocery stores are flown in from South America where land and labor are much cheaper.

The grocery store flower scene has emerged over the past 30 years or so says Becky Roberts director of floral at the IFPA. As shoppers became more time-starved grocery stores evolved to be more of a one-stop shop with bank branches coffee shops post offices and of course florists.

Covid-19 lockdowns were especially lucrative for the cut flower industry.

“People had to come to supermarkets as one of the few places that they really could still come and shop” Roberts said. “They wanted things that could bring them a little joy a little fun a little happiness.”

Inflation is taking its toll of course but Roberts said she expects floral sales to remain strong even as consumers rein in spending on non-essential items.

“You might not be able to afford a $200 dinner now or to be able to take that road trip” she said. “But you still can go pick up a bunch of flowers and feel like ‘OK I’m still treating myself.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZGVzb3RvY291bnR5bmV3cy5jb20vZGVzb3RvLWNvdW50eS1uZXdzL2EtZmlsbC11cC1vZi1hcHByZWNpYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A fill up of gratitude,"Austin Woods of Horn Lake has worked in the lawn spray division of Michael Hatcher and Associates 8365 Center Hill Road in Olive Branch for just a couple of weeks. He was just hired there to join about 155 fellow team members on the production team for the well-known commercial and residential landscaping company. Woods said he had never met Hatcher personally before Friday.

Yet on a Friday afternoon as Woods was checking out for the holiday weekend there he was Hatcher himself directing one of his leadership team members to fill Woods’ car with gasoline.

At the same time Hatcher held a $50 Kroger gift card with Woods’ name on it ready to give him for some extra groceries maybe for a weekend July Fourth barbecue.

One by one as they were set to finish their work for the week field team members were able to drive up get their vehicles filled with up to 15 gallons of gas and Friday also received a Kroger gift card as thanks for a job well done.

And with the rising price of gas and groceries nowadays for 155 employees this is not a cheap token of appreciation.

Fill Up Fridays started June 24 with more than $4000 worth of regular and diesel gas or about 1000 gallons of fuel dispensed straight from the Hatcher company pumps. The giveaways continued on Friday July 1 with Kroger cards included and the giveaways will take place every other week through the end of July.

Needless to say the field team members were leaving work happy to have a full tank of gas and some extra grocery money to spend.

Woods said he has never worked at a place more appreciative of their employees’ efforts before.

“There’s nothing you can name that’s not good about working here” Woods said. “The friendly people the benefits that come with hard work. The only thing you gotta do is put in the effort. This is the first job I like waking up to do.”

Hatcher explained that the key to a successful workforce is like a three-legged stool: attract or attain train and then retain.

“Once you attract them and once you train them they’re more valuable when they get to that retention because they’ve already been trained with the time and effort” Hatcher said. “We spend just as much effort time and money to retain an employee.”

Hatcher CEO Russ Sneed said the idea came about in a leadership team meeting where it was brought up how much gasoline and groceries were rising in price. It was decided Fill Up Friday would be a way to express what the production team meant to the landscaper.

“Not just what we can get from them but what they are getting back from the company” Sneed said. “It’s huge not only for the guys that are out in the field but it’s also it’s a big win for the people in the office because we’ll be able to come out here and celebrate with the guys a little bit and have that camaraderie and teamwork.”

Sneed said being able to retain people and make them feel like the company is looking out for them is part of the culture Michael Hatcher has instilled and continues today.

In her first appearance at Essence Fest since becoming vice president Kamala Harris sat down with Palmer for a wide-ranging conversation. Harris shared various moments from her tenure including the moments before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed by the Senate.

She also reflected on the moment she learned that the Supreme Court removed constitutional protections for abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. She was en route to meet with Rep. Lauren Underwood to discuss work the two have been planning around maternal health.

Black maternal health and related supports is something Harris and Underwood have been working on even before she became vice president.

“We have to recognize we’re a nation that was founded on certain principles that are — that are grounded in the concept of freedom and liberty” Harris said. “We also know that we’ve had a history in this country of government — trying to claim ownership over human bodies.”

In her conversation with Palmer Harris also noted the intersection between states denying bodily autonomy and those restricting access to the ballot. But she encouraged people to be vigilant and understand that people will always have to fight for these rights.

She transitioned to highlighting other successes of the Biden-Harris administration including historic efforts to address environmental injustice through the Justice 40 Initiative and funding to massive lead pipe removal. Harris lifted up the value and importance of youth leadership in response to a question about getting young people engaged.

“We have a history of these movements being fueled by students by young leaders” she said. “And you could look at anything from who was taking to the street articulating with Black Lives Matter to who has been now out there marching on choice who is out there leading on so many of the issues that are about the climate crisis that is pounding on the door for attention and swift response.”

The annual Essence Festival captures the best of culture politics music and more. While there was much joy and excitement to go around the conversations led by organizers and civil rights advocates struck a different tone. As reported by Nola.com civil rights leaders speaking on various panels during Essence Fest took the time to denounce attacks people’s rights.

Louisiana’s Democratic governor recently signed into law an extremely restrictive abortion ban citing his personal anti-abortion position as the justification. Sadly he is among those who don’t understand that their personal beliefs and religion should not be allowed to dictate for others how they live.

A Sunday article in The Advocate noted the dire conditions for families and children. Louisiana ranks high in terms of maternal mortality and low in other quality of life indicators. The state previously received an F from the March of Dimes in terms of infant mortality.

Local news outlet WWLTV captured the full conversation between Harris and Palmer.

Griffin Green 24 moved to the Bronx from Michigan last week for a new opportunity as a sales development rep with the software company Outreach Reason reported.

He took to TikTok to complain that bodegas - corner stores - in his Bronx neighborhood only stocked unhealthy instant foods and that it was hard to shop properly there compared to a larger supermarket like Kroger back home.

But busybody Twitter hall monitors soon seized on the clips claiming they demonstrated white privilege with Green's cowardly employer bowing to pressure from the niche accounts to terminate their staffer.

Outreach told Reason that Green was fired for sharing an offer of employment letter on social media not because of the controversial bodega videos which earned him the moniker 'Bodega Bro.'

But the publication suggested Outreach was using that as a fig leaf to justify its decision to fire him over the innocuous bodega clips

The series of videos that sparked the online outrage shows Green walking around his Bronx neighborhood where he had moved for his new job while he blasts the local bodegas and asked his viewers how he was supposed to make dinner and where he could find a 'big grocery store.'

'OK so I just moved to New York and I'm going to go grocery shopping and so I type in like 'grocery stores' on my Apple Maps and every f–king one I go to … they're like this s–t' he told the camera in one video.

Outreach told Reason that Green was fired for sharing the offer letter on social media not because of the controversial bodega videos which earned him the moniker 'Bodega Bro'

'Like bro that's not a grocery store' he said as he turned the camera to show one of the small stores. 'I'm trying to get like eggs yogurt cheese s–t like that. Like look at this place.'

Green continues to walk through his Bronx neighborhood and states he's been to several and doesn't know what to do about dinner.

'Like I've literally been to like five of those now and like I don't know what the f–k I'm about to do for dinner. Like where are the Krogers and the Whole Foods at? Like I'm about to eat f–king like cereal and ramen for dinner like what the f–k?'

The clip went viral after a Twitter user posted it with some saying Green was exuding white privilege for blasting bodegas which are a staple in New York communities.

Blogger Perez Hilton - best-known for bullying female stars including Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan on his website - circled the wagons further by tweeting that the video seemed 'racist.'

'I'm sure this 'bro' thought he was being funny but… did anyone else view this as racist? Or just me?'

Blogger Perez Hilton tweeted that the video seemed 'racist'

TikTok star Dutch De Carvalho chimed in on the video: 'I mean what he's been here like two days? And he's found a way to make fun of the stores that many people in the community rely on.'

More videos surfaced which prompted further backlash on social media.

In one clip which seemed to have surfaced during Pride Green commented on how many gay people are in New York and asked whether 'being gay is just a thing now.'

In another one he pointed out that he was wearing an NAACP shirt to the gym in the Bronx so 'these people' vibe with him more.

'I'm in the Bronx for a few weeks so I'm like the only white dude in this whole gym so I got this NAACP shirt so these people vibe with me more' he purportedly said in one video the New York Post reported.

Video that Green posted of his offer letter and announcement of moving to New York resurfaced and a Twitter user alerted the company.

'I don't think it's very flattering to have this type of person representing your company' the user wrote. 'I would revalue his employment if I were you.'

Outreach responded 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Upon investigation we took swift internal action in accordance with our company policies and in alignment with our core values. He is no longer an employee of Outreach.'

The firm said Green was fired for sharing the offer letter on social media even though it was only visible for a few seconds.

'It is against company policy for employees to leak private and confidential information and grounds for termination' Outreach's vice president of communications told Reason. 'We remain committed to building our culture that finds strength in our diversity equity and inclusion — and a company where all can succeed.'

Green who had just signed a 1-year lease with an apartment in the Bronx told Reason he was fired on his second day of work. He asked for a chance to explain but said he was denied.

'People can be painted as these mean awful people when really they're just trying to explore new things' Green told Reason. 'I was exploring New York for the first time … I didn't know that people do grocery shopping at these corner stores.'

'It was more of an intent to almost like make fun of myself for being a new person in the city' he said.

Green set his TikTok account to private but on Saturday night posted a new video that addressed the backlash and included a compilation of the grad ordering food at a local bodega.

Green posted a new video to TikTok Saturday night of buying food at a local bodega and distributing it to various homeless men in the area

'If you came here from Twitter you probably know me as ""Bodega Bro""' Green said. 'So I came off private to show you guys what Bodega Bro is really all about.'

Green then bags up the bacon egg and cheese rolls and chopped cheese rolls that he bought along with gatorade and fruit and films himself distributing them to various homeless men in the area.

In the video Green adds that 'if anyone is hiring in tech sales or needs a workout partner in New York' to let him know."

The mission designated USSF-12 released the two Space Force satellites into an on-target orbit more than 22400 miles (about 36100 kilometers) over the equator according to ULA. The spacecraft are expected to maneuver into their final operating positions a couple hundred miles lower in the geostationary belt where they will orbit in lock-step with Earth’s rotation.

One of the payloads called the Wide Field of View Testbed will demonstrate a new instrument design that could help give the military better warning of a missile attack. The USSF-12 Ring spacecraft riding below the WFOV Testbed payload during the launch sequence hosts classified experiments and tech demo payloads.

Launching a day late after stormy weather scrubbed a countdown Thursday the Atlas 5 ignited its Russian-made RD-180 main engine and four strap-on solid rocket boosters at 7:15 p.m. EDT (2315 GMT) Friday to kick off the fourth mission of the year for United Launch Alliance a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

The countdown Friday was also delayed by bad weather. The Atlas 5 launch team waited more than an hour for electrically charged anvil clouds and upper level winds to become more favorable for liftoff.

The weather concerns cleared and ULA engineers gave approval to commence the final four minutes of the countdown culminating in the Atlas 5’s fiery departure from Florida’s Space Coast.

The rocket headed east riding 2.3 million pounds of thrust and exceeded the speed of sound in less than a minute as it disappeared into an overcast cloud deck. On-board cameras showed the rocket jettison its four boosters and payload fairing as the kerosene-fueled RD-180 engine powered the Atlas 5 for the first four minutes of the flight.

The RD-180 engine hit its marks Friday giving good performance to begin the mission for the Space Force. Friday’s launch marked the 100th flight of an RD-180 engine — all successful — since its debut on a Lockheed Martin Atlas 3 rocket in May 2000. The Atlas 3 was a bridge program between the older versions of the Atlas rocket family and the Atlas 5.

ULA is retiring the Atlas 5 and ending its use of Russian engines. After Friday night’s flight the company has 22 Atlas 5 missions left on the books. ULA’s new rocket the Vulcan Centaur will be powered by all U.S. engines.

After the first stage completed its burn and separated to fall into the Atlantic Ocean the Atlas 5’s Centaur upper stage lit an Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10 engine for the first of three firings to place the USSF-12 payloads into their target orbit.

The first two burns placed the satellites into a parking orbit and then an elliptical or oval-shaped transfer orbit. The Centaur upper stage coasted to the target altitude more than 22000 miles above Earth the reignited the RL10 engine to circularize its orbit.

The WFOV Testbed spacecraft separated from the Centaur stage at 1:04 a.m. EDT (0504 GMT). A special adapter structure released about 10 minutes later allowing the USSF-12 Ring spacecraft to deploy from the rocket at 1:20 a.m. EDT (0520 GMT) Saturday.

ULA declared the launch a success in a press release early Saturday.

“This mission once again demonstrated ULA’s unmatched capability of precisely delivering the country’s most critical assets to a highly complex orbit” said Gary Wentz ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. “Our strong partnership with the USSF team is essential to maintain our nation’s security advantages and achieve robust mission assurance.”

The Space Force’s Wide Field of View or WFOV Testbed surveillance satellite was one of the payloads on the USSF-12 mission. The WFOV Testbed satellite is demonstrator for a next-generation space-based sensor designed to detect rocket launches and provide early warning of a missile attack.

Built in El Segundo California by Millennium Space Systems a subsidiary of Boeing the WFOV Testbed satellite carries an optical staring instrument to detect the exhaust plumes from missile launches demonstrating the wide-area sensor for future use in the military’s operational early warning systems.

The WFOV mission will demonstrate the optical sensor technology for use on future missile warning missions in the Space Force’s Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR program. The next-generation OPIR missions will replace the Space Based Infrared System or SBIRS missile warning satellites that currently provide missile detection and early warning coverage.

The Space Force is partnering with the Space Development Agency and the Missile Defense Agency on a next-generation fleet of missile warning satellites in low Earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit.

Col. Brian Denaro the Space Force’s program executive officer for space sensing said the WFOV Testbed mission will “advance our target identification and characterization capabilities. It’s an important prototype for the resilient integrated missile warning tracking missile defense architecture.”

The infrared sensor on the WFOV Testbed satellite was developed by L3Harris. The Space Force said the infrared instrument has “first in its class sensor sensitivity” across its wide field of view capable of tracking dim targets over large areas. The new sensor technology is necessary as threats shift from primarily large ballistic missiles to smaller projectiles such as hypersonic cruise missiles.

“The threat is certainly evolving at an unprecedentedly fast pace that we haven’t seen before” Denaro said. “We’re looking at a range of targets and missiles in the hypersonic domain that are far more maneuverable they’re dimmer they’re harder to see. And that’s requiring a new approach to how we both detect and then track all these missiles throughout their flight.

“We’re seeing these developments both in China and in Russia at a very fast pace to which we need to develop these overhead systems that are able to evolve to keep pace with those changing directions” Denaro said.

SBIRS satellites carry scanning and staring sensors while the instrument on the WFOV Testbed mission can collect data with a single sensor. The last SBIRS satellite is scheduled to launch in August on the next Atlas 5 rocket and the first next-generation OPIR missile warning satellite is slated to launch in 2025 or 2026.

The WFOV Testbed “can simultaneously perform strategic missions such as missile warning and battlespace awareness as well as tactical missions directly supporting the warfighter by continuously monitoring up to one-third of the Earth’s surface with just a single sensor” said Col. Heather Bogstie senior materiel leader for resilient missile warning tracking and defense at Space Systems Command.

The L3Harris instrument also features a “tactical cryocooler” to chill its infrared detectors. The lower-cost cryocooler was originally designed to fly on airplanes but has been repurposed for operating in space.

The missile warning demonstration satellite — about one-fourth the size of the Space Force’s current-generation SBIRS satellites — is designed for a mission of three years with a total mass of up to 6600 pounds (3000 kilograms) according to Millennium.

The L3Harris payload stands more than 6 feet (2 meters) tall and weighs more than 365 pounds (165 kilograms). The instrument was developed at an L3Harris facility in Wilmington Massachusetts.

“The L3Harris instrument can stare continuously at a theater of interest to provide ongoing information about the battlespace which is an improvement over legacy systems” said Ed Zoiss president of space and airborne systems at L3Harris. “It also provides better resolution sensitivity and target discrimination at a lower cost.”

The second satellite on-board the USSF-12 mission carries a suite of classified payloads.

The Space Force says the USSF-12 Ring spacecraft is based on a “ring-based structure” capable of hosting multiple experiments and prototype technologies. The military has not said what experiments might be mounted on the USSF 12 Ring spacecraft or whether it carries deployable free-flyer satellites that will separate from the parent spacecraft to perform their own missions.

The USSF-12 Ring spacecraft is built on a Northrop Grumman satellite bus called ESPA Star itself based on a ring structure originally designed to accommodate secondary payloads during launch. Northrop Grumman has modified the ring structure with solar power and propulsion capabilities to function as a standalone satellite.

ULA’s next mission is scheduled for August with the SBIRS GEO 6 missile warning satellite.

The launch company has up to six more missions on its calendar for the rest of the year including the SBIRS launch and the final flights of the Delta 4-Heavy rocket and Atlas 5 rocket from the West Coast spaceport at Vandenberg Space Force Base California. The remaining Delta 4 and Atlas 5 flights will all lift off from Cape Canaveral.

ULA hopes to launch the first next-generation Vulcan Centaur rocket from Florida by the end of the year. And the first crew flight on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft could launch on an Atlas 5 rocket in late 2022.

Wade.

Supporters led by a $1 million donation from Lizzo and Live Nation are amping up their giving to both long-established advocacy organizations and on-the-ground groups (especially ones that are helping women gain imminent access to health care) while using their celebrity and influence to inspire further giving. As pro-abortion advocates ramp up their donations The Hollywood Reporter spoke with a showrunner a manager/producer an engagement officer at an entertainment law firm and the leader of an advocacy group for women in Hollywood about what organizations they are currently supporting in the battle for abortion rights.

“Hollywood has been coming together to support leading organizations like the Center for Reproductive Rights — which argued Dobbs before the Supreme Court — in preparation for this moment and some incredible leaders have emerged” says Hannah Linkenhoker chief engagement officer of entertainment law firm Johnson Shapiro. The center counts actresses Elizabeth Banks Amy Brenneman Lisa Edelstein Aja Naomi King and Busy Philipps as members of its ambassador council while producer Heidi Lindelof is a board member.

“The Center has really created a powerful community in Hollywood” continues Linkenhoker “and that community has driven funding exposure messaging and more to impact the movement for reproductive rights and abortion access.”

Many entertainment industry insiders are also donating to the venerable Planned Parenthood including Ellen Goldsmith-Vein of The Gotham Group who calls the nonprofit a “trusted resource for women for over 100 years.”

Lizzo has been vocal about her support for Planned Parenthood. Within hours of the Supreme Court ruling the Grammy-winning superstar announced that she will be donating $500000 of the profits from her upcoming tour to the organization which offers reproductive health care to women across the country as well as to the National Network of Abortion Funds. Live Nation the sponsor of the multi-date tour has agreed to match Lizzo’s donation making the total a substantial $1 million.

This week Olivia Wilde led an online discussion with doctors from Physicians for Reproductive Health an organization she has supported for many years. Many stars also are joining in protests springing up across the nation including Philipps who was arrested at an abortion-rights protest in Washington D.C. on Thursday June 30 and Jodie Sweetin (Full House and Fuller House) who was recently shoved by police at an abortion rally in Los Angeles. Additionally Sweetin sponsored an Instagram fundraiser which raised $5000 for Planned Parenthood.

“Our activism will continue until our voices are heard and action is taken” Sweetin said in a statement. “This will not deter us; we will continue fighting for our rights. We are not free until ALL of us are free.”

Other entertainment industry figures have taken to social media to help raise funds. Showrunner and writer Liz Meriwether (The Dropout New Girl) recently hosted an Instagram fundraiser for The Brigid Alliance raising over $6000 in donations.

“When the leak came out in May I donated to the National Network of Abortion Funds which is an incredible umbrella organization that funds many smaller local groups who do the on-the-ground work of getting people the care they need” Meriwether tells THR. “Now I am also donating to Brigid Alliance because it directly funds all travel and logistics of people trying to get to abortion care and demand on the group has skyrocketed. I’m also donating to the Plan C organization which provides medication abortion through the mail to anyone seeking it.”

Debra Messing has shared information on The Brigid Alliance and Apiary for Practical Support a nonprofit national technical assistant hub for the organizations that provide practical support to people seeking abortions. And the band Bon Iver is sponsoring a match program for The Brigid Alliance matching donations up to $22000. Linkenhoker is also supporting Keep Our Clinics a fundraising campaign to support independent abortion clinics which provide the majority of the abortion care in the U.S. and are more likely to be located in states that are working to outlaw abortion. Abortion could be outlawed or severely restricted in more than 20 states this year in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling (around five states now have bans) which will lead to many women traveling to states that allow abortion for reproductive health care.

Ariana Debose speaking with Jimmy Fallon this week said that she’s focusing her funding efforts on making “a difference on a local level so I’m trying to find abortion funds in my community that I can support so I can help anyone with a uterus.” In its YouTube clip of DeBose’s appearance on the show The Tonight Show shared a link to the National Network of Abortion Funds with its fans.

And entertainment figures including Whoopi Goldberg Chelsea Handler Ireland Baldwin and Laura Prepon are sharing and resharing their personal stories of abortion while encouraging support for reproductive rights.

Other Hollywood insiders are coming up with unique ways to engage their followers. BoJack Horseman showrunner Raphael Bob-Waksberg offered up a lottery — pledging to give five Twitter followers signed scripts of their favorite BoJack Horseman episode if they emailed him proof that they had donated to an abortion fund.

Some celebrities have focused their attention on political action and the upcoming midterm elections. Julia Louis-Dreyfus took to Twitter and vowed to match $10000 in donations to 11 pro-choice candidates for state legislatures where abortion rights are on the line in the upcoming midterms. She also vowed to match $10000 in donations to 80 local abortion funds.

July 9 may also see a Hollywood contingent show up in Washington D.C. when the Women’s March sponsors an abortion-rights protest in the nation’s capital. It’s sign-up page provides a box that participants who are willing to risk arrest can check.

Industry organizations also have banded together to provide their members with information on resources and reputable places to donate. “We created a list of resources that includes what different entertainment companies are doing for their employees and then also general resources” says Kirsten Schaffer CEO at Women in Film which advocates for women in the entertainment industry. “A lot of them are abortion funds…like ARC Southeast Northwest Abortion Access Fund Midwest Access Coalition Fund Texas Choice. People had abortions scheduled and their abortions were canceled and so now they need to get out of state to make that abortion happen. And that’s what these funds help them do.”

Schaffer says she has seen a positive reaction to Women in Film’s list of resources which includes a link to support the National Network of Abortion Funds. “People are applying to our newsletter which connected to the resources [saying] that they really appreciate the care and concern. And also they appreciate the access to the resources” she says.

Amid the flurry of giving supporters of abortion rights in Hollywood caution potential donors to make sure that their funds are going to legitimate organizations. “Use your network to verify credibility check the organization’s nonprofit status — look at their 990s look them up on Charity Navigator look at their board of directors to make sure they are reputable” says Linkenhoker.

And since supporters of abortions say their battle to restore access across the country will no doubt be long strategic giving is seen as the way to go by many pro-choice advocates.

“Right now I am donating to groups making an immediate impact on people currently seeking an abortion and then I will make another round of donations to political action groups and voter mobilization groups who will be fighting in the long term” Meriwether says. “This will be a long fight fought on many different fronts and I think everyone who supports abortion access needs to be prepared for the marathon.

A hypersonic jet Darkstar looks stealthy and its DNA does originate in the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance plane that the U.S. military crowed about so loudly decades ago. The plane emerged out of both film production and Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works which designed the Blackbird and its soon-to-be revealed progeny due in the skies in 2025.

The meeting of the minds was apparently fruitful and led to the development of a 1:1 prototype for film shooting. The aircraft features heavily in the first minutes of Top Gun: Maverick helping to set the stage for the drama to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlZC1ub3NlLWMtMTMwai1zdXBlci1oZXJjdWxlcy1mbGllcy1wcm91ZC10by1iZS1wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS13b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1jLTEzMC1mb3JjZS0xOTIzNTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Nose C-130J Super Hercules Flies Proud to Be Part of the World's Largest C-130 Force,"The 19th Airlift Wing is one of the many unsung units of the U.S. Air Force the ones tasked not necessarily with conducting battle but with making sure other units can do so effectively. It also happens to be the one operating the largest fleet of C-130 aircraft anywhere in the world.

More to the point between the 19th and its sibling the 314th Airlift Wing there are now 47 C-130J Super Hercules flying out of Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas where the two are based. The last plane of the bunch arrived in the base’s care back in May 2020.The Super Hercules is the most recent variant of the C-130 Hercules and is one of the largest in the family. From wing tip to wing tip it measures 132 feet (40 meters) and nose to tail 112 feet (34 meters).It can take off weighing as much as 164000 lbs (over 74 tons) as much as 46700 lbs (21 tons) of that being the cargo alone. According to its maker Lockheed Martin it can carry in C-130J-30 configuration 30 percent more cargo 44 percent more paratroopers and 50 percent more Container Delivery System (CDS) bundles than a regular Hercules.Back in March 2022 Lockheed announced it produced the 500th Super Hercules for the USAF. But there are more of them as some 22 countries are using the plane. Combined this massive fleet flew for over 2 million hours – that’s 228 years if you really want to make some sense of it.The one you see here flying its red nose over some woods over in Arkansas does serve the U.S. It’s deployed with the aforementioned 19th Airlift Wing (more precisely the 61st Airlift Squadron) and is seen here conducting a formation flight that took place at the beginning of the month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhdWxpZGRvbi8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL2V2ZW4taWYtdHVya2V5LWdldHMtbW9kZXJuaXplZC1mLTE2cy1ncmVlY2Utd2lsbC1zdGlsbC1oYXZlLWEtdGVjaG5vbG9naWNhbC1lZGdlLWluLWFpcnBvd2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Even If Turkey Gets Modernized F-16s Greece Will Still Have A Technological Edge In Airpower,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2022/07/02/even-if-turkey-gets-modernized-f-16s-greece-will-still-have-a-technological-edge-in-airpower/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhdWxpZGRvbi8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL2V2ZW4taWYtdHVya2V5LWdldHMtbW9kZXJuaXplZC1mLTE2cy1ncmVlY2Utd2lsbC1zdGlsbC1oYXZlLWEtdGVjaG5vbG9naWNhbC1lZGdlLWluLWFpcnBvd2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYWJhbWF3eC5jb20vP3A9MjQ0MTU10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Early Evening Look at Our Weather; Good Weather Up in Canton OH,"As we have reached the 5 pm hour on this hot Sunday evening for some others are seeing some heat relief in the form of scattered showers and thunderstorms. Unfortunately while rain is close by to my house in West Blount County we continue to stay dry for what seems to be forever. It does look like we’ve made it up to our projected highs before the scattered showers broke out across the area reaching the upper 80s to the lower 90s. All of the activity is moving slowly to the southeast.

We’ll continue to have a few showers and storms during the evening until after dark then activity will really start to dissipate. Afterwords some patchy fog will develop and could be thick enough for a fog advisory to be issued. Skies will be partly to mostly cloudy with lows reaching the lower to mid 70s.

Monday Independence Day will be a near repeat of today. Hot humid and scattered to numerous showers and storms possible during the afternoon and early evening hours. While everyone will have a good chance for rain the southern half of the area will have the higher chances. Highs will be in the upper 80s to the lower 90s.

For the championship game up in Canton Ohio with the kickoff at 6:30 pm… skies will be mainly clear with temperatures dropping from the lower 80s to the lower 70s by the final whistle. Winds will be out of the north to northeast at 5-10 mph. Good luck Birmingham!

Each machine deploys 150 laser beams projected from a gantry and moving quickly back and forth making high-tech parts for corporate customers in fields including aerospace semiconductors defense and medical implants.

The parts of titanium and other materials are created layer by layer each about as thin as a human hair up to 20000 layers depending on a part’s design. The machines are hermetically sealed. Inside the atmosphere is mainly argon among the least reactive of gases reducing the chance of impurities that cause defects in a part.

Lowe’s contract was up this summer but there is an agreement in place for Lowe to continue to serve as the host of NBC’s Premier League pre-and post-match shows.

Lowe has been with NBC since it acquired the rights to the property in 2013 and she relocated to the U.S. from England for the position.

The Athletic has learned that Lowe’s contract with NBC Sports will track in years with the company’s recent deal with the Premier League that runs until the end of the 2027-28 season. Last November NBC Sports extended its partnership with the Premier League to exclusively broadcast games in the U.S. The new six-year deal will run from the start of the 2022-23 season until the end of the 2027-28 campaign.

The Athletic placed the value of that deal at $2.7 billion. All 380 games each season will be broadcast live across NBC Universal platforms in English and Spanish. As part of Lowe’s new deal she is expected to continue her work as an Olympic host as well as a role in the Kentucky Derby.

Lowe was a guest on the Sports Media Podcast last August and was asked if her professional future tied professionally to NBC having the Premier League rights.

“Well I think we have seen with the NHL and the losing of the NHL for NBC that anything can happen” Lowe said at the time. “I was at Setanta Sports and that went bust under my feet. ESPN lost the (World Cup) rights when I was there. I really don’t take anything for granted. I don’t see myself tied to anything or anyone. I love my job. I love doing the Premier League. I love working on the Premier League at NBC.

I think they’ve done an incredible job of raising the profile of this league in this country to something that I don’t think anyone saw coming and certainly not when I joined in 2013. I joined thinking I’ll be here for a few years and go back to England. That would just be a great experience. This has turned into a bit of a juggernaut which I’m incredibly proud of.”

NBC’s Premier League viewers will have a different sound on their game broadcasts this August as Peter Drury was brought in to replace Arlo White as the lead announcer for the package. White had served as the lead play-by-play voice for NBC Sports Group’s Premier League coverage since the network acquired the U.S. media rights. White is now the lead broadcaster for the LIV Golf International Series.

Drury served on commentary this season for CBS Sports’ coverage of the Champions League. He had a long run with ITV Sport as their No. 2 soccer commentator and has recently worked for Amazon Prime Video for its Premier League coverage in the UK as well as BT.

Lowe’s retention gives NBC’s Premier League fans some stability on the high-end talent that has been part of their weekend viewership for the past eight years.

The actor and producer showered Berkoff with more than enough love in honor of her 61st birthday on June 20.

The ""St. Elmo's Fire"" star used social media to celebrate his wife – a move that his followers and fans cannot complain about.

Rob Lowe Is Glad To See His Wife Of Three Decades Turn 61

MEGA

Although Lowe and Berkoff have been married since 1991 after meeting on a blind date in 1983 the pair have remained in love.

Lowe reminded his followers of this love when he uploaded a gorgeous image of his wife through his Instagram account.

In the image the jewelry designer looked straight at the camera with a sultry gaze that one cannot ignore.

For her outfit Berkoff has a black top and jacket which she accessories with neckpieces rings and bracelets. Through the caption Lowe excitedly wrote:

""Happy Birthday to the love of my life. You are the whole package and I am blessed. Here's to many more years of love and fun!""

Fans were quick to drop over 30k likes on the picture before going to the comment section to hype the actor and his wife.

While one said the post was ""so sweet"" another could only hope that her husband would take a cue from Lowe and do the needful.

Many others just wished the 61-year-old celebrant a happy birthday and prayed for her to celebrate more years.

Just before the big birthday shoutout Berkoff praised her man in an Instagram post on Father's Day 2022. The picture showed her man and their two sons Matthew Edward and John Owen posing against a black background.

The trio stares at the camera seriously with their hands folded and a frown. Berkoff's short caption read ""Happy Father's Day to all the Dads!""

As expected her followers gave the post thousands of likes and sent their love to Lowe in the comments.

One fan however noted how ""proud"" the ""Square Dance"" actor looked in the picture and another noted how ageless Lowe is.

The compliment sat well with many especially those who have known the actor since he started his career at 15. Since then the now 58-year-old has featured in numerous movies and produced a handful of projects.

During an interview the actor spoke some more about said career and his life of sobriety.

The Blast reported that when speaking on his life of sobriety the ""About Last Night"" actor said he had had to make a choice that would influence his life in more ways than one. In his words:

""I had the feeling that if I was ever going to be able to make it work with anybody it was Sheryl. Alcohol and drugs were only going to make that next to impossible.""

The makeup artist and the actor have not looked back since then.

The strength of their relationship has caused many to wonder just what they do to keep it going. That question might be answered with the help of The Blast's earlier report.

In January Lowe shared some juicy detail on Gwyneth Paltrow's sex life. The spill came when the actor appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" to talk about his podcast ""Literally! With Rob Lowe.""

Just after Lowe said that he had featured guests like Matthew McConaughey Charles Barkley Kenny Loggins and Paltrow Kimmel laser-focused on the actress.

Lowe deciphered what the host was driving at within seconds so he recalled that the ""Sliding Doors"" actress and his wife had become close when they met on the set of a movie Paltrow's mother Blythe Danner was heading.

One day when Berkoff visited the then 18-year-old on set she gave her a lesson to be remembered forever. Lowe said his wife had taught the green-eyed actress about oral sex.

Paltrow appreciated the move because it meant that Berkoff looked at and treated her like an adult. The actor never heard of this occurrence until recently when Paltrow spilled the tea on his podcast.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21lZXQtY3J5c3RhbC1sb3dlLWFjdHJlc3Mtb2Ytc2lnbmVkLXNlYWxlZC1kZWxpdmVyZWQtb24taGFsbG1hcmsvYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Crystal Lowe: Actress of 'Signed Sealed Delivered' on Hallmark,"Crystal Lowe. Photo Credit: Bettina Strauss Crown Media

Canadian actress Crystal Lowe sat down and chatted during RomaDrama Live! which took place in West Palm Beach Florida from June 24 to 26.

“It feels amazing to be at RomaDrama to be honest” Lowe said. “You never know what to expect when you go to conventions and what it’s going to be like. The fans at RomaDrama are just the sweetest. My ‘POstables’ are top-notch. I have received socks and handmade gifts from them. I am beyond spoiled and loved constantly so it has been really nice.”

Lowe is known for her starring role in the “Signed Sealed Delivered” series on Hallmark where she plays Rita Haywith. “Rita is super sweet and kind. She always sees the best in people but she has a quirky and funny side. She loves to gamble and she will fight to the death to protect her friends” she said with a sweet laugh.

“Rita is also very spontaneous and I love that about her” she added.

Lowe is also a former Scream Queen. “I have died so many different ways to the point where my mom would ask me each time I book a horror film ‘how do you die this time?’ It’s my goal in life to live until the end and that’s what is great about Hallmark” she admitted about the horror movies she has done.

The digital age

On being an actress in the digital age she said “I think it’s great to be honest. I direct too. As a director it is really amazing. You can shoot a movie on an iPhone. The technology lately is incredible cinematic mode is beautiful. We need content and we need to have empathy towards each other and we need to understand one another. This is the time to share experiences and stories in life with the digital platforms.”

She shared that she is in the middle of editing her own film called “Afterglow.” “It is about a former adult film star who doesn’t want to do it anymore but nobody wants to hire her because she was in the industry. She has a daughter and she is fighting. It’s about her controlling her own narrative whatever that may be and taking her power back. It’s a great little story and I have written a pilot that is attached to it” she said.

On the title of the current chapter of her life Lowe said “Embracing Transitions.”

Lowe listed Oscar winner Viola Davis Issa Rae and Mindy Kaling as her dream acting partners in life.

For Lowe the word success means “moving an inch forward.” “I don’t have to move 50000 feet forward. Keep going and eventually you will stop and look back and you will notice how far you’ve come. That way you can appreciate it as you go” she explained.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels.

Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvbWFuLXdoby1yZWNlaXZlZC0xMjVtLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtaHBkLWFycmVzdGVkLWd1bi1jcmltZXMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF3YWlpbmV3c25vdy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9tYW4td2hvLXJlY2VpdmVkLTEyNW0tc2V0dGxlbWVudC1ocGQtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZ3VuLWNyaW1lcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who received $12.5M settlement from HPD arrested for gun crimes,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 38-year-old man getting paid $12.5 million to settle a lawsuit with HPD has been arrested for gun crimes according to Honolulu police.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Thompson Center is in full swing after the building’s developers on Monday officially kicked off the redevelopment project saying it will have an “unbelievable impact” on the Loop and strengthen Chicago’s reputation as a technology hub.

Once complete the building at 100 W. Randolph St. will become Google’s Chicago headquarters and house 2000 employees. The project is expected to be move-in ready by 2026.

The renovation of the center comes at a time of wider transformation for the Loop. Mayor Brandon Johnson announced in April that he was seeking $150 million in tax increment financing for four La Salle Street adaptive reuse projects. The conversions would create more than 1000 new apartments in the city’s Central Business District bringing new use to largely vacant office buildings.

Prime/Capri Interests a joint venture between developers Michael Reschke and Quintin Primo III is completing the $280 million build-to-suit redevelopment under an agreement with Google which intends to purchase the building once renovations are complete. PCI said the makeover is akin to a rebuild.

“When this project is complete this one single building will help lift up the surrounding area” Reschke said. “Not only will it lift up the buildings but it also will lift up ... all the people who work live and visit this area every single day.”

Reschke and Primo were joined by Gov. J.B. Pritzker Johnson and Google’s head of its Chicago operations Karen Sauder along with other Google executives and city and state officials.

Pritzker told Google’s leaders that it’s “an incredible investment both in your future and in ours.”

PCI will restore and modernize the Thompson Center with a new triple-pane glass wrap on the exterior a heightened colonnade three levels of covered terraces and access to green spaces.

The center’s CTA stop at Clark and Lake streets where six lines converge will remain open throughout construction. Google previously said passengers on those lines could expect a “new and improved CTA experience” though it hasn’t been made clear what that will look like.

Carbon-free energy

In 2022 Pritzker announced that the center traded hands inking a deal with Google in “a sale that has eluded State government for decades” according to a news release at the time. The state working out terms with developer Reschke sold it to Google for $105 million and then paid $75 million for 115 S. La Salle St. formerly the BMO Harris Bank building where the state moved its offices from the Thompson Center.

Construction at the 1.2 million-square-foot center started a month ago when Clark Construction placed equipment on the site and protective fencing was installed around the building’s perimeter and outdoor plaza. On Thursday construction crews could be seen tearing off the lower exterior of the building and a portion of the atrium.

The 38-year-old state government building has long garnered mixed reactions. Over the course of its existence three governors wanted the center demolished because of its age and high maintenance costs. State officials have said it costs $17 million a year to operate the building.

But pricey maintenance costs are expected to change through PCI’s redevelopment efforts. The developer is pursuing LEED Platinum status — the highest level of LEED certification — and transitioning the building to all electric. The Thompson Center’s internal systems will be replaced along with its heating and cooling systems to better handle Chicago’s climate. The glass facade which will bring a modern touch and higher visibility will also double as a way to improve the building’s thermal performance.

Efforts to make the center a green building are in line with Google’s goal to use 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“With the Thompson Center we saw a chance to revitalize the Loop but also take this iconic building that some thought of tearing down and instead make the renovations necessary to respectfully steward it into the 21st century” Sauder said.

Designed by Chicago architect Helmut Jahn the building opened in 1985 as the State of Illinois Center. It’s become recognizable for its 17-story atrium and the 29-foot tall “Monument with Standing Beast” sculpture. The sculpture nicknamed “Snoopy in a Blender” was removed last week and will be kept at a state facility until it’s moved to the Art Institute of Chicago.

Jahn’s namesake architecture firm is leading the redesign.

Johnson said Google’s investment proves Chicago is globally connected and a world-class hub for innovation. From 2022 to 2023 Chicago saw 32 new office openings.

“Chicago is the place to be” Johnson said.

Declaring that he was a proud Chinese citizen who loved his country and the city Cheung on Sunday argued that the phrase should not be banned just because it was once used by people who “made mistakes”.

In the 21-second message he recorded for CCTV to mark the 25th anniversary of the city’s handover to Chinese rule Cheung said: “Hong Kong has experienced a lot with ups and downs in the past 25 years. I grew up with this city. I was born and grew up here. I still believe in this city still hoping that it will become a better one. Add oil Hong Kong.”

The phrase of encouragement which roughly translates as “Keep it up” was widely heard during the social unrest three years ago.

Its majestic mountain peaks hot springs cool summers and snowy winters are pretty legendary.

What you may not know though is how few points-friendly hotels there are in the area.

While points hotels are not the be- all end-all of travel if you are trying to stretch your vacation dollars their absence can present a bit of a logistical challenge.

We can't wave a magic wand and wish into existence some great Banff properties where you can use your hotel points but we can tell you about one property in nearby Kananaskis that might not have been on your radar: Kananaskis Mountain Lodge.

Part of Marriott's Autograph Collection this points-friendly property is surrounded by natural beauty. But is it a worthwhile alternative to Accor's Fairmont Banff Springs a better-known (and far pricier) points option in Banff?

Here's what to know about Kananaskis Mountain Lodge Autograph Collection before you book a stay.

You're an hour from Banff but still in a beautiful setting

Kananaskis Mountain Lodge also known as the Pomeroy is not actually in Banff. As its name suggests it's instead in Kananaskis Country an area about halfway between Banff and Calgary.

Because the property is roughly an hour from both destinations it's fairly easy to reach while still being remote enough to feel like you are really in the Canadian Rockies.

Given the lodge's location it's a great jumping-off point for exploring all that Banff has to offer — but know that Kananaskis is worth checking out too. It's not as built up as Banff but it still offers its fair share of outdoor activities (think: horseback riding hiking skiing and more) plus a few shops and eateries.

There's a huge Nordic spa

A major advantage to staying here is the property's proximity to Kananaskis Nordic Spa. Open every day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. this epic Nordic spa complex features more than 50000 square feet of hot and cold pools.

While access to the on-site facility isn't complimentary for hotel guests there are some ""stay and soak"" discounts you can take advantage of when you visit. Instead of paying $119 or $129 per person (depending on which date you visit) hotel guests can visit for just $69 between 6 and 9 p.m. An additional $10 discount is available if you have Gold Elite status or higher in the Marriott Bonvoy program.

You'll find a mini indoor water park

While many properties have pools Kananaskis Mountain Lodge dials up the fun by offering a small indoor water park. Best of all it's open late (from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily) and doesn't cost a penny extra for guests to access ... sort of. More on that later.

If I was a kid the pool would have made me lose my mind ... in a good way. It's not massive by any means but it has multiple waterslides a waterfall and a splash area. There's also a large hot tub that sits partly inside and partly outside so you can get some fresh air without having to get out of the water.

Family-friendly rooms are plentiful

Our stay here was during a multigenerational family trip with my parents and my kids so one standard hotel room wasn't going to work.

Luckily we didn't have to pay double the amount to book two rooms like we normally would have had to do as there were a couple of family-friendly room types available. While they cost more than a standard room they still are cheaper than what you'd spend on two standard rooms.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

For a two-bedroom Family Room which comes with one king- and two queen-size beds like the one we reserved expect to pay between 511 Canadian dollars (about $394) and CA$843 (roughly $650) per night (taxes included) this summer.

While the lack of a second bathroom was certainly a downside especially since the door on the only bathroom didn't seem to lock we found the space more than adequate for our family. It's great to have the option to book a room that can sleep up to six people at a cost that is often about 50% less than it would be to reserve two standard rooms with points or cash.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Should you still decide two standard rooms are the way to go know that the points rates are reasonable. Rates hover between 45000 and 60000 Bonvoy points per night depending on the dates you choose. That means you can apply 50000-point free night certificates to your stay though you may need to top off your certificates with some extra points.

Right now the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card is offering the chance to earn three Free Night Awards (each night valued up to 50000 points) after spending $3000 in the first three months of account opening. Certain hotels have resort fees.

Some extra fees apply

My family loved the property's water park and nightly s'mores but know that there's a catch to these seemingly free amenities.

Despite appearing free on the surface they're actually inclusions factored into the hotel's resort fee. With that CA$25 (about $19) per night (plus taxes) resort fee you can also use select sports equipment borrow board games and access other facilities like the fitness center and game room but you'll be on the hook for this pesky fee whether you plan to take advantage of these perks or not.

You'll also have to pay CA$22 (approximately $17) per night if you plan on parking on-site. However if you park in the nearby public village parking area like we did you can avoid this charge.

A CA$15 (roughly $12) daily fee for the area's Kananaskis Conservation Pass is technically required when you visit or stay in Kananaskis Country too though the spot to buy the pass was closed when we arrived so we accidentally missed paying that fee. Know that you'll pay a similar fee if and when you visit Banff as well.

The food is tasty

Even though the lodge is in a pretty remote location where you might wonder about the quality of the food options we were pleasantly surprised by the hotel's cuisine. Since there weren't a ton of places to choose from near the hotel we ended up enjoying a few meals on-site.

Because I have Platinum Elite status I opted for free daily breakfast as my check-in amenity. That turned out to be a solid selection. It included either room service or full breakfast for two in Forte Restaurant's dining room.

We went for a takeaway option choosing French toast and eggs with bacon toast and potatoes (plus coffee and orange juice). All of it was free thanks to my elite status. Not to mention it was delicious and plenty to share with my family.

Along with in-room dining and Forte there are the grab-and-go Market Cafe the Cedar Room (a Canadian chophouse) and Blacktail Bar which was a lively lunch and evening bar spot located just off the hotel lobby.

Bottom line

Although Kananaskis Mountain Lodge isn't right in Banff and could benefit from some deep cleaning and updating in a couple of spots it is a relatively stylish property that provides all the essentials.

Sure it isn't as upscale as the Fairmont Banff Springs (which my family also enjoyed staying at this trip) but it's far more affordable and just as memorable to visit.

CHINA DAILY

The Ritz-Carlton Tianjin announced its cooperation with Chinese block game developer Tang Lock in June another co-branding move after its partnership with luxury Chinese jewelry brand Qeelin early this year.

The efforts involving the integration of immersive Chinese culture have attracted new visitors signaling the hotel's strong confidence in recovery amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hector Busto general manager of The Ritz-Carlton Tianjin

""The challenges of the epidemic started early this year and brought many restrictions that affected our business compared with 2021"" said Hector Busto general manager of The Ritz-Carlton Tianjin and The Ritz-Carlton Executive Residences Tianjin who took up the post in 2021.

""However after the slowdown we are seeing a resurgence in the city bringing a lot of hope to the hotel business. After Beijing and Shanghai's recovery we saw a fast ramp-up in the market"" he said. ""Although the hospitality industry in China has been impacted the development of this industry is progressing. We are extremely optimistic that new opportunities and developments will arrive quickly.""

The hotel's partnership with the emerging brands－most of which were infused with rich Chinese history and culture－has won popularity among its visitors.

""The presence of Qeelin's elegantly and gracefully designed jewelry in the hotel's afternoon tea program has become the top seller for the lobby lounge this year"" he noted.

Some netizens broadcast their enjoyable afternoon tea moments on streaming platforms including Douyin whose international version is known as TikTok.

Tang Lock a block constructing game brand originating from China hit the market with products featuring typical Chinese cultural elements such as the Luban Lock and Nine Color Deer. Its spaceship series was inspired by China's achievements in space exploration.

""Differentiated from other block games it is about the construction to show the wisdom of ancient Chinese and we expect the educational program could boost the children's room experience"" Busto said.

In addition the hotel has never ceased its efforts in boosting Western styles.

French perfume brand Juliette which is expected to be introduced to the hotel in July will enliven the experience from afternoon tea to room packages and spa experiences according to the hotel.

The Lululemon project aimed at helping people find inner peace will be expanded with more activities including Songbo Healing or Asian singing bowl healing.

Apart from the co-branding efforts amid the pandemic the hotel has found a new customer base－Bleisure travelers. They not only stay for business but also explore the city like other guests.

""This encouraged the hotel to provide more genuine care and outstanding service to make these guests feel at home while away from home"" Busto said.

In addition the hotel also gives job seekers a great opportunity. ""A total of 33 percent of internships have received a full-time contract. This is a large number and indicates our positive attitude toward the hospitality industry"" the general manager noted.

""My suggestion to the young generations who are looking at the hospitality industry with passion is to have a positive attitude toward this business look for excellence on a daily basis develop clear communication skills and set midterm and long-term personal expectations"" he said.

Hailing from Spain Busto worked in the food and beverage industry in Europe for five years prior to joining Marriott International.

He started his journey with Marriott International at the iconic Hotel Arts Barcelona and then moved to The Ritz-Carlton Tokyo seven years later.

In 2019 he was promoted as director of luxury openings operations for the Asia-Pacific region and helped to open more than 20 new luxury hotels across the globe receiving many awards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZiMTAxLmNvbS9hdGxhbnRhLW1hcnJpb3R0LW5vcnRod2VzdC11bnZlaWxzLWJyYW5kLW5ldy1ldmVudC1zcGFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Marriott Northwest Unveils Brand New Event Space,"Just in time for the broadscale return to in-person meetings and conferences Dimension Hospitality presents Cobb County’s second largest hotel ballroom at the Atlanta Marriott Northwest at Galleria.

According to the Head of Payment at MEXC Global Anthony Guo the decision is because they want to simplify and create a “connected user experience”.

“By enabling crypto purchase through Visa and MasterCard directly MEXC Global is delivering a faster simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier for users to convert fiat into crypto assets which opens up the ownership of cryptocurrency to millions of people where bank card is the dominant medium of transaction.”

MEXC Global is actively opening up more channels for fiat holders to acquire their favorite crypto assets using an easy-to-use and familiar payment method they are comfortable with. Despite the explosion of crypto and blockchain-enabled payment and remittance ramps Visa MasterCard and other traditional payment options are used by fiat holders spread across the globe.

These payment processors have refined their operations over the years. Notably they have a more robust global network of partners primarily financial institutions. On the other hand crypto solutions are still being developed and lagging. MEXC Global is filling this gap by linking the crypto and fiat worlds to fast-track the adoption of digital assets. This specifically considers the massive cost benefits associated with digital asset infrastructure.

MEXC Global and its newfound partners MasterCard and Visa realize what’s at stake. They are now committing to driving crypto adoption in a win-win arrangement. While MEXC Global will increase its user base and Visa and MasterCard profit from fees end-users on the other hand can quickly shuttle between the fiat and crypto worlds without necessarily learning or familiarizing themselves with complex systems.

The partnership follows the successful launch of the Global Bank Transfer Program that allows MEXC Global clients in Europe and the U.S. to deposit and withdraw using SWIFT and FedWire networks. Users who purchase crypto through the program also don’t pay trading fees.

MEXC Global has also launched an OTC payment service and activated P2P trading. Moreover clients can use approved third-party portals like Simplex and Banxa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kvMjAyMi9jcnlwdG8tZXhjaGFuZ2UtbWV4Yy1nbG9iYWwtdG8tYWNjZXB0LXZpc2EtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crypto Exchange MEXC Global to Accept Visa Mastercard,"MEXC Global has begun letting customers directly buy cryptocurrencies with Mastercard and Visa according to updates posted on the exchange’s website in June.

“Users can now enjoy a user-friendly experience and purchase crypto with one of the lowest payment fees and success rate. In addition the instant transaction offers both speed and convenience to users” the company said in its update.

MEXC Global stated in a post on its Telegram account that the cryptocurrency purchases with Visa and Mastercard will be possible in 180 countries with a cap of $5000.

Anthony Guo head of payment at MEXC Global said in a news release that company took the step of allowing Visa and Mastercard purchases to simplify transactions for customers.

According to the Head of Payment at MEXC Global Anthony Guo the decision is because they want to simplify and create a “connected user experience”.

“By enabling crypto purchase through Visa and MasterCard directly MEXC Global is delivering a faster simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier for users to convert fiat into crypto assets which opens up the ownership of cryptocurrency to millions of people where bank card is the dominant medium of transaction.”

MEXC Global is actively opening up more channels for fiat holders to acquire their favorite crypto assets using an easy-to-use and familiar payment method they are comfortable with. Despite the explosion of crypto and blockchain-enabled payment and remittance ramps Visa MasterCard and other traditional payment options are used by fiat holders spread across the globe.

These payment processors have refined their operations over the years. Notably they have a more robust global network of partners primarily financial institutions. On the other hand crypto solutions are still being developed and lagging. MEXC Global is filling this gap by linking the crypto and fiat worlds to fast-track the adoption of digital assets. This specifically considers the massive cost benefits associated with digital asset infrastructure.

MEXC Global and its newfound partners MasterCard and Visa realize what’s at stake. They are now committing to driving crypto adoption in a win-win arrangement. While MEXC Global will increase its user base and Visa and MasterCard profit from fees end-users on the other hand can quickly shuttle between the fiat and crypto worlds without necessarily learning or familiarizing themselves with complex systems.

The partnership follows the successful launch of the Global Bank Transfer Program that allows MEXC Global clients in Europe and the U.S. to deposit and withdraw using SWIFT and FedWire networks. Users who purchase crypto through the program also don’t pay trading fees.

MEXC Global has also launched an OTC payment service and activated P2P trading.

Only one team from the Wild Rift Champions Southeast Asia (WCS) remain at the Wild Rift Icons Global Championship after the quarterfinals of the Knockout stage concluded on Saturday (2 July).

Vietnamese powerhouse and WCS first seed Team Flash secured a semifinals slot after an upset 3-0 sweep against China's Wild Rift League (WRL) second seed JD Gaming.

Meanwhile WCS second seed from Taiwan Flash Wolves were eliminated after losing to WRL fourth seed J Team 3-1.

Team Flash started the competition with a direct entry into the Group Stage. The Vietnamese team swept T1 2-0 in the opening match of Group A. They then struggled in the Group A Winner’s Match getting swept by Nova Esports 2-0.

However Team Flash bounced back strong in the Decider match of Group A where they swept South Korean team T1 once again to secure a spot in the Knockout Stage.

Team Flash succeeded in doing what the other WCS teams were unable to: defeat a Chinese team.

The Vietnamese powerhouse soundly swept WRL's second seed JD Gaming in a 3-0 rout. Here's how that series went:

In the series opener Team Flash struggled in the laning phase with JDG taking first blood against Team Flash’s Đỗ ""Elly"" Thành Đạt.

Team Flash however traded two more kills but JDG took the upper hand in that early team fight.

JDG continued to increase their gold lead by three thousand after taking down a couple of turrets and bullying them from other map objectives.

Team Flash patiently played defensively waiting for Nguyễn ""Zysu"" Phat to come online with his late-game Jax pick.

After finding an opportunity Team Flash fought back in a fight at the Dragon pit with Zysu dealing lots of damage allowing his team to take out JDG’s jungler Zhang ""Xingdou"" Wenming and stop JDG’s gold lead from snowballing.

As both teams grouped up at the Baron pit Phạm ""Coyote"" Bình found a backdoor opening in the top lane with his Jayce pick on a Hullbreaker item destroying the Nexus of JDG and giving Team Flash the game one win in 20 minutes despite an 8-10 kill deficit.

In game two JDG tried to stop Coyote’s Zed pick from gaining a gold lead taking first blood and trying to pick him off in the side lanes while destroying the outer turrets of Team Flash gaining a small gold lead in the process.

However Zysu took advantage of JDG being scattered in the jungle pushing them away and taking two kills in the process.

And with Zysu’s Jax terrorizing the members of JDG and Coyote’s Zed pick split pushing and rejoining team fights to get through JDG’s back line Team Flash continued to outplay JDG team fight after team fight.

And after a 20-minute game (and far too many pauses) Team Flash destroyed JDG’s base to win game two with a 16-2 kill lead.

With their tournament lives and reputation on the line JDG switched up their tempo and team composition to try to outplay Team Flash.

The Chinese team went with a high-damage Corki-Ziggs combination along with Lee Sin who could break team fights while Team Flash gambled on a late-game composition.

For JDGm the plan was simple — prioritize demolishing the top lane and killing members of Team Flash in the process.

With Xingdou’s Lee Sin snowballing Team Flash struggled against JDG’s early game aggression.

But the Vietnamese found an answer to this by slowing down JDG in the Dragon pit with Elly’s Morgana pick and Coyote’s Jayce pick and Zysu on Kha’zix forcing JDG to retreat from the Dragon.

In a teamfight at the top lane JDG pushed forward thinking they could win but the Vietnamese rotated around with their combinations until only Nguyễn ""Shy"" Khanh remained finishing off JDG with an Ace.

Team Flash were then able to take all the map objectives and barreled down JDG’s turrets.

And after a 19-minute encounter and a 17-11 kill lead Team Flash did what was previously thought impossible at Icons — sweeping JDG and advancing to the semifinals.

Team Flash's next match up will be in the semifinals where they will face J Team in a best-of-five series on Friday (8 July).

Yahoo Esports SEA also caught up with some members of Team Flash in the post-match interview with Zysu commenting on the result saying ""Last night we thought we were going to win 3-1 against JDG and today we won 3-0 so it’s kind of surprising for me as well.""

He added that the team were able to outplay JDG’s aggression in the third game because ""we were able to stick to our plan and follow it"".

Coyote said that a factor to their win was that they had everything planned before the match.

The player was repeatedly highlighted as one of the players that helped win this series especially with his Zed pick in the mid lane popping off in the second game.

“We were able to follow our strategy and win the game[s] one by one” said Coyote. “I think my Zed was effective because I have [my teammates’] trust so I [was able] to do my best.”

Phạm “Joyce” Quốc Thắng substitute jungler of Team Flash also thanked the team's management who had helped by giving the team encouragement ahead of their clash.

""Before our match against JDG our boss came down to our hotel and gave a pep talk and a great conversation…so it really boost[ed] our mentality"" said Joyce.

Meanwhile Shy admitted that while they won today they didn't really have a specific strategy against J Team just yet.

""We will work on our mistakes from our gameplay. So after this… we will start scrimming and preparing for the semifinals match"" Shy said.

Team Flash also continued to ask for the support of Southeast Asia fans adding that they would do their best in the next match against J Team.

Meanwhile Flash Wolves and JDG bow out of the competition in 5th-8th place taking home US $80000 in consolation.

RRQ were also eliminated in the quarterfinals the day before (1 July) making Team Flash the only WCS team and the only non-WRL team to make it to the semifinals.

The winners in the semifinals will play against each other in a best-of-seven in the finals on Saturday (9 July).

Hosted by Honduras the tournament not only handed out four berths for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Indonesia (to the four semifinalists) but it will also determined the two teams that will participate in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris (the two finalists).

The USA defending champions of this competition after winning the most recent edition held in 2018 became the first team to clinch a semifinal berth and a ticket to the 2023 World Cup. Honduras joined them but the Americans came away with the spot in the 2024 Olympics after a 3-0 win over Los Catrachos in the semifinals.

The other two semifinalists were surprise packages: the Dominican Republic will be heading to their first FIFA World Cup while Guatemala qualified to their second. The Dominican Republic also claimed the other ticket to the 2024 Olympics in Paris making their first Olympic tournament appearance in the program's history.

What's at stake at CONCACAF U20 Championship 2022

This tournament doubles as the CONCACAF qualification event for both the 2023 FIFA men's Under-20 World Cup and the 2024 Summer Olympics.

CONCACAF will send two participants to the 2024 Summer Olympics and four participants to the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

The total number of qualifiers for each event makes things straightforward: The four semifinalists of the 2022 CONCACAF U-20 Championship will head to the World Cup in 2023 and the two finalists will be the only two nations to play in the Olympics the following year in Paris.

Why the U-20 championship will determine Olympic qualification

Previously CONCACAF held a separate U-23 tournament dedicated to determine Olympic qualification and it took place in March prior to the start of the Summer Olympics. That competition involved Under-23 players because Olympic soccer is an Under-23 tournament (so as not to compete with the popular FIFA World Cup).

Often since that tournament did not fall within an official FIFA international match window players were not released by their clubs resulting in weakened teams and surprise results. For players who were not necessarily prevented from traveling by their club it still forced them to choose between club or country resulting in difficult decisions.

The event couldn't simply be moved to the summer after the European season because there were players who featured in leagues that played through the summer like MLS which is on a February to November schedule.

To alleviate the scheduling conflict CONCACAF scrapped its Olympic qualifying event for Under-23 players and instead folded it into the Under-20 Championship tournament. The fact that the Under-20 competition involves younger players than the Under-23 tournament makes it more likely that players are permitted to participate by their clubs since the younger age group is less likely to have prominent playing roles with their clubs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc2VyaWVzL3ZpdGFsaXR5LWJsYXN0LTIwMjItMTI5NzY1Ny9zdXNzZXgtdnMtaGFtcHNoaXJlLXNvdXRoLWdyb3VwLTEyOTc5MTYvbWF0Y2gtcmVwb3J00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hampshire warm up for quarter-finals with ninth win in ten matches,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.espncricinfo.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Eric Holcomb has locked in its two candidates according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

Sen. Mike Braun who chose not to run for reelection to the Senate and instead opted to run for governor is projected by the NBC News Decision Desk to beat a crowded field of Republican contenders including Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch.

Braun’s focus during the campaign was on improving economic opportunity within the state citing his experience as a small business owner. He also campaigned on protecting the rights of parents in making decisions related to education and on making healthcare more affordable through increased transparency according to his campaign website.

Democratic candidate Dr. Jennifer McCormick the state’s former superintendent of public instruction ran uncontested in the primary and was projected as the winner shortly after polls closed in northwest Indiana according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

McCormick received her doctorate in education from Indiana State University. She is running on a platform that includes increased investment in public education protection of reproductive rights and finding unique solutions to eliminate wasteful spending while not eliminating key programs according to her campaign website.

McCormick was endorsed prior to the election by the American Federation for Teachers’ Indiana chapter the Indiana State Teachers Association and several other groups.

Braun and McCormick will face off in the general election this fall. Holcomb was unable to seek reelection due to term limits imposed in the state but won his 2020 reelection campaign decisively.

The state has not had a Democratic governor since Joe Kernan took over for Frank O’Bannon following his death in 2003.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L3N0ZWVsZXJzLXJvb2tpZS1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stc3RhcnRpbmctcmlnaHQtZ3VhcmQtMjAyNC1qYW1lcy1kYW5pZWxzLXRyYWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

The annual letter-writing campaign is organized by the Northwestern chapters of the Society of Women Engineers the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers.

Current McCormick students write the letters in the spring and Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Ellen Worsdall the faculty advisor for SWE SHPE and NSBE mails out the letters to women Hispanic and Black engineering students over the summer.

Worsdall said 38% of McCormick class of 2026 were women and over a third were from underrepresented communities. The goal of the letters is to build community especially within underrepresented demographics in engineering Worsdall said.

McCormick freshman and SWE Mentorship Director Kayla Youhanaie said she loved receiving her letter.

“(The letter) showed me that (SWE) is very active and they care a lot about their club members” Youhanaie said. “I instantly got involved when I first got here.”

SWE hosted a letter-writing event in the Technological Institute on April 30 where colored paper and markers were provided.

“We write individual handwritten notes to every student” Youhanaie said. “We like making them feel like somebody’s thinking about them.”

On Friday SHPE also held a letter-writing event in the Ford Center where they encouraged letter-writers to include introductions to SHPE and its values as an organization give advice and make the recipient excited about coming to NU.

McCormick freshman and SHPE Mentorship Chair Gisela Martinez said she hopes to build relationships between mentors and mentees in SHPE during Fall Quarter. The letters are a first step she said.

SHPE letter-writers are encouraged to leave their contact info on the letters Martinez said in hopes that this will begin to build mentorship relationships.

“I wish to give back to my community and become a mentor even if it’s through a small thing such as a letter” Martinez said.

NSBE will be holding a letter-writing event on Friday in Ford.

Prior to receiving her letter McCormick freshmen Jocelyn Luevanos said she was nervous about going to an engineering school.

Luevanos later participated in both SWE and SHPE letter-writing events because she remembered how the letters impacted her.

“It came to my house and I was like ‘Oh my gosh I got a SWE letter’” Luevanos said. “Even though you’ve already been accepted you still don’t feel like you’re really part of the NU community. (The letter) gets you excited to go to college and helps ease some of that anxiety.”

Anthony Heredia 19 told investigators that employees of the McDonald’s at 4334 W. 26th St. called that day and asked him to come to the restaurant after the employees recognized the girl Tierra Franklin from an altercation at the restaurant the previous week prosecutors said in court Sunday.

When Heredia arrived the employees told him everything was fine and he waited in the ’s parking lot while Franklin and her family got food inside according to prosecutors.

When Franklin walked up to a drive-thru window and threw a cup of water inside splashing an employee Heredia pulled a gun and fired twice at her as she ran back to a car prosecutors said.

Franklin was struck in the back about 3 p.m. and taken to St. Anthony Hospital by her family where she was pronounced dead the Chicago police said.

Employees at the McDonald’s declined to talk with a reporter Sunday. A request for comment with a spokesman for the McDonald’s Corp. was not returned.

Family members told ABC7 Franklin was headed into her senior year at Curie High School and dreamed of becoming a lawyer.

After the shooting a surveillance camera recorded Heredia returning to the parking lot and picking up a shell casing and investigators later matched another shell casing recovered at the scene with a shell casing found in Heredia’s pocket when he was arrested a short time later prosecutors said.

Charged with first-degree murder and unlawful use of a weapon Heredia was ordered held without bail Sunday.

Only one has a solution,"Not good for you? (A screenshot from a McDonald's ad) A screenshot from a McDonald's ad

You've changed so businesses have tried to change too.

They adjusted to your new ways during the pandemic. They're still trying to adjust to the different ways you're behaving as the pandemic becomes one of life's constant presences.

It doesn't always go so smoothly.

The fast food business is fascinating in so many ways but the sudden preference for drive thru and delivery over actually eating in a Burger King or McDonald's has caused fast food companies considerable heartburn.

Just as McDonald's and friends were experimenting with robot ordering at the drive thru so those very drive thrus were becoming clogged like ailing hearts.

Not so long ago I mentioned a Chick-fil-A in Santa Barbara California. It had become so popular that the local council was ready to declare it a public nuisance. No not because fried chicken is bad for you but because it was causing enormous traffic jams on the city's State Street.

There seemed no way for any technology to fix it. Even though I suggested that a few alerts via Waze and Google Maps could have helped. Sample: ""You really want Chick-fil-A? Well it's going to take you another 67 minutes to get it. Do you really need it?""

Instead Chick-fil-A chose curiously analog solutions such as signs discouraging cars at the drive thru from reversing back into the street security guards to enforce what the signs were saying upgrading the kitchens and even oh yes communicating with customers about the problem.

Astonishingly this actually worked as Chick-fil-A and the local council have concluded that the traffic issue had largely dissipated. So no more threats of a public nuisance order.

Perhaps then Chick-fil-A might have some hints for its fellow fast fooders at McDonald's.

A particular McDonald's that is. This one is in the Cremorne suburb of Sydney Australia. Its drive thru has become very popular too during and after the pandemic.

Naturally McDonald's thought it an idea to build a second drive thru lane. Naturally there was local opposition.

No not because Big Macs aren't good for you. Wait yes because Big Macs aren't good for you.

McDonald's insisted there would be no deleterious effect on traffic. Local functionaries from the Northern Sydney Local Health District tried to drive through that argument. They claimed there hadn't been sufficient analysis of the potential problems.

They did though have another far more emotive objection. They insisted the local population was already overly large and could live without another McDonald's drive thru lane.

As Australia's news.com reported the health department offered: ""There is also a concern that increasing accessibility to fast food via an expanded drive thru may negatively influence the eating habits of children and adults and undermine existing population health strategies to tackle obesity.""

Some may worry that a single additional drive thru lane may not have too much influence on obesity levels. The craving for fast food encompasses a vast range of elements such as speed cost convenience and the fact that some of it does actually taste good.

There are plenty of options.

You may feel indeed that the local health authority just really really doesn't want this additional lane.

It insisted that a community health center opposite the Cremorne McDonald's might suffer from fewer local parking spots as the new drive thru lane would reduce the number of spots at the McDonald's.

So now the burger chain has something of a problem. Will it do what Chick-fil-A did and work with the local authorities?

Or will it find some other more dastardly way of getting its new drive thru lane built?

I'm sure McDonald's has already performed due and fast diligence. It seems for example that obesity rates in Cremorne stood at a (relatively) mere 19% in 2020 as compared to the average in the state suburbs of 33%.

But these things can be complex. What happened in 2021 when everyone was going to the drive thru?

I fear this could be a long affair.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMizAFodHRwczovL2thdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL2FzaWFuLW1hbi1raWNrZWQtc3BhdC1vbi1hdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtZHJpdmUtdGhydS1ieS1mZWxsb3ctY3VzdG9tZXItc2hhbmctd2FuZy1icmFuZG9uLXN0b3JtLXJvY2t2aWxsZS1tYXJ5bGFuZC1mYXN0LWZvb2QtYXNzYXVsdC1yYWNpc20tY2hpbmVzZS1tb250Z29tZXJ5LWNvdW50eS1wb2xpY2XSAdABaHR0cHM6Ly9rYXR2LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvYXNpYW4tbWFuLWtpY2tlZC1zcGF0LW9uLWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1kcml2ZS10aHJ1LWJ5LWZlbGxvdy1jdXN0b21lci1zaGFuZy13YW5nLWJyYW5kb24tc3Rvcm0tcm9ja3ZpbGxlLW1hcnlsYW5kLWZhc3QtZm9vZC1hc3NhdWx0LXJhY2lzbS1jaGluZXNlLW1vbnRnb21lcnktY291bnR5LXBvbGljZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asian man says he was kicked spat on at McDonald's drive-thru by fellow customer,"Shang Wang drove to a in to order a soda before running a few errands. he left with spit residue on his cheek and bruises on his legs.

Wang said he arrived at the fast-food restaurant located along the 1300 block of Rockville Pike in Rockville shortly before noon. He said he passed by a red Nissan SUV that was idling and consequently blocking the main drive-thru lane.



It seemed like he was on the phone. So I just drove around him and went and ordered my drink"" Wang told WJLA. ""I didn't think anything of it and then I heard honking just constant honking behind me.""

Wang who emigrated from Taiwan in 1977 and grew up in Fairfax County said he was confused by the loud noise.

And then I hear these racial comments. 'Go back to China! Hey you Chinese MF'er!' And I look up this guy is at my window and he spits through my window and the spit lands on my face"" Wang said.

Wang exited his vehicle and confronted the alleged attacker identified in a report as Brandon Storm 54 of Rockville.

As soon as I get out he actually starts kicking me and he starts spitting at me some more"" Wang said. ""And instead of fighting back I just took it. I felt like if I had retaliated I would have been charged.""

Wang said he called 911 with his cell phone as Storm hurled more anti-Asian insults and kicked him around the ankles and legs. By the time police arrived however Storm had already fled from the McDonald's property.

According to Montgomery County Police officers watched McDonald's surveillance video and recognized Storm from previous encounters. The officers noted that the surveillance video corroborated Wang's account.

The police report described Storm as being in a ""fit of rage.""

I felt very violated"" said Wang who added that he'd never interacted with Storm prior to that day. ""What are you supposed to do when someone starts spitting at you with these racial taunts? He even said he was going to come to my house and rape my wife and kids. I wasn't too worried though because I'm not married and I don't have any kids.""

WJLA located Storm Tuesday evening at Auto Wholesalers of Rockville where he works. The 54-year-old quickly burst into an expletive-laden barrage of insults.

""F*** you and the news media. Put me on. F*** news media. Loser get the f*** out of here"" Storm told a WJLA reporter.

WJLA proceeded to ask Storm if he spat at and directed racial slurs toward Wang at McDonald's a few days earlier.



""Come to the court. I'll see you guys in court"" Storm responded with a chuckle.

Police identified two eyewitnesses to the incident including McDonald's drive-thru cashier Syed Chishty.

I've worked at this McDonald's for almost five years now. I usually just do the weekends but I've never seen something like this wild"" Chishty told WJLA.

Chishty described the fast-food restaurant as busy at the time of the drive-thru assault. He vividly recalled seeing Storm approach Wang's vehicle and then spit in his face.

""A lot of people might not care if someone jumped in front of them but that guy felt offended and that's what caused him to spit in his face and it escalated from there... I think the whole spitting-in-the-face thing was so unnecessary"" she said.

Chishty identified Wang as a regular customer.

He always just comes around to get a large Diet Coke with extra ice and goes about his business. He's always been nice to me. I think he just wanted to get his soda and leave"" she added.

The second eyewitness — a retired school teacher who was eating food in her car at the time of the alleged assault — did not return a phone call from WJLA seeking comment.

Montgomery County Police said they have not classified the case as a hate crime because no one aside from Wang heard the racial remarks.

I can't comment on his mental frame but I do know the words that came out of his mouth"" Wang said. ""I think that he got mad that I passed him in line but then I think once he saw that I was Asian it just drove him crazy because the first thing that he said to me was the racial slants.""

Wang said he has experienced anti-Asian racism before but nothing to this extent. He shared that his main takeaway is people ought to treat one another with more kindness and respect.

I just got to trust the process that Rockville Montgomery County Police will do their job and duty. There are witnesses. There are surveillance videos. So you know I hope something gets done"" Wang said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4eHYuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvY2hpY2stZmlsLWEtcmFua3Mtbm8tMS1pbi1jdXN0b21lci1zZXJ2aWNlLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1mYWxscy10by1sYXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chick-fil-A ranks No. 1 in customer service McDonald's falls to last,"COLLEGE STATION Texas — America has spoken and they want more Chick-fil-A!

Indeed the chicken chain has ranked No. 1 for the 8th consecutive year in customer service - beating out even its popular sit-down competitors.

According to a recent poll by the American Customer Satisfaction Index Chick-fil-A leads all restaurants in customer service with a score of 83.

The average score was determined at 76 with McDonald's scoring the lowest across any brand.

Ranking in last place with a score of 68 - the burger chain saw a drop of 3 percentage points since the last survey.

The organization said 20143 customers were chosen at random and contacted by email to participate in the survey.

However the survey also showed that across the board consumers still prefer full traditional sit-down restaurants.

Tied for the top spot in this category were both the Longhorn Steakhouse and Texas Roadhouse their scores remaining unchanged at 80.

Taking the last place spot however was another tie this time between Applebee's and IHOP which both scored a 73 respectively.

In general full traditional sit-down restaurants still outranked fast food in multiple categories including cleanliness food quality and overall friendliness.

McDonald’s has been left in a pickle after being hit by ingredient shortages at several of its outlets.

It comes 10 months after the fast-food giant halted sales of milkshakes and bottled drinks nationwide which at the time was blamed on Brexit the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent shortage of lorry drivers.

But fears that other cult favourites will be struck from the menu have been reignited recently as signs began popping up in some McDonald’s branches.

One notice pasted on the counter at McDonald’s on the King’s Road Chelsea south London reads: “Due to supply chain challenges some menu items may be served with some ingredients missing and others may be temporarily unavailable.

“We apologise in advance to any customers impacted and thank you for your patience.”

A spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “Like most retailers we are currently experiencing pressures across our supply chain which at times may impact a small number of our menu items at certain restaurants.

“We apologise for any inconvenience and thank our customers for their patience. We are working hard to resolve the issues as quickly as possible.”

It comes as food prices are set to soar this summer with the spiralling rate of inflation potentially lasting into the middle of next year according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD).

In a report published last month it predicted prices will rise by 15 per cent in the coming months as people pay more for household staples such as meat cereal dairy fruit and vegetable products.

Food items that rely on wheat – such as bread poultry and pork – could see the most rapid price rises in the summer or autumn the IGD said.

These household staples are likely to be the worst affected because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since the countries are both major global grain producers.

The report warned the price hike could see more people skipping meals as it predicted the average monthly groceries bill for a family of four could reach £439 in January next year up from £396 in the same month this year."

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

Vyjuvek is a topical gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa an inherited disorder causes painful blisters and persistent wounds.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO Calif. May 07 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytomX Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: CTMX) a leader in the field of masked conditionally activated biologics today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside of the US and Canada) for CytomX’s first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the clinical activity of CX-801 a dually-masked interferon-alpha2b cytokine in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab).

“Interferon-alpha-2b is a potent cytokine with demonstrated clinical activity against multiple cancer types but its use has been limited by systemic toxicities. CX-801 is designed to overcome these limitations to unlock the full potential of interferon in activating the immune tumor microenvironment. With an improved therapeutic profile our goal is to establish CX-801 as a cornerstone of immuno-oncology combination regimens including in combination with checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda for the treatment of a broad range of tumor types” said Wayne Chu M.D. chief medical officer of CytomX Therapeutics.

“CytomX is excited to be entering into this agreement with Merck to utilize Keytruda in combination with CX-801. The product design principles behind CX-801 integrate over a decade of continuous innovation and experience at CytomX in masking potent biologic therapies. The mechanistic combination of CX-801 and Keytruda is compelling and has potential to be a highly effective regimen to significantly improve the outcomes of patients with cancer” said Sean McCarthy D.Phil. chief executive officer and chairman of CytomX Therapeutics.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzE5MTI5Mi9jb250cm9sLXNvY2lhbC1hbGdvcml0aG1zLWZlZWRzLXJlYm9vdC1ob3ctdG_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to do a Feeds Reboot to take back control of your algorithms,"For the last few years I’ve chosen one weekend day a year to undertake what I’ve come to call a Feeds Reboot. I try to systematically go through every subscription every follow every algorithmically or chronologically generated thing I see on social platforms streaming services and news apps and reset or at least review the way it works. I can’t recommend this enough.

Every time I do a Feeds Reboot I notice a huge uptick in how interesting and relevant I suddenly find the internet. Does it then spend the next 364 days slowly degrading back into a morass from which I will try and extricate myself next year? Yep! But I’m still making progress.

The point of a Feeds Reboot is to be more intentional about the internet. It’s not the same as a privacy audit which is also a good thing to do every year; rather it’s a way to change what you see online. Odds are some of what’s in your feeds — the creators on YouTube the out-there old friends on Facebook the inescapable dance crazes on your TikTok For You page — is the result of something you commented on liked or just happened to watch many months or years ago. The reboot gives you a chance to start fresh to declare to the internet that you are no longer the person you once were and to take more control over the algorithms that run so much of your life.

My process has gotten more complicated over time and now includes three steps: the Following Audit the Mass Archive and a more complicated step I’ve come to call the Feeds Reboot Pro Max.

The Following Audit is tedious but really simple: just assess everything you follow everywhere. Go through your following list on Twitter TikTok and Instagram look at all the sources you follow on RSS check all your Discord memberships look at all the newsletters you get scroll through your podcast subscriptions and check all the bands you follow on Spotify to make sure you still care. Don’t worry about adding better stuff since that tends to happen naturally over time. Just delete everything you don’t want and make sure you’re only signed up for stuff you actually care about.

Just delete everything you don’t want and make sure you’re only signed up for stuff you actually care about

The next step is the Mass Archive which is exactly what it sounds like. Do you have a million emails in your inbox? Do you have a read-it-later app chock-full of stuff you haven’t gotten to yet? How many unviewed Snaps do you have in your list? There’s only one way forward: get rid of all of it. You can delete it all if you’re feeling chaotic or just make a folder called “Archive” and dump everything in. That way it’ll all still be there if you need it… but you won’t. That’s the point.

If you just do those two things you’ll notice almost immediately that your online life feels more relevant and less overloaded. It always takes the longest the first time since you have a lifetime of feed choices to look at; every year after that is much quicker.

The Feeds Reboot Pro Max is the next step in taking control of your algorithms. It involves looking into how various social algorithms already understand what you like and care about and tweaking them whenever possible.

Not every app lets you do this — TikTok for instance won’t give you any control at all over what you see. But some apps do offer more fine-grained control over the algorithm. I’ve included the steps for their mobile apps though you can sometimes get to the same information in a browser. (And with YouTube and Facebook in particular it’s much easier to do some bulk actions on a laptop.) Here they are in no particular order:

YouTube

Go to your Library tab then select View All above your watch history. Scroll back through everything you’ve watched hit the three-dot button on the right side and select Remove from watch history to also take it out of your recommendation pool.

tab then select above your watch history. Scroll back through everything you’ve watched hit the three-dot button on the right side and select to also take it out of your recommendation pool. Or go nuclear: go to Settings  then History & privacy  and just click Clear watch history to wipe the whole thing and start over.

 then  and just click to wipe the whole thing and start over. You can also click on Manage all activity and tell YouTube (and other Google services) to purge all your activity after a certain period of time. I have mine set to 18 months but you can also choose three months or three years of data for Google to keep around.

You can control the data YouTube stores about you or delete it after the fact. Image: YouTube/David Pierce

Instagram

Go to Settings  then Ads  and then Ad Topics to see a list of all the categories advertisers can use to reach you. If you see one you don’t want tap on it and select See Less .

 then  and then to see a list of all the categories advertisers can use to reach you. If you see one you don’t want tap on it and select . Go to your profile tap on Following in the top right and tap on the Least Interacted With category. Unfollow everything in there you don’t want anymore.

Facebook

Go to Settings & privacy > Settings and select Your Time on Facebook . Hit See Settings under Get More From Your Time  then tap News Feed Preferences  and either add or remove people from your Favorites and Unfollow lists to control how often they appear in your feed. (Unfollowing people without unfriending them remains an underrated tactic on Facebook.)

and select . Hit under  then tap  and either add or remove people from your Favorites and Unfollow lists to control how often they appear in your feed. (Unfollowing people without unfriending them remains an underrated tactic on Facebook.) Go to Settings & privacy > Settings look for Permissions and select Ad preferences. Select Ad Topics at the top of the page and you can see and edit all the topics Facebook tells advertisers you’re into. (This list mirrors the one on Instagram by the way so you should only need to tweak it in one place.)

Facebook offers more content control than most — and some of it applies to Instagram too. Image: Facebook/David Pierce

Twitter

Go to Settings > Privacy and safety select Content you see and review both the Topics and the Interests Twitter has for you. Unfollow the ones you no longer want and opt in to the suggested topics that sound most interesting.

LinkedIn

Go to Settings & Privacy > Advertising data then select Interest categories. You’ll be presented with everything LinkedIn thinks you care about and can turn off any you don’t.

Streaming services

Most streaming services have a feature — usually under some phrase like “Watch history” or in the menu where you manage your Continue Watching section — that lets you control what the service uses to inform your recommendations. I would do this on all your services more often than once a year.

In Netflix for instance it only works on the web: under your profile picture go to your Account look for your profile picture in Profile & Parental Controls then select Viewing activity. Click on the Hide icon next to anything you’d rather not show up in your viewing history or inform your recommendations going forward.

Some folks I’ve talked to over the years recommend a more scorched-earth version of a Feeds Reboot. They say you should just periodically unfollow everyone everywhere and rebuild all your feeds naturally going forward. That feels like overkill to me but the purpose is the same. Modern life is run by feeds and algorithms and if you don’t tend to your inputs you’ll eventually grow to hate the outputs.

The real onus here should be on the platforms themselves to make this process simpler and more transparent — to tell you more about what they know and let you change it. Facebook is probably the model here: a lot of its information is buried deep in settings menus but you can see and edit everything from your search history to a detailed list of everything the platform thinks you care about.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWV0YS10cmlhbHMtZmlyc3QtbmZ0cy1mYWNlYm9vay1wb3N0cy0yMDIyLTfSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL21ldGEtdHJpYWxzLWZpcnN0LW5mdHMtZmFjZWJvb2stcG9zdHMtMjAyMi03P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta testing NFTs as Facebook posts in Zuckerberg's metaverse push,"Jesse Smith created The Tadpole Interleukin NFT after being inspired by a walk in the forest.

Facebook NFT posts with the ""digital collectible"" label do not link to marketplaces to purchase.

NFT sales have plunged from $12.6bn in January to about $1bn in June The Guardian reported.

One person testing it out said it was like uploading a photo and doesn't know what comes next.

Facebook started trialing NFTs as posts with a ""digital collectible"" label this week in a bid to expand its efforts in the metaverse.

Meta announced in June that it would broaden testing of digital collectibles to Facebook and at a later date on Instagram with augmented reality platform SparkAR.

Meta's trial with a small group of US creators comes as NFT sales have plunged to the lowest levels in a year. NFT sales plummeted to close to $1bn in June down from a peak of $12.6bn in January the Guardian reported.

Research from crypto market data firm Chainalysis show that was significantly lower than the same period last year when sales amounted to $648m.

Jesse Smith 45 from Richmond Va. is one of 10 creators to try the new feature. The NFT creator does not receive any money from Facebook to post his NFTs on the platform.

""It's exciting but I've not fully wrapped my head around what it means because Facebook hasn't communicated what will happen"" Smith said. ""I don't know if they understand what's happening as the world hasn't fully caught on to NFTs yet.""

The Facebook post displays a photo of the NFT but there is no direct link to connect it to the OpenSea exchange for purchase. Smith chose to post a link to it in the comments section.

The tattoo artist said it was like posting a normal photo but the company gave him the option to click a 'digital collectible' button when uploading.

""I don't know why they chose me they told me I had the audience demographic and checked all the boxes for things they were looking for"" he said.

The social media giant announced Friday that in September it is closing down its pilot cryptocurrency wallet Novi amid a downturn in the digital asset market.

The platform was trialing crypto payments through the Facebook-backed Diem cryptocurrency but had to scrap those plans. The chief executive of Diem said in a statement in January that it became apparent from talks with federal regulators that it couldn't move forward with the project.

Facebook currently still supports digital collectibles held on the Ethereum Polygon and Flow blockchains the website says.

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade major corporations are adding abortion travel costs to their employee benefits.

The goal is to ensure their employees can seek abortion care if they live in states where the procedure is now or will soon be illegal. About 26 U.S. states are expected to swiftly outlaw abortion following the overturn of the landmark 1973 ruling according to the Guttmacher Institute which researches reproductive issues.

A trickle of companies announced abortion travel coverage earlier this year after states including Texas introduced restrictive abortion laws. But more corporations have followed in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on Friday with dozens of companies representing millions workers now pledging to cover travel costs in case their employees need abortion care.

Here's a rundown companies that have expanded coverage:

Local 54 of the Unite Here union said it reached a tentative agreement avoiding a strike that had been threatened for 12:01 a.m. Sunday.

The union had reached tentative agreements on Thursday with the Borgata which is owned by MGM Resorts International and three Caesars Entertainment casinos: Caesars Harrah’s and the Tropicana.

Resorts and the Golden Nugget are two casinos still without a contract but the union said it expects both of them to agree to one in the coming days.

ATLANTIC CITY AVOIDS CASINO STRIKE WITH LAST-MINUTE DEAL

Bally's and the Ocean Casino Resort have signed so-called ""me-too"" agreements committing themselves to adopting the terms of contracts the union reaches with the larger casinos.

The deals still need to be ratified by the full union membership.

""We are extremely pleased that we were once again able to reach a successful settlement with Unite Here Local 54 to increase wages and benefits for our deserving team members"" said Jim Allen chairman of Hard Rock International. ""We look forward to further expanding this excellent relationship at both the national and local levels as we expand our iconic brand.""

The union had said it is seeking ""significant"" salary increases in new contracts to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline food rent and other expenses.

The deals not only avoid what would have been a costly and disruptive strike during one of the busiest weekends of the year for the casinos but it provides labor peace in the crucial third summer of the coronavirus pandemic as the casinos are struggling to return to the revenue and profit levels they enjoyed before it began.

The deals avoided what would have been the city’s first casino strike since 2016.

Their leaders are happy with their decisions but they don’t expect any other properties to join them.

Two downtown Las Vegas resort properties forbid people under 21 from entering.

But don’t expect the policies imposed by Circa and the El Cortez to gain any traction in other Las Vegas properties.

Derek Stevens Circa’s owner in June 2020 tweeted about his place’s under-21 ban effective on opening day in October 2020. El Cortez this year made its switch to an adults-only property with a two-phase change that began April 1 and is ongoing through the end of the year.

The property tells potential guests when they seek to book hotel reservations that those under 21 aren’t welcome. By the fourth quarter of this year El Cortez will hire more security officers to keep those under 21 from entering the building. Some entrances to the property will be closed or converted to exit-only doors.

‘Works great for us’

Both Stevens and El Cortez General Manager Adam Wiesberg are happy with their decisions but neither thinks other casinos are going to do anything similar.

“It works great for us” Stevens said in a recent interview. “That was one thing we wanted to bring into Circa from the beginning. It’s one of the things I may have underestimated but it’s been a huge huge success at Circa.”

For El Cortez it was more about formalizing a policy that already made perfect sense for the historic downtown property Wiesberg said.

“The decision to go 21 and older is an easy one with very few if any negatives and a whole lot of positives” Wiesberg said. “We’re all family people here we have kids and we love kids but when they come into the casino there’s no pool there’s no arcade there’s no food court per se there’s no shows or any entertainment for anyone under 21 and there’s no real space that isn’t serviced by a bar or gaming in very close proximity. So when kids enter the property it’s all challenge and no benefit to us.”

Wiesberg’s remark about the absence of an arcade at El Cortez was actually used as a joke by Stevens when he elaborated on his policy.

“Circa was expensive to build and we couldn’t afford the arcade LOL” Stevens messaged to me.

Both Stevens and Wiesberg — as well as a couple of local gaming industry analysts — are convinced that there won’t be a rush of other properties banning people under 21.

There was some momentum to do so in 1998 when Steve Wynn then the owner of Bellagio famously vowed to keep children out of the property first by trying to ban strollers from the premises.

The policy was relaxed as guests wanted their children to be able to see the floral displays at the property’s Conservatory.

When Bellagio was turned over to MGM Resorts International in the company’s acquisition of Mirage Resorts in 2000 the policy gradually disappeared.

Some resorts have kid-friendly amenities

Brendan Bussmann founder of Las Vegas-based B Global and Josh Swissman founding partner of the Las Vegas-based Strategy Organization say they don’t see other casinos moving to go adults-only.

One reason: Many nongaming amenities have been added to resorts over the years at great expense — bowling alleys theaters waterpark-style pools roller coasters and other family-friendly attractions.

From 1992 to 2003 MGM Grand had MGM Grand Adventures a theme park with various amusement rides on its property. It was an era in which Las Vegas touted itself as a family destination and Time magazine chronicled it with a cover story about the changing appeal of the city.

But as with many aspects of Las Vegas attitudes and philosophies have changed and the city continues to reinvent itself on many levels including ideas about whether it should be an adult destination. Stevens and Wiesberg have made their decisions.

‘Focused on gaming and bars’

Stevens said the number of rooms a property has becomes part of the equation on the decision.

“What I mean by that is we don’t have that many hotel rooms so when I say we’re giving up all of our business for a hotel for people with minors remember I’ve got one-tenth the number of rooms MGM Grand has or one-fifth of what the Golden Nugget has. So I figure it really depends on the property. It’s something that differentiates Circa which I like but I would certainly say this is not a policy that’s for everyone.”

For Wiesberg the policy enables his staff to focus most of its energy on superior customer service.

“We’re laser-focused on the slot floor and providing good odds and a good gamble and then in the table games with our liberal games and to support those gamblers our bars have been expanded over the years to provide the best drink service while you’re playing” he said. “Everything is focused on gaming and bars here.”

You’d likely also get votes for National Golf Links of America Shinnecock Hills Oakmont Country Club and Merion Golf Club to name just a few more. We’re not taking anything away from those heralded courses but a list of golf destinations that are so exceptional—but also so guardedly private—that only their fortunate members and guests can enjoy them is rather limiting. In essence it’s a collection of aspirational rounds that are just that: fantasies.

That got us thinking. What would a top-25 list of US golf courses look like if we focused only on courses that the public can play? With that in mind here is our list of the the best 25 US courses you can play. It’s a list that emphasizes layouts that have hosted major championships or annual PGA Tour events as well as courses that deliver memorable and distinctive playing experiences. In some cases we also included courses that provide golfers with an opportunity to humbly brag about their rounds after the fact. In the instances when a golf resort with multiple courses is listed we tried our best to limit our selection to a single course from that property. Had we not Bandon Dunes Golf Resort might occupy 20 percent of this list.

So as the golf season kicks into high gear we hope this group of recommendations help you schedule a few memorable rounds of golf on truly special courses. If you do enjoy the experience and hit ’em straight!

Bandon Dunes Resort (Pacific Dunes Course) Oregon

Considered by many to be Tom Doak’s first masterpiece Pacific Dunes at Bandon Dunes Resort effectively put Mike Keiser’s premier golf property on the map. Not to take anything away from the resort’s eponymous debut course designed by David McLay Kidd but Pacific Dunes made the golfing world take notice for two reasons. The first according to Keiser is strictly about numbers. “One course is a curiosity” the 77-year-old golf developer has often said. “Two courses is a destination.”

In some respects the second reason why Pacific Dunes first made an impact is also about numbers. The 6633-yard course was the first modern layout to let the topography of the site dictate how the course’s routing took shape. As a result the first six holes on the back nine feature three par 3s two par 5s and only one par 4. “I think many outsiders felt that it was very bold” Keiser says of the decision to build a course with such an unconventional scorecard. “But Tom and I both felt that the routing fit the site perfectly.”

Bay Hill Resort (Champion/Challenger Course) Florida

Most PGA Tour venues that are open to the public provide exciting bucket-list rounds of golf explicitly because of the annual Tour events that they host the famous shots that have been hit there or sometimes the famous individual holes that those courses have become synonymous with. The Champion/Challenger course at Bay Hill Resort in Orlando Fla. checks all of those boxes. Yet Bay Hill Resort also warrants a visit for its association with one esteemed golfer (and the property’s owner): Arnold Palmer.

The golf course originally designed by Dick Wilson in 1960 hosted a charity exhibition match in 1965 which Palmer won. It was his first time visiting and playing the course and he was immediately enamored with it so much so that in 1970 he took a 5-year lease on the property with an option to buy. In 1979 four years after taking ownership of the course Palmer secured an annual PGA Tour event now known as The Arnold Palmer Invitational.

Palmer’s presence can be felt all across the property thanks to photos statues and other mementos; yet The King also left his fingerprints on the golf course via a sweeping renovation in 2009 that redesigned every green reworked every bunker and altered the layout of four holes stretching the total yardage to 7196. The course is typically open only to members and their guests; however non-members who stay at the lodge are granted access to tee times.

Bethpage State Park (Black Course) New York

The sign posted on the wrought iron fence just behind the first tee box of the Black Course at Bethpage State Park tells you all you need to know: “Warning – The Black Course Is An Extremely Difficult Course Which We Recommend Only For Highly Skilled Golfers.” That’s not hyperbole. The middle tees play just under 6700 yards yet the course rating is more than 3 strokes above par while the layout’s slope rating comes in just a tick under 150. Even Jordan Spieth ranks the Black Course within the top five most difficult layouts that he’s ever played.

Despite all of the implied frustration that the sign and course ratings suggest most golfers will be enamored by the prospect of playing a really difficult course—even if it comes at the expense of posting a good score. In that way a round at Bethpage Black is badge of honor. Moreover the course makes our list for being one of only six public golf courses that have hosted a US Open. If you should play it prepare yourself for elevated greens defined by almost indistinguishable contours (meaning putts will break in directions that you might not expect). You should also be prepared for massive and in some cases steeply banked bunkers (some of the largest and most creative that A.W. Tillinghast the course’s original architect ever built).

In other words prepare for a challenging round of golf. And if you’re not you clearly didn’t read the sign.

Chambers Bay Washington

When Chambers Bay hosted the US Open in 2015 much of the attention on the course focused on bumpy irregular and inconsistent putting surfaces—an unfortunate circumstance brought on by native Poa Annua grasses sprouting up across much of the fescue-seeded greens. Such rough conditioning sparked harsh criticism from many of the players competing in the major which not only detracted from the event but also the golf course’s otherwise dynamic layout.

Since then Chambers Bay’s superintendent and the team of groundskeepers have re-seeded the greens with the indigenous species of grass which has allowed the course to shine—and to be appreciated—for what it is. After all the young course (circa 2007) won its bid for the US Open for a reason.

Although many of the holes at Chambers Bay look and play like a traditional links course the venue is unique in that it was built across an abandoned sand quarry. For that reason the course feels like a fusion of links and mountain golf which introduces a challenging juxtaposition of styles and strategies that golfers must navigate throughout their rounds.

Erin Hills Wisconsin

Erin Hills in central Wisconsin is a young course with a lot of history. That is to say the undulating topography upon which the course was built was formed thousands of years ago when glaciers receded from the area. Embracing the course’s natural landscape Erin Hills’ founders cleverly crafted a slogan which gets right to the point: “a course 10000 years in the making.”

The course hosted the US Open in 2017 which immediately put it on every enthusiastic golf traveler’s radar but the layout is worthy of considerable praise even without that championship pedigree largely due to the dynamic elevation changes that shape each hole. Notably those ridges and hills weren’t manufactured when the course was built in the mid-2000s. “You would never have thought a course naturally shaped by glaciers would have such incredible elevation change on almost every hole” says Jim Lombardo Erin Hills’ head golf professional. “It’s remarkable.”

Stretching beyond 7700 yards from the black tees the course can be downright brutal especially if golfers let their egos get in the way. “People who play too far back are in trouble off the tee all day long” Lombardo acknowledges. “Even if you’re on the fence between two tee boxes start with the ones that are a little closer. The course is hard enough as it is.”

Firestone Country Club (South Course) Ohio

If you want to play a classic tree-lined course that is as beautiful as it is challenging not to mention one that exudes an air of exclusive and has seen some of the sport’s greatest players claim victory you could try to secure an invitation to Augusta National. However you could also opt for one of Firestone Country Club’s stay and play packages which gets you access to the private club’s South Course a venue that has hosted three PGA Championships and 19 World Golf Championship events.

The parkland layout meanders up and down and across rolling hills and its pastoral setting can lull first-time visitors into a false sense of security. But make no mistake the South Course at Firestone Country Club is deceptively difficult. “The South is a very strategic golf course that requires playing from the fairway” says Tommy Moore the club’s former director of golf. “If you just miss the fairway by a yard it’s effectively a half-stroke or full-stroke penalty. It can be punishing even if you’re just one or two steps off the fairway.”

Adds Jay Walkinshaw Firestone’s general manager: “Physically it’s not a challenging golf course. The South is very straightforward and lays out well in front of you but it requires you to be mentally tough to play almost every shot. It’s a tough test of golf.”

Forest Dunes (The Loop) Michigan

If you aspire to tee it up on the Old Course in St Andrews but can’t get across the pond a round of golf on a Tom Doak-designed golf course here in the States is in many respects the next best thing. As a college student Doak spent a year of independent study in the UK and Ireland which included a summer caddying at the Old Course and also routinely picking the brain of its resident greenkeeper. During those months Doak began to understand how subtle ridges and hollows—and the occasional overt mound—can infuse a golf course with character creating a dynamic environment that can play differently every day.

In Roscommon Michigan The Loop embraces that ethos. The course’s minimalist design across firm and fast terrain makes it one of the few layouts in the United States that effectively emulate true Scottish links land. Equally significant The Loop is one of the few (and the first) reversible courses in the country—it plays clockwise one day and counterclockwise the next. Not only does the course feature examples of classic golf architecture such as Biarritz and Redan greens it also encourages golfers to see and appreciate a singular piece of property from different perspectives one day to the next.

Gamble Sands Washington

When Gamble Sands opened in 2014 the American links course set atop an expansive sandy desert-like plateau overlooking the Columbia River Valley represented a shift in design philosophy for architect David McLay Kidd. Prior to that Kidd had created a series of courses that were equally demanding and difficult but he broke that mold with Gamble Sands.

Unlike many courses in the Pacific Northwest which are defined—and sometimes feel constricted—by heavily forested corridors Gamble Sands is distinctive for being treeless. Because of that Kidd took the approach that bigger is better. The course features exceptionally wide fairways—to the point that the term “generous” doesn’t do them justice—equally sprawling greens and it delivers breathtaking vistas.

At Gamble Sands it’s not inconceivable to say that average players are likely to shoot their best scores. Such a declaration is supported by the fact that Kidd created player friendly ridges and contours that steer shots away from bunkers and other troublesome areas. Furthermore those wide and firm fescue fairways allow balls to bounce and roll for a long time. Couple that with Eastern Washington’s thin desert air and the conditions are right for players of all ability levels to hit massively long drives that also stay on the short grass. That’s a foolproof formula for success.

The Greenbrier (The Old White Course) West Virginia

There aren’t many courses in the country that have routinely hosted a PGA Tour event are open for public play and have a deep history stretching back more than a century. The Old White course at The Greenbrier resort in West Virginia is one of them. Designed by Charles Blair (C.B.) Macdonald the course opened in 1914 and features several classic hole designs from the best links courses throughout the United Kingdom. The 8th hole for example was styled after North Berwick Golf Club’s famous “Redan” green; the 13th hole was modeled after the “Alps” at Prestwick; and the 15th hole bears a striking resemblance to the “Eden” hole on the Old Course in St Andrews.

The Old White garnered its name from a hotel that stood on the resort’s grounds from 1858 to 1922 but the course’s design and character cannot be attributed just to C.B. Macdonald. Seth Raynor one of Macdonald’s contemporaries and associates assisted in the layout’s original construction and returned during the 1920s to oversee a handful of renovations.

The 7292-yard course hosted a PGA Tour event for a decade (from 2010 to 2019) but it also served as the venue for the US Women’s Amateur Championship in 1922.

Harbour Town Golf Links South Carolina

There aren’t many golf courses in the United States that host annual PGA Tour events—or occasional major championships—that are also open to the public. Harbour Town Golf Links the headline-stealing course at Sea Pines Resort on Hilton Head Island is one of them. The 7099-yard course which has hosted a Tour event every spring since 1969 is a Pete Dye masterpiece in shot-shaping. It’s also one that requires all players touring professionals and weekend hackers alike to implement course management strategies from the moment they step onto the tee box of each hole.

For that reason a round at Harbour Town Golf Links is much more than an opportunity to simply tee it up where the pros play. “This course forces you to play like the pros play” says John Farrell the resort’s director of golf. “Not just where the pros play but like the pros play. You’ll be challenged in ways that you’re not always challenged and you’ll hit every club in your bag.”

The Tour-like experience doesn’t conclude when resort guests walk of the 18th hole. When you play a round at Harbour Town you also have access to the 4000-square-foot professionals’ locker room located on the second floor of the stately clubhouse. “You’re a PGA Tour player for the day” Farrell says “and that doesn’t happen everywhere.”

Kapalua Resort (Plantation Course) Hawaii

Remarkably the Plantation Course at Kapalua Resort which opened in 1991 was Bill Coore & Ben Crenshaw’s first completed design project together. Built up and down—and across—a series of steep volcanic slopes that at one time were home to windswept pineapple fields the Plantation Course wowed resort guests from the moment it opened. Today some 31 years later the course still offers plenty of opportunities to hit heroic shots while a handful of expansive fairways on holes playing downhill and with a favorable prevailing wind allow average players to grip it and rip it without much trepidation.

Coore and Crenshaw returned to the course a couple of years ago to renovate the layout during which the greens and bunkers were rebuilt with better drainage all of the tee boxes were laser-leveled and the entire course was re-grassed. The latter point is the most noteworthy as the re-grassing effort brought back the firm and fast playing conditions that initially defined the course’s playing experience.

Since 1999 the course has hosted the Sentry Tournament of Champions a PGA Tour event held the first week of January. The pros often post final four-day scores that flirt with (or exceed) 20 under par—an indication of the layout’s player-friendly design—but that only adds to its charm for the average golfer.

Kiawah Island Golf Resort (Ocean Course) South Carolina

Host of two PGA Championships an infamous Ryder Cup and a pair of additional major championships for the PGA of America the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island Golf Resort boasts a championship pedigree that warrants it being near the top of most avid golfers’ bucket lists. If you should be fortunate enough to tee it up on the almost 7900-yard-long Pete Dye masterpiece consider two numbers: 79.1 and 155. Those figures represent the course and slope ratings that the USGA assigned to the Ocean Course from its very back tees.

Fortunately you won’t have to play from those tee boxes but that doesn’t mean the course is much easier from any of the more forward tees. It’s simply shorter. “You can patch it together and get around on other courses” said Brian Gerard the director of golf at Kiawah Island Golf Resort. “But when you’re on the Ocean Course that’s a difficult patch. Simply put it will expose your weaknesses.”

For visitors who have only seen it on television the course comes alive in person revealing steep and subtle slopes and contours on and around the greens that aren’t always captured or conveyed accurately by the TV cameras. According to Gerard television broadcasts also don’t do justice to the locale or the course’s sense of place. “The Ocean Course shows very well on TV” he says “but you don’t really get the true effect of how it makes you feel until you’re standing on the property. When you get to number five just standing on the tee and looking around … it’s amazing.”

Mammoth Dunes at Sand Valley Wisconsin

Stretching to almost 7000 yards Mammoth Dunes at Sand Valley in central Wisconsin plays just as long as the resort’s first namesake course designed by Coore & Crenshaw. Yet Mammoth Dunes a David McLay Kidd layout that opened in June 2018 delivers a unique playing experience thanks to generously wide fairways—some exceed 100 yards from edge to edge—and greens positioned into natural pockets in the terrain.

The impact that Mammoth Dunes has on the average golfer’s playing experience is less about providing forgiveness and more about instilling confidence. As Kidd explains mid- to high-handicappers typically shoot better scores on the course because they hit better shots and they hit better shots because what they see of the course reaffirms that they don’t have to be perfect to have success. The par-73 course is equally appealing to highly skilled players since pinpoint accuracy is still required if those players want the best chance at a birdie. In that regard Mammoth Dunes—which plays around expansive 80-foot-tall sand dunes old-growth oak trees and a plethora of red pines—is the poster course for Kidd’s design philosophy which emphasizes enjoyment over excessive difficulty.

“We don’t want you to score easily” he explains. “But we’ll show you mercy if you stumble. You have to hit good shots to make birdie or better; but we’ll give you a chance if you hit a marginal shot because making birdie is the best thing in golf no matter how you do it.”

Payne’s Valley at Big Cedar Lodge Missouri

The newest golf layout at Big Cedar Lodge Payne’s Valley opened in 2020 and is the second US course designed by Tiger Woods but the first that is accessible to the public (his first US venture Bluejack National is a private course about 45 minutes outside of Houston that opened in 2016). Like Bluejack National Payne’s Valley showcases the love affair that Woods has with the Old Course in St Andrews—the 15-time major champion often points to that historic Scottish layout as his all-time favorite course. Payne’s Valley feature’s wide fairways low-cut rough that’s intended to keep balls in play rather than penalize golfers and strategically placed hazards that will challenge good golfers but not require lesser-skilled players to hit shots near or over them.

“My favorite [style of] golf is to play it on the ground which is links golf” Woods says. “You can use the ground as your friend. So many of the different golf courses that I play around the world that’s kind of been taken out of the game. Everyone’s forcing people to play the ball in the air.

“I want the ball running I want it traveling I want it moving on the ground” Woods adds “and this golf course allows us to do that.”

Pebble Beach Golf Links California

When it comes to Pebble Beach Golf Links not much needs to be said. The 7075-yard layout originally designed by Jack Neville and Douglas Grant in 1919 has hosted six US Opens not to mention a celebrity pro-am event since 1947. So whether you want to walk in the footsteps of the world’s best players—names like Nicklaus Palmer Woods and Watson—or world-renowned celebs such as Bing Crosby Bob Hope Clint Eastwood and Bill Murray the most famous golf course on Monterey Peninsula has you covered.

When it comes to successfully playing Pebble Beach Golf Links the secret lies in having a stellar short game. After all the average size of a putting surface at Pebble Beach is only 3500 square feet by far the smallest greens on the PGA Tour. “People say it all the time: These green are small” says Casey Boyns one of Pebble Beach’s longest-tenured caddies. “And they are. Even the big greens are small; and there’s so much slope that even the chips are hard.”

Beyond that the course truly shines for its locale right along the edge of Carmel Bay. Just know that if you’re one of the first groups out in the morning the rangers are going to be more focused on your pace of play so if you’re hoping to take your time (and plenty of pictures) during your round aim (or hope) for a mid-morning tee time.

PGA West (Stadium Course) California

You see plenty of vehicles driving around with bumper stickers brandished with a single number: 26.2. It’s a not-so-subtle way for people to let everyone around them know that they’ve finished a marathon one of the most grueling tests that a distance runner can take on. In some respects golfers who complete a round of golf on the Stadium Course at PGA West should take a similar approach framing their scorecard as proof that they survived one of the more challenging courses anywhere. In fact there was a time when a prominent golf publication ranked it inside the top 5 most difficult courses in the country.

This Pete Dye design is comprised of holes with foreboding names such as San Andreas Fault and Alcatraz and those monikers aren’t hyperbole. San Andreas Fault for example is marked by a fault line of sorts—a long-running stretch of fairway bunkers down the left side that culminates in a greenside bunker that is better described as a canyon. The base of the bunker is almost 20 feet below the putting surface. Alcatraz by contrast is what you’d expect: a par three with an island green that plays more than 160 yards from the back tees.

Factor in that The Stadium Course at PGA West hosts an annual PGA Tour event and every other year serves as the final site for the Tour’s Qualifying School (aka Q School) and it’s easy to understand why the 7300-yard layout is a course on most avid players’ bucket lists.

Pinehurst Resort (No. 2 Course) North Carolina



From a golf standpoint the No. 2 course has shone brightly as Pinehurst’s crown jewel since the mid-1930s. Spread out over 196 acres the course is widely considered to be architect Donald Ross’s pièce de résistance. No. 2 benefited from a comprehensive restoration by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw in 2010 during which 26 acres of lush Bermuda rough was replaced with natural waste areas and native sandscapes. According to Coore the course in its restored form now looks and plays in a manner that would please its original designer.

“Pinehurst is a throwback to what golf was when it was a game played in nature and not a botanical garden” Coore explains. “If you play a course like No. 2 most often every round something memorable is going to occur. That memorable moment may be really happy and positive and it may be the exact opposite. There’s that element of unpredictability. It’s the element of the unknown. That’s the thrill. It’s what’s captured people’s imaginations for hundreds of years about playing golf.”

Beyond those experiences golf travelers who make their way to the sand hills of North Carolina and play the No. 2 course can also revel in the thrill of playing a course that has hosted three US Opens and was recently named the first anchor site for that major championship.

Sea Island Resort (Seaside Course) Georgia

Simply put passionate golfers who have never been to Sea Island are missing out. The coastal vacation destination in southern Georgia is home to multiple private golf clubs with exceptional practice facilities—hence why so many PGA Tour pros call the island community home. But Sea Island is also home to a classic resort community with three noteworthy courses of its own the most prolific of which is the Seaside Course.

Although the course was re-designed by Tom Fazio several years ago its roots can be traced back to 1929. It was then during golf’s golden age of design that Harry S. Colt and Charles Alison initially laid out the course. Today the Seaside Course is the most dramatic layout of the three at Sea Island Resort and it artfully marries manicured fairways and greens (in the Tom Fazio tradition) with plenty of dunes and native areas planted with tall wispy maritime grasses and wildflowers.

The coastal course can be mighty challenging when the winds blow and even in benign conditions the layout is no pushover. But then resort guests who tee it up on the course likely know to expect that. After all a course like Seaside wouldn’t annually hosts a PGA Tour event each fall if it didn’t have some bite.

Shadow Creek Nevada

NFL Hall of Famer (and golf enthusiast) Jerome Bettis describes Shadow Creek as “North Carolina majesty in the middle of the desert.” It’s an apt description though we also see a lot of Augusta National in the place which makes sense given that Tom Fazio designed and built the course in 1989 and the longtime golf architect allegedly has had a hand in renovating the site of the Masters for years.

Regardless of what comparisons spring to mind it’s clear—and likely undisputable—that Shadow Creek delivers one of the finest and most memorable going experiences anywhere. As an MGM Resorts Entertainment Destination the course is available for guest play but only for those who are also guests of an MGM Resorts International property. Fortunately that’s not a very limiting criteria in Las Vegas since 13 properties are branded with the MGM Resorts insignia. Those who are lucky enough to play this course will be whisked to and from the club via limousine and upon arrival they’ll be greeted by their caddie for the day.

Just how special is a round at Shadow Creek? Consider the perspective of PGA Tour player and Las Vegas resident Ryan Moore: “Anyone who gets invited to go play Shadow Creek has to go. It’s one of the top five golf courses on the planet. The course is unbelievable—it’s an amazing facility and in great shape. It will be one of the best golfing experiences you’ll ever have.”

Spyglass Hill California

There are few guarantees in life but one of them is knowing that if an avid golfer is making a trip to Pebble Beach they’re most excited about playing the resort’s eponymous golf course. By contrast Spyglass Hill doesn’t get quite as much love or attention but it should. In fact many who have played all of the resort’s golf courses will argue that Spyglass is the best layout out of them all.

Initially conceived by Robert Trent Jones Sr. in collaboration with the Northern California Golf Association the course was designed to resemble two exclusive (and iconic) courses on the East Coast: Pine Valley and Augusta National. The course opens in the dunes just off of 17 Mile Drive and transports golfers up into the hills of Monterey Peninsula. Along the way players are likely to spot plenty of wildlife including blacktail deer and they’ll be better protected from strong gusts that blow off the bay. “You’re out there in these backwoods and it’s like it’s its own world” says Casey Boyns one of Pebble Beach’s longest-tenured caddies. “It’s a different feel and a different vibe [compared to Pebble Beach Golf Links]. It’s quieter.”

Streamsong Resort (Red or Blue Course) Florida

The first two courses at Streamsong Resort were simultaneously designed and built and they shine equally bright in part because they share the same general piece of property. In fact when golf architect Tom Doak and the course design duo of Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw each visited the property to survey the land and draft a proposed routing of their courses they found that certain proposed holes for one routing worked better with the other layout and vice versa. In the end the two courses—Red designed by Coore & Crenshaw and Blue designed to Doak—intersect and overlap at numerous points yet both deliver unique playing experiences. They even look different which is a remarkable achievement.

Additionally the Red and Blue courses at Streamsong are bucket-list golf experiences for the dynamic untraditional Floridian terrain upon which they’re built. Because Streamsong Resort was constructed upon a site that was previously a phosphate mine the topography is unnatural; however the stacked mounds and trenches created by that former mining operation naturally revegetated over time giving the site a more organic appearance. “If you brought me in blindfolded” says Doak “Florida would’ve been the last state that I would’ve guessed I was in.”

Torrey Pines (South Course) California

Since its inaugural tournament in 1895 golf’s US Open Championship has been contested at only six non-private golf courses. The South Course at Torrey Pines has welcomed the esteemed major championship on two occasions (most recently just last year) which by itself makes the 7015-yard layout a bucket-list destination for golf (the course can stretch to 7802 yards but only golfers receiving special permission can play from those very back tees). However the 65-year-old course which also hosts an annual PGA Tour event in late January or early February deserves to be on your bucket list for reasons beyond its major championship connections.

For starters the South Course at Torrey Pines offers sweeping views of the Pacific and the southern California coastline. Many of its holes also introduce dramatic approach shots to greens that were recently repositioned closer to the edges of several canyons thanks to redesign efforts led by architect Rees Jones who conditioned the course for its two major championships. And while avid golfers are likely to fixate on the professional events that have been played at Torrey Pines (and how the pros played each hole) it’s important that they remember that the course was also designed to be a fun and playable experience for golfers of average ability. That means mid- to high-handicap players won’t always need to attack the greens through the air. They can hit bump-and-run shots that bounce and roll up onto the putting surfaces. “On a number of holes they can access the green on the ground” Jones says. “The pros don’t do that.”

TPC Sawgrass (Stadium Course) Florida

Aside from Augusta National and Pebble Beach Golf Links the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass may be the most famous golf course in the United States by virtue of the fact that the 7245-yard layout has hosted The Players Championship every year since 1982. “What I love about the Stadium Course is that it feels like I’m challenging history throughout a round” says Tom Alter the vice president of communications for the PGA Tour. “If I remember certain players having a similar shot during The Players Championship in the past I can compare how I did against some of the greatest players in the world.”

The championship course is noteworthy for not favoring a particular playing style—a characteristic that is evidenced by the varied list of PGA Tour pros who have won The Players Championship over the years. That being said golfers who exercise restraint and don’t try to overpower the golf course off the tee will typically have the greatest success. You’ll also want to settle your nerves when you reach the course’s iconic 17th hole. That tee shot will be the most important one of your round. “When people hear that you played the Stadium Course” Alter says “the first question that everyone asks is ‘How did you do on 17?’”

Whistling Straits (The Straits Course) Wisconsin

When Herb Kohler hired Pete Dye back in the late 1990s tasking him with the design and construction of The Straits course at Whistling Straits the resort’s owner and developer gave Dye a single marching order: “Make it look like Ballybunion.” Dye obliged bringing in more than 10000 truckloads of sand. In the process he took a flat parcel of land that had once supported a military airstrip and transformed it into a dynamic golf course that emulated the rugged windswept links of southwestern Ireland.

Even though the 7790-yard championship golf course hugs the shores of Lake Michigan those waters are very rarely in play. Instead The Strait’s course primary defense—aside from the strong winds that often blow off the lake—are its bunkers. Want proof? Consider the par-5 11th hole aptly named Sand Box. There are more bunkers on that one 645-yard hole than there are across all 18 holes of The River course another championship layout that Dye designed and built for Kohler back in the late 1980s.

Visitors who are lucky enough to play The Straits course not only get the opportunity to experience such a memorable (though difficult) round of golf they also get the chance to play a course that has hosted three PGA Championships and most recently the Ryder Cup in 2021.

Yale Golf Course Connecticut

For decades the Yale Golf Course was a tough track to get on—you had to be a current student or faculty member at the university a member of the club or a guest of a member. You might not think that a university’s golf course would have much clout but the 6409-yard layout is historic one that exists as the byproduct of a collaboration between C.B. Macdonald and Seth Raynor two golden age course architects who collectively are responsible for the design of more than a dozen of the most prestigious and heralded golf courses in the country.

The once-private course opened for play in 1926 but only within the last year or so has it opened its gates to non-members with the caveat that those aspiring golfers complete a request form. What can those first-time players expect? Wide rolling fairways that lead to expansive greens guarded by deep bunkers. The course is also home to the first Biarritz green in the United States and many consider it to be one of the finest examples of the template green outside of the original design in France.

Heralded as one of the finest collegiate courses in the nation Yale Golf Club has earned such accolades almost from the moment it opened for play. Prestigious sportswriter Herbert Warren Wind described the course this way in 1937: “A back-breaking job over an untouched plot of rugged land whose hazards and greens have the kind of dimensions that one would have expected of Michelangelo.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaGFybmVzc2xpbmsuY29tL3VzYS9qb3ZpYWxpdHktcy1iZWF0cy10aGUtYm95cy1pbi1tZ20teW9ua2Vycy10cm90LWZpbmFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joviality S makes history in $280904 Yonkers Trot victory,"Driver Brian Sears had Joviality S ready to leave from post seven and she fired right to the top carving out fractions of 27.2 56.4 and 1:24.4 while pursued by pocket-sitter Double Deceiver (David Miller). Those two faced off in a match race through the lane and although Double Deceiver made some late headway it wasn’t enough as Joviality S tallied by a length and matched Plunge Blue Chip’s track record established back in 2018. Pour Mea Double (Dexter Dunn) got up for third.

Joviality S ( Chapter Seven ) became the first filly since Continentalvictory in 1996 to win Yonkers Raceway’s MGM Yonkers Trot taking the $280904 harness racing final and the first leg of the Trotting Triple Crown for 3-year-olds on Friday night (July 1) in 1:53.1 to equal the track record for her division.

JOVIALITY S REPLAY

“She’s just so handy out on the track and lets me do anything that I want. It makes my job so much easier. She has so much talent gets over the ground so easy and just has a great gait to her” said Sears. “I let her roll along a little bit tonight. She felt really good getting over the track. I called on her a little bit down the lane and she picked it up like she usually does.”

With one notch in the Trotting Triple Crown now secured the question will be if Joviality S opts to go in the Hambletonian or Hambletonian Oaks but Sears noted she could have some additional racing to do before that.

“I really haven’t talked to Marcus (Melander) about it. Maybe we’ll get a sire stake or two in between now and Hambletonian Day or we’ll just take it from there. We’d still like to race her in New York and keep her tight” remarked Sears.

Melander trains Joviality S for owner Courant Inc. whose AM Bloodstock Inc. bred the filly. Joviality S has won all five of her starts in 2022 has a record of 14-2-0 from 17 lifetime tries and has now banked $1205818. She paid $2.40 to win as the favorite and led an $8.00 exacta and a $23.00 trifecta.

It was a 1-2 finish for trainer Ake Svanstedt in the companion $126165 New York New York Mile for 3-year-old filly trotters with 1-5 favorite Jiggy Jog S (Walner Dunn) defeating stablemate Little Pink Lies (Svanstedt) in a 1:54 effort.

Little Pink Lies shot to the top from post five but Dunn also left from post six with Jiggy Jog S and she cleared to the point passing the 27.3 opening quarter. Jiggy Jog S then faced no pressure from there trotting through a half in 56.1 and a three-quarters in 1:24.3.

While Jiggy Jog S had a fairly routine journey up to that point it was anything but routine on the last turn as she drifted out and then got rough allowing Little Pink Lies to take command on the inside and get a bit of separation coming into the lane. However Jiggy Jog S got back on the right foot once she got straightened up in the stretch and was able to chase Little Pink Lies back down defeating her by three-quarters of a length. Cash Infusion (Yannick Gingras) came in third."

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

An Australian startup just modeled a molecule on a microchip placing atoms in silicon with sub-nanometer precision.

This ability to simulate molecules on the atomic scale — where matter is ruled by quantum mechanics — could improve our understanding of the quantum world and lead to the creation of incredible new materials such as high-temperature superconductors or super efficient solar cells.

“We could start to mimic how nature behaves and then we can start to make new kinds of materials and devices that the world has never seen before” said Michelle Simmons founder of Silicon Quantum Computing the startup responsible for the microchip.

Thinking small

A couple of million years after making our first stone tools humans discovered that when we zoom in on matter looking at the atoms and subatomic particles that comprise it they adhere to a different set of rules than the ones that govern objects on a larger scale.

These rules (“quantum mechanics”) can have their own useful applications — MRI scanners solar cells and atomic clocks all take advantage of quantum phenomena.

“We can start to make new kinds of materials and devices that the world has never seen before.” Michelle Simmons

But while it’s easy to heft a rock and extrapolate that it might be good for bashing things it’s not so easy to see or understand how matter behaves on the quantum scale — especially since observation itself affects quantum systems.

We can use computer programs to simulate how some small molecules behave on the atomic or subatomic level but that isn’t a viable option for larger molecules: there’s too many possible interactions between their particles.

“If we can start to understand materials at [the quantum] level we can design things that have never been made before” Simmons told ScienceAlert. “The question is: how do you actually control nature at that level?”

The quantum simulator

The answer it seems is by modeling molecules on silicon chips.

For a recent study the SQC team successfully manufactured a microchip at the atomic scale creating 10 uniformly sized artificial atoms — also known as “quantum dots” — and then using a scanning tunneling microscope to precisely position the dots in silicon.

The team modeled their chip after the structure of polyacetylene a molecule made from carbon and hydrogen atoms connected by alternating single and double carbon bonds.

Once it was built they could apply an electric charge to one part of the chip (the “source”) and study how it moved along the chain of atoms to exit at another part (the “drain”).

“We’re literally building it from the bottom up where we are mimicking the polyacetylene molecule by putting atoms in silicon with the exact distances that represent the single and double carbon-carbon bonds” said Simmons.

Based on theoretical predictions polyacetylene is supposed to behave differently depending on whether the chain of molecules begins and ends with double carbon bonds or single carbon bonds.

“What [this model is] showing is that you can literally mimic what actually happens in the real molecule.” Michelle Simmons

To check if their modeling technique was accurate the researchers created one chip based on each version — and saw that the number electrical peaks did change as the current ran through each version.

“This confirms long-standing theoretical predictions and demonstrates our ability to precisely simulate the polyacetylene molecule” according to SQC.

The team also observed an electron existing in two places simultaneously an example of the quantum phenomenon superposition.

“What [this model is] showing is that you can literally mimic what actually happens in the real molecule and that’s why it’s exciting because the signatures of the two chains are very different” said Simmons.

As expected the different configurations produced two different electrical currents. Credit: Silicon Quantum Computing

What’s next?

The team chose a 10-dot chain of the polyacetylene molecule to demonstrate its tech because that’s something we can simulate with classical computers. Now they’re looking to scale up.

“We’re near the limit of what classical computers can do so it’s like stepping off the edge into the unknown” said Simmons. “And this is the thing that’s exciting — we can now make bigger devices that are beyond what a classical computer can model.”

These future quantum models could be for materials that lead to new batteries pharmaceuticals and more predicts Simmons.

“It won’t be long before we can start to realize new materials that have never existed before” she said.

What happened

Shares of semiconductor design outfit Himax Technologies (HIMX 0.97%) took a steep 19.6% hit last week. It caps off a terrible June for the market and the worst first half of a year since 1970. If you're keeping score the S&P 500 was down 19.7% the Nasdaq Composite was down 25.9% and Himax stock was down 54.8% so far in 2022 through July 1.

So what

Semiconductor businesses in particular are under siege right now especially those like Himax that provide circuitry for consumer electronics. After two years of heavy spending on work-from-home and other at-home products the global consumer is shifting its wallet toward more basic items as inflation rages.

In light of this Himax updated its Q2 2022 financial guidance lower on June 20. Himax management now thinks revenue will decline 22% to 27% from Q1 2022 compared with previous guidance for a 16% to 20% sequential decline before. It appears it took a few days for the market to digest the news.

Now what

As if to reinforce the deteriorating short-term outlook for consumer electronics memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU -0.77%) issued weaker-than-expected financial guidance on June 30 as well. Micron said there's too much inventory on the market for consumer devices and it could take some time to work through this excess. Micron is one of the more cyclical semiconductor stocks out there given that it's a top manufacturer of commoditized chips used in more complex computing systems.

Himax falls into this camp as well since it provides basic image processing chips for TVs smartphones autos and the like. With consumer spending taking a hit expect more volatility ahead for this small chip designer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA3LTAzL3VrcmFpbmUtbG9zZXMtaXRzLWZpbmFsLWVhc3Rlcm4tc3Ryb25naG9sZC1pbi1sdWhhbnNrLXJlZ2lvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ukraine Loses Its Final Eastern Stronghold in Luhansk Region,"Why did this happen?

The stock falls 5% and the sector slumps. While battered chip stocks may look cheap to investors is another leg down coming?

Shares of Micron Technology (MU) and other semiconductor stocks are losing ground today after the semiconductor maker warned that demand is falling and sales will be lower in the current quarter.

The industry weathered a shortage coming out of the Covid pandemic as demand outstripped supplies. But a slowing economy that may be headed to recession has flipped the story.

While Micron reported a strong growth in revenue at $8.64 billion up from $7.42 billion a year ago it forecast revenue in the current quarter of just $7.2 billion. Analysts had been targeting over $9.1 billion according to Bloomberg.

Micron stock was down about 5% for the day bringing its losses to about 40% this year. S&P 500 semiconductor stocks were all down at midday with Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also down nearly 5%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index shed almost 5% and is now down nearly 40% year to date.

With the sector deep into bear market territory and long-term forecasts strong there’s an argument for bargain-hunting at these prices. But if the industry is now facing a glut there could be another leg down ahead and even lower entry points.

What Micron said

Micron’s third-quarter numbers were strong with net income and operating income up and diluted earnings per share at $2.34 up from $2 last quarter and $1.52 a year ago.

The outlook is what has investors worried. The lower revenue guidance was substantially below analyst forecasts and the company’s guidance is now for earnings at $1.52 per share while analysts had been looking for $2.60.

Micron pegged falling demand across the industry a concern backed by recent reports of lower phone shipments to China slower sales of electric vehicles and slowing computer sales.

“Micron delivered record revenue in the fiscal third quarter driven by our team’s excellent execution across technology products and manufacturing” said Micron Technology President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in a statement. “Recently the industry demand environment has weakened and we are taking action to moderate our supply growth in fiscal 2023.”

The “Memorandum for the Next Generation: NCKU on Talent Cultivation for Future World” ( 給下一世代的人才備忘錄 ) is published in November 2021 and outlines seven global competencies as the Imagination as the ability to anticipate the future the agility to keeping up with a changing world a critical mindset to define the problem the wisdom gathering with self-learning ability the curiosity to explore the unknown and the extraordinary the vision to inclusion and global culture and finally the achievement of mutual prosperity.”

“NCKU has deployed a successful global talent development strategy and its cooperation with semiconductor industry has been a landmark” commented Mon Chi Lio Political Deputy Minister of Education. “Internationalization will profoundly change the higher education in the next decade and the university should do their best to prepare the students and enhance their global mobility for the highly competitive global market as well as create an international campus recruit more international students to compensate the declining young population in this aging society” Mon Chi Lio also stress on the various policies to promote of the academia-industry collaboration for future talent cultivation and the driving force for the higher education in Taiwan.

The Global Future Forum “Pathway to a new Global Competence and Bilingual Education Paradigm” held on June 28th in Taipei

“NCKU is the first university to launch the semi-conductor college in Taiwan as a successful Academia-Industry collaboration” noted Dr. Yen Yi Lee Director-General of the Department of International and Cross-strait Education at the Ministry of Education . Dealing with challenges from globalization to flipped classroom the higher education institutions would be benefited from the bilingual policy the Skilled Personnel Training Innovation Act the SPROUT Project and the Yushan Scholar Program . She concluded that the n ew generation talents should be equipped with global mobility new technology skills and liberal arts education.

Bilingual education international cooperation and partnership with industry have been outlined by other speakers at the forum.

“Cultivating international talents with English proficiency is an important part of the global roadmap to 2030 and the BEST program by the Ministry of Education” commented Ralph Rogers Director of British Council in Taiwan an organization aiming to create strong inclusive and globally connected higher education systems and improve standards of the teaching learning and assessment of English.

“NCKU partners with Mitacs to re-imagine education and transcends national borders between Taiwan and Canada” commented Ed Jager Director of Trade & Investment at the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei. Mitacs is a not-for-profit organization to develop industrial research placements for graduate students and Postdoctoral fellows and team up with NCKU to provide funding connect expertise of researchers across the Taiwan and Canada. He added “Taiwan is vigilant to take on a proactive approach to embrace globalization and increase the international cooperation.”

“International students facilitate the integration in campus life and academic curriculum. They are new talents and can be a strong asset in a country’s soft power strategy” commented Dr. Josef Goldberger Director of the DAAD Information Center Taipei. He advises that the universities should take the initiative to prepare the international students for entering the local workforce.

“The future talent cultivation takes on six key approaches” proposed Jeremy Cornforth Deputy Director of the American Institute in Taiwan: future talent development in all aspects of a society; a transition to an innovation-based economy; Taiwan workforce internationalization; leaders with a global outlook on top of the technical know-how; the strong skills for communication leadership and English language as well as an international mindset. He also stressed on empowering talents in diversity equity inclusion and accessibility.

“Taiwan students ranked top 5 on the global competence by the Programme for International Student assessment (PISA)” noted Mark Pearson Director of the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office. To move forward to the Bilingual 2030 an international curriculum and student mobility would be great support as well as the cooperation with the foreign institutions in Taiwan.

“A mindset for growth the skills for collaboration and the courage to lean in and lead – these are our requirements for the future talent” stated Milan Chang Talent Acquisition Director of Micron Technology a world leading company in innovating memory and storage solution to deliver the world’s broadest portfolio of technologies such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles.

“The pursuit of truth and the cultivation of future talents are the mission of universities” concluded President Su to wrap up the forum. It is part of NCKU BEST program (the Bilingual Education for Students in College) initiated by the Ministry of Education based on the “Blueprint for Developing Taiwan into a Bilingual Nation by 2030” issued by the Executive Yuan in December 2018.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzAzLzMtdG9wLWNoaXAtc3RvY2tzLXRvLXN1cHBsZW1lbnQteW91ci1udmlkaWEtYW5kLWFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Top Chip Stocks to Supplement Your Nvidia and AMD Position,"The semiconductor industry is seemingly in a tailspin but there's extreme value to be had out there.

The semiconductor industry is being hit hard. Proof is piling up that consumers are slowing their spend on electronics (after two years of a spending spree on work-from-home updates). A possible recession is also weighing on investor sentiment casting doubt on the sustainability of business spending on tech hardware. High-flyers Nvidia (NVDA -1.72%) and AMD (AMD -0.87%) are being hit particularly hard with each down 51% and 49% respectively through the first half of 2022.

Such cycles are the norm for chip stocks though and incredible value can be found. That's why three Fool.com contributors think chip fab equipment leader Applied Materials (AMAT -0.74%) automotive chip design and manufacturer NXP Semiconductor (NXPI -0.38%) and display materials and tech licensor Universal Display (OLED -0.63%) are a great way to supplement existing chip stock positions.

Help wanted: New chip manufacturing capacity

Nicholas Rossolillo (Applied Materials): Shares of Applied Materials were sinking like a stone in sympathy with Nvidia and other chip stocks to kick off the month of July. Why? Thank Micron Technology (MU -0.77%) manufacturer of basic commodity memory chips that are used in everything from graphics cards to tablets to cloud-computing servers. Micron cited slowing consumer demand for some devices when it issued weaker-than-expected guidance for its summer quarter.

Applied Materials is a top provider of equipment to the memory chip industry so it's been particularly sensitive to all the talk about economic slowdown and possible recession. Nevertheless this flies in the face of Applied and its peers who have been saying there's strong demand for fab equipment well into 2023 and beyond. The global chip shortage has exposed inadequate capacity to manufacture basic tech components and Applied should be able to steadily grow for the next few years as it supplies the heavy equipment needed to produce memory and other pieces of circuitry.

Granted supply chain issues have put limits on how much equipment can be assembled and shipped in recent quarters. During its fiscal 2022 second quarter (the three months ended May 1 2022) Applied reported year-over-year sales growth of just 12%. However since help in increasing manufacturing capacity isn't going away any delayed shipments would just be pushed back into 2023. Either way Applied has a big backlog of demand for its products and services.

That's why I think Applied Materials is an awesome deal at less than 15 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. It's a dividend stock and the company also repurchases lots of shares during periods of decline like right now to boost returns. If you ask me this is a top way to supplement any existing chip stocks in your portfolio with a long-term market outperformer.

This auto and industrial chip designer is an acquisition target and supercheap

Billy Duberstein (NXP Semiconductors): Semiconductor downturns are usually scary as chips are known to be economically sensitive and prone to booms and busts. While we were in a boom to start 2022 it looks as though we are about to go through a downturn of some kind.

However over the long term investors get rewarded for that volatility. Over the past 10 years which encompassed about five different semiconductor busts (including the current downturn) the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH -0.87%) has nearly tripled the returns of the broader market -- and this is after the crash in the sector this year. One would think investors would stick with a sector that has proven itself over the long term and yet so many traders still play the cycle.

The reason for this outperformance is that the semiconductor industry is a long-term growth industry and it will continue to be in the 2020s even if we are about to have a soft year. Moreover many chip companies still usually generate cash flow in downturns and repurchase a fair amount of stock when that happens.

One area that should grow even faster than the overall semi market and which should outperform the sector this year is automotive chips. Due to increasing chip content in cars advanced driver-assisted systems (ADAS) electrification and autonomy the auto chip sector is forecast to grow in the low double digits annually through 2028 according to Market Research Future projections. Moreover even though auto chips have been strong they should remain resilient since there was a downturn in 2019 and another weak year in 2020 due to Covid lockdowns. So there is still likely some catching up to do.

NXP Semiconductors has among the highest exposure to the auto sector with about 50% of its revenues coming from auto chips. Another 22% comes from industrial and Internet of Things chips which also appear to be in for a strong year as companies look to automate their factories and reduce labor costs. NXP makes a variety of auto chips including advanced radar systems electrification chips zonal processors and a variety of microcontrollers from the powertrain to comfort control. It also has a leadership position in a majority of the chips it sells to the auto industry.

If that's not enough to convince you it was recently reported that Korean chip giant Samsung wants to acquire NXP or at least another auto chip maker. When one of the largest chip-related conglomerates in the world is specifically targeting auto and industrial chips it's probably a good sign for the long-term growth of the sub-sector. Trading at just 10.5 this year's earnings estimates NXP looks awfully attractive at these levels

Catch this cyclical tech stock while the downswing lasts

Anders Bylund (Universal Display): Cyclical stocks can be beautiful. The trick is to identify the cyclical pattern buy some shares on the downswing and hold on for dear life across the inevitable bumps in the road.

Digital display technologist Universal Display is a very cyclical stock and the current downturn brought back share prices not seen since 2018. This may not be the exact bottom of the negative market action but Universal Display stands in a potentially profitable position right now.

Here's the thing: The organic light-emitting diode (OLED) researcher's stock prices have tended to mirror the company's revenue line quite closely in recent years:

However that pattern broke down in 2021. Universal Display kept delivering stronger and stronger top-line results but share prices fell dramatically anyhow. Trailing sales are up by 27% year over year but the stock is trading 55% lower.

Universal Display's OLED technology is finding its way into larger target markets these days such as mid-range smartphones in-dash car screens and large-screen TV sets. The power-sipping nature of OLED screens is a big selling point alongside display-quality benefits like perfectly black blacks incredible contrast ratios and stellar color reproduction.

As the market grows -- even in an era of constrained consumer spending and global manufacturing slowdowns -- Universal Display is also bringing new products to market that promise to expand its revenue take per square inch of OLED screen productions. The company's business prospects are as healthy as ever and you get to pick up shares at a massive discount. On top of all that Universal Display's formerly forgettable dividend policy is nothing to laugh at anymore offering a healthy 1.1% yield and an unbroken history of annual payout boosts since 2018.

That's why I'm still on the sidelines of AMD and Nvidia's overheated stock charts preferring to own Universal Display's healthy combination of stellar growth modest prices and robust dividends. This mid-cap growth stock is simply a great buy right now."

Why trust us?

You can find all sorts of comparisons if you search the internet for Microsoft Office versus Google apps. And these side-by-side comparisons are helpful if you’re deciding between the two productivity suites. If it comes to cost many simply find Google’s free apps like Docs Sheets and Slides the obvious choice.

But if you’re like me and use these types of applications many many times per day or even for running a small business you have to look at more than the price tag.

Recommended Videos

Here are the three main reasons that I choose to use and pay for Microsoft’s Office suite rather than use Google’s free apps.

Features

When it comes to the reasons we use these productivity applications their features have to play an integral part. While Google does a good job at introducing new features regularly its apps still miss several of the useful features that Microsoft provides.

While there are too many features to compare and list let’s look at a few that stand out in Microsoft’s applications that are either limited or not available in Google’s.

Microsoft Word versus Google Docs

Video insertion feature: If you create more than simple essays or articles you’ll appreciate the option to easily insert videos into your Word documents. You can add a video from your computer the stock collection or an online source like YouTube. Docs lacks the ability to insert a video.

Multiple viewing options: When you have a lengthy document Word offers helpful ways to view that document. You can use vertical or side-to-side views and see multiple pages at once. You can also type add rearrange cut copy and paste while using the multiple page view.

Mail merge labels and envelopes: As a full-featured word processor Microsoft Word also gives you a mail merge feature (and helpful wizard tool) that you can use for physical pieces as well as emails. Plus you can set up and print labels and envelopes and connect postage software if needed.

Microsoft Excel versus Google Sheets

Data visualization options: For displaying data graphically Excel offers many chart types that Sheets does not such as sunburst funnel surface stock and combo. In addition you can create a chart template in Excel that you can save and reuse.

Tables tables tables: With Excel you can easily convert data to a table which allows you to filter sort format name for formula references and manage as its own element within a sheet. Sheets does not offer a table feature only a table chart which is limited in features.

What-if analysis tools: When you have a result you want to accomplish but aren’t sure of the best way to get there you can use Excel’s What-If Analysis tools. With the Goal Seek Scenario Manager and Data Table features you can easily see what you need to reach your financial goal.

Microsoft PowerPoint versus Google Slides

Audio and screen recording: You may want to narrate your presentation or capture your screen on a slide. In PowerPoint you have both audio and screen recording options. Plus Microsoft is implementing a live camera feed feature in the near future. Slides does not offer any recording options.

A summary slide: Like a table of contents in Word a summary slide in PowerPoint contains images of slides you select that are directly linked. It’s more attractive than a textual table of contents in a visual presentation and makes navigating to other slides a breeze. Note: The feature is called Summary Zoom in PowerPoint.

Export options: Not every spot you want to present your slideshow can accommodate it. You might want to export your presentation as a video or even a GIF for a website or social media post. With PowerPoint you can do this easily while Slides only offers image or document file types.

Overall features

Here are just a few additional features that Microsoft Office offers over Google’s suite.

Granular control over formatting for fonts images charts and layouts.

A robust accessibility checker with recommendations and suggestions.

A large and versatile template collection for each application.

Offline access

No matter where you live or work there’s bound to be a power or internet outage at some point. Because the Microsoft Office applications have desktop versions that makes them the clear choice. Google’s applications are only available via the web.

Knowing that you can work from anywhere without an internet connection is also more attractive these days than it ever has been. Whether the beach park or a hotel that requires you to pay for internet you can continue working with Microsoft Office’s desktop applications.

Familiarity

One final reason for sticking with Microsoft Office over Google’s apps is familiarity. It’s hard to get around the fact that familiarity ultimately plays heavily into my continuing loyalty to Office. Microsoft Word debuted on Windows in 1989 and I’m one who’s been using it since the 90s. The interface has changed over time but never too much to make me look at other options.

Being comfortable with the applications you use is important. You want tools that you don’t have to stop and think about. You can simply click here click there and continue working. Familiarity with Microsoft Office’s applications is a true benefit.

All of this being said I do use Google’s free apps in certain situations. After all the sharing is super simple the integration with other Google services is a perk and places I work with use these tools because of the ease of access and price tag.

However even after all these years no matter which computer platform I use I’ll remain a loyal Microsoft Office user. Yes Word Excel and PowerPoint will continue to be my go-to productivity tools with Google’s apps as solid second choices.

For many years the only option was Microsoft Office if you wanted to work on documents without an internet connection. It was a firm favorite until Microsoft changed its model to a monthly subscription for Office 365. Google noticed a gap in the market and made some changes to take advantage. Here’s what you need to know about accessing and editing Google Docs when offline.

Microsoft Office and Google Docs

Google Workspace is similar to Microsoft’s Office 365 in that it serves as one destination to create and edit word documents presentations and spreadsheets. It’s free for all Google users but until 2019 you could only access your files online.

That changed when the search giant rolled out Google Docs Offline. The small browser extension lets you edit create and view your documents while offline. But the extension was only meant to work with Google Workspace.

Starting this week Google is implementing a big move that takes aim at Microsoft Office. Starting a few years ago you could import and edit Word documents in Google Docs. Now you can work offline with Microsoft Office files on your desktop.

What you can do about it

In a blog post Google explains that the feature brings the collaboration benefits of Google Workspace to Microsoft Office files. You don’t need to be online to edit comment and collaborate on Office files using Docs Sheets and Slides.

Any changes made to files while offline will sync to Google Drive once you are connected. But there is a caveat: You can only edit offline documents if you’ve previously opened them online and in Office Edit Mode. That’s because the file must be cached first so that you can make changes to a copy.

When you go online again the changes to both documents sync automatically. But remember that you can only use the new function if you install the Google Docs Offline browser extension.

The S&P 500 is officially in a bear market and is off to its worst start in more than 50 years.

Bear markets can be mentally taxing but they all end eventually and can be opportunities to buy great companies at discounted prices. Companies with competitive advantages and strong cash flows can deliver market-beating returns over the long run and are also well-positioned to capitalize during market downturns. Here are three companies that rake in cash consistently that you can add today -- and should help you sleep a little easier at night.

1. Mastercard

Mastercard (MA 0.82%) operates the world's second-largest payments network helping customers move money globally through its credit and debit cards and other payment products.

Mastercard's payment network gives the company a major competitive advantage because of the network effect meaning as the network grows it's harder for competitors to come in and take away business. The network effect is also why Mastercard and Visa dominate the payments market holding 90% of the credit and debit card markets.

You can visualize this competitive advantage when looking at Mastercard's profit margin which has averaged nearly 40% over the past decade. Mastercard's business is also relatively asset-light and its free cash flow or cash left over after paying for operating expenses and capital assets has grown at almost a 13% compound annual growth rate in the last decade.

Strong free cash flow helps Mastercard reward investors through dividends and share buybacks and allows it to ride out the waves through different economic cycles. While other companies play defense as economic uncertainty persists Mastercard can play offense and make acquisitions at deep discounts -- among the reasons it could be an excellent addition to your portfolio.

2. S&P Global

S&P Global (SPGI 0.66%) gives ratings to companies worldwide and is an integral part of debt markets. When companies want to raise money by selling debt credit rating agencies like S&P Global evaluate the companies' risks and assign grades that determine how much interest they pay.

Regulations make it difficult to crack into the credit rating business. This high barrier to entry gives S&P Global a considerable advantage and is why S&P Global has a 40% market share about the same as Moody's Corporation.

This competitive advantage translates into high gross profit margins which have averaged nearly 70% over the last decade. These high margins are a big reason why S&P Global's free cash flow has grown at a 15% rate compounded annually.

One thing to keep in mind is that 50% of S&P Global's revenue comes from its credit ratings business -- which has slowed down drastically this year as debt issuance has fallen 35% in the U.S. Despite this S&P Global's other business units such as research analytics and index products grew 51% from last year and the company's total revenue grew from last year.

S&P Global's position as a top rating agency and its asset-light business model make it another stellar cash-generating stock you can add today that will help you sleep easy at night.

3. Progressive

Progressive (PGR -0.02%) primarily writes auto insurance policies for individuals and businesses. The company has developed a competitive edge pricing its policies by analyzing driving behavior known as telematics.

Telematics is a technology that tracks driving behavior using data collected from a device installed in your car or through the app on your phone. The data Progressive collects include things like mileage driven speed braking time and the time of the day driven. It then develops customized rates which can give drivers discounts for safe driving. Progressive made this widely available in 2011 through its Progressive Snapshot product giving it a first-mover's advantage.

This technological advantage has translated into industry-beating profitable policies for Progressive for years now. One way to measure profitability in the insurance industry is the combined ratio. This ratio is the total losses from insurance claims plus operating expenses divided by total earned premiums. A ratio below 100% means a company is writing policies at a profit; the lower the percentage the better. Progressive's combined ratio has consistently outperformed the industry for 20 years now.

This strong underwriting ability is why Progressive's free cash flow has grown at a 17% rate compounded annually over the last decade.

Progressive faces growing threats as more companies incorporate telematics into their businesses. However the company has years of data ahead of the competition which should help it continue outperforming the industry.

Progressive's technology and attention to detail in writing profitable policies make it another excellent cash-generating stock you can add to your portfolio that will help you rest easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Leonard David Bernstein 90 was charged with a felony of shooting with intent to kill according to Oklahoma Detention Center records. The victim was identified as 61-year-old Christopher Bayouth who was taken to the hospital and is expected to survive according to Oklahoma’s KFOR.

Bernstein was released on $50000 bail booking reports show.

A Morgan Stanley employee told police that the motive may have been connected to a work-related dispute as the two had been working together for nine months since Bayouth had taken over some of Bernstein’s accounts due to his declining health according to Oklahoma’s News on 6.

A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley which has around 16000 brokers said the firm is working with investigators.



“We are cooperating with the authorities and our thoughts are with our employee” the spokesperson said in a statement.

Bernstein could not be reached at two publicly listed phone numbers.

The employee in Oklahoma City reported hearing multiple shots until the gun’s slide locked back indicating that the ammunition clip had been emptied according to News on 6. Bernstein drove away and was caught at a traffic stop by police the local news outlet reported. Bayouth had been shot as many as five times with wounds to his torso back leg and foot according to a police report obtained by AdvisorHub.

Bernstein a 27-year industry veteran has no disciplinary actions discharges or investor complaints on his BrokerCheck record. He had rejoined Morgan Stanley in August last year after nine years at Wells Fargo Advisors according to the database.

Bernstein started his brokerage career at Morgan Stanley in 1994. He moved in 2012 to Wells Fargo Advisors along with three other brokers who had been managing $168 million in assets combined according to a Reuters report at the time.

Bayouth had been based at the same branch and has 33 years of industry experience all without any record of customer claims or other disclosure events according to the database. He started his career at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in 1988 and had been with Morgan Stanley since 1997 according to BrokerCheck.

Bayouth is listed as a vice president according to the branch website which shows 40 advisors at the Waterford location.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWVpbWVpZm94LzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvd2l0aC1taWxsaWNlbnQtc3RlbGxhLWR5ZXItYWltcy10by1maW5hbmNpYWxseS1lbXBvd2VyLXRoZS1kaXNlbmZyYW5jaGlzZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Millicent Stella Dyer Aims To Financially Empower The Disenfranchised,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meimeifox/2022/07/03/with-millicent-stella-dyer-aims-to-financially-empower-the-disenfranchised/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWVpbWVpZm94LzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvd2l0aC1taWxsaWNlbnQtc3RlbGxhLWR5ZXItYWltcy10by1maW5hbmNpYWxseS1lbXBvd2VyLXRoZS1kaXNlbmZyYW5jaGlzZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0bWFyeW5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy1sb2NhbC1zcG9ydHMvZGl4aWUteW91dGgtYWxsLXN0YXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dixie Youth All-Stars,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0bWFyeW5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy1sb2NhbC1zcG9ydHMvZGl4aWUteW91dGgtYWxsLXN0YXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlcm1hdG9sb2d5dGltZXMuY29tL3ZpZXcvaG90LXRvcGljcy1hdC10aGUtc3BkLTIwMjItNDd0aC1hbm51YWwtbWVldGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hot Topics at the SPD 2022 47th Annual Meeting,"The SPD 2022 47th Annual Meeting kicks off this year on July 8 with welcome remarks from 4 key opinion leaders in the field of dermatology:

The market sell-off has taken stock indexes from all-time highs at the start of the year to levels that are 20% lower for the S&P 500 and over 30% for the Nasdaq. Many Wall Street analysts believe these will fall further in the second half.

Tech stocks have been most brutally battered. Amazon is down 34%. Netflix has fallen over 60%. Non-tech stocks that raced toward all-time highs have also had tremendous sell-offs. Ford’s stock price has dropped 45% this year.

Some stocks are considered safe havens. Their businesses are often boring but stable. Many have strong dividend yields. Verizon probably should be on the top of this list.

Several public corporations are in deep financial trouble and their share prices could go much lower. An analyst at Morgan Stanley recently wrote that the stock price of cruise company Carnaval could drop to zero. The same comment has been made about troubled retailer Bed Bath & Beyond. Some companies which went public recently are in distress just as severely. Electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors traded as high as $9.68 in the last year. Recently it dropped to $1.60. Its cash balance challenge could push the price toward zero as well.

The worst stock to own for the balance of the year is Meta parent company of Facebook. So far the social media corporation’s stock is down 52% this year.

There are several reasons Meta an immensely popular and profitable investment until the middle of last year faces more hurdles. Government regulators want to limit the content that can appear on Facebook. Some of this content has been part of promoting hate crimes and discrimination. Meta management says it can and will regulate these. Some members of Congress and politicians in other countries believe otherwise.

An author recently wrote in the Guardian “Facebook’s sheer size and market dominance remain a significant barrier to change and a growing chorus of lawmakers and others are calling for a simple solution: break it up.” Such a breakup could cause uncertainty about stock value and if Facebook is broken up how will the pieces be valued in the public markets?

Facebook’s primary business headwind is the recession. Facebook relies almost completely on advertising for its revenue. Advertising rates usually fall sharply when the economy turns down

Dump Meta shares. Facebook is in trouble.

PIDC an economic development nonprofit founded by the City of Philadelphia has owned the Navy Yard since 2000. The agency has partnered with real estate investor Ensemble/Mosaic on the $6 billion plan which would add 8.9 million square feet of residential retail science and multi-use development to the waterfront site.

Ensemble/Mosaic which is investing more than $4 billion into the project plans to build 3900 apartment units and 235000 square feet of retail space. Of the apartments 15% will be offered at affordable rates and 25% of retail space will be subsidized for minority and women-owned businesses.

Chapel Block which was unveiled by PIDC in 2021 as part of an update to its Navy Yard Master Plan included more than 600 apartment units as the basis for the expansion of a new residential neighborhood at the edge of the city.

PIDC has put forward three redevelopment plans so far that have built off of the existing infrastructure of the Navy Yard with funding provided by partners every few years. The partnership between PIDC and Ensemble/Mosaic would be its largest investment to date.

The agency released its first plan in 2004 attempting to add corporate offices hotels mixed-use development on the waterfront and the potential for residential properties.

In the years between the implementation of the original redevelopment plan and an update in 2013 several businesses moved to the large public space including an Urban Outfitters headquarters TastyKake and several pharmaceutical companies.

""The Navy Yard has been an anchor and economic driver for Philadelphia for more than two centuries serving in both times of war and peace"" Mayor Jim Kenney said on Tuesday. ""Today the progress it has made and will continue to make as outlined in this plan will help reinforce its role as a leading business and life sciences campus and unrivaled asset to the city.""

Renderings by James Corner Field Operations/Courtesy of PIDC and Ensemble/Mosaic This is the third development plan offered by PIDC since it took ownership of the Navy Yard in 2004. This large-scale project would expand on its existing life sciences infrastructure and add more lab and office space.

The 2013 update grew from the initial plan proposing larger-scale office development and more than 20 new buildings in each segment of the yard. The bulk of the plan included the addition of new corporate offices and an expansion of the Port of Philadelphia.



The addition of residential properties has been a major goal of the Master Plan since its unveiling nearly 20 years ago. Though zoning restrictions and other issues have made it difficult to implement a September 2021 update brought PIDC closer to being able to lease out residential space and build the foundations of a community.

Much of the controversy surrounding the Master Plan's housing proposals was based on Navy deed regulations that barred housing in parts of the public space. Those regulations had been in place since the Navy Yard entered city ownership but were relaxed in 2019.

As a result PIDC and its partners were able to support the creation of at least 1000 to 1500 apartment units in the area's Historic Core district which is where most of the apartment units have been proposed since 2013.

It remains unclear whether those regulations will allow for the almost 4000 apartment units proposed by Ensemble/Mosaic though PIDC noted in a developer document in 2019 that additional residential plans outside of the Historic Core would require special permission from the Navy.

Whether the 2022 plan is able to come to fruition is largely dependent on the partnerships formed between PIDC and its corporate and investing teams. Currently the Navy Yard hosts 150 employers and 15000 workers and hopes to expand that with 12000 jobs over the next two decades.

In the years since PIDC has controlled the Navy Yard it has expanded its life sciences campus with a focus on cell and gene therapies. The new plan would build out 4.3 million square feet of additional lab and office space for companies working to cure cancer and chronic diseases.

""Throughout its history the Navy Yard has been at the leading edge of innovation and this transformative plan continues to break new ground"" said Kate McNamara PIDC's senior vice president of the Navy Yard. ""We are incredibly excited to set a new standard for equitable development that balances inclusive business growth with sustainability connectivity beautiful public spaces and quality jobs for all Philadelphians.""

A new 137000 square foot science research facility will begin adding tenants in 2023 building off of the existing life science lab and research spaces that have been built on the property in recent years.



""Our focus the entire way through the plan development has been to remember that the Navy Yard is public land and its development should be about people"" said Kam Babaoff chairman and co-founder of Ensemble Real Estate Investments. ""Every one of the 109 acres we develop – whether for the first residential property in more than 70 years or for thriving retail life science and corporate use – will increase accessibility and provide an environment that supports equity in all facets.""

Renderings by James Corner Field Operations/Courtesy of PIDC and Ensemble/Mosaic Ensemble/Mosaic is set to build 3900 apartment units and 235000 square feet of retail space. 15% of the apartments will be leased at affordable rates and 25% of retail space will be subsidized for minority and women-owned businesses.

Investments into expansive public transit were also hallmarks of the earlier plans and additional investments from Ensemble/Mosaic could bring them closer to reality. The project development includes several transportation consultants as the Navy Yard expects to expand its public transit reach to make the residential and retail space more accessible to the rest of the city.

In addition to driving and parking expansion there will be dedicated bike lanes rapid bus lines pedestrian-only streets and a new transit center connecting the Navy Yard to Broad Street.

The plan also seeks to expand open space and support the waterfront adding stormwater canals dry ponds and other environmental protections.

The Navy Yard will utilize its own workforce training program – launched by PIDC and the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative in 2020 – to assist in growing the area and bringing quality-waged jobs to the new community.



The Navy Yard Skills Initiative graduated 64 participants on Tuesday afternoon just in time for the plan unveiling and subsequent block party.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBxYm5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL25hbm9vc2UtYmF5LWNyZXctcmVjb2duaXplZC1mb3ItbG9uZ3N0YW5kaW5nLXNhZmV0eS1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1ieS1tb3NhaWMtMTIwNDQyNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nanoose Bay crew recognized for longstanding safety performance by Mosaic,"Forest company honours contractors for excellence in various areas

The look most often materializes as an array of multi-colored stones set around the bezel of a timepiece (famously on the Rolex Cosmograph Daytona for example) but has in some cases appeared as varying bright hues on hour markers and indices as seen on Breitling’s hit Superocean 57 Heritage Rainbow. Having already done the traditional take on models like the Royal Oak Frosted Gold Double Balance Wheel Openworked Audemars Piguet offered a new twist on the trend last month when it debuted a Royal Oak Selfwinding Carolina Bucci Limited Edition featuring an iridescent mirror dial which appears black or charcoal at first glance but reveals various ROYGBIV colors as the wrist moves beneath certain lighting. That model came in the brand’s ultra-hot black ceramic version of the 34 mm Selfwinding reference.

Flipping the script the latest all-black ceramic timepiece with a rainbow dial iteration comes in 43 mm on the Royal Oak Offshore. This model comes with a black rubber strap (turquoise yellow and green straps are also included) instead of a black ceramic bracelet and features a tapisserie dial—the company’s instantly recognizable waffle-shaped design—with rainbow colors arranged in various squares to mimic the look of a music equalizer used in music studio sound mixing. It is also available in a 43 mm titanium version on a blue rubber strap and a 37 mm titanium reference with a blue rubber strap featuring a mosaic design both limited to 500 pieces each. For those that prefer a blinged-up rainbow watch there is also a 37 mm titanium piece with the same blue rubber mosaic strap that comes with multi-colored gems both on the bezel and in the equalizer design on the dial.

The 43 mm black ceramic reference however is limited to 250 suggesting that the company already knows this will be the model clients are vying to put on the wrist and in the vault. While the Carolina Bucci mirrored-style rainbow dial on the Royal Oak is arguably still the must-have at 34 mm its fit may be a bit diminutive for some. Besides the likelihood that you would be able to get your hands on one a month after the launch is slim to none. But don’t expect the Royal Oak Offshore Selfwinding Music Editions to be any easier. A word to the wise: If you want one you better start courting your local AP retail managers ASAP.

If you're not buying ETFs in your retirement account you should probably consider it. There are hundreds of popular and reputable ETFs that are designed to deliver different types of performance. Whether you're trying to maximize growth in your Roth IRA or trying to limit volatility in your 401(k) there are ETFs that can provide everything you need to meet your retirement goals.

1. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY 0.11%) is the quintessential index fund of the ETF world. It's one of the oldest largest and most popular financial products of its kind. The fund doesn't do anything too crazy -- it just holds stocks that are meant to replicate the performance of the S&P 500. That makes this ETF a useful cornerstone for nearly any strategy when combined with other more specific investments.

This passive strategy allows for a razor-thin 0.09% expense ratio which means investor returns aren't eroded year after year. The fund's popularity leads to high trading volume which makes it highly liquid with low trading costs. These are all great features that make this a great piece of any retirement ETF strategy.

2. Vanguard Growth ETF

The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG -0.04%) is a straightforward investment vehicle for investors who seek higher growth than a typical stock market index. The Vanguard Growth fund is passively managed and it's meant to provide higher upside exposure without excessive risk. Its selection criteria include several screens for earnings and sales expansion across multiple time frames so it holds stocks that are consistently growing. It currently has around 250 holdings.

Unlike the ETFs that track the S&P 500 the Vanguard Growth ETF also holds mid-cap stocks. That helps investors mix up some performance and potentially outpace the market. The ETF's 0.04% expense ratio is as low as it gets so that's great for net returns. Younger investors who are building assets for a retirement a few decades down the road should consider a growth-heavy portfolio in their IRA or 401(k).



3. iShares Russell 2000 ETF

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM 0.23%) is one of the most efficient investments for diversified exposure to small-cap stocks. Small caps tend to be more volatile than their larger counterparts but they can also provide more upside. Many of tomorrow's dominant industry leaders are currently in their formative stages and investors who get on board today will experience explosive returns. Small caps are also popular among factor investors and the smart beta crowd with research indicating that smaller companies have tended to outperform larger ones over the long term.

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF has a relatively high expense ratio among index funds at 0.19% so you have to pay a premium for this. That's still far below the typical fees for actively managed and niche funds.

4. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF

The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD 0.15%) is one of the best options available for investors who want dividend income from their portfolio. The fund holds 100 stocks all of which have at least a 10-year history of distributing cash to shareholders. The fund's selection criteria target financial health operational efficiency dividend growth and yield. The resulting portfolio is composed of companies with sustainable and reliable dividends.

It currently boasts a 3.42% distribution yield which is well above the market average. This also comes with a super-low 0.06% expense ratio and great liquidity. Dividends are especially important for investors who are retired (or approaching retirement) so the Schwab Dividend Equity ETF could be a great option for older households looking to sell off some of their growth assets.

5. iShares MSCI International Quality Factor ETF

The iShares MSCI International Quality Factor ETF (IQLT 0.39%) is another option for investors prioritizing stability. This fund screens its potential holdings based on return on equity the debt-to-equity ratio and earnings variability. It then weighs the portfolio based on quality score rather than market cap so its largest holdings are the stocks that are the best fit. The ETF is composed of profitable consistent stocks. That's generally not the recipe for the highest growth or dividends but it can be extremely attractive for retirees and other risk-averse investors.

Even though the fund doesn't specifically target dividend stocks its selection methodology tends to favor companies that pay dividends. Its 3.57% distribution yield is high. It's also a global fund so it provides great exposure to economies outside of the United States. Investors probably aren't thrilled with the 0.3% expense ratio but that's still manageable.",,,,,,,,,
NDAQ,"Nasdaq, Inc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy9raW5kLWludmVzdG9ycy1vd24tbW9zdC1zYXRzdW1hLTE0NDgxMTM1NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Kind Of Investors Own Most Of Satsuma Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:STSA)?,"A look at the shareholders of Satsuma Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:STSA) can tell us which group is most powerful. Generally speaking as a company grows institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.

Satsuma Pharmaceuticals is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$136m which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company below shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner to discover more about Satsuma Pharmaceuticals.

Check out our latest analysis for Satsuma Pharmaceuticals

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Satsuma Pharmaceuticals?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Satsuma Pharmaceuticals does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Satsuma Pharmaceuticals' earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

It would appear that 21% of Satsuma Pharmaceuticals shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. The company's largest shareholder is RA Capital Management L.P. with ownership of 19%. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 12% and 10.0% of the shares outstanding respectively. Furthermore CEO John Kollins is the owner of 1.0% of the company's shares.

On looking further we found that 55% of the shares are owned by the top 5 shareholders. In other words these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Satsuma Pharmaceuticals

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Satsuma Pharmaceuticals Inc.. As individuals the insiders collectively own US$1.4m worth of the US$136m company. This shows at least some alignment but we usually like to see larger insider holdings. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

With a 20% ownership the general public mostly comprising of individual investors have some degree of sway over Satsuma Pharmaceuticals. While this group can't necessarily call the shots it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 35% private equity firms could influence the Satsuma Pharmaceuticals board. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.

Public Company Ownership

We can see that public companies hold 5.0% of the Satsuma Pharmaceuticals shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Satsuma Pharmaceuticals you should be aware of and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.

Here’s a look forward at everything scheduled to hit Netflix US between July 4th (Happy Independence Day!) and July 10th 2022.

There’s still lots to look forward to throughout the month of July 2022 and we’re still getting lots of new release announcements as time passes. As always we’ll be documenting everything new on Netflix daily via our new on Netflix hub.

Before we dive into the full list of what’s coming up here’s our top 3 picks of the week:

Boo Bitch (Limited Series)

Coming to Netflix: Friday

A new limited series headlined by Lana Condor headlines Netflix’s own TV lineup this week. Condor is perhaps best known for her Netflix movie series To All The Boys but will be playing a drastically different role this week in the form of Erika Vu.

The crux of the series is about two friends who have a hard time getting noticed at school but things change when one turns into a ghost. It’s an odd concept with potential so let’s see how it turns out this Friday.

12 Strong (2018)

Coming to Netflix: Sunday

Chris Hemsworth is the biggest name in town right now. He’s just come off the back of releasing Spiderhead on Netflix and heading into the coming weeks you’ll be seeing him in Disney’s new Marvel entry Thor: Love and Thunder which is hitting theaters.

Hoping to capitalize further on the Hemsworth mania this week is the licensing of the often overlooked Warner Bros movie 12 Strong.

The war movie is about a team of special forces who went into Afghanistan following the September 11th attacks in an attempt to dismantle the Taliban.

The Sea Beast (2022)

Coming to Netflix: Friday

Not only is The Sea Beast Netflix’s most ambitious animated titles to date employing the talents of former Disney director Chris Williams but it’s also one of our most anticipated movies for the entire year.

The Sea Beast follows the crew of a ship that’s infamous for being the best at hunting down legendary sea monsters but everything changes when a young girl finds herself on board the ship.

Among the voice cast for the movie includes Karl Urban (The Boys) Zaris-Angel Hator Jared Harris and Dan Stevens.

If you buy through our links we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.

Criminal Minds fans it finally happened. After years of being able to stream the longtime procedural drama on Netflix the streamer said goodbye to the hit TV series. In other words it might be a little harder for folks to get to know (or revisit) the fan-favorite group of criminal profilers in the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) of the FBI.

Before we do anything let's recap what's going on. After 15 seasons of airing on CBS the show ended in early 2020. While viewers were not too thrilled about its abrupt finish their faith was restored in February 2021 when an announcement revealed a reboot was coming out on Paramount+. Yes there may have been back and forth over whether the show was officially ""dead."" But Deadline reported early this year in February that a revival was still on the table with six actors returning: Joe Mantegna Kirsten Vangsness Adam Rodriguez A.J. Cook Aisha Tyler and Paget Brewster making the news that much sweeter.

Here's the thing though: Until we know more information about the reboot (like when it will premiere) fans will need to figure out a new way to stream the original series since it's no longer on Netflix. Read on to learn more details about how you can continue getting your fill of investigative cases.

It's a spectacular lookout area where people can watch mining activity happening in the Hollinger open pit mine and see many familiar areas of the city's landscape.

The three-hundred and sixty degree unobstructed view of the mining operation and the city became open to the public as of Friday afternoon.

“We’re expecting people to come up here have their lunch; watch the operation. There’s plenty of seating. We’ve had requests for wedding pictures. We’ve had requests for weddings up here"" said Bryan Neeley sustainability and external relations manager for Newmont Porcupine.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind when visiting the landmark. There are only eleven parking spots at the top of the berm including one accessible planking place but there is another location at the bottom of the berm.

The viewing area is only open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and security guards will ask people to leave during blasting times. It will shut down for the winter season on October 1st.

“To tell you the truth this is a phenomenon for Timmins"" said Helga Kroll chairperson of the Hollinger Project Community Advisory Committee. ""It’s something that Timmins has never seen before.

Melody Bruneau of Timmins was able to wave at her husband on Saturday who was on the job for Newmont Porcupine.

“I’m watching my husband down in the pit getting loaded right now. So it’s pretty cool. I’m really excited"" she said.

Another woman Dellanie Robitaille who recently moved to Timmins from Sudbury said it's great to see a mine she's learned about at Cambrian College during her mining engineering technology program.

The 65-year-old model and actress filed a petition in Superior Court of California citing ""irreconcilable differences"" as legal grounds for divorce.

In her petition she also sought unspecified spousal support from 91-year-old media mogul Murdoch and wants him to pay for her attorney's fees.

She said in the petition she is ""unaware of the full nature and extent of all (Murdoch's) assets and debts and will amend this petition when the information has been ascertained.""

Hall's attorney Ronald Brot did not immediately respond to Reuters request for a comment.

Murdoch and Hall married in a low-key ceremony in central London's Spencer House in March 2016. It was Murdoch's fourth marriage and Hall's second.

The Fox Corp chairman controls News Corp and Fox Corp through a Reno Nevada-based family trust that holds roughly a 40 percent stake in voting shares of each company.

It’s all part of the Clearwater Wind Project that NextEra Energy Resources is building.

Construction is ahead of schedule on the wind farm which the company says will be the largest in Montana.

""The reason we are here obviously is because of the wind. This is where the wind is” says Jess Melin executive director for NextEra. “I think here in eastern Montana we have found a gold mine here.”

Q2 News Miles City wind farm

A lot of research went into putting the wind farm here and Melin is certain they found the right spot.

“We have over 10 years of onsite meteorological data. We know how much the wind blows we know when it blows we know how it blows over the land. We combine that with satellite data and models to determine where to put the turbines” says Melin.

Melin says animal species in the area and landowners' requests were also considered before construction began on the wind farm.

Eventually close to 300 wind turbines— each roughly as tall as a 40-story building—will snake through parts of Garfield Rosebud and Custer counties.

The first phase of the project which includes around 130 turbines is moving closer to completion.

An 85-mile power line is being built to transfer the power that is harnessed from the farm to the substation in Colstrip where existing transmission lines will be used to send the power to Washington state.

Puget Sound Energy based in Bellevue Washington has rights to purchase the energy from the first phase of the project for customers in the Pacific Northwest.

The wind farm will eventually provide about 750 megawatts of electricity—enough to power about 135000 homes.

Q2 News Miles City wind farm

While the energy harnessed here won’t stay in Montana Melin says this part of the state will still reap a lot of benefits.

“At the end of the 30 years we will have paid over $200 million in property taxes in these three local counties and all of the landowners who are our partners for 30 years we will have paid them over $200 million in land payments” says Melin.

That’s not to mention the money brought into the local economy by the hundreds of construction workers who have been busy working on the project.

Wind energy has come a long way in recent years. Not only are the turbines taller and blades longer but new technology also makes it easier to capture the wind.

“Each of these turbines has its own little weather station on top and so they are always communicating with each other. When the wind starts hitting the north part of the farm it will send a signal out to tell the rest of the farm this is where the wind is shifting to. Each turbine will independently turn into the wind and pitch the blades to maximize the capture of that energy” says Melin.

The turbines have a life expectancy of 30 years but can be refitted with new blades and a new generator so there’s a good chance this wind farm will be providing power for many decades into the future.

The first phase of the wind farm is expected to be online by September or October of this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Nike Dunk is one of the most iconic shoes in sneaker history and 35 years after the original “Be true to you school” sneaker campaign. Atlanta HBCU Clark Atlanta is set to become one of the first historically black college and university with its own Nike Dunk colorway.

What started in 1985 as Nike’s original team shoe initially named the “College Color High.” The Dunk sneaker was first a mash-up of other Nike sneakers – including the Air Force 1 from 1982 and Air Jordan 1 which debuted just months before it.

The first “Be true to you school” Nike Dunk Highs were released in the colorways of some of the top college basketball schools of the era.

Made for the then Nike-sponsored schools of University of Michigan University of Kentucky University of Iowa Georgetown Syracuse St. John’s and UNLV. One additional Georgetown-edition Nike Terminator was later released to round out the eight classic Dunk models.

Since their release in 1985 the Dunk has gone from basketball shoe to high fashion while establishing a cult following around the globe. Creating “sneaker holy grail” collaborations with the Wu-Tang Clan Virgil Abloh’s “off-white” Stussy and the Diamond Supply Co.

Now it appears there’s an HBCU in the Nike Dunk mix as leaked images of a Clark Atlanta x Nike Dunk Low have hit the internet.

Michael Le of Sneakernews.com describes the the CAU x Nike Dunk Low as a “full-fledged love letter to the school itself.”

Not only is the shoe made in the schools red black and grey colorway the Clark Atlanta motto – “FIND A WAY OR MAKE ONE” – is repeated all over the laces while the Panthers’ logo is stitched on both the tongue and outsole as well as embedded within the insole.

The history of CAU is featured prominently on the shoe as well. “Clark College” is written on the backside of the tongue and the heel has “1988” embroidered across the tab both of which reference the year Clark College merged with Atlanta University to form Clark Atlanta University.

While there is no release date yet nicekicks.com says they are “expected to drop later this year.” So for now we’ll have to settle for these leaked images until the Nike HBCU collaboration makes its way on the yard.

Dozens of NBA players have made a pilgrimage there to play in front of die-hard hoops fans. Everyone from Kobe Bryant to James Harden to LaMelo Ball has displayed their skills at the annual event.

No player is as synonymous with the Drew League as Chicago Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan. The Compton native has played in the league since he was 14. Not only has the prodigy hooper turned into a 5-time NBA All-Star but he has often used the event to showcase his footwear.

DeRozan's respect for the late-great Kobe Bryant is well-documented. No player in the association has a stronger collection of Nike Kobe's than DeRozan. In the past DeRozan has debuted new Kobe's at the Drew League. While the local legend didn't wear a new model he did rock a pair of player exclusives that have not been released to the public.

The kicks worn by DeRozan are a black and white pair of Nike Kobe 6 Protros. For the novice sneakerhead 'Protro' is a conjunction of the words 'performance' and 'retro.' Before Bryant's untimely passing Nike began re-releasing his older shoes with updated technology advancements.

In April 2021 Nike and the Bryant estate let the contract lapse when they could not agree on a new contract. Luckily for fans the two parties announced a new partnership in March 2022. Vanessa Bryant said ""fans will soon be able to have access to Kobe and Gigi Nike product for years to come.""

This is welcomed news to Kobe fans and sneakerheads alike. While we wait on more Kobe's to hit shelves it appears DeRozan will continue to tantalize us with more unobtainable shoes.

That’s according to Limerick City East Labour Party councillor Elena Secas who said that the Castletroy area is one of the fastest growing areas in Munster and it will now be left without a bus service.

“There are around 1000 new homes being built in Annacotty we have a few schools in the area and we have got a much needed approval for an extension to Castletroy College.

“Students and residents on Groody Road as well as employees of Northern Trust and other businesses on the Ballysimon Road rely on the bus service to get to work university or the city centre. There is a new secondary school under construction as well as planning permission for a new private hospital on Groody Road.”

“How can these areas be left without any bus service?” Cllr Secas asked.

“These areas are full of young families students and an increasing number of elderly people who deserve good public transport.”

“I have previously asked Bus Eireann to extend their 304a route to include Newtown the route from Monaleen School to Super Valu Groody Road and Ballysimon Road. I have been told that this wouldn’t happen given that there is a private operator serving these areas.

“If we had public transport serving these areas residents would not be in this position now left with no bus service at all. This is simply not good enough. Bus Eireann services every other suburb of Limerick so why not all of Castletroy?

“With increasing fuel costs many more are considering looking at alternative ways to get to work or school. If we are serious about moving away from a car-dominated city we need a public transport service to cater for the big population in Castletroy/Annacotty” Cllr Secas added.",,,,,,,,,

~

Press Release Dulles 02 July 2022: Northrop Grumman Corporation played a vital role in the successful launch and deployment of the US Space Force (USSF)-12 mission which launched last night from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. As part of this mission a Northrop Grumman-built ESPAStar satellite and a Wide Field of View testbed missile detection satellite launched on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket powered by Northrop Grumman-provided solid rocket boosters and other critical components.

The ESPAStar platform supports a wide range of missions by utilising the ESPA standard. ESPAStar is equipped with multiple payload ports that can accommodate hosted and free-flying payloads.

“ESPAStar provides rapid access to space” said Troy Brashear vice president national security systems Northrop Grumman. “As the ESPAStar mission owner we combined critical technology into a single cohesive mission including hardware integration and test ground software command and control development and integration mission execution planning and on-orbit operations.”

Four of the company’s 63-inch-diameter Graphite Epoxy Motors (GEM 63) solid rocket boosters provided approximately 1.5 million pounds of thrust at launch to help lift the rocket and payload from the pad. Earlier this month the company finalised a contract for its GEM solid rocket boosters to fly on ULA’s next-generation Vulcan rocket one of the largest commercial solid rocket motor contracts in history.

Northrop Grumman also provided numerous subsystems for the ESPAStar bus including the solar arrays propellant tanks satellite and star tracker structures.

Using advanced fibre placement manufacturing and automated inspection techniques Northrop Grumman produced the composite first-stage heat shield the Centaur Interstage Adapter that houses the second-stage engine and the broadtail that adapts from the core vehicle to the five-metre diameter fairing. The company also manufactured hydrasine propellant tanks which feed the Centaur Upper Stage reaction control system to provide guidance and control.

How Did It Go?

United Launch Alliance (ULA) launched two spacecrafts for the U.S. Space Force’s Space Systems Command (SSC) and the Department of Defense (DoD). This mission saw the use of an Atlas V 541 launching from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida USA. On board of USSF-12 were the Wide Field of View (WFOV) testbed for the SSC and the USSF-12 Ring spacecraft for the DoD’s Space Test Program (STP). Both satellites were ferried directly into a geosynchronous orbit. This mission marked ULA’s fourth launch in 2022 with OFT-2 the third back in May of 2022.

After the Centaur Upper Stage was put into its initial highly elliptical orbit it entered a five-hour coast phase after which it reached apogee. At apogee its RL-10 engine fired up for a third and final time to insert both payloads directly into the target orbit. Separated by ten minutes both satellites were separated from the Centaur Upper Stage which performed its “Blowdown”. The mission ended approximately seven hours after lift off.

USSF-12

USSF-12’s primary payload is the U.S. Space Force’s SSC’s Wide Field of View (WFOV) testbed with a secondary payload for the DoD’s STP.

Wide Field Of View (WFOV) Testbed

The WFOV testbed is an Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) technology demonstrator that will mature and prove the effectiveness of its 6-degree staring sensor called Wide-Area Six-Degree Payload (WASP). Developed by L3 Harris under a separate contract WASP will be able to observe nearly one third of Earth’s surface. WFOV will be capable of performing strategic and tactical missions such as battlespace awareness and missile warning and directly supporting warfighters by monitoring Earth’s surface respectively. With pathfinding the process to operationalize OPIR data the WFOV testbed will play an important role as part of the Missile Warning Tracking and Defense architecture.

The WFOV testbed is based on Millennium Space System’s Aquila M8 satellite bus. It has two deployable solar arrays offering a baseline payload power of 2500 W (options up to 10 kW) is powered by a bi-propellant propulsion system and single or dual string avionics. The Aquila M8 satellite bus is Millennium Space System’s biggest satellite bus in their line-up weighing ~3000 kg with a payload accommodation of over 350 kg. It’s designed to operate 3 to 5 years on orbit.

USSF-12 Ring Spacecraft

The secondary payload of the USSF-12 mission is an ESPA (EELV Secondary Payload Adapter) Star platform built by Northrop Grumman weighing 740-780 kg with room for up to six hosted or up to twelve deployable payloads. Each of the six payload slots is designed for payloads of around 320 kg (1920 kg in total). It has a four-panel deployable solar array providing 1200 W of power and a hydrazine based hypergolic propulsion system.

The USSF-12 Ring spacecraft is a classified mission that will demonstrate future technology for the DoD.

What Is The Atlas V?

The Atlas V is an expendable medium-lift launch system and member of the Atlas rocket family. The rocket has two stages. The first is a Common Core Booster (CCB) which is powered by a single RD-180 engine that burns kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen (LOx). This is accompanied by up to five strap-on solid rocket boosters (SRB). The second stage is the Centaur upper stage which is powered by one or two RL10 engines and burns liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) and liquid oxygen (LOx).

The CCB is 3.8 m (12.5 ft) in diameter and 32.5 m (106.5 ft) in length. This stage is capable of producing 3.83 MN (860200 lb) of thrust at sea level. Each SRB can provide additional 1.6 MN (371550 lb) of thrust. The Centaur second stage in turn is 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and 12.6 m (41.5 ft) in length and is capable of producing 101.8 kN (22900 lb) of thrust.

What Does 541 Mean?

Atlas V rockets have a three number configuration code. The first number represents the fairing diameter size in meters. The second number denotes the number of solid rocket motors (SRMs) which attach to the base of the rocket. The number of SRMs for a 4 meter fairing can range from 0 – 3. However the 5-meter fairing Atlas V can support up to 5 SRMs due to the different aerodynamic properties of the fairing. For the GOES-T mission there will be four SRM attached to the center core. The third number denotes the number of engines on the Centaur Upper Stage.

MicroNFT is a NFT funding platform where the user can purchase NFT through MicroNFT token (MNT) and the proceeds from the issued NFT are distributed to the original creator and NFT holder. The famous social Instagram meal coupon NFT is sold at a high price on its NFT marketplace and its NFT can participate in various events depending on the card grade providing an opportunity to participate in social star's goods products.

MicroNFT provides a method of investing in expensive products that are burdensome for individuals to invest in alone or in products whose prices are expected to rise due to inflation because of the popularity of the products. Multiple investors can jointly invest in the product and get NFTs tokenized for the products in a proportionate way which adds value to the NFTs and distributes profits through sales and rentals.

Users can purchase MNT within the NFT market and invest in a variety of NFTs provided by the MicroNFT brokerage platform including Instagram date coupon NFT Instagram goods NFT real estate NFT figure NFT and more. NFTs issued as date meal tickets clothing figures images and videos of famous social stars are sold on MicroNFT Market and the proceeds are divided between the original artist and the holder. There's also a Metaverse where users can meet Instagram stars and buy/sell real estate.

The semiconductor industry is being hit hard. Proof is piling up that consumers are slowing their spend on electronics (after two years of a spending spree on work-from-home updates). A possible recession is also weighing on investor sentiment casting doubt on the sustainability of business spending on tech hardware. High-flyers Nvidia (NVDA -1.72%) and AMD (AMD -0.87%) are being hit particularly hard with each down 51% and 49% respectively through the first half of 2022.

Such cycles are the norm for chip stocks though and incredible value can be found. That's why three Fool.com contributors think chip fab equipment leader Applied Materials (AMAT -0.74%) automotive chip design and manufacturer NXP Semiconductor (NXPI -0.38%) and display materials and tech licensor Universal Display (OLED -0.63%) are a great way to supplement existing chip stock positions.

Help wanted: New chip manufacturing capacity

Nicholas Rossolillo (Applied Materials): Shares of Applied Materials were sinking like a stone in sympathy with Nvidia and other chip stocks to kick off the month of July. Why? Thank Micron Technology (MU -0.77%) manufacturer of basic commodity memory chips that are used in everything from graphics cards to tablets to cloud-computing servers. Micron cited slowing consumer demand for some devices when it issued weaker-than-expected guidance for its summer quarter.

Applied Materials is a top provider of equipment to the memory chip industry so it's been particularly sensitive to all the talk about economic slowdown and possible recession. Nevertheless this flies in the face of Applied and its peers who have been saying there's strong demand for fab equipment well into 2023 and beyond. The global chip shortage has exposed inadequate capacity to manufacture basic tech components and Applied should be able to steadily grow for the next few years as it supplies the heavy equipment needed to produce memory and other pieces of circuitry.

Granted supply chain issues have put limits on how much equipment can be assembled and shipped in recent quarters. During its fiscal 2022 second quarter (the three months ended May 1 2022) Applied reported year-over-year sales growth of just 12%. However since help in increasing manufacturing capacity isn't going away any delayed shipments would just be pushed back into 2023. Either way Applied has a big backlog of demand for its products and services.

That's why I think Applied Materials is an awesome deal at less than 15 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. It's a dividend stock and the company also repurchases lots of shares during periods of decline like right now to boost returns. If you ask me this is a top way to supplement any existing chip stocks in your portfolio with a long-term market outperformer.

This auto and industrial chip designer is an acquisition target and supercheap

Billy Duberstein (NXP Semiconductors): Semiconductor downturns are usually scary as chips are known to be economically sensitive and prone to booms and busts. While we were in a boom to start 2022 it looks as though we are about to go through a downturn of some kind.

However over the long term investors get rewarded for that volatility. Over the past 10 years which encompassed about five different semiconductor busts (including the current downturn) the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH -0.87%) has nearly tripled the returns of the broader market -- and this is after the crash in the sector this year. One would think investors would stick with a sector that has proven itself over the long term and yet so many traders still play the cycle.

The reason for this outperformance is that the semiconductor industry is a long-term growth industry and it will continue to be in the 2020s even if we are about to have a soft year. Moreover many chip companies still usually generate cash flow in downturns and repurchase a fair amount of stock when that happens.

One area that should grow even faster than the overall semi market and which should outperform the sector this year is automotive chips. Due to increasing chip content in cars advanced driver-assisted systems (ADAS) electrification and autonomy the auto chip sector is forecast to grow in the low double digits annually through 2028 according to Market Research Future projections. Moreover even though auto chips have been strong they should remain resilient since there was a downturn in 2019 and another weak year in 2020 due to Covid lockdowns. So there is still likely some catching up to do.

NXP Semiconductors has among the highest exposure to the auto sector with about 50% of its revenues coming from auto chips. Another 22% comes from industrial and Internet of Things chips which also appear to be in for a strong year as companies look to automate their factories and reduce labor costs. NXP makes a variety of auto chips including advanced radar systems electrification chips zonal processors and a variety of microcontrollers from the powertrain to comfort control. It also has a leadership position in a majority of the chips it sells to the auto industry.

If that's not enough to convince you it was recently reported that Korean chip giant Samsung wants to acquire NXP or at least another auto chip maker. When one of the largest chip-related conglomerates in the world is specifically targeting auto and industrial chips it's probably a good sign for the long-term growth of the sub-sector. Trading at just 10.5 this year's earnings estimates NXP looks awfully attractive at these levels

Catch this cyclical tech stock while the downswing lasts

Anders Bylund (Universal Display): Cyclical stocks can be beautiful. The trick is to identify the cyclical pattern buy some shares on the downswing and hold on for dear life across the inevitable bumps in the road.

Digital display technologist Universal Display is a very cyclical stock and the current downturn brought back share prices not seen since 2018. This may not be the exact bottom of the negative market action but Universal Display stands in a potentially profitable position right now.

Here's the thing: The organic light-emitting diode (OLED) researcher's stock prices have tended to mirror the company's revenue line quite closely in recent years:

However that pattern broke down in 2021. Universal Display kept delivering stronger and stronger top-line results but share prices fell dramatically anyhow. Trailing sales are up by 27% year over year but the stock is trading 55% lower.

Universal Display's OLED technology is finding its way into larger target markets these days such as mid-range smartphones in-dash car screens and large-screen TV sets. The power-sipping nature of OLED screens is a big selling point alongside display-quality benefits like perfectly black blacks incredible contrast ratios and stellar color reproduction.

As the market grows -- even in an era of constrained consumer spending and global manufacturing slowdowns -- Universal Display is also bringing new products to market that promise to expand its revenue take per square inch of OLED screen productions. The company's business prospects are as healthy as ever and you get to pick up shares at a massive discount. On top of all that Universal Display's formerly forgettable dividend policy is nothing to laugh at anymore offering a healthy 1.1% yield and an unbroken history of annual payout boosts since 2018.

That's why I'm still on the sidelines of AMD and Nvidia's overheated stock charts preferring to own Universal Display's healthy combination of stellar growth modest prices and robust dividends. This mid-cap growth stock is simply a great buy right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY2hyb21ldW5ib3hlZC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXNoaWVsZC10di11cGRhdGUtbmlnaHQtbGlzdGVuaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Shield 'night listening' feature balances audio while watching movies after hours,"Have you ever had to play “sound control” late at night while watching an action flick because the characters whisper and explosions are as loud as the commercials in between? Oh yeah? Me too. Unfortunately on my Chromecast with Google TV I find myself constantly pressing the up and down volume buttons as I watch something. Sadly this has become second nature for most of us and we do it without thinking but Nvidia has a solution for this.

In the Nvidia Shield Experience update 9.1 a new ‘night listening’ mode will lessen the volume on those loud noises like explosions and such (via HDMI only) while increasing the volume of dialogue and other quiet things dynamically. I feel like this should have been a thing decades ago but it is what it is.

Additionally Shield TV will now automatically switch your television to low-latency “game mode” while you’re playing a game or doing a video call. Once you’re watching content again game mode will toggle off. Previously you would have had to manually switch this on and off.

We covered this back in January but now Gaming Hub is officially launching on Samsung TVs!

Samsung considers Gaming Hub its ultimate home for all games in your living room. Instead of having to individually launch third-party cloud gaming applications you can simply boot up this app and select a game to play based on its cover art. Within moments it communicates to those services and launches the game on your behalf.

In addition to Google Utomik and Nvidia’s apps linking up with Gaming Hub Amazon Luna will soon be available as well expanding your options quite a bit. Add to that the fact that Xbox Cloud Gaming is also coming to Samsung TVs and living room televisions are practically becoming new generation game consoles!

If you have a 2022 Neo QLED 4K or 8K TV a 2022 QLED or 2022 Smart Monitor Series unit you’ll be able to update to software version 1302.5 to get access to the new Gaming Hub application. Let me know in the comments section below whether or not you care about having one app to rule them all and house all of your cloud games or if you just and only use one service like Stadia or GeForce NOW.

NVIDIA and AMD focus on discrete graphics card while Intel mainly specializes in integrated graphics card for laptop processors. As we all know integrated graphics card usually has low performance. At present NVIDIA has dominated the laptop graphics card market while AMD occupied the lower share of the market compared with NVIDIA. Now let’s have a look at the best laptop graphics card ranking list. For users who plan to make the first purchase on the laptop our best laptop GPU ranking list will be of good help.

For the user who intends to buy a laptop with the graphics card for computer game a laptop with GeForce 1000 series graphics card will be a good choice. If the user needs to use the laptop to play the game such as Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds which has high demand on the graphics card then a laptop with GTX1050Ti or higher version will be good.

But if the user only needs to play common 3D online games like CF and Lol and then a laptop with AMD series graphics card like MX150 and MX130 can satisfy such requirement. Even the UHD620/HD620 integrated graphics card from Intel’s processor can basically meet the demand.

2018 laptop graphics card purchase tips

Since now NVIDIA is the main manufacturers in the laptop graphics card market we will first take NVIDIA graphics card into consideration. This year NVIDIA’s new generation GTX1000 series graphics card including GTX1080 GTX1070 GTX1060 GTX1050Ti and GTX1050 are good choice. But if you aren’t satisfied with the price you can choose relatively cheaper NVIDIA graphics card including GTX980M GTX970M GTX965M GTX960M and GTX950M. As for AMD at present its graphics card in the market is the old generation graphics card which has poorer performance than NVIDIA’s graphics card with regard to the framework and power consumption. Therefore the laptop coming with AMD discrete graphics card is not common to see in the market."

Rain hit the track with 45 laps scored declaring Thornton as the winner of the Able Air Independence 50 on Friday night at Portsmouth Raceway Park. The Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series-sanctioned event became official with five laps remaining in the race when track conditions became too wet to continue.

The win was worth $12000 for the defending Dirt Track World Championship winner. The 31-year-old stood in PRP Victory Lane scoring his first Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series win of 2022 to become the 15th different winner this season.

Defending series champion Tim McCreadie finished in second followed by Hudson O’Neal Earl Pearson Jr. and Daulton Wilson who led the first 29 laps of the race.

Wilson one of the five drivers battling for the O’Reilly Auto Parts Rookie-of-the-Year chase with the series looked to be on his way to a clean sweep as he dominated the first half of the race. With impending weather in the area Wilson led at the halfway mark which would have become official if the rain would have caused a halt to the race.

A caution with 28 laps scored had Wilson leading followed by Thornton and McCreadie. Wilson would lead those two on the restart for another circuit but heading into turn four on the 30th lap he got crossways in turn four which allowed four drivers to get by him as he fell to fifth.

Once Thornton had the lead he stretched it out to be 2.165 seconds ahead of McCreadie when rain halted the race for good.

Thornton who started fifth went to Lucas Oil Victory Lane for the fourth time in his career this time did his post-race interview from the tower. “I didn’t know if we were going to lose the track or not luckily we didn’t. So we went back green and with five to go I didn’t know it was raining until I went down into turn one and I was like ‘I really blew that corner’ then I realized it was raining. It was something different I am glad we got to do a victory lane like interview. I think overall it was pretty cool” said the Arizona native who now makes his home in Indiana.

“My crew has busted their tails and it is definitely showing a lot of speed this year so I hope we can keep it going. This track has been extremely good to us. Maybe we can come back here later in the year and get another win. I want to thank all of the fans for coming out tonight. You really didn’t know what the weather was going to do tonight. The track busted their tails to give us the best track we could get.”

Pasquantino and Hunter Dozier hit back-to-back homers leading Brad Keller and the Kansas City Royals over the Detroit Tigers 3-1 Friday night.

Playing his third game in the majors Pasquantino was 0 for 6 overall when the former Old Dominion star hit Michael Pineda’s first pitch of the fourth inning to deep right field. The ball hit the top of the fence bounced off a railing and back onto the field.

Thinking the ball was in play Pasquantino tried to get a double but Javy Baez took Willi Castro’s throw and tagged the rookie as he slid into the bag. The Tigers shortstop then told Pasquantino to get up and enjoy the last half of his home-run trot.

“I got tagged out at second base by Javy Baez” on home run No. 1 Pasquantino said. “How cool is that?

“I’m glad that all got captured on video because I’m going to be showing that to my grandkids someday” he said.

Thanks to Baez Pasquantino got the ball from his first homer but he was also hoping to get another memento from the occasion.

“I sent Javy a jersey and I hope he’ll sign it for me” he said. “I never really pictured my first major league hit but there’s no way it could be any better than what happened.”

Pasquantino was called up June 27 after amassing 18 home runs and 67 RBIs over 250 at-bats this season with the Triple-A Omaha Storm Chasers. He was one of the top power hitters in all of the minor leagues.

Keller (3-9) allowed five hits and two walks in six-plus scoreless innings. He’s won two of his last three starts.

“When he’s on he can really move the ball around” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “We really couldn’t get the ball off the ground against him for the first five innings and then we couldn’t get a big hit later on.”

Keller exited after hitting rookie Spencer Torkelson in the helmet with an 88 mph changeup in the seventh. Torkelson stayed on his feet and walked off the field under his own power.

“I really hate that my outing ended like that” Keller said. “You never want to see someone get hit in the head but I sent a (clubhouse attendant) over to their clubhouse and they said he’s fine.”

The Royals took a 1-0 lead in the third when Whit Merrifield doubled stole third without a throw against the shift and scored on Andrew Benintendi’s single.

After Pasquantino homered Dozier sent a 2-0 pitch into the Kansas City bullpen.

Team Norfolk Boxing will have a permanent home in Park Place as the Economic Development Authority has under contract the purchase of the former Rosna Theatre on 35th Street.

The city says this location provides better proximity and accessibility for the youth.

“Today’s announcements highlight our ongoing efforts to strengthen the Park Place neighborhood” states Norfolk Mayor Kenneth C. Alexander. “We are excited to add a community hub and our boxing program to the 35th Street corridor. In addition the acquisition of 2707 Granby Street provides an opportunity to add high-quality affordable housing to the north end of Granby. There is no question that Park Place is experiencing a resurgence thanks to efforts from residents civic groups and private corporations. We are happy to complement those efforts and we look forward to making similar strategic investments across the city.”

The future site of Team Norfolk Boxing is the 12500-square-foot Rosna Theatre built in the 1930s and will serve as a community development and historic rehabilitation project. The space allows for the boxing program as well as expansion to a wrestling program while offering private-sector partnerships and events.

The boxing club will feature two regulation rings training equipment teaching space exercise equipment and a footwork area. In addition to the boxing club the space now allows for a neighborhood lobby to host Team Norfolk Boxing meetings as well as community meetings and youth programs. Also included is a new restaurant space with windows to view the boxing club.

The theater purchase price is $712000 with an additional $2.4 to $3.2 million for renovation costs.

“The 35 Street corridor is one of the most exciting redevelopment areas in the City” states Jared Chalk Director of Norfolk’s Department of Economic Development. “Bringing youth and athletics together within the community and in close proximity to additional amenities such as Old Dominion University and the Virginia Zoo is a way to enhance and grow this neighborhood.”

According to Norfolk officials they have further invested in Park Place with the purchase of the property located at 2707 Granby Street. Three options for redevelopment of this property will go to City Council for consideration and expands upon the Midtown Norfolk Vision Plan for the area between the Virginia Zoo Church Street and Granby Street. The purchase price for the property is $1.15 million.

This year’s celebrations will be remembered no doubt but not for the reason that winning agencies would have liked.

Former Cannes Lion winner Gustav Martner set the tone at the opening ceremony as he stormed the stage and gave back his award then held up a sign reading: “No awards on a dead planet. Ban fossil ads!”

This was only the beginning. Later in the week Greenpeace protestors paddled in canoes to invade WPP's rented beach next to the Croissette. After that they scaled the Palais conference centre and unfurled a banner declaring: ""Fossil fuel ads are burning the planet.""

WPP’s clients include BP and Shell and chief executive Mark Read defended the network’s relationship with energy clients saying: “Energy companies have to be part of the solution as much as anybody else.”

Network groups and agencies are awash with sustainability initiatives with those such as WPP Publicis Dentsu and Omnicom Media Group signed up to Ad Net Zero. At the festival though agencies were faced directly with the opposition and the potential consequences of facilitating energy companies.

So where does this leave them? Did employees perhaps leave the festival with a guilty conscience? Or were they galvanised to prove that energy companies are part of the solution to climate change?

Campaign asked members of adland for their perspective.

John Brown

Founder Don't Cry Wolf

There will always be an agency willing to sacrifice its moral compass for the sake of a few quid. However the tide is beginning to turn for three key reasons. The first is that the climate crisis message is starting to get through thanks to the likes of Greenpeace Creatives for Climate and a heap of other essential pressure groups and collectives.

The second reason is that attracting the best talent is as much about having the right ethics as it is about having the right pay cheque. As CV pools run dry agencies must reflect on whether their client list is a deterrent.

Lastly as society demands greater transparency creative leaders must come clean about their work rather than bleat on about their plastic-free breakout rooms and Birkenstock recycling schemes. It will take a special kind of arse to submit a Cannes Lions award entry focused on sustainability while reporting a chunk of income from oil and gas.

Ete Davies

EMEA chief operating officer of Dentsu Creative

Activists have a role to play in raising awareness. But as an industry we need to face up to our role and the opportunity we have to change the story. We are seeing increasing scrutiny from clients who have set net zero targets and are passionately committed to this agenda. And from our people who are choosing to work for organisations that are committed to driving positive impact.

Objectively much of the Cannes agenda was already dominated by discussions about sustainability and commitments to actionable plans to reduce our industry's negative environmental impact across its entire value chain. At Dentsu this is a board-level priority. We are one of the first companies in the world to have our net zero target approved by the Science Based Target initiative. Many of our peers followed suit with public (and real) commitments to becoming net zero and to science-based targets.

There’s clearly a challenge for agencies that have made such commitments yet continue to service fossil fuel clients to balance these two positions – especially given recent focus on ""advertised emissions"" – in other words the impact of the campaigns that we run. I can only assume that agencies in such a situation are either having those challenging conversations or as we are at Dentsu focusing their engagements on supporting those clients or business units that are making the pivot to ""clean energy"".

Nikki Cunningham

Managing director Curious

Greenpeace’s protest certainly got us talking. They were the most ""in your face"" but definitely not the only voice on sustainability as expected with a vast majority of speakers using their platform to voice concerns. Though I can’t help but wonder how many of the execs who trot out the well-worn mantra about ""being part of the journey of change"" as an excuse for their fossil fuel partnerships actually believe what they are saying.

So will the Greenpeace protests at Cannes stop agencies working with fossil fuel clients by itself? The short answer is no but we as an industry should be actively engaging with the conversation above and beyond well practised platitudes. At some point in the future – I hope the near future – fossil fuels will follow the same path as tobacco. After all when was the last time you saw an agency proudly flaunting a Marlboro logo?

Xavier Rees

Chief executive Havas London

If you’ve got a burning (no pun intended) desire to work with fossil fuel clients a few protests probably aren’t going to stop you. Not that that means the protests aren’t worthwhile – it’s an important conversation and one we need to have.

If that’s the case what might give you pause for thought is when your access to the best talent – who increasingly care about this stuff – dries up.

And if that doesn’t stop you more and more clients electing not to work with you might. I’m not just talking about those brands founded on sustainable principles – big global players are increasingly mindful of the issue have a point of view and want to work with like-minded partners. Regardless of the wider considerations you might find fossil fuel clients end up costing you more than they’re worth.

Melanie Welsh

Founding partner Strat House

Greenpeace’s protest was certainly memorable and they aren’t alone in their stance. Sustainability was a major theme at Cannes Lions with many speakers from brands and advertisers given the platform to raise similar concerns. The Greenpeace protests added to the conversation and sharpened the comments.

This isn’t the first time the industry has received pressure from climate activists. Groups that will really turn heads are those that are working directly with and alongside the industry. Clean Creatives is probably the most well-known organisation galvanising people within the industry to change and their message is more likely to resonate with ""creative greenwashers"" – as they come from a communication background themselves. Then the industry can choose to listen – or not.

Ultimately the Greenpeace protest alone isn’t likely to revolutionise the industry. Instead the pattern of more and more advertisers backing out and the wider conversation around industry responsibility can create positive change.

Stephen Woodford

Chief executive Advertising Association

No I don’t think it will stop agencies working with fossil fuel clients – but every company has the right and option to choose the clients they represent. Like them or not these are essential businesses to the functioning of our economy and society with the right to buy professional services of all kinds not just those from the advertising sector.

I do think however that these protests will rightly put ever more focus on the type of work produced for advertisers in the energy sector. This work must be fair accurate and properly representative of the efforts they are making to address climate change.

At the same time it is important we listen to all voices in the climate debate to drive the change needed worldwide and this includes how energy companies must rapidly transition their businesses to support a low carbon economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Founded in 1846 the city is named after a Texas Revolution hero who led one of the militias shouting the “Remember the Alamo” rallying cry. Almost two centuries later residents still pass beneath an ancient sprawling pecan tree that shades the county courthouse and the former town square. They know their neighbors’ names professions and family trees. They visit shops restaurants and expansive antique stores in the city’s preserved downtown.

But there’s a new lifeblood of Sherman’s economy.

No longer built around railroads or mail routes or cotton trades it’s now a high-tech town largely bolstered by the jobs and investments provided by Texas Instruments GlobalWafers and Apple supplier II-VI. As the city’s tech sector expands its population is growing and new housing developments and businesses are popping up left and right.

“It’s a little scary for us” said 37-year-old Sherman resident Lauren Sims. Still she said “It’s a good scary.”

Sherman the bigger part of the 120000-person Sherman-Denison metro area is no stranger to change.

Its transformation into a key U.S. hub for semiconductor manufacturing is made possible by natural resources infrastructure and savvy local leadership but also by a business-friendly tradition dating back decades.

“It’s in our DNA” said Kent Sharp president of the Sherman Economic Development Corp. which helped land the GlobalWafers deal that’ll bring the first facility of its kind to the U.S. in two decades.

Semiconductors the tiny chips that power modern computers and other electronic devices are at the heart of city leaders’ plans. The city wants to be home to companies along all steps of the supply chain from crafting silicon wafers to creating circuit boards for consumer products.

Striking a deal

In 1990 the U.S. accounted for 37% of semiconductor production capacity. In 2020 that number dropped to 12% according to a study by Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association.

During the coronavirus pandemic supply chain issues in securing chips from overseas and record demand caused a shortage that persists today prompting calls to bring more production to the U.S. The shortage has been exacerbated by continued lockdowns in China and ripple effects from the war in Ukraine.

Semiconductor supply chains are still vulnerable and long-term demand is skyrocketing thanks to increasing digitization.

“Automobiles vacuum cleaners you name it everything’s running on chips these days” said Michael Savoie professor of operations and supply chain management at the University of North Texas’ Ryan College of Business. If semiconductor production in southeast Asia is disrupted “you could cause a global catastrophe within the supply chain.”

For Taiwan-based GlobalWafers and its GlobiTech subsidiary supply chain issues mean high demand and an impetus to add capacity through a $5 billion expansion in Sherman.

“We and our peer competitors have been sold out especially on advanced products (300-millimeter) where the supply will remain tight possibly through year 2024 which is the timing of new expansions” GlobiTech president Mark England said in an email.

Before semiconductors can roll off the line and into cars consumer electronics and industrial machinery fabrication plants start with a silicon wafer — a large mirrorlike sheet of ultrathin silicon that yields thousands of chips.

The new GlobalWafers plant will craft those wafers in addition to being capable of applying a crystalline coating. GlobiTech’s existing facilities will receive some of the raw wafers and apply that coating.

GlobalWafers’ expansion will be a long-term investment. Samples will begin making their way to customers in the second half of 2024 and mass production — starting at 350000 wafers a month — will begin in 2025.

The site could eventually ramp up to 2.4 million wafers produced a month England said.

“It will be our expansion vehicle for the next 40 years” he said.

Stiff competition

GlobiTech and city leaders weren’t certain Sherman would win the project especially since construction costs in the U.S. are three times more expensive than overseas. Sites in Ohio and South Korea were also being considered and all three locations offered big economic incentives.

“It’s like dating” England joked with competing cities putting their best foot forward.

Winning the faceoff required collaboration between the Sherman Economic Development Corp. four local taxing bodies and state government — as well as a promise of future federal incentives. The economic development agency was “the point of the spear” City Manager Robby Hefton said organizing different groups during negotiations with companies like GlobiTech.

The economic development agency offered $20 million in cash payments and the sale of over $14.4 million in land for $1 an acre. The Texas Enterprise Fund contributed a $15 million grant.

The city Grayson County and Grayson College chipped in tax incentives and the city offered a discount on water bills. Though it needs school board approval the company should also receive a break on taxes paid to the local school district.

While Ohio had a 100% tax abatement deal ready to go in a week efforts in Texas took months of negotiation between taxing entities. Each Sherman negotiator could have busted the deal with just one hangup.

Luckily for the city GlobiTech and its president have strong Sherman roots.

“We’ve been working with the city for over 20 years and we know everyone” said England a Sherman native.

Sherman had several other advantages.

GlobiTech’s existing management team can oversee the new plant which is helpful because the wafer production process involves trade secrets. The city has an ample supply of workers land power and other utilities boasting some of the best water access in Texas thanks to Lake Texoma one of the few reservoirs in the state that’s at full capacity.

The GlobalWafers project will be eligible for incentives under the CHIPS Act approved in January 2021 but Congress still needs to provide $52 billion in funding for subsidies to spur domestic semiconductor investment. For GlobalWafers that funding is essential.

Intel has said it may delay or reduce its plans to build a $20 billion chip plant in Ohio depending on what happens with the bill and England said GlobalWafers could scale back plans in Sherman or move its new production overseas if the money doesn’t come through.

“We’re in the same boat with Intel” England said. “We don’t feel secure about the decision until the concrete dries.”

Dealmakers are anxious to see the bill funded before Congress recesses in August and city leaders have talked to elected officials about its importance. But there is debate over whether $52 billion is enough to bring more of the nearly $500 billion semiconductor industry to the U.S. thereby decreasing supply chain vulnerability.

“With the CHIPS Act it may be an uphill battle: Is it enough to provide $52 billion to the industry? Absolutely not. It’s just a start” Bloomberg semiconductor analyst Paula Penkal said.

A legacy of encouraging industry

After wafers come off the assembly line companies use them as the base for microchips. In the United States that’s where companies like Texas Instruments come in.

Sherman has been home to manufacturers for more than a century but the modern-day city’s efforts — including the high-tech manufacturing push that brought Texas Instruments to the city — have their roots in a group active in the middle of the 20th century called the Young Turks.

Led by local business leaders and named for an Ottoman revolutionary group the Young Turks pooled money to attract businesses to Sherman.

“I would hear stories about them flying off to the East Coast and wining and dining the IBM executives before IBM came here and Johnson & Johnson” the son of one of the Young Turks said in a video commemorating the Sherman economic development agency’s 25th anniversary.

That business-friendly spirit guided Sherman as it carved out a place as a high-tech hub. The city created an industrial district on land the Young Turks raised money to buy. Leaders in the 1980s worked to secure the water supply according to Hefton.

The results? Texas Instruments IBM and Johnson & Johnson opened plants in Sherman in the middle of the century. GlobiTech began operations in 2001. II-VI’s factory opened in 2018 producing parts for the Apple iPhone.

II-VI Inc. landed a $390 million contract from Apple to accelerate manufacturing of a kind of laser that powers some of the iPhone's newest features such as facial recognition that unlocks the phone and a portrait mode that enables its camera to take professional-looking photos.

Last year Sherman won the $30 billion Texas Instruments expansion that will be the crown jewel of the city’s manufacturing sector and secure its place in the middle of the semiconductor supply chain. Like GlobalWafers TI got big tax incentives to pick Sherman.

It’s been over half a century since the heyday of the Young Turks. Still Sharp cites the Turks as inspiration.

“We’re trying to emulate what those guys did back then” the economic development corporation president said.

Sherman’s roots as a small city have helped it grow into a tech hub said Tyson Bennett superintendent of the Sherman Independent School District. He pointed to the relationships among local leaders which make it easier to work together to attract companies.

“We live and work with folks we’re friends with folks we go to church with folks. We’re all about benefiting our community” he said.

‘Complete semiconductor ecosystem’

Three steps of the semiconductor supply chain will soon be concentrated in Sherman: making the wafers applying the coating and transforming those wafers into semiconductor chips. This clustering is characteristic of the semiconductor industry.

“Suppliers will set up shop in the area to be closer to the chip producer so that you have more direct access both logistically for easier cheaper delivery and for better collaboration” analyst Penkal said.

Vertical integration — the phrase industry leaders use to describe that clustering — is Sherman’s goal.

“We envision the complete semiconductor ecosystem developing with chip manufacturers and starting materials” England said in an email. “It should completely change the landscape of Sherman.”

Sharp said the next step is attracting companies that make circuit boards for consumer products in the growing number of industries that rely on chip technology: laptops phones cars microwaves electric toothbrushes and more.

In response the city’s population could double over the next five to 10 years Hefton said.

“Part of the challenge is … how do you keep [Sherman’s] heritage and legacy kind of authentic in the face of all this other growth?” he said.

Residents want the city to thrive and like the amenities growth brings said Sims who grew up in Sherman and raised two children there. At the same time she said home values have risen in Sherman in recent years. Property taxes have gone up too.

Compared to 2021 the median house price in Sherman increased 31.2% this May hitting $305000. The city released a plan for 8000 new homes before the GlobiTech announcement. Sherman also ranks second in the U.S. for the most overpriced housing market signaling prices could be on their way down soon.

Evan Martin a realtor who works for Real Broker LLC in Sherman said the city experienced an “extreme shortage of inventory” in the first part of this year sometimes resulting in 10 or more offers on a home in its first few days on the market. Martin also noticed an influx of out-of-state buyers.

“No longer does it take five minutes to get anywhere in Sherman” he said. “It’s definitely grown but there is still that small-town feeling. It’s what makes living here so enjoyable.”

Hefton pointed out that as property values increase revenue from industry helps the city keep tax and utility rates low.

Right now Sherman’s entire property tax base is about $4.5 billion wrote community and support services manager Nate Strauch in an email. Even after tax breaks the taxable value of just the first phase of the TI project is between $150 million and $280 million and each of the four phases of the GlobalWafers project will have a taxable value of $40 million to $60 million he wrote.

In addition to public revenue the tech industry brings new businesses and amenities Bennett said. But it’s more than that: People who grow up in Sherman don’t have to choose between living there or pursuing career opportunities elsewhere.

“I love my kids” Bennett said. “And I want them to stay here close to me and raise the family and have kids [so] my grandkids aren’t three hours from here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMy9ob3ctdGhlLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItY3Jpc2lzLXJlYWxseS1hZmZlY3RzLWVsZWN0cmljLWNhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the semiconductor crisis really affects electric cars,"Long waits unscheduled handover dates – disrupted semiconductor supply chains significantly impair battery-electric car production. Management consultancy P3 has analysed the supply chain problems – and identified the issue as repeat mistakes similar to those made in battery cells.

* * *

The phenomenon of missing semiconductors also affects combustion engine vehicles but to a lesser extent. That is the core result of P3 Group’s analysis. “Four years ago we realised that the semiconductor would become the new battery cell” says Markus Hackmann managing director at the consulting firm. He adds that car manufacturers who had prepared for potential bottlenecks would come through the current challenge much better. P3 conducts at the root of the problem: What has caused the current semiconductor crisis?

A battery-electric vehicle (BEV) has easily twice as many semiconductors as an ICE car. Specifically P3 talks about a difference of 1300 to 600 per car. And they are mainly in the powertrain (600 to 300). The inverter is particularly dependent and heavy in semiconductors.

“Repeat mistake like with battery cells”.

In terms of value creation the German car industry has become dependent on Asian suppliers – which the P3 Group calls a “repeat mistake” that had been made with batteries before. This time however the big trigger was the Covid pandemic: fearing a slump in demand quite a few automakers have cancelled orders in 2020. However the consumer dip in the car market remained small and at the same time demand for semiconductors in the entertainment industry grew enormously.

The subsequent alternation of lockdowns and opening booms combined with other negative factors – remember the container ship transversed in the Suez Canal – has led to a regular stall. A problem that continues to this day. For example the lockdown in Shanghai is only gradually reduced so the traffic jam in the world’s largest port is far from resolved.

If you look at the seaports with the highest container throughput almost all of them are in Asia: Shanghai is followed by Singapore Ningbo-Zhoushan Shenzhen and Guangzhou-Nansha. Currently ships are sailing at high speed without regard to heavy oil consumption to compensate for the shortfall. The prices paid for semiconductors have multiplied making this spurt financially possible. The next bottleneck looms after arrival in Europe i.e. in Rotterdam Antwerp and Hamburg because the ports must laboriously handle the immense volume of goods.

Eight per cent of chip production for cars

At the same time the market power of the automotive industry is not as great as usual: Only eight per cent according to the P3 Group’s calculations of all semiconductors are purchased here. In contrast 80 per cent are used in consumer electronics.

For a relatively simple passenger ICE car in 2017 about two per cent of the total costs were due to semiconductors. A BEV of 2030 will require six per cent three times as much. In addition to electrification drive automation is essential to this development.

Let’s mention just some components that require semiconductors: In the powertrain of a BEV for example these are the charger the inverter the DC/DC converter the high-voltage battery the central processor and the motor itself. For autonomous driving various cameras multiple radars ultrasonic sensors and steering and braking by wire will be essential in the future (automation levels 4 and 5). Add to this the digital control unit and the infotainment system.

Semiconductors are also produced in different sizes for different purposes; for example the demand for semiconductors with small structure sizes below 150 nanometers will increase by 10 according to P3.

Supply chain transparency

And now?

“In the acute situation we are building transparency about supply chains at P3 Group” says Mauritz Schwartz a semiconductor specialist. Many parties involved in the automotive industry are unclear for example who could be a producer and who is just an agent. From this analysis improvements and more accurate delivery forecasts could be made. At present it can take up to 72 weeks from the time an order is placed for semiconductors to arrive.

In the medium term however the overall situation could improve with new locations in Germany. For example Intel has announced plans to build a large plant in Magdeburg and invest 17 billion euros. Intel is not a typical automotive supplier but will find its way into this role. The short distances – to VW in Wolfsburg for example – also remove intermediate stages in orders. But really large volumes are not to be expected here until 2027. Much sooner probably in 2023 Bosch from Dresden could contribute to easing the semiconductor crisis.

Conclusion

The automotive industry needs to reorganise itself. The self-evident tendency to relegate semiconductors and battery cells to the status of arbitrary supplier components is over. However it will probably be years before supply chains can function smoothly again and (re-) localise some in Europe. The disaster that exists due to the lack of semiconductors must not remain without consequence: It must be regionalised. Because the importance of semiconductors will increase a particular focus should be placed here. For those interested in buying the only thing to do is wait and see. At some point the system will be back in balance.

The state government said on Friday that an “MoU was signed today between IGSS Ventures Pvt Ltd and the Tamil Nadu Guidance Bureau to set up a high-tech semiconductor park…”



The state’s guidance department said it had allocated nine strategic sites including two sites near Chennai to house a semiconductor fab.



The fab it said will be producing wafers ranging from 28 nanometre (nm) 45 nm and 65 nm and an industry ecosystem infrastructure that hosts semiconductor circuit designers material suppliers equipment suppliers and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSATs) players.

The state government “accords the highest priority to the development of semiconductor manufacturing in the State. The State is traditionally strong in the automobile and auto components sector and emerging in electronics which have backward linkages with fab which makes the State an ideal location for a fab unit in India” said Pooja Kulkarni managing director and chief executive guidance department in a statement.The Rs 25600-crore investment would be spread over five years and would create 1500 jobs.IGSS is a consortium of companies with specialised capabilities in setting up a first-grade semiconductor foundry. The consortium which will set up a semiconductor fab named Project Suria is an applicant under the Indian Semiconductor Mission.“The consortium believes that a differentiation strategy which offers both mainstream and emerging niche technologies with Tier 1 foundry capabilities and cost competitiveness will enable India to become a global leader in selective semiconductor technologies besides offering mainstream solutions in the technology nodes” founder and group CEO Raj Kumar said in a statement.Tamil Nadu has become the second state to bag a semiconductor plant.Karnataka became the first off the block after the ISMC consortium chose a water-abundant site in Mysuru for its factory.The Vedanta-Foxconn joint venture is still scouting for a location to set up its plant.In December last year the Union Cabinet approved a Rs 76000-crore incentive plan to encourage semiconductor display manufacturing and fabrication units in India.The incentives have been planned for silicon semiconductor fabrication packaging design display fabrication compound semiconductor and silicon photonics manufacturing units.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvdmVkYW50YS1ncm91cC1leWVzLTMtNS1ibi10dXJub3Zlci1mcm9tLWNoaXAtYml6LW9uZS10aGlyZC1mcm9tLWV4cG9ydHMtMTIyMDcwMzAwNDQwXzEuaHRtbNIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvY29tcGFuaWVzL3ZlZGFudGEtZ3JvdXAtZXllcy0zLTUtYm4tdHVybm92ZXItZnJvbS1jaGlwLWJpei1vbmUtdGhpcmQtZnJvbS1leHBvcnRzLTEyMjA3MDMwMDQ0MF8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vedanta Group eyes $3.5-bn turnover from chip biz one-third from exports,"Vedanta Group has earmarked investments of up to USD 20 billion for semiconductor business and it plans to invest USD 15 billion in the first 10 years

Vedanta Group expects its semiconductor business turnover to be in the range of USD 3 to 3.5 billion out of which around USD 1 billion will come from exports a senior official of the company said.

Vedanta Group's global managing director of display and semiconductor business Akarsh Hebbar told PTI that its JV partner Foxconn has all the agreements and required technologies in place to start making electronic chips.

Vedanta Foxconn JV is among three companies that have applied for setting up semiconductor manufacturing units in the country. Vedanta has also applied for setting up a display fabrication plant to make screens that are used for display in electronic devices.

""We expect our turnover to be in the range of USD 3-3.5 billion in the first phase which is by 2026-27. This will be from both display and semiconductor combined. At that time we expect USD 1 billion to come from exports"" Hebbar told PTI.

Vedanta Group has earmarked investments of up to USD 20 billion for semiconductor business and it plans to invest USD 15 billion in the first 10 years.

This is the second attempt of Vedanta Group to enter into the semiconductor business. Earlier the company had announced plans to foray into the segment in 2015-16 with USD 10 billion to set up a display fab unit but it could not get government's approval.

Later Vedanta acquired Taiwan-based Avanstrate to enter into display fab manufacturing.

The company has now formed a JV with electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn to set up an electronic chip manufacturing plant.

""Foxconn is running four foundries themselves. They purchase USD 30-40 billion worth of semiconductors. The reason we don't see it is because the S group is a very small subsidiary of Foxconn compared to the whole of Foxconn. They are going to bring this ecosystem here. Foxconn is a fully integrated unit that can bring IPs (Intellectual Properties) required to make 28 nanometer technology"" Hebbar said.

He said India's vision is to make 1 billion smartphones by 2030 15 million televisions and 24 million notebooks per year by 2030 only for local consumption.

""Our target is towards local consumption. We will keep 10 per cent of display for exports and 20-25 per cent in semiconductor for exports. Majorly we will make it for India"" Hebbar said.

The company expects to start manufacturing display units in 2024-25 and semiconductors by 2025-26.

Vedanta will look at making a 28 nanometer (nm) chipset.

Hebbar said: ""28 nm is tried and tested technology. The operational efficiency that it is coming with and the operational model that we are building around this efficiency makes it look like we are going to make affordable chipsets in our country for people to have good business value. Our business structure is robust even without subsidy.""



Vedanta group will look at manufacturing 40000 panels of semiconductor and 60000 panels of display per month he said.

The company's application is under evaluation by the government. Minister for electronics and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that the government will start clearing applications in the current calendar year.

Hebbar said 20-30 per cent of the production capacity is likely to be absorbed by Foxconn itself and the company is also in discussion with smartphone makers for business.

The government has also assured semiconductor companies of giving policy support besides fiscal incentives to ensure a sustainable market for them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9hdXRvLW5ld3MvY2FybWFrZXJzLXN0ZXAtb24tdGhlLWdhcy1hcy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNob3J0YWdlLWVhc2VzLTExNjU2Njk5MDM2MTA2Lmh0bWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vYXV0by1uZXdzL2Nhcm1ha2Vycy1zdGVwLW9uLXRoZS1nYXMtYXMtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1zaG9ydGFnZS1lYXNlcy9hbXAtMTE2NTY2OTkwMzYxMDYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carmakers step on the gas as semiconductor shortage eases | Mint,"Easing supplies of semiconductor chips is aiding a gradual recovery in production for Indian automakers as they line up new launches to capture a sharp rebound in automobile sales with the abatement of the pandemic and an increased preference for personal mobility.

Leading carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) have said that semiconductor supplies have begun to improve from June and that production is expected to rise from this month.

Senior industry executives said Maruti Suzuki the country’s largest carmaker plans to produce more than 11000 units of its newly launched compact SUV Brezza this month whereas M&M is looking to add 6000 units of its new Scorpio-N SUV as it gears towards a festive season delivery.

Maruti Suzuki is also gearing up to start production of a new midsize SUV at Toyota’s Karnataka plant starting August which is expected to go on sale sometime in the festive season.

“The semiconductor situation has become better. We were at 40% of our plan in September last year which was when we were the worst hit. We increased it to 60% in October 85% in November 90% in December 92% in Jan and Feb 93-94% in March and April and 95% in May and June. So in that sense there is a consistent increase. We are not certain what time we will reach 100% but we expect to get there soon"" said Shashank Srivastava executive director of Maruti Suzuki.

Automakers’ reliance on electronic chips has significantly increased as vehicles become more feature-rich. Carmakers across the board see greater preferences for top-end variants of cars which use comparatively more semiconductor chips than the lower-end versions.

Carmakers are also revisiting lower-end models to eliminate the use of chips that are not critical to a vehicle. The shortage of chips and the lack of supply chain readiness have also pushed back launch timelines for some automakers as was the case for M&M’s Scorpio-N which was launched after a delay of more than a quarter. Despite easing chip supplies automakers are running waiting periods as long as two years for some models as demand continues to outstrip supply.

“The chip situation has improved compared to what it was for us from August to December last year. We in particular were very dependent on one supplier who had a very high dependence on Malaysia and Malaysia had a washout for almost two months due to covid-19. But since then the semiconductor situation is much better"" said Rajesh Jejurikar executive director auto and farm sector at M&M.

Recent supply-chain disruptions emanating from the fresh surge of covid-19 in China are also easing. “Demand for passenger vehicles continued to stay strong in Q1 FY23 even as the supply side remained moderately impacted due to the lockdown in China. As a result we expect the supply side including that of critical electronic components to progressively improve"" said Shailesh Chandra managing director Tata Motors passenger vehicles and Tata passenger electric mobility in a press release announcing its June quarter sales on Friday.

“The most difficult part of the China lockdown is behind us. Shanghai is now mostly open with panic in some pockets. Beijing is affected but there isn’t a large industrial base there so it doesn’t affect supply chains the way Shanghai did"" Jejurikar added.

ORCL,Oracle Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL3Rpa3Rva19jaGluYV91c19kYXRhL9IBQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS9BTVAvMjAyMi8wNy8wMi90aWt0b2tfY2hpbmFfdXNfZGF0YS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikTok: Yes some staff in China can access US data,"TikTok owned by Chinese outfit ByteDance last month said it was making an effort to minimize the amount of data from US users that gets transferred outside of America following reports that company engineers in the Middle Kingdom had access to US customer data.

""100 percent of US user traffic is being routed to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure"" TikTok said in a June 17 2022 post while acknowledging that customer information still got backed up to its data center in Singapore. The biz promised to delete US users' private data from its own servers and to ""fully pivot to Oracle cloud servers located in the US.""

That pivot has not yet been completed. According to a June 30 2022 letter [PDF] from TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew obtained by the New York Times on Friday some China-based employees with sufficient security clearance can still access data from US TikTok users including public videos and comments.

""Employees outside the US including China-based employees can have access to TikTok US user data subject to a series of robust cybersecurity controls and authorization approval protocols overseen by our US-based security team"" the letter states.

It goes on to describe ""Project Texas"" an initiative to strengthen the company's data security practices in conjunction with Oracle and consultancy Booz Allen.

""The broad goal for Project Texas is to help build trust with users and key stakeholders by improving our systems and controls but it is also to make substantive progress toward compliance with a final agreement with the US government that will fully safeguard user data and US national security interests"" Chew's letter explained.

The letter stated TikTok's data handling is being reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ""to help ensure compliance and enhance protection of US user data defined as 'protected.'""

Not all data will be defined as ""protected."" Employees based outside the US including those in China ""will have access to a narrow set of non-sensitive TikTok US user data such as public videos and comments"" for the sake of global interoperability the letter explained.

One has to wonder if Beijing's intelligence agencies ordering ByteDance to hand over Americans' information counts as global interoperability or a narrow set of data access.

A TikTok spokesperson said the company does not share correspondence with Congress but confirmed the authenticity of the letter published by the newspaper.

TikTok's letter represents a response to several Republican senators who penned a letter on June 27 2022 to TikTok's CEO demanding answers within three weeks to eleven questions about how the company handles US users' data.

The lawmakers' missive notes that at a Senate subcommittee hearing in October 2021 Michael Beckerman TikTok's Head of Public Policy for the Americas had indicated that TikTok is not transmitting data to Beijing and that the data associated with US TikTok users is stored in the US. The senators questioned whether the company made false statements in light of reports that contradict its claims.

In his response Chew claims that TikTok did not at any point mislead Congress about company data and security controls and practices.

TikTok has been under fire since the Trump administration two years ago tried to have the app banned from the US in an effort to force its China-based parent company to sell to a US-based owner. A year ago President Biden revoked the Trump-era executive orders that would have banned TikTok and other apps operated by Chinese companies. But he did so in executive orders promoting the protection of Americans' data and directing the Commerce Department to look into the issue.

The change of administrations has not really diminished concerns about data privacy data sovereignty and supply chain security. Nor has it diminished political grandstanding. On Thursday Brendan Carr a Republican FCC Commissioner asked Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai to remove the TikTok app from the iOS App Store and Google Play. Carr's letter to the two CEOs cites past reports about TikTok as evidence that the TikTok app presently violates App Store and Google Play policies.

""TikTok doesn’t just see its users' dance videos"" said Carr via Twitter. ""It collects search and browsing histories keystroke patterns biometric identifiers draft messages and metadata plus it has collected the text images and videos that are stored on a device's clipboard.""

TikTok which discloses extensive data collection that isn't significantly different from American social media apps continues to be available through the iOS App Store and Google Play. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL2JhbmZpZWxkL29saWdhcmNocy1pbnNpZGUtdGhlLW1pbmRzLW9mLXRoZS13ZWFsdGhpZXN0LWFtZXJpY2Fucy_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzbmF0aW9ubm93LmNvbS9iYW5maWVsZC9vbGlnYXJjaHMtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1taW5kcy1vZi10aGUtd2VhbHRoaWVzdC1hbWVyaWNhbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American oligarchs: Inside the minds of this country’s wealthiest people,"(NewsNation) — Russia may have given “oligarchs” a bad name but other countries have them too. They’re private citizens who are unbelievably rich unbelievably powerful and seemingly unavailable to their fellow citizens.

This week NewsNation’s “Banfield” did a deep dive into the oligarchy of America which has more of these people than any other country on earth. NewsNation’s Brian Entin spoke with former employees of the oligarchs journalists and technology experts about these mysterious billionaires.

ELON MUSK: $221.4 billion NET WORTH

“Banfield” started with the world’s richest individual Elon Musk.

“Elon sleeps in the factory in his sleeping bag” Joe Justice a former Tesla employee said. “Elon is accessible. If you’re also working on the most important thing then Elon is there. You can always email or chat or message Elon. Or walk over.”

The Tesla and SpaceX owner is also trying to buy Twitter in a $44 billion deal.

Twitter’s board has recommended unanimously that shareholders approve the proposed $44 billion sale of the company to billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk according to a regulatory filing last week.

“I think it is way too much power” Dr. Nolan Hidgon the author of “The Anatomy of Fake News” said. “Historically wealthy individuals have bought media platforms to manufacture consent from the public for their economic and political interests.”

Jeff Bezos: $135.3 billion net worth

The founder of Amazon Jeff Bezos was the first human being to reach a net worth of $100 billion and $200 billion.

From 1990 to 1994 Bezos worked for one of the most successful hedge funds on Wall Street for D.E. Shaw & Co. New York.

Its founder David Shaw tasked Bezos with figuring out what could be sold on the internet for the highest profit. Bezos pitched the idea of books which is how Amazon began.

“Bezos built this empire on the strength of starting with books but he understood early on that he was aiming to be the so-called “Everything Store.” Eventually he could become this sort of middle merchant between the factories of the world and the households of the world” New York Times Global Economics Correspondent Peter S. Goodman said on “Banfield.”

Bezos stepped down as CEO on July 5th in 2021 handing over the reins as the company navigated the challenges of a world fighting to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.

During the time that Bezos was the CEO at least 189 instances of “suicide attempts suicidal thoughts and other mental health episodes” happened between October 2013 and October 2018 The Daily Beast reported.

“He’s one of the wealthiest men to ever live in the entire world. He’s doing that it seems by cutting costs when it comes to average entry-level employees. There were all these reports about Amazon employees trying to unionize just to get some basic rights. To get breaks” New York Post Business Reporter Lydia Moynihan said. “He seems like he’s the kind of person who’s willing to do whatever it takes to maintain his empire.”

“There’s no question that Bezos has very unapologetically set up a pressure cooker environment where he’s extraordinarily demanding” Goodman added.

Bill Gates: $124.1 billion net worth

Bill Gates the billionaire whose squeaky clean image has taken a beating is now buying a lot of farmland.

He’s purchased 27000 acres so far in the United States and his latest purchase was 2000 acres in North Dakota. Apparently the neighbors there are furious.

The college dropout and software pioneer was the richest man in the world from 1995-2009.

“I think the fact that he is the largest owner of farmland illustrates that it’s not a baseless conspiracy or slippery slope to say that unless stopped oligarchs will continue to accumulate as much wealth and resources as possible. Until theoretically there’s nothing left for everybody else” Dr. Nolan Higdon said on “Banfield.”

Similar to management under Bezos Gates has also been described as an angry and difficult boss in his early Microsoft days.

“He was very combative. He didn’t even really want to talk to anybody but senior management. He would say things like ‘that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.’ These guys don’t get to the top by being like Mr. Rogers. You can’t get to the top by being a nice guy” Dana Kennedy the national writer for The New York Post said.

In 2021 Bill and Melinda Gates announced their divorce however they said they would continue their foundation. The Gates Foundation said the ex-couple would continue to work as co-chairs for a two-year trial period and after that time if the arrangement unravels Melinda would step down.

“I think they do give money to causes that a lot of people would advocate for but the reality is a lot of that money goes to policy papers lobbying and ways of him influencing lawmakers” Higdon said. “The proof really needs to be in the outcome. What are the outcomes of this funding? It’s just a way for Gates to expand his influence and to improve his public image.”

Mark Zuckerberg: $55.5 billioN NET WORTH

Mark Zuckerberg was a billionaire by the age of 23 and the computer program that he and his Harvard roommates launched in 2004 also known as Facebook has 2.9 billion active monthly users.

Facebook now known as Meta owns 94 companies. The major Facebook acquisitions are Instagram Whatsapp and Oculus VR.

Facebook is among the several social media apps that may be subject to lawsuits in California if children become addicted to their apps.

The complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claims Meta is responsible for Spence’s addiction to Instagram and that Meta knowingly targets preteen users with an addictive app featuring algorithms that lead users to harmful content.

“The way that Facebook and other social media platforms make money is by keeping us addicted right? The more time that we all spend on these platforms the more money they can make from advertisers. It’s just that simple” Associate Professor at Hofstra University Kara Alaimo said.

US Sun reporter Charlotte Edward said there’s a lot we don’t know about Zuckerberg. He spends $27 million a year just on security to keep him and his family safe.

“This is a man that has big plans for the world. He’s investing billions right now in the metaverse and he’s creating this new virtual reality that he thinks we’re going to live in in the next 10 years” Edwards said.

“I think the real problem is these tech guys are very clever on a certain kind of mathematical level a certain abstract level but they have no feeling about how human beings actually are” Social Trends expert Joel Kotkin said.

Klotlin says that Zuckerberg believes that the future of humanity is the metaverse.

“It’s a really serious issue. And I think one that people have to pay attention to is this the vision we want and think about the fact that he and his offspring and people around them are going to have enough money to fund nonprofits for the next 100 years which will shake public perceptions and policies to their desire” Klotlin added.

LARRY ELLISON: $49.3 billion

Larry Ellison is the co-founder of Oracle Corporation which has major customers including Netflix eBay and LinkedIn.

Oracle is the third-largest software company in the world but not a lot of Americans are aware.

“He’s trying to be noncontroversial and intentionally so. He wants to stay off the radar. Oracle is not known among average Americans. It’s not as flashy as Amazon or Tesla or SpaceX” New York Post reporter Mary Jacob said.

Ellison got his start by building databases for the CIA.

“The actual origin of Oracle came from a research paper that he founded at IBM. He took the risk” said Build Your Wealth Quotient Author David Friedman.

“Structurally Oracle is a B2B company. It serves businesses not consumers. I think he just cares about winning. I don’t know if he cares about whether people know it or not” Friedman added.

Baylor University Assistant Professor Luke Winslow also weighed in on the conversation and said that oligarchy is about bridging economic and political power.

“I think what oligarchs are primarily concerned with is if the processes by which they bridge economic and political power are well-known.

The Guardian reports that Nine Republican senators this week issued a later to TikTok following a report by Buzzfeed last month claiming that employees of ByteDance (TikTok’s parent company) were able to access private data of American users from their work location in China.

The Guardian adds that a Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also requested chief executives of Apple and Google to remove TikTok from its app stores while the issue is ongoing.

TikTok responded to the senators’ letter confirming that the company is working with the Biden administration on an agreement that would “fully safeguard user data and US national security interests” according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.

TikTok’s chief executive Shou Zi Chew wrote that ByteDance was working with US cloud computing company Oracle on “new advanced data security controls that we hope to finalize in the near future.”

The company’s letter acknowledged that China-based employees “can have access to TikTok US user data.” However it argued that access is subject to “robust cybersecurity controls and authorization approval protocols overseen by our US-based security team.”

TikTok has quickly become one of the world’s biggest social networks. In September 2021 it reported one billion monthly active users worldwide representing a 45 percent growth compared to the previously reported figure of 689 million in July 2020. Experts put the company’s value at between $50 and $75billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdGlrdG9rLWNoaW5hLWJhc2VkLWVtcGxveWVlcy1jYW4tc2VlLXVzLXVzZXItZGF0YV9pZDE0MTA5OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikTok comes clean and admits China-based employees can access data it has on you,"Bloomberg There might be something fishy about China's ByteDance's short-form video app TikTok's data security practices after all suggests a newreport.





Former US President Donald Trump deemed TikTok a security risk and tried to ban it. He wanted the parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US business. President Joe Biden revoked the ban in June 2021.





Recently some US senators accused TikTok of keeping tabs on US citizens after Buzzfeed News published a report that said TikTok's engineers in China could access US consumer data and had asked whether China-based employees had access to US users’ data and whether that information was being shared with the Chinese government.





Responding to those nine senators TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew admitted in a letter that some China-based employees can access information from US users including public videos and comments. He added that none of that data is shared with the Chinese government and is subject to tough security controls.





Chew also said that TikTok has limited links to ByteDance and the information that non-US-based employees are able to access is non-sensitive in nature and this sharing helps ensure global interoperability.





This led to more criticism from US lawmakers about TikTok's data-sharing protocols.









TikTok says it's working with the US government to strengthen security around consumer data especially the information that the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) defines as protected.





Under an effort called ""Project Texas' the social media company is making moves to address lawmakers' concerns. This includes physically storing information about US customers on US servers owned by Oracle . TikTok is also shifting its platform to the American software company's cloud infrastructure.





Currently 100 percent of US traffic is routed to Oracle Corp but that data is backed up to the company's own data centers in the US and Singapore. TikTok intends to fully migrate to Oracle's US servers in the future and delete the information from its own systems.





According to app intelligence company SensorTower TikTok has been downloaded 321.6 million times in the US."

So do Jeff Bezos and Dan Schulman PayPal’s chief executive. The jets roughly 470 of which are in operation retail for about $75 million each.

Most days those planes are spread out ferrying captains of industry to meetings around the globe. But for one week in July some of them converge on a single 100-foot-wide asphalt runway beside the jagged hills of Idaho’s Wood River Valley.

The occasion is the annual Sun Valley conference a shoulder-rubbing bonanza organized by the secretive investment bank Allen & Company. Known as “summer camp for billionaires” the conference kicks off this year on Tuesday and it draws industry titans and their families — some of whom are watched over by local babysitters bound by nondisclosure agreements. In between organized hikes and fly-fishing at past gatherings there have been sessions on creativity climate change and immigration reform.

For decades at these secluded gatherings chief executives and board chairmen have made deals that have shaped the TV we watch the news we consume and the products we buy. It is where near the ninth hole of the golf course the head of General Electric expressed interest in selling NBC to Comcast. It is where Mr. Bezos met with the owner of The Washington Post before agreeing to buy the paper and where Disney pursued a plan to purchase ABC — with Warren Buffett at the center of the discussions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9tb25leS9maXZlLXNjYW1zLXdhdGNoLW91dC1pbmNsdWRpbmctMjczNzYzMTHSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvbW9uZXkvZml2ZS1zY2Ftcy13YXRjaC1vdXQtaW5jbHVkaW5nLTI3Mzc2MzExLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five scams to watch out for - including PayPal con that could empty your account,"Consumer rights expert Martyn James is hearing from increasing numbers of people who are being scammed out of their hard-earned cash. Here he explains what tools you have to beat the scammers

Five scams to watch out for - including PayPal con that could empty your account

Keeping up with the scammers is a never-ending challenge.

Just when you think you’ve heard it all a new variation emerges that people aren’t expecting.

I’m afraid that the simplest advice of all to avoid getting ripped off is to be a bit cynical about everything.

Don’t ever click on links sent by email or text hang up on people calling from official organisations or businesses and call them back on the correct numbers and be wary of doorstep fraudsters too.

Scams are big business – and the sheer number of fraudsters out there means it’s increasingly hard for the police to investigate them.

But there are ways you can fight back.

What are the latest scams to be aware of?

I’m sorry to say that the same old fraud methods are still doing the rounds in new guises.

But here’s a list of some of the new scams that you might not have encountered yet.

PayPal friends and family

I’m hearing from increasing numbers of people who have been tricked into paying for goods or services by using PayPal’s ""Friends and Family"" option.

By using this service you can avoid paying a fee.

However ""Friends and Family"" payments are basically a money transfer and therefore are not covered by PayPal’s buyer/seller protection schemes.

I’ve spoken to PayPal and they are clear – you should never use this method of payment unless you are sending money to an actual friend or family member.

WhatsApp fake friends and offers

There has been a rise in scams targeting people on WhatsApp recently with lots of people falling for an offer of a cooler full of beer just a few weeks ago – in that case you claimed by clicking on a (fake) link.

Lots of people I speak to tell me that they assume because WhatsApp is encrypted scammers can’t target them.

But it is possible to ‘spoof’ or use malware to make a number look like it’s from a friend or family member or simply take over your account.

When you click on the link the fraudsters try to pinch your data or hijack your account.

Post and delivery texts

Back with a vengeance in the last few weeks is the fake postal delivery company message.

The scam works because many of us have items on order that might be due to be delivered soon.

The text or email says your parcel could not be delivered and invites you to follow a link.

You’ll then be asked to either pay a minor post charge (giving away your bank details) or enter a few personal details (after which the information is used to crack any online accounts you have.

Phone scams and sim swaps

The sim-swap scam involves fraudsters sifting through the online black market of hacked and stolen data and gathering enough to build up a pretty good guess of what your personal log in details to official sites might be.

Once they have enough information the fraudster contacts your mobile phone provider and requests a sim card swap – which then allows them to access your private details from official notifications and emails from banks and other financial services.

A new variation on the scam involves requesting a ""PAC code"" - a way to simplify switching to a new phone provider by text that rather unfortunately can also facilitate this scam.

This can happen to anyone – even Twitter’s Chief Executive Jack Dorsey got caught out.

The latest variant is fraudsters using stolen personal data to get into your mobile phone contract order a new phone to your address then the scammers pretend to be the phone firm or delivery company and ask you to send it back (or even collect it from your door!).

People only discover the fraud when they get hit with a bill for the stolen phone.

Stay vigilant and keep an eye on your bills – and only contact your mobile phone firm through their official channels.

Unable to make a payment scams

The days of badly spelt emails from foreign princes wanting to let money ""rest"" in your account are long gone.

The latest email scams are ultra-convincing.

Many purport to be from retailers banks or other official organisations notifying you that a payment has failed and to log in to the account to sort out the problem.

These emails are so convincing I nearly fell for one from (fake) PayPal.

These emails work because we are all often busy and distracted and click on a link without thinking.

If you do this change all your passwords asap and notify your bank and card providers.

New ways to fight the fraudsters – your free toolkit

If you have transferred money or given access to your accounts then contact your bank as soon as possible either through 159 or by calling the number on the back of your card (hang up on anyone who calls you direct and listen for a proper dialling tone when you call back just in case the scammer hasn’t disconnected).

The sooner you seek help the better your chances are of getting your cash back.

The Stop Scams UK campaign launched a new number last year that you can call if you suspect that a fraudster is trying to trick you by pretending to be your bank.

If you are called by someone claiming to be from a bank - or you are asked to transfer money by someone ""official"" - hang up dial 159 and you’ll be connected to your actual bank.

The scheme covers almost all the banks in the UK and is simple and free to use.

Over 100000 people have already used it to beat the fraudsters.

A brand new scheme has just been launched through Citizens Advice to provide advice for people who have been tricked out of their cash or are concerned that they’ve been exposed to a scam.

It’s a free service so share the link above with everyone you know particularly if they are older or more vulnerable.

Don’t give up on a complaint! The free Financial Ombudsman Service can look at complaints about fraud issues and financial services.

So if you are tricked into handing over cash but the bank failed to help you warn you or deal with your complaint properly the Ombudsman might take a different view.

Last year they upheld 60% of fraud cases in the complainant's favour – a huge amount and a warning to the banks they must do better.

If you’re worried that your email or phone number has been in a data leak you can check haveibeenpwned for free.

And if you want to learn more about how you can protect your data and find out who has it (and what they have) then Rightly have some great tips too.

Free services like these matter because £572million was lost on plastic card fraud alone last year and £583million was lost on ""push payment"" fraud where people are tricked into transferring money or giving access to their accounts.

And that’s just two types of fraud.

Elon Musk is a 51 year old entrepreneur from South Africa and is most famous for launching the companies Tesla and SpaceX which have made him the richest man on earth since 2021.

Musk has had countless successful business ventures in his time. For example SpaceX was the first ever company to launch a commercial space flight.

In 1999 Musk set up bank X.com an online financial services/payments company which merged with Confinity in 2000 to create PayPal.

eBay then bought PayPal in 2002 for $2.1 billion earning Musk a personal fortune of $247 million.

Other notable companies the billionaire has founded include Neuralink The Boring Company and SolarCity.

One of his more recent exploits is trying to become the primary shareholder of social media giant twitter which brings us on to the big question: Why Has Elon Musk Stopped Tweeting?

Why Has Elon Musk Stopped Tweeting?

Despite having over 100 million twitter followers the billionaire has strangely gone silent on the social media platform.

Advert

One theory to why this has occurred stems from a recent open letter from SpaceX employees criticising Elon Musk for using twitter too much.

The letter which is titled ‘An open letter to the Executives of SpaceX’ has called out the company founder for being a “distraction and embarrassment” to the corporation.

The document goes on to say “Elon’s behavior in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us particularly in recent weeks.”

“As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX — every tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company.”

Advert

Up until 16 June the day the letter appeared Musk averaged around 145 tweets and retweets per week or about 21 per day.

Since then his twitter interactions slowly petered out until the 21st June when he abandoned posting on the platform whatsoever.

This is not the first time Elon Musk has taken a break from twitter however he is usually only absent for around a few days making his current silence a new record.

This all seems rather peculiar given that Musk is in the process of buying the service he’s disappeared from for an eye watering $44 billion.

As per reports post lockdown there has been an increased investment in lush properties by high net worth individuals (Representational Image: Pixabay)

Delhi: Whole-time director at Varun Beverages Varun Jaipuria has reportedly bought a farmhouse in Delhi stretching over 2.5 acres of land for over Rs 120 crore. Accorded as one of the biggest value transactions in Delhi only three people are said to be aware about this deal. The farmhouse is located in Delhi. At present Varun Beverages is the second largest franchise of PepsiCo after the one in US.

According to a report by Economic Times jewelers Manoj Kumar Samdaria and Sarla Jain were the owners of the farmhouse bought. Samdaria also confirmed about the transaction but did not reveal any further detail about the deal. While there has been no official statement from Jaipuria himself yet as per a Zapkey.com the registry for this massive transaction was already done on June 20.

This farmhouse is ranked amongst the most prime properties at Moulsari avenue in Westend Greens.

Big Purchases Trend

Covid induced lockdowns brought in lots of concepts and cultures which otherwise were untrodden paths until now like – work from home webinars staycations etc. As everyone was confined to the walls in their houses eventually people started looking for alternatives.

According to property experts there has been an upward trend observed where wealthy businessmen and executives have made high end purchases of luxurious farmhouse properties post lockdown and continue to do so.

Few examples

Founder of Aakash Educational Services Ltd JC Chaudhary purchased a farmhouse in South Delhi for Rs 235 crore few months back . The farmhouse is spread on a 5 acre land.

Jaquar India’s one of the leading sanitary ware company also spent Rs 235 crores for buying three farmhouses in Westend greens Delhi.

Within a range of Rs 10 crore to Rs 150 crore Delhi boasts of about 300 farmhouses which are on sale currently. Mostly these properties are built in Sultanpur Vasant Kunj Westend Greens and few other regions in Delhi.

Metros building luxury properties

There are few clusters of farmhouses around Rajkori Chattarpur Panipat and Mehrauli as well. Reportedly Delhi is the only city in India that has areas reserved for farms in its master plans. Sprawling over expansive land of around 1-2.5 acres there are about 4000 farmhouses in 18 villages around the national capital.

Speaking of metros areas in proximity to Mumbai – Karjat Igatpuri- are constructing upcoming posh farmhouses areas. Following suit in this development spree are the Southern cities of Benguluru and Chennai as well.

He is also a mensch.

In an interview at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on Tuesday ahead of receiving the 2022 Genesis Prize for his leadership in the development of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Bourla revealed that he would donate the $1 million award to building a Holocaust museum in his home town of Thessaloniki (also known as Salonika).

During the interview he praised Pfizer’s successful partnership with Israel in combating the pandemic and said he was extremely impressed by the country. “This is a miracle what is happening here in Israel which is right now one of the most advanced nations in the world” he said. “This is a miracle of which all Jews should be very proud.”

Wherever the 60-year-old Bourla went in his first visit here in 46 years – from the ANU Museum to Yad Vashem – he was treated as a celebrity and he graciously allowed people to take photographs with him. At all times his modesty and humanity shone through. As Genesis Prize Deputy CEO Sana Britavsky put it “Albert himself is a humble man but also a remarkable Jewish phenomenon. The story of his roots commitment to his identity and how this identity influenced his achievements is a fascinating one.”

Born to a family who survived the Holocaust in Thessaloniki Bourla joined Pfizer in 1993 initially serving as a veterinary doctor and technical director for the company’s animal health division in Greece. He immigrated to the US in 2001 and worked his way up the corporate ladder to CEO at the beginning of 2019. He lives today in Scarsdale New York with his wife Myriam with whom he has a son and daughter. SPEAKING AT the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland May 25. (credit: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters)

Bourla is credited with leading Pfizer’s extraordinary campaign against COVID-19 around the world and he is now working on adapting its technology to treat other diseases such as cancer.

How did you receive the announcement that you were this year’s laureate of the Genesis Prize?

I got a phone call from the president of the Genesis Prize. I was really shocked. I didn’t expect it. I said “I don’t know what to say.” He said “Good luck” and that was it.

What does the Genesis Prize mean to you?

It’s a very important recognition for me. I was blessed to be recognized by many countries and institutions but when you receive something that comes from your own people it matters way more. It’s an award that has been given so far to some of the most distinguished Jews in the world so I was really humbled.

What do you plan to do with the prize money?

That was an easy decision for me. I come from a city that used to host one of the most vibrant Jewish communities – Salonika a community known as “the little Jerusalem.” It was a very big Sephardi community which had the highest extermination rate of all cities in the world during the Holocaust: 96%. Of 50000 Jews only 2000 survived. We do not have a Holocaust museum that reflects the tragedy that happened there and so the money will go to build and support a museum there.

Is there a construction plan?

Yes it will be built on the premises of the old railway station in the city where all Jews were loaded into the trains and most were taken to Auschwitz and others to Treblinka. The community has secured the land and already has the first architectural plans and I want to get involved and push in all directions so that we can start building very soon.

ON HIS visit to Yad Vashem with his wife Myriam (L) Yad Vashem chairman Danny Dayan (Second from R) and Genesis Prize Foundation chairman Stan Polovets (R). (credit: LENS PRODUCTIONS) As the son of parents who survived the Holocaust what was it like to visit Yad Vashem on Monday?

It was my second visit to Yad Vashem. My first was as a kid. There are no words to describe it. On my way out someone told me “You never come out of Yad Vashem the same way you go in.” It’s exactly the feeling I felt.

How has Israel changed since your last visit 46 years ago?

Although I wasn’t here physically I’ve always been close to Israel closely following what’s happening here and I have many Israeli friends so I have a very good understanding of what’s happening here. On my first visit 46 years ago I remember that it was the day of Operation Entebbe in Uganda. I was 15 years old at the time and I remember that when I landed everybody was celebrating. My impression of those days was an impression of pride. I was coming from Greece and here I found a way more developed nation. And now I’m even more impressed. This is a miracle what is happening here in Israel which is right now one of the most advanced nations in the world. This is a miracle of which all Jews should be very proud.

How do you see your connection to your Jewish values the Jewish people and Israel?

We grew up in a very small community. As I said 2000 survived but only 700 remained in the city. Many went to Israel many went to Athens. We learned to support each other. We learned that we need to stay strong together and we learned that there is a safe harbor for all of us: Israel. This is what my father taught me this is what my mother taught me. They knew that their kids may have a better future because if something goes wrong again there is no other place in which we can be safe. So that creates a Jewish identity that is stronger than anything else and it’s very deep inside me – the feeling that I belong to a nation that I belong to a people. We have been different; we kept our traditions despite the persecution and we thrive despite the envy and the attacks by many over the years. I feel very proud of our religion.

What was it like as CEO of Pfizer to partner with Israel in the vaccination campaign?

Of course it was a fantastic feeling. I said many times around the world that Israel deserved what it received because it was the best country in the world to partner with and demonstrate that there is hope. Basically that’s what it’s about: that the dark days of the pandemic can disappear with the use of the vaccine. But the fact that I was able to help my people was very very important.

We seem to be experiencing a new wave even though the fourth vaccine has been shown to be effective. How do you see things developing? Do you recommend that people get a fifth vaccine?

I’ve always been very careful to rely on the recommendations of each country and authorities because every country has very unique characteristics and the people running things – particularly in Israel – are very skillful and know exactly what needs to be done. There is a new wave. I believe that not everybody has done the fourth dose and we also have the Omicron variant right now which is more challenging to control. The vaccine as Israeli data has proven reduces the chances of going to hospital or dying.

What is your recommendation to governments and people about how to cope with this variant? Should we wear masks?

I don’t make recommendations for governments. I give them data and they make recommendations. Here in Israel there is a recommendation for the fourth dose and people right now don’t need to have the social distancing measures that we used to have. There is a lot of pressure for people in all places in the world to get our lives back. But there are reasons why we can do it now. There is a very large percentage of vaccinated people and we have treatments. Right now there are oral treatments that dramatically reduce the chances that you’ll get a serious disease. With all the medical tools we have I think people can live their lives.

In what way has Pfizer’s treatment changed our world?

First of all on the positive side by giving hope to people. For me the most touching letters were letters that I received from elderly people who were living in isolation. After the circulation of the vaccine they told me that they can’t appreciate enough how it changed their lives and allowed them to spend time with their grandchildren. But also there is the message of hope because of human ingenuity. It was a very challenging technical task but science won and we were able to do what was perceived as impossible. It was another big victory that gives us confidence for the next big health challenge that the world will face.

Do you see Pfizer’s mRNA technology being used for the treatment of other diseases such as cancer?

Yes absolutely. mRNA’s first application and research work started on cancer. We still don’t have any cancer medicine based on this technology but there is a lot of work that’s happening around the world right now and I’m very hopeful that within the next couple of years we’ll have good news about this. But also the mRNA technology can be used in many other applications and vaccines for other diseases such as genetic diseases that people are born with. I think we are just scratching the surface of what the technology can deliver. Having said that it’s not a panacea which will give solutions to all medical problems. Many other technologies right now are equally exciting.

Looking back at the pandemic the investment in your vaccine campaign was a gamble that paid off. What did you learn from the experience?

The most important lesson for me was that if you task your people with a very difficult goal the first reaction is to lower the bar. If you don’t lower the bar and insist that the goal remains the goal and you provide the resources you will be surprised how much they can do. That was a serious lesson to me and we hope to repeat that with cancer.

What are your plans for the future?

I have a job that I love. I have a team that is a joy to work with and I hope that my remaining years will be as productive as the previous years.

Has being in the spotlight as a celebrity a pandemic hero who appears on ‘The Jerusalem Post’ list of the world’s top Jews changed your life?

Unfortunately I wasn’t asking for it but now I’m a public figure and a role model so I need to be very careful of what I say and what I do. I try to use this spotlight on me to do something positive. This is why I chose to speak a lot about my Jewish identity. I’m very proud of it and maybe I can also use the lights on me to speak about something that happened 70 years ago in the Holocaust. For me it is extremely important to always give a good example to those who believe in me. With this responsibility there is also the loss of privacy but I am very proud to be recognized.

What is your message to the Jewish people and Israel?

Israel has become an example to the world. Everybody – those who hate us and those who love us – know that we are able to do things that no one else has done. Not only Jews throughout the years but Jews who build this country Israel. I think the message I’d like to give is this: Try to stay as united as you can and don’t let small things divide you. There is something bigger which is the future of Israel. ■",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA3LTAzL2dzay1zLW5ldy12YWNjaW5lLWhpcmUtbG9va3MtYmV5b25kLWNvdmlkLWluLXF1ZXN0LWZvci1uZXh0LWhpdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GSK's New Vaccine Hire Looks Beyond Covid in Quest for Next Hit,"Why did this happen?

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Four-star transfer PG Miro Little has committed to Utah,"On Tuesday Craig Smith and the Runnin' Utes picked up a very valuable transfer portal addition after former Baylor guard and four-star transfer Miro Little announced his commitment to the program. This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Portland won the game 2-1 in double overtime taking the series 4-2. Advertisement

It’s all over for the Prince George Cougars.

Josh Davies ended the Cats’ terrific season 5:40 into double overtime with a gut-wrenching shot from 30 feet out sending the Portland Winterhawks to the WHL championship series with a 2-1 victory in Game 6 of the Western Conference championship Monday at CN Centre.

The longest game in Prince George’s 30-year WHL history ended in sudden death and it came seconds after Borya Valis’s close-range shot at immortality at the other end of the rink was blocked by Portland defenceman Tyson Jugnauth. The puck skipped to Josh Mori who fed it up to Davies and he wired a low wrist shot into the far corner behind Joshua Ravensbergen.

“They got a couple good chances in our end and we got a good block Josh Mori made a nice play and I joined the rush and after that I kind of blacked out” said Davies. “I saw the puck go in the net and the rest is history.

“Our team was ready for big moments like this this is what we grinded out all year for. Now that the moment has come we couldn’t be happier. We’re in the dance now and we’re ready to go.”

The Winterhawks will now await the winner of the Saskatoon Blades-Moose Jaw Warriors series to determine who they will be playing in the next round.

Davies a Florida Panthers draft pick in 2022 missed four games of the series with an injury and his return to the lineup after being sidelined in Game 1 came just in time for the ‘Hawks.

Both teams had glorious chances to end it in the first overtime period.

Portland failed to convert a 3-on-1 chance just before the three-minute mark when Ravensbergen stuffed the shot from Diego Buttazzoni. Thirteen minutes into overtime ‘Hawks captain Gabe Klassen got the puck in deep and tried to tuck it between the goalie’s legs but Ravensbergen somehow came up with the stop.

The Winterhawks took a penalty 8:20 into overtime and came out of it unscathed holding the P.G. power play without a shot. The Cougars buzzed the net numerous times with great looks but came up empty trying to put one past Spunar.

The opening goal of the game came with a minute left in the second period but nobody knew that for certain until after the clock had run out. The goal from Winterhawks exquisite playmaker Nate Danielson came as a result of a close-in shot that crossed the line and was instantly cleared by Cougars defenceman Hudson Thornton as the Portland players briefly celebrated. The play continued and the period ended with Thornton bouncing a high shot that nearly found the back of the Portland net behind Jan Spunar.

The Cougar coaching staff was already heading into the locker room when video goal judge Lance Van Helvoirt confirmed Danielson’s shot had indeed crossed the goal line. He got on the phone with referee Bobby Jo Love to tell him it was a good goal giving the Hawks a 1-0 lead to take into the second intermission.

It didn’t take long for the Cougars to tie it up.

Zac Funk gained the puck behind the goal line and pushed it over to Riley Heidt who wasted no time dumping it out into the slot for Valis who blasted it in for his ninth of the playoffs much to the delight of Cougar fans in a sellout crowd of 6016 who leapt to their feet with an ear-splitting roar.

Both teams had their chances gunning for the go-ahead goal. Mori joined the rush and Ravensbergen kicked out a dangerous-looking shot just before the Cougars went on the power play midway through the third period. The puck was in the Portland zone for most of that two-minute session but they couldn’t beat Spunar.

With less than two minutes left in regulation time Chase Pauls made a nice play with his glove at the blueline to knock down a Portland clearing attempt and his shot deflected off Ondrej Becher in the slot and just missed the net high.

Winterhawks head coach and general manager Mike Johnston noted that while the series produced a few lopsided scores he thought all six games reflected how close the two teams were. The Cougars finished just one point ahead of Portland atop the Western Conference standings and both teams raised their game in the series to an amazing level that produced highly-entertaining hockey that impressed everyone in the building.

“I know there was some games where there was a spread on the score and it looked like one team was maybe winning it easier but I don’t think through the whole series there was more than a one-goal difference between the teams” said Johnston. “Both teams played outstanding in the series. Both teams have a core of really good players and both play a style that up-tempo and fast as you saw tonight.

“I’ve been on the other side with a good team like P.G. had and you’re home trying to squeeze it out and you miss it. We were fortunate You got to get a bounce and we got a bounce. It was a big character win for us because we were down a few players. Playing a series without (Luca) Cagnoni our top-minute defenceman was a big loss for us but they lost (Terik) Parascak a really key player for them.”

The Winterhawks were eliminated in the second round in the previous two playoff years and Johnston said the core of his team learned from that and used it to overcome their adversity this season.

“Now we pushed through the third round it’s hard in playoffs” he said. “Getting that experience with P.G. having a lot of returning players they’ve got to be one of the favourites heading into next year.”

If that is the case Cougar overagers Funk Thornton and Pauls won’t be there to see it having now played their last junior hockey game.

“I’m almost speechless it’s such a tough feeling honestly” said Thornton the Cougar captain after spending about half an hour after the game in the room with his teammates. We’ve been through so much this year as a group and we’ve come so far and this city deserves so much.

“We try to give our best every single night and at the end of this you wanted to give them a championship and obviously we didn’t do that so it’s pretty disappointing. Overall we had a tremendous season and the group that we have is so special we’re brothers for life.”

The Cougars established franchise records for wins and points and finished the season as the No. 1 ranked team in Canada. They truly believed they had what it took to go all the way.

“That’s what’s so disappointing and the guys really feel it we didn’t think we were going to lose” said Cougars head coach and general manager Mark Lamb. “It was a really good year when you get by the disappointment which I can’t get by right now yet. When I look back in a couple days and reflect on it it will be a lot better but it really hurts right now.

“Winning is so so hard and the guys really got a feeling of it tonight. They played so well bit they will learn. Portland is a winning organization and they have been for a few years now and we look at that and that’s where we’re at now. We’re turning into one of those organizations .”

Spunar picked up his 12th win in 14 playoff starts and looked unbeatable at times as did Cougar goalie Josh Ravensbergen and they put on a classic goaltending clinic with both teams testing them relentlessly. The Cougars outshot Portland 49-38.

Just as they did in their two wins in the series in Portland the Winterhawks got off to a great start and the 17-year-old rookie Ravensbergen was the reason they were not be down by a goal or two after the opening period.

Led by Danielson the WHL’s player of the week who came into Monday’s game with a goal and nine assists in the series the ‘Hawks forced the Cougar goalie to make three saves in the opening minute.

The Cougars finally got their offence untracked on a four-minute power play that came 4:17 in when Davies took exception to Nick McLennan’s crushing hit that knocked Ryan Miller off his feet and into the boards and was served a double roughing penalty.

The penalty came seconds after Davies was denied by spectacular glove stop from Ravensbergen off the rush on a feed into the slot from Miller. With Davies in the box came close a couple times but the 19-year-old Czechian goalie was locked in on the task at hand.

Portland came out guns-a-blazing in the second period and severely tested Ravensbergen at least three times in the first five minutes including a glove stop to deny Kyle Chyzowski on a 2-on-1 setup and keep the game scoreless.

Inspired by their goalie’s heroic efforts the Cougars were finally able to deliver sustained pressure for the first time since their extended power play in the first period. The Funk-Heidt-Valis line delivered a dominant shift and threw everything but the kitchen sink at Spunar and he had to come up with three huge saves.

The Eastern Conference final resumes with Game 7 Tuesday night in Saskatoon. Four of the six games in the series have required overtime.

LOOSE PUCKS: The Cougars’ previous longest game happened April 10 1997 in Game 1 of the Western final in Seattle. Peter Roed ended it for the Cougars 1:59 into the second overtime. The Thunderbirds went on to win that third-round series in six games … The Winterhawks will board an Air Canada charter for the flight back to Portland Tuesday morning … Cats forward Hunter Laing was named the WHL’s rookie of the week. The 17-year-old Kelowna native scored his first career WHL playoff goal in Game 5 in Portland. He is ranked 86th on NHL Central Scouting’s final draft list …. The WHL U.S. Priority Draft will go ahead on Wednesday and on Thursday the league will have its Prospects Draft. The Regina Pats have the first pick in the U.S. draft while the Everett Silvertips will get to pick first in the Prospects Draft a result of the Joel Hofer trade the Silvertips made with Kamloops at the deadline last year …. The Cougars pick 21st out of 22 in the Prospects Draft and hold the 21st and 43rd choices when the league selects draft-eligible Americans ... Former Cougar captain Brett Connolly is back visiting his former hometown and brought his young son to the game from their home in Toronto. The 32-year-old longtime NHL’er who won the Stanley Cup with the Washington Capitals in 2018 just finished his second season playing in Switzerland.

Sittenfeld's convictions for bribery and attempted extortion should stand.

Sittenfeld the former Democratic Cincinnati city councilman is now five months into a 16-month prison sentence. He has asked the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out his convictions.

A three-judge panel made up of appointees of former President Donald Trump will hear the case: John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy.

Oral arguments are set to begin at 9 a.m.

Typical politics or campaign crime?

Sittenfeld's defense has remained consistent since he was indicted in 2020. He says his actions were typical of politics − he was raising money for future campaigns.

If his convictions are allowed to stand his attorneys say in documents filed in his appeal it would usher in ""a First Amendment Ice Age"" where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld's goals for higher office led him to accept $20000 in donations to his political action committee in exchange for his official support of a Downtown development project.

Accepting the money in exchange for an official act amounted to an illegal quid pro quo prosecutors said.

Former attorneys general under three Republican presidents the former head federal prosecutor for the southern half of Ohio and a collection of law professors with expertise in public corruption were among those who filed amicus briefs in support of Sittenfeld. The briefs argued that the convictions had criminalized typical political fundraising.

What's next for P.G. Sittenfeld case

A decision won't come for some time possibly after Sittenfeld completes his prison term. He sought a speedy review of case but that was rejected. The decision impacts Sittenfeld's future because a felony conviction prevents him from holding public office ever again."

I was blown away by your front-page story on Jody Conradt. And it was good to see her called Addie Jo again.

I like Addie Jo was blessed to grow up in Goldthwaite where we without cellphones or any other distracting devices experienced the freedom and joys of life in a small country town. I was five years older than Addie Jo but nevertheless saw early on that she was going to be a force on the basketball court. She truly loved the game.

My only claim to fame if I have any is that I taught her how to dribble with her left hand when she was being challenged on her right side!

Kudos for what Mark Cuban is accomplishing now and in the future by putting the squeeze on the pharmacy benefit managers. I’ll bet these managers haven’t called his people yet to “get this done” have they? Keep it up Mark. We’re all behind you!

3 Pioneer Natural Resources — Many of the old-timers who work for Pioneer Natural Resources call the old gal “Mama Pioneer” for good reason. Her birth was in the heady days of 1997 when two petroleum companies combined assets.

In the beginning she was worth much less than a billion dollars but now much more. I worked for her for 22 years. During those years she provided medical insurance for her workers and families double 401(k) matching contributions assistance for your children at college and free college tuition for her workers weeks of vacation and day care with an on-site physician.

Mama Pioneer grew from a young filly into the company that she is today. She carefully watches over her 2000 charges who work for her in Irving and the Permian Basin.

Good companies don’t just happen by chance. They are built from the ground up by dedicated employees.

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade major corporations are adding abortion travel costs to their employee benefits.

The goal is to ensure their employees can seek abortion care if they live in states where the procedure is now or will soon be illegal. About 26 U.S. states are expected to swiftly outlaw abortion following the overturn of the landmark 1973 ruling according to the Guttmacher Institute which researches reproductive issues.

A trickle of companies announced abortion travel coverage earlier this year after states including Texas introduced restrictive abortion laws.

POOL,Pool Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vY2hlc3RlcnBhYmxvZy53b3JkcHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvJUVGJUJGJUJDaG93LXdlLWdvdC1tZW1vcmlhbC1wYXJrLXBvb2wtb3Blbi1ieS1qdW5ldGVlbnRoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How we got Memorial Park Pool open by Juneteenth,"I was tipped off soon after getting sworn in in January to not waste any time getting the pool ready for a Memorial Day opening. I must admit that I didn’t jump right on it. I figured there had to be more important issues in January than worrying about a pool opening in late May.

Somewhere around the first of March I turned my attention to the pool starting with my first visit and tour. All I’ll share here is that it wasn’t a pleasant sight.

I’ve never operated a pool and determined I had a lot to learn quickly. I found a representative from a pool management company to walk me through the Memorial Park pool and asked that he submit and honest estimate for the work that needed to be done to bring the pool up to standard. My novice estimate for the work to be done was four times as much as what is in the budget for pool repairs and I was so far off the pool guy’s proposal which was ten times more than my estimate. That means we needed 400% more money to get the job done.

The pool guy was only looking at the pool. His estimate didn’t include other repairs that were desperately needed on the pool deck and pool house areas. Between deferred maintenance and vandalism there was no way that pool could be opened in that condition.

I joined city government just as departments were putting in their claims for American Rescue Plan (ARPA) funds. Much of the priorities on the public property side of my department had already been identified but the parks and recreation side still needed to be accounted for. In short order I identified immediate safety concerns in our parks and playgrounds that needed to be addressed and then I submitted the numbers for the pool. Immediately the Receiver’s team made the pool project a priority and earmarked the necessary funds to perform the repairs and upgrades but that money would not be released in time to open the pool by the end of May.

This is where the story gets interesting because there are many stakeholders no money huge expectations and me the guy who has to make it happen. Despite what some were advising me to do I didn’t listen and was willing to take a huge political hit by not opening the pool in its current condition until the systems were in place that all public pools must have to ensure clean safe water. There was a good chance the pool opening would have been delayed indefinitely.

Before I go further let me recognize the key people who were responsible for the pool opening on the Juneteenth weekend: The Receiver’s project management team; the city’s Chief Operating Officer; the Mayor; the Deputy Director of Public Property and Recreation along with key members of the Public Works department; the city’s engineer; the HR department; the city solicitor’s office; Laborer’s Local 413; a local corporation; the pool guy; and the sand company.

Complicating matters was the number of hands in the cookie jar. The process to get the pool opened was confusing ugly loud mean wrong improper and frustrating. We had our share of bad direction lack of communication misunderstandings and insubordination. Yet all those ingredients were needed to complete the work to open the pool with clean safe water a repaired pool deck upgrades to the boy’s and girl’s bathroom and the rehiring of long-time employees who do everything from serving as lifeguards to signing up families for memberships. Thankfully we’ll never have to do it that way again.

Memorial Park Pool 2022 features a brand new state of the art chemical control system that assures the water is perfect at all times.

If there was ever a Hail Mary moment in Chester City government this was it because the last step to get the pool open on Juneteenth depended on a delivery of sand from Pittsburgh that was arriving by truck with no assurances it would arrive in time for our guys to do what they had to do. They said it would be delivered on Monday – it didn’t arrive. They said Tuesday – that was Flag Day and I had a public works guy standing by on his holiday at home just in case the truck arrived because we needed a forklift to get it off the truck – it still didn’t arrive. They said Wednesday – it didn’t arrive. On Thursday the truck driver called me to say he was an hour away. Our guys unloaded 2.5 tons of sand off the truck and put over 80 fifty-pound bags of sand in the filter. On Friday the pool was ready.

Saturday was the Juneteenth celebration in Memorial Park and the pool was open to the public with only a few of us knowing what it took to pull off the ‘Miracle at Memorial.’

My favorite picture. There were a couple patches of concrete in bad shape on the pool deck. Kids are going to run and the tripping hazards were real. Catching this kid in a photo as he ran across the repaired concrete was a proud moment.

Adding to the drama is the new Delaware County Department of Health which launched earlier this year and has a new pool certification requirement. None of us were aware of the requirement until about 3-weeks ago and fortunately the work we did checked off a lot of the boxes of their certification requirements. The county health inspector came by yesterday to look things over and gave us a passing grade. I assured her of the Phase 2 activity that will be occurring at the pool as ARPA funds get released which will ultimately position the Memorial Park pool to be one of the most modern and up to date public pools in the county by next season.

If you’ve never enjoyed the Memorial Park pool this is the summer to come by and enjoy. It is really one of Chester’s most happy places! Thank you everyone who helped get us there.

The Mayor is a major stakeholder. We met at the pool to look things over and I told him where we were coming up short. He made a couple phone calls that only he could make and got the help we needed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbmV3czEuY29tL3dpL21pbHdhdWtlZS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDYvMjIveW1jYS1ob3N0cy0tc2FmZXR5LWFyb3VuZC13YXRlci0tcHJvZ3JhbS10by10ZWFjaC1zd2ltbWluZy1pbi1yZXNwb25zZS10by1saWZlZ3VhcmQtc2hvcnRhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YMCA hosts 'Safety Around Water' amid lifeguard shortage,"CUDAHY Wis.— While the lifeguard shortage makes it more risky to go into the water YMCA of Metropolitan Milwaukee is stepping in to make sure people know how to swim.

The Y is hosting several sessions of its ""Safety Around Water"" program at Sheridan Lincoln and Wilson Parks.

As a swim coordinator for the YMCA Dan Locher teaches kids how to swim float and get to safety.

“When you get exhausted then roll back over to your front to continue swimming to get to your desired destination. As well as learning how to jump in water that could potentially be in over your head and then learning how to jump off the floor to the wall to safety. So even if you are not the most competent swimmer it gives you tools that can allow you to get back to safety” said Locher.

Locher has been a swim instructor since he was a teenager.

He said the biggest reward of this profession is seeing someone learning the process of how to swim.

“The world is mostly water and we are mostly water so I feel kinda that everybody should be able to at least function in the water even if they don’t want to spend a lot of time in the water” said Locher.

Zachariah Hutchens serves as the aquatics director for the YMCA of Metropolitan Milwaukee.

He said the “Safety Around Water” program is a partnership between the Y Milwaukee County Parks and Pool Corp. The partnership helps keep the lessons affordable.

“What we are trying to do is empower kids by teaching them the basics of water survival to try and combat the drownings that happen throughout our city” said Hutchens.

Hutchens said he believes the kids that are learning to swim today could be the lifeguards of tomorrow.

“Hopefully by getting the kids involved in these programs we can really instill a love and a joy and being in and around the water because it is such a fun place to be especially in the hot summers that we get. Everybody wants to be able to cool off so hopefully like I said that they learn to love it. They want to continue and bring that joy and experience to others as they grow up throughout their teens” said Hutchens.

For Locher swim lessons provide a simple joy.

“I guess just getting to play in the water all the time"" said Locher.

That’s why he said he hopes these kids learn to enjoy the water the same way he did when he was their age.

The YMCA still has more openings for its “Safety Around Water” program. Get more information on how to register here.",,,,,,,,,

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Don Bacon R-Neb.

The group Unrig Our Economy Nebraska is the local offshoot of a national effort by progressive donors to push back against GOP messaging about the economy including inflation.

The first Omaha-area ads painted Bacon as a corporate shill who protects profits over people. In Iowa and other districts the group has targeted GOP members for prescription drug votes.

Unrig’s local director Kevin Cass said Bacon blames Democrats for price hikes as businesses post record profits. Cass wants people to see Bacon talks moderate and votes conservative.

“People need to know who Don Bacon is” he said.

Bacon has said the dark money group is deflecting from economic mistakes made by President Joe Biden and Democrats. He said 2nd Congressional District voters won’t be fooled by the ads.

On Sunday Bacon said one of the “far-left” group’s goals is to “raise business taxes” which he said “undermines our economic competitiveness.” He said they want to elect his opponent.

Bacon is seeking a fourth term in November against State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha a former teacher and nonprofit executive who served previously on the Omaha Public Schools board.

The 2nd District is no stranger to spending from third-party groups. In 2020 Bacon and his opponent Kara Eastman each faced about $5 million in outside spending against them.

Sarah Baron the director of the national Unrig campaign told The Hill in June that Democrats need to make sure voters know why Republicans in Congress vote the ways they do.

She called for a “progressive populist economic message.”

The umbrella Unrig Our Economy organization is a combination of two former educational nonprofit groups Tax March and Health Care Voter which pressed for progressive policies.

Cass would not say who is funding the 501(c)4 group’s ads.

Michael Ashner a longtime corporate activist who bought a stake in parent company Unilever after the boycott announcement and led a group opposed to move said other conglomerates should take heed of the repercussions suffered by the UK multinational since Ben & Jerry’s announced a boycott of the “occupied Palestinian territories” last year.

The boycott move — which was set to come into effect at the end of this year when Ben & Jerry’s contracts with its Israeli licensee Avi Zinger were due to expire — triggered massive financial blowback for Unilever as a number of US states enacted laws requiring them to divest from companies that boycott Israel. The Securities and Exchange Commission also launched an investigation into Unilever’s response to the boycott. Ben & Jerry’s made the boycott decision independently from Unilever which it was able to do under its acquisition agreement with the corporate behemoth.

On Wednesday Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s Israel announced a deal resolving a federal court case filed by the Israeli vendor that produces and distributes Ben & Jerry’s in the country. The agreement grants the Israeli licensee independence to continue operating in Israel and the West Bank essentially quashing the boycott.

“Other multinational companies will think twice before they engage in BDS activities in the future. That’s the lesson from this” Ashner told The Times of Israel on Thursday.

Ashner has a history of corporate activism with the Winthrop Capital Partners investment group in New York. He said he saw the boycott as a threat to the Jewish state a place the US-based investor feels connected to.

“If multinational companies could start cutting off Israel because of BDS that was as dangerous to the existence of Israel as Iran. It’s a very bad slippery slope” he said. “The first and loudest to do it was Unilever and somebody had to confront Unilever not just because what Unilever was doing was wrong but to send a message to all the other multinationals that this is not a good idea.”

Shortly after the Ben & Jerry’s boycott announcement Ashner acquired an undisclosed stake in Unilever and began pressuring the board and pushing for legal action in the US. He formed an organization called the Coalition to Hold Unilever Accountable with a number of law firms lobbying groups and scholars.

Ben & Jerry’s is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unilever despite its board’s independence on some matters. Unilever is a UK-based conglomerate and one of the largest consumer goods companies in the world with some 400 brands and a market value of around $116 billion.

They wanted to send the message that the repercussions would be severe from a financial perspective a corporate standpoint and for the company’s shares.

“It wasn’t over ice cream. What if Nestle decided to cut Israel off? What if Nike all these other companies? What would that do to Israel’s standing in the world? What would it do to it economically?” Ashner said.

The group started pressuring US states to go through with laws requiring them to divest from companies that support BDS. A number of states pulled close to a billion dollars from Unilever and the company’s value plummeted over $20 billion in the months after the boycott announcement at a time when the market was on the rise. Over 30 states have anti-BDS legislation and 12 state attorneys general and treasurers from seven states also called on Unilever to reconsider the boycott.

Separately Ashner and his partners also pushed the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Unilever claiming the company did not properly disclose to investors the risks stemming from the boycott.

Four US House Representatives signed onto a letter to the SEC including New York’s Ritchie Torres and Josh Gottheimer from New Jersey where Unilever’s US headquarters is located. Ashner warned Unilever of the SEC response in correspondence with Unilever’s leadership that was viewed by The Times of Israel.

On another track Ben & Jerry’s Israel and its owner Avi Zinger sued Unilever in US federal court in New Jersey saying the company was violating US and Israeli laws and illegally terminating their business relationship. The dispute ultimately came to a close when Zinger and Unilever resolved that case this week.

“This case became about so much more than just Avi Zinger. This became a case really for the Jewish people at large” said Alyza Lewin president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law which represented Zinger. “It was a case that they all felt as a people so what it did was it motivated people from far and wide to step up and do whatever they could do.”

“A lot of people were watching a lot of people were paying attention a lot of people were unhappy or angry” she said. “It’s like a machine with lots of different moving parts.”

Ashner said Unilever will likely change its business approach going forward. The company has a progressive corporate ideology with commitments to causes including the environment nutrition and living standards. Ben & Jerry’s has long pitched itself as a liberal activist company and when Unilever acquired the ice cream maker in 2000 it allowed the Ben & Jerry’s board to make those decisions independently. Unilever long maintained it had no control over the boycott decision.

“I think they’re going to have to modify their business model” Ashner said of Unilever. “Shareholders want profitable companies that are non-controversial. They’re not here to buy into investing controversy like this.”

He said prominent investor Nelson Peltz joining Unilever’s board in late May was likely a step in that direction that the firm was under pressure on other issues and that it had reached out to states that had divested because many may be able to reverse the move.

He gave Unilever credit for the agreement announced Wednesday but said the “real hero” was Zinger who inadvertently became a face in the struggle against BDS.

“I think Unilever believed that it was just going to go away and it would be able to deal with Avi in a quiet matter and it did not go away” Ashner said. “He dug his heels in and stayed the course all the way through and I think in his own way he’s heroic for what he did.”

Under the terms of his deal with Unilever Zinger has independence to produce and sell Ben & Jerry’s products in Israel and the West Bank in perpetuity. He has the exclusive rights to the Hebrew and Arabic branding but will cease using the English logo.

Ben & Jerry’s said it did not agree with the decision and will no longer profit from ice cream sales in Israel or the West Bank.

The BDS movement said Thursday that Unilever had “succumbed to bullying” and that the agreement was “further implicating the company in Israel’s decades-old system of oppression against Palestinians.”

Ashner and his family have previously been involved in philanthropy in Israel and founded the Beit Ruth therapeutic school for vulnerable women and girls in Afula.

The dispute began after last year’s May war between Israel and Gaza terror groups when Ben & Jerry’s said it would no longer allow its ice cream to be sold in Israeli settlements and also appeared to refer to East Jerusalem. The boycott announcement came after a heavy pressure campaign from anti-Israel and progressive activists. The decision sparked uproar in Israel and among some US Jewish groups many of whom called it antisemitic since the company has no boycotts against any other area of the world.

Zinger and his company refused to comply. Their license to sell the ice cream was set to expire at the end of 2022 meaning the boycott had not yet come into effect.

Critics of the attempted West Bank boycott note that Ben & Jerry’s allows its products to be sold in states with atrocious human rights records including Russia Saudi Arabia Syria Iran and China. The company has not taken action regarding other disputed territories including Tibet Crimea Western Sahara and Kashmir.

Since the law was set to amplify workers’ rights in a number of areas this put the country’s capitalist class on alert. Factory owners began to sabotage production and shut down plants. This process which put workers and owners in open conflict affected the whole country but was especially fierce in the industries of Guayana in Bolívar state.

After many long battles workers in some factories got control of the plants as mandated by the Labor Law’s article 149. Here we hear the stories of the Equipetrol and Calderys factories in Puerto Ordaz (Bolívar State). The people who kept the factories running tell us about their struggle for worker control and about the hurdles that they had to overcome to keep the plants operative during the blockade while explaining the need for import substitution.

Calderys

Since 1964 Calderys has been making refractory material: bricks and a variety of panels that can sustain extremely high temperatures and pressure for blast furnaces and other heavy industries. It was long owned by a French transnational corporation. However following an sabotage that the owners carried out in the wake of the Labor Law Calderys’ workers took control of operations in 2016. Today the Calderys plant is democratically-run by thirty highly experienced and committed workers.

THE HISTORY OF A TAKEOVER

José Guerra: Chávez’s Labor Law sparked a sabotage of production on the part of the owners. It was a coordinated effort by the capitalist class to bring the government to its knees and roll back the law.

The new Labor Law was promoted in May 2012 and by October Calderys owners had stopped paying wages alleging a negative balance in the company’s bank account. We began to track the enterprise’s revenues and we quickly discovered some rather shady dealings. The company was purchasing [state oil company] PDVSA bonds with its profits. They then exchanged the bonds for US dollars which they deposited abroad. It was a capital flight scheme.

We introduced a claim before a court and eventually the bosses paid what they owed us. They did it by selling one single truckload of Calderys’ products. It then became even more clear to us that the company had no real solvency issues: we were producing thirty truckloads each month and with just one cargo the bosses were able to pay all debts and back salaries!

Later in 2013 we got word that Calderys France the parent company was closing up operations in Venezuela and would be firing all of us. By then we had a pretty good understanding of their operational and financial schemes. So in a workers’ assembly we decided that we were not going to let it pass. This was not bankruptcy it was plain sabotage! And there were clear political objectives behind the operation.

Abimael Velásquez: When Calderys France ordered us to shut down the plant we first explored the nationalization option. Calderys’ production is strategic for the basic industries in Guayana so there should be an interest in keeping the factory running. Much to our surprise the CVG’s [state-owned Corporation of Guayana] president said nationalization wasn’t a viable option. At the time we suspected that there could be an under-the-table negotiation with the bosses who wanted to close shop while maintaining ownership of the factory.

As all this was happening we decided to be vigilant: we set a 24-hour guard and took turns to protect the plant. Our main concern was that the bosses would dismantle the factory as they had already done elsewhere.

José Guerra: By 2014 the workers at the nearby Equipetrol plant had already taken steps toward worker control. They did it with support from Jesús Martínez who was then Labor Minister and by appealing to article 149 of the new Labor Law which entitles workers to take control of a factory when the bosses jump ship.

We finally managed to take control of the enterprise here. The first thing we did was to carry out a thorough assessment of the plant with a view to reactivating production. The situation wasn’t easy because the bosses had indeed succeeded at removing the cables that fed power to the machinery. However there were workers here who had twenty and thirty years of experience so we were able to solve many problems.

Plus working-class solidarity kicked in. We got the tools and cable we needed to reactivate the factory from Carbonorca [state-owned anodes plan] Indorca [worker-run metalworks factory] and other enterprises. That is how we reactivated the plant. 2015 through 2018 were very good years for Calderys: we were running the factory democratically and we were getting contracts from the basic industries.

This doesn’t mean that it was easy. We ran into many hurdles due to our condition as a worker-run enterprise. Particularly administrative obstacles that came from the CVG bureaucracy our natural client. Nonetheless allies in the government helped us in overcoming these problems. However around 2018 things began to get harder: the crisis the sanctions fiefdoms inside the CVG and later the pandemic all colluded to bring us to a halt.

WORKERS’ DEMOCRACY AND POLITICAL EDUCATION

Abimael Velásquez: In a worker-run factory democracy becomes one of the pillars of the enterprise but the democratic spirit doesn’t appear automatically in a factory that has been run by a transnational corporation for ages. That is why the Jesús Rivero Bolivarian Workers University [UBTJR for its initials in Spanish] became so important to our project.

Around 2015 the UBTJR led workshops in political and technical education in various worker-run and publicly owned enterprises. They did so here too. We also had regular spaces to reflect on the social process of work and to talk about socialism worker control and democratic management.

José Guerra: Worker-run factories such as Calderys are run in a democratic manner. There is a three-person administrative junta but all important decisions are taken in a workers’ assembly where all votes count equally.

Here at Calderys we all work in the plant we all cook and eat lunch together and the books are open for review. In other words there are no secrets!

This is light years away from the former owners’ control mechanisms. The capitalist bosses maintained corporate secrecy and they developed questionable production practices to cut corners. They ran such an opaque operation that the company – while producing on a large scale – could allege bankruptcy!

This has much to do with Calderys being a dependent industry. Calderys’ parent company was in France and the local bosses had no commitment to Venezuela or to the workers. The revenues were turned into US dollars through various capital flight schemes.

IN LIMBO

José Guerra: Calderys is in a process of reactivation. Recently Sidor [state-owned steel plant] gave us a contract and the plant is now running but another hurdle has come up. As a worker-run factory the Labor Ministry has to annually renew Article 149 – which grants us control of the plant. Unfortunately the ministry hasn’t renewed it yet. The nearby factories Indorca and Equipetrol are in the same boat.

This limbo situation creates immediate problems for us. First there are companies such as PDVSA that need to see that our enterprise is in good legal and administrative standing before signing a contract. In fact we have lost several major jobs because the ministry has not renewed article 149 for us.

Then there is the uncertainty and precarity that the non-renovation of Article 149 brings to us. We ask ourselves: Is this just an administrative delay? If so why the radio silence? Does some power group want to take control of the plant and hand it over to the former bosses or to other capitalist interests?

Unfortunately these fears are not just paranoid speculation. Our brothers and sisters at C.E. Minerales [a factory producing alumina] are in the midst of a struggle to regain control of the factory: a few months ago an external junta was set in place by the Labor Ministry. Now the plant is being run as any old capitalist enterprise!

THE BLOCKADE AND REACTIVATION OF PRODUCTION

Abimael Velásquez: Calderys was fully active until 2018. Around that time production came close to a halt: we had very few orders. Then came the pandemic which was the final straw. Now however some orders are beginning to come in. Our hope is that as the basic industries begin to reactivate they will turn to us for contracts.

José Guerra: Here in Calderys we have one advantage when it comes to the blockade: we have a reserve of raw material. We also have our production lines operational at 70% of installed capacities. That means that we could be producing 20 thousand tons of refractory material per year if the orders came in.

To overcome the effects of the blockade we must jumpstart national production in this country from primary to tertiary sectors. We carried out a study about the production costs of refractory materials and it turns out that basing production in Venezuela [because of nearby raw material and cheap electricity] actually lowers prices. We suspect that this is true in all metalurgic production branches.

Of course import substitution requires a coordinated plan. Venezuela consumes approximately 24 thousand tons of steel per year. With the exception of very specialized kinds of steel the CVG can produce what the nation requires and more.

There is no hiding that in the basic industries the crisis took multiple plants and production lines out of operation. Our proposal is that as the CVG reactivates they develop a coordinated plan to incorporate Venezuelan industries – and particularly worker-controlled factories – into the recovery process. We can provide materials that meet international standards. In the midst of a blockade sovereign production has to become a reality!

Aldemaro Mundaraín: Turning inward toward Venezuela is a must now. Unfortunately old practices still prevail the at CVG and PDVSA: these enterprises tend to contract intermediaries who will either subcontract or more likely import the materials.

Calderys has the potential to provide refractory materials for up to 40% of what the nation requires. However we could actually increase our share of the market: we now have the installed capacity to produce 20 thousand tons of refractory materials per year but that could go up to 36 thousand if we are able to activate a production line that has been defunct since the former bosses lifted the power cables.

José Guerra: As we begin to get contracts we will invest the profits in making Calderys 100% operative. Full operation is our objective. We will do so on the basis of our accumulated experience and knowledge as workers and the history of struggle that gave us the tools to successfully run a large operation.

Equipetrol

Founded in 1984 Equipetrol is a metalworks industry specializing in producing valves manifolds wellheads and other equipment needed in the oil and gas industry. Equipetrol has been hard hit by the blockade and crisis. However the group of workers who run it has a tremendous commitment to worker control and to socialism.

HISTORY OF A STRUGGLE

Leonel Véliz: Around 2011 the bosses began to fire workers: it was a reign of terror. In a short period of time we went from having 260 to 40 workers in the plant. The plant’s manager was a psychopath. On top of the layoffs he wasn’t paying our salaries.

A struggle began and eventually in December 2012 the Ministry of Labor recognized our right to run the plant as established in article 149 of the Labor Law.

We were the first in the country to get control of an enterprise by activating the new Labor Law so the process wasn’t easy at all: we had to deal with many uncertainties. First we introduced a legal claim against the owner so that Equipetrol would pay what was still owed to the workers. While that was going on we had to protect the plant to avoid looting by the boss’s hired men.

Once we got the keys to the plant the problems continued because the former owner was still part of the transitional junta and we needed his signature for financial operations. This meant that to proceed with any banking transaction we had to rely on the representative of the boss who did everything possible to sabotage administrative processes.

One day after many hours trying to get this guy to sign some payments the owner’s lawyer came to Equipetrol with fifteen National Guards alleging that we “kidnapped” the representative. However when they arrived it was obvious that we had not kidnapped the representative. They said to him: “Nobody is hurt here sign the checks and let’s get this done with.”

Finally we were able to get the Labor Ministry to remove the former owner’s man from the junta. That is when we really got full control of Equipetrol.

A SOCIALIST ENTERPRISE

Elis Pomontti: Equipetrol is a socialist enterprise. We talk through all our decisions and keep open books when it comes to accounting. Moreover we all get paid the same. Here we look at material goods in a different way: the old saying “what is mine is mine” doesn’t apply in our company.

We often remember Comandante Chávez saying ”We should not be selfish we should be solidarious we should share what we have.” That is a revolutionary precept and an old Christian teaching – it’s important for us.

Elvis Muñoz: We are solidarious with Indorca and Calderys whenever we can. We share our knowledge with them and we even share materials and tools if we are able to do so.

We have a new perspective a new way of seeing the world. All this comes from the combination of practice and consciousness. Of course there is a discrepancy between our practice and that of the world outside – the capitalist world – and that makes our work very difficult.

Many people don’t understand where we are going. They don’t understand why we all get the same wages and they question democratic management. Unfortunately some people are not motivated by solidarity and consciousness. They talk about Chávez but they reject socialist practice.

This means that we have encountered many obstacles along the way and that Equipetrol has sometimes been up against the wall. However we are convinced that we are on the right path and we know that socialism is the future.

SERVICES FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY DURING THE BLOCKADE

Leonel Véliz: In 2013 and 2014 we reactivated our plant. We had a contract from PDVSA to make manifolds: a complex system of valves and piping used to gather or distribute oil. We developed a mechanism so that a single person could operate these manifolds as opposed to several workers.

We delivered on time but unfortunately the payment came late. Of course that generated cash flow problems and by the time the payment finally came in the bolívar was highly devalued.

More recently in 2016 we got a PDVSA contract to build wellheads together with Indorca. We were able to reverse engineer a wellhead that would otherwise have to be purchased in the US. We improved the design and we delivered two in just a month. In total we made seven wellheads.

We had support from President Maduro after that who said on national television: “This is what we need national production. Contract these people. Give them work for fifteen years.” That contract however never came through. Now a private enterprise is producing the wellheads.

The bottom line here is that we need to coordinate production in the country now more than ever. Chávez often talked about sovereignty about making what we need here in Venezuela. We know that this is possible.

I would also like to add that worker-run factories are in a privileged position to serve the nation: we are our own bosses so we don’t have to serve capitalist interests. We have no bank accounts abroad and most importantly we are committed to building a better future for Venezuela!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphY2tzb252aWxsZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wZmxhMDI0NTc3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Bertrand Monsky Obituary - Florida Times-Union,"John Bertrand Monsky was born in Montgomery Alabama in 1930. A graduate of Sidney Lanier High School Philips Academy Yale University and Harvard Business School he never left his roots or any of his dear friends behind. He served in the Air Force at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery a legacy of his uncle Sol who was awarded a Silver Star in World War I and his first cousin Leroy Monsky who was captain of the University of Alabama football team in 1937 and served under General George S. Patton.

John met his beloved wife Joan Gilbert Monsky while she was at Sarah Lawrence College and he was at Yale. The day after they met he wrote to her that he loved her and wanted to marry her. They recently celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary and were deeply in love until the day he died. She was by his side as they lived their lives and raised their family in Montgomery Alabama Louisville Kentucky and Jacksonville Florida. John and Joan were deeply dedicated to their family friends and community in Jacksonville where they both served on many non-profit boards and supported community causes. He was a champion of progressive education. He was President of the Board of Jacksonville Country Day School served on the board of the Bolles School and generously supported other educational institutions and medical centers. He also supported the efforts of his wife Joan who founded Theatreworks Inc. in Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Film Festival.

He rose through the corporate ranks and at age 40 he was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Universal Marion Corporation an American Stock Exchange listed company located in Jacksonville FL. Universal Marion owned Baldt Chain and Anchor and Scullin Steel the company that made the crawler that brought the Apollo spacecrafts to the launch pad. Universal Marion also produced Mel Brooks’ original movie The Producers a film that was so successful in the long run that John would quote the famous line from the movie “Where did we go right?”

In 1985 John founded First Florida Capital Corporation; his son Harry Robert Monsky left Wall Street to partner with him in 1995. John bestowed his wisdom integrity joy and love as they traveled the globe. John also supported the many endeavors of his eldest son John Richard Monsky and his daughter Leslie Joy Monsky. He had a southern charm and charisma; the family was constantly being told by people who met him “We love John.”

John loved to laugh with his children; grandchildren Harrison Annabel Gillian and Caitlin Monsky; his daughter in law Jennifer Weis; as well as Leslie’s boyfriend Mel Parker. He did his best to extend his motto “Love and do well” to them all. He will be hugely missed.

PLD,Prologis,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL2NvdWxkLXByb2xvZ2lzLWJlLWluLXRyb3VibGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Prologis Be in Trouble?,"The warehouse giant's stock has nosedived in 2022 but are the risks really as big as they seem?

Prologis (PLD 2.95%) is one of the largest warehouse owners in the world controlling a global collection of vital assets in key transportation hubs. The stock is down around 30% so far in 2022 as investors seem to be worried that big-picture trends will bring the company's growth to an end. That's possible of course but there's so much good news built into the portfolio that the real estate investment trust (REIT) is likely to do just fine even if there's a recession or a warehouse-sector downturn.

Here are the problems that are facing Prologis and why it will most likely take them in stride.

The bad news

Warehouses are vital cogs in the world economic order. Prologis owns more than 4600 properties across North America South America Europe and Asia. That's all well and good but warehouse demand is subject to the ebb and flow of the global economy. Recessions lead to less demand. But that's just par for the course and there's nothing that Prologis can really do about it. The weak stock price at least partly reflects concerns among investors that the world is heading toward an economic downturn thanks to high inflation rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions.

Adding to the concern here is that Amazon.com (AMZN 0.03%) recently announced that it had too much warehouse space. That was a frank admission that it overspent on space during the pandemic-driven demand spike. The fallout from this announcement is that Amazon is looking to sublease locations increasing the amount of warehouse space that's on the market. Given the retailer's size that could clearly have a negative impact on the entire warehouse sector.

For Prologis in particular Amazon is by far its largest tenant roughly double the No. 2 tenant by both occupied square feet and rents. That means that Prologis could end up competing with Amazon for tenants over the REIT's own assets.

Plenty of good news

The coronavirus pandemic likely brought forward demand for online sales that abnormally increased demand for warehouse space over the near term. Tenants might have to work through that excess but what is unlikely to change is the generally higher trajectory of online sales over the long term. So even if there's an adjustment period in which excess warehouse supply exists it will likely be absorbed eventually. That's true even with Amazon looking to sublease space.

It's also important to highlight that the increase in online shopping though headline grabbing isn't the only trend that will impact Prologis' business. For example brick and mortar stores are still a huge business. The current supply chain disruptions have retailers and many other businesses reconsidering just in time inventory practices. That means an increased need to store extra inventory to ensure that there are enough products to sell or for non-retail companies supplies to keep operating. In fact some manufacturers are bringing operations back closer to home or placing them in more stable regions another potential demand driver.

Meanwhile newer more modern properties are likely to remain in high demand. And Prologis has 10600 acres of land on which to erect the types of modern assets that will attract the most customers. It can sell older assets and effectively upgrade its portfolio with properties that generate higher rents.

As for rents in the first quarter the REIT was able to increase rental rates on expiring leases by a huge 37%. That's because existing leases were for rates far below the currently prevalent rates. Even if rental rates don't increase any more or even fall a little bit there's a huge chasm to close between in-place lease rates and current ones as leases roll over. So there's still rental growth to be had even if the warehouse market stagnates from here.

Ups and downs

Both the market and businesses move in pendulum fashion swinging from good times to bad times. Those swings can be caused by actual business conditions or simply by investor emotions. Right now a mixture of both is impacting Prologis. (The planned acquisition of a peer is also in the mix but management expects it to be accretive to adjusted FFO in year one so it seems like a net plus.) All in all however the positives seem to suggest that the long-term picture is much brighter here than what short-term fears suggest.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From the total number of 11 vessels the Enterprise own two carry fuel. However it has been leasing out the fuel carrying vessels.

The two fuel carrying vessels were procured with the intention to transport petroleum products to Ethiopia without proper studies so the Enterprise had to lease them out Roba Megersa CEO of the Enterprise disclosed.

“We will see a giant vessel in the history of Ethiopia docking at Djibouti port after disposing of these two soon” Roba said in his presentation at the onboarding meeting between the Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH) and the newly constituted 27 subsidiaries of state owned enterprises.

The Enterprise refrained from the business of transporting fuel due to requirements including assigning captains. The income secured from the ships was barely covering their own costs according to an official at the Enterprise.

The board approved its plan and once finalized Ethiopia will not have a fuel carrying vessels.

“The two vessels aren’t really profitable” the official told The Reporter adding “We will do asset valuations for the two vessels and evaluate the larger vessel to know if we have to add more money or get some in return as well.”

The Enterprise plans to acquire a larger vessel with a carrying capacity of up to 65000 tons. The Enterprise’s nine cargo carrying vessels have modest capacities ranging between 25 and 28 tons. This has been one of the biggest problems with the vessels the Enterprise owns.

“A journey takes up to three months and a smaller loading capacity isn’t lucrative” said the official adding “With the bigger vessel we will have the capacity of the two vessels.”

The enterprise appealed to the Public Enterprises Holding Administration (PEHA) the office it previously reported to to increase its capital to 90 billion birr for over a year. Similar request have made to the Ethiopian Investment Holdings according to Roba.

After reaching 3.7 billion birr in paid up capital six years ago the Enterprise surpassed its subscribed capital of 20 billion birr last year. It registered a 2.5 billion birr in additional assets Roba disclosed in his presentation.",,,,,,,,,

Crunch Fitness has announced that it plans to open a facility on Madison’s Far West Side at 7401 Mineral Point Road.

Beginning in 1980 the more than 80000-square-foot space was home to a Shopko store until the Green Bay area-based company filed for bankruptcy and closed all of its Shopko and Shopko Hometown locations in 2019. The company continues to operate optical centers.

Some demolition and prep work has been underway at the Mineral Point Road location but construction of Crunch Fitness has not yet begun. It was unclear when the facility would open how many employees it would hire and if the company had plans for other Dane County locations. Attempts to reach the company were unsuccessful.

Founded in a basement studio in 1989 in New York City Crunch Fitness serves over 1.9 million members with over 400 gyms worldwide in 34 states and the District of Columbia Australia Canada Costa Rica Portugal Puerto Rico and Spain according to its website and “is rapidly expanding across the U.S. and around the globe.” The Madison location would be the company’s second facility in Wisconsin joining another in Appleton.

When Shopko announced the closing of its stores it left many to wonder who would fill the spaces. But despite the pandemic many of those empty buildings which ranged from 80000 to 100000 square feet have found new uses.

The East Side store which opened in 1988 on Zeier Road has been converted to an At Home a home interior store. At South Towne Mall in Monona the Shopko opened in 1981 but is now home to Floor & Decor and is taking up 81500 square feet of the 98000-square-foot former Shopko space. The 16700-square-foot retail space that had been part of the Shopko but not needed by Floor & Decor is being advertised for lease by Galway Companies a Monona-based development company known for its retail projects throughout Dane County.

The Shopko just off Aberg Avenue on Madison’s North Side which opened in 1982 and closed in 2014 has been converted to a StorQuest Self Storage facility.

Self storage has been a popular use for the former Shopko spaces in Fort Atkinson Racine and Watertown. The former Janesville Shopko is being converted to a Hy-Vee grocery store the Monroe space is a Farm & Fleet while in Beaver Dam the former Shopko is a home to Warehouse 151 a wholesale company that sells direct to retailers.

In Columbus the former Shopko Hometown which in 2012 opened in a 35000-square-foot space along Highway 151 as part of a new but smaller approach to retailing is now home to Gates Auto. The dealership bills itself as having “Wisconsin’s Largest Indoor Showroom.” Meanwhile the former Shopko Hometown in Mayville was sold in 2021 to Old Fashioned Foods for use as a cheese warehouse.

Adult retailer

A strip mall that is home to Vanilla Bean Great Clips and Olson’s Vacuum Cleaner Sales & Service is about to get a little more risqué.

Work has begun on the west side of the building to create space for an Adam & Eve store one of the largest chain of stores in the country that sells lingerie adult movies and sex toys.

Located across the street from the Camera Company and on the same side of the street as Rogan’s Shoes Joann Fabric & Crafts Ross Dress for Less and a Burlington store the checkout counter with an “Adam & Eve” sign on the wall and some shelving has begun to be installed. It is unclear when the store will open but it will become the first Wisconsin store for the North Carolina-based retailer which has 105 stores in 21 states.

The company announced in May that it planned to add four stores this year and grow revenues by 20% in 2022.

“We are grateful for our franchise operators both new and existing who are benefiting from the popularity of our product assortment and trusted brand” David Keegan vice president of franchising for Adam & Eve stores said in a news release. “Adam & Eve’s store operators are positioned to have another lucrative year and this is due to our company’s ongoing commitment to support our franchisees in unique and different ways.”

The company was founded in 1971 as a mail order company selling condoms before expanding into other products and has shipped over 56 million orders according to the company’s website. It won a case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 after it sued the U.S. Justice Department for violating the First Amendment and the right to marital privacy. The company opened its first brick-and-mortar store in 1999.

McFarland addition

A new retail center that will be anchored by Grace Coffee Co. is planned for McFarland.

Dubbed the Atwater and located at 4719 Farwell St. the project from Lakestone Properties and marketed by Wisconsin Commercial Real Estate features 12000 square feet of space that could be divided into six separate spaces.

The project is scheduled to be completed in 2023 is just two blocks from McFarland High School and just east of Highway 51. It’s also adjacent to a 47-unit upscale apartment building.

State grants

Twelve companies including six in southern Wisconsin have been awarded Buy Local Buy Wisconsin grants from the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection.

The grants are part of a program designed to strengthen Wisconsin’s agriculture and food industries by helping farms and businesses more efficiently process market and distribute locally grown food products.

DATCP received 60 funding requests totaling more than $1.9 million but awarded 12 grants totaling $300000.

Blue Moon Community Farm in Stoughton received $10000 to expand capacity for fresh spring vegetable production a protected growing area and the supply of produce to increase local purchasing. Crimson Kitchen and Gardens in Watertown also received $10000 to expand food product sales and make canned food available year round to create new jobs.

Gander Family Farms in Beloit was awarded $12600 to develop marketing materials and purchase supplies for retail sales capacity expansion for a farm store while Telsaan Tea in Mount Horeb received $9504 for equipment and resources for small growers to process and package herbs.

Branches and Berries in Wauzeka received $23696 to increase market presence production and demand for berries while the Verona Area Chamber of Commerce was awarded $22000 to purchase marketing management software and increase advertising to grow the number of vendors and customers and market at the Downtown Verona Farmers Market.

Since its inception in 2008 more than 547 applications have been submitted for Buy Local Buy Wisconsin Grants requesting a total of more than $19 million in funding. Of those applications 90 projects have been funded totaling more than $2.6 million according to DATCP.

Now not only cooling but also some other features are very important when making a purchase decision. Today the AnTuTu benchmark platform released its monthly report showing the best smartphones in three categories – premium mid-range and low-end.

We mentioned the heat dissipation of smartphones because in the list for June the gaming phones lead it. As you know gaming smartphones come with boosted cooling systems.

Best Smartphones In Premium Segment

Not surprisingly the Black Shark Gaming Phone 5 Pro ranks first. It has an average score of 1040111. What’s interesting the CPU and GPU performance is not outstanding. But what makes this handset stand out is its memory. Thanks to the SSD+UFS 3.1 solution the storage is able to quickly read and write which ensures the best performance in comparison to others.

Another gaming smartphone the Red Magic 7 Pro Under-Screen Camera Version has an average score of 1031867. Interestingly when looking at the CPU and GPU scores it has no equals.

In third place we can see the Lenovo Legion Y90. Though it combines the two solutions of Black Shark and Red Magic (SSD+UFS 3.1 combination (640GB top version only) and active air cooling) it could only land in the third position.

The Best Mid-Range Smartphones

If Qualcomm chips dominate in the flagship segment MediaTek sees no rivals in the sub-flagship field. The Dimensity 8100 is almost in every model that appeared on this list.

Well the OPPO Reno8 Pro+ ranks first. It sports the MediaTek Dimensity 8100-Max processor with an average score of 822915.

Two Redmi models – the Redmi K50 and Redmi Note 11T Pro+ – are in the second and third positions respectively. The average scores are 816851 and 812671 respectively.

1 Floor Down

Not long ago Qualcomm released the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 which is built with a 4nm process and has an upgraded CPU architecture. It consists of an A710 super core at 2.4GHz + three A710 large cores at 2.36GHz + four A510 small cores at 1.8GHz. It also integrates the Adreno 662 GPU which has a 20% higher graphics rendering speed in comparison to the Snapdragon 778G.

Why we say this is that though the former one came later the Snapdragon 778G has the most representatives here.

The first model is the iQOO Z5. It sports the Snapdragon 778G with an average score of 577956. But what’s more interesting this handset has been in this position many times. Apart from the mentioned chip the phone also boasts LPDDR5 (6400Mbps) memory and UFS3.1 (V6 process) native storage.

The second place is the OPPO Reno 8 Pro which comes with the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 with an average score of 573115.

The rest of the phones feature either the Snapdragon 778G or the Dimensity 900 chips.

While the company has had a slow start selling the card it now appears that the official North American portal is selling the graphics card by bundling it with their top-tier PSU.

EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti KINGPIN Launches For A Retail Price of $2500 US Comes Bundled With a 1600W SuperNova PSU

EVGA Kingpin one of the more popular graphics card lines from the company is now on sale at $2500. In addition to the graphics card EVGA includes the company's SuperNOVA 1600 P2 power supply with an 80+ PLATINUM 1600W rating. The power supply does not feature a PCIe Gen 5 16-pin connector but can be adapted using a dual 16-pin adapter (to 6 x 8-pin connectors).

2 of 9

The EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti KINGPIN is unique because it has not one but two PCIe Gen5 16-pin connectors which is relatively rare on the market. The PCIe connections required for this layout are six 8-pin cables while the SuperNOVA 1600 P2 power supply includes nine PCIe connectors in this bundle so it should be more than good enough unless you plan on putting the card under some OC action in which case it can consume up to 1200W of power (GPU-only) using a specialized BIOS that unlocks its full power limit.

EVGA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Kingpin graphics card offers a cultivated cooling unit that is fashioned as a four-fan cooling solution. The Kingpin utilizes a hybrid AIO cooling unit attached to a 360mm external radiator with three fans. The fourth fan is installed directly on the card to allow adequate airflow to spread to the card's VRMs.

Another unique feature of the EVGA Kingpin RTX 3090 Ti is that it also includes an integrated OLED panel that displays information on temperature voltage and clocks on the display. The Kingpin is a hefty GPU that offers a custom 14-layer PCB three BIOS switches for normal OC or LN2 settings and voltage monitoring headers for high-powered overclocking.

EVGA also offers a way to help with cable management a PowerLink 52u adapter for the dual 16-pin to six 8-pin power cables adapter. Unfortunately it is unknown if the adapter is included in the bundle or sold separately.

It also features a 360mm AIO with an extra fan dedicated to cool the VRM and ships with a 1600W power supply included in the hefty price tag.

EVGA's RTX 3090 Ti Kingpin is now available three months after the launch of Nvidia's flagship Ti model GPU. This graphics card is the company's highest-end SKU designed mainly for extreme overclocking as evidenced by the onboard voltage monitoring headers and a BIOS switch with Normal OC and LN2 settings.

The Kingpin has a hybrid cooling solution consisting of a 360mm AIO liquid cooler and an extra fan on the card itself to cool the monstrous 24-phase VRM. It also ships with a built-in OLED display which allows you to monitor voltages temperatures clocks and more.

EVGA's flagship features dual 16-pin power connectors making it one of the first cards on the market with such a configuration. As there are currently no PSUs with two 16-pin cables the company developed the PowerLink 52u adapter allowing you to use five 8-pin connectors instead. Using that would give the Kingpin a total power budget of 825W (5 x 150W plus another 75W from the PCIe slot).

EVGA is bundling the graphics card with its SuperNOVA 1600 P2 power supply. However if you're looking to run two of these cards you might want to upgrade to the SuperNOVA 2000 G+ which luckily comes with exactly ten 8-pin power connectors.

The EVGA RTX 3090 Ti Kingpin is available on the company's website for $2499.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ldmdhcy1kb2xsYXIyNTAwLXJ0eC0zMDkwLXRpLWNvbWVzLXdpdGgtZnJlZS0xNjAwdy1wb3dlci1zdXBwbHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA's $2500 RTX 3090 Ti Comes With Free 1600W Power Supply,"After months of rumors EVGA has finally released its top-tier overclocking-focused variant of the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti under the Kingpin Hybrid Gaming branding. This card caters to extreme GPU overclockers but competes with the best graphics cards on the market. The Kingpin GeForce RTX 3090 Ti sells for an eye-watering $2499.99 but to sweeten the deal EVGA has bundled a free 1600W SuperNova P2 power supply to the 3090 Ti which is an exceptional deal considering it costs $399.99 all by itself.

Coincidentally EVGA is also advertising the same deal with the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 Ultra Gaming for a limited time with even more stuff to celebrate EVGA's 23rd anniversary. With the FTW3 deal you get a free EVGA SuperNova 1600 P+ PSU a 23rd-anniversary shirt and three months of Xbox Game Pass for PC. It is even better considering this deal with the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is on an attractive discount of $1899.

The RTX 3090 Ti Kingpin is the most advanced model from EVGA's lineup. The card features a 360mm AIO liquid cooler for the GPU and a secondary heatsink and fan for cooling PCB components on the card such as the power delivery system. Aesthetically the card is decked out in a matte black finish with a large silver accent with all three fans on the AIO featuring RGB lighting. For the select few customers who won't be putting an LN2 pot or custom water block on this card you will be greeted by EVGA's K|NGP|N logos everywhere to make it stand out from the rest of EVGA's hybrids. An OLED display is also mounted on the side of the card to show off unique animations or pictures.

The most significant selling point of the Kingpin is its incredibly overbuilt power delivery system and very high-quality componentry. In addition the Kingpin is one of the only GeForce RTX 3090 Ti models to feature dual 16-pin power connectors giving the card a whopping 1200W power for overclocking.

It is highly doubtful that the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti core will ever take advantage of 1200W of power or anything close to that. However the twin 16-pin connectors ensure the card will never be power throttled under any scenarios including liquid nitrogen overclocking.

To nobody's surprise the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Kingpin also comes with the highest factory overclock of any EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti with a 1950 MHz boost clock by default. However with its monstrous cooling solution you should be able to overclock the card well past that limit for regular gaming use."

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has amplified supply chain challenges and commodity squeezes. Beyond the broader economic impact it will create particular challenges in the months and years ahead for banks active in and with exposure to Russia and Ukraine as they grapple with operational challenges and the beefed-up sanctions regime.

But even before the war began in February there were already rumblings of global inflationary pressures and incoming economic turbulence. And with central banks including the US Federal Reserve European Central Bank and the Bank of England now engaged in a clear programme of interest rate increases while beginning to wind down stimulus it is evident we are entering a new economic phase.

For banks this is not necessarily bad news; indeed profitability in the era of low interest rates has been a major challenge. The data for 2021 (the full-financial year data the 2022 Top 1000 World Banks ranking is based on) points to a significant recovery in profitability compared to last year when banks collectively booked hundreds of billions of dollars in impairment charges expecting significant loan losses due to Covid-19 disruption.

Top 1000 aggregates

2022 ($bn) 2021 ($bn) Change from previous year (% bps) Aggregate Tier 1 10383 9913 4.74 Aggregate Total Assets 154211 148583 3.79 Aggregate Pre-Tax Profits 1439 936 53.73 Profits/Tier 1 (%) 11.09 7.57 352.07 Return on Assets (%) 0.75 0.51 23.67

Bounceback

Aggregate return on assets in the Top 1000 now stands at 0.75% compared to 0.51% last year broadly in line with where it was in 2020’s Top 1000 results (based on full-year data from 2019). Profits as a percentage of Tier 1 capital has also jumped from 7.57% last year to 11.09% this year higher than the figure for 2020. In dollar-and-cents terms aggregate pre-tax profits reached $1.44tn — the highest figure ever recorded in the Top 1000. This shows a 53.7% year-on-year increase and a 24.1% increase on 2020.

However as our analysis shows it is unclear to what extent profitability has improved in a meaningful sense. The impact of Covid-19 economic disruption on banks’ loan books has been less severe than expected in large part due to major central bank and fiscal stimulus packages. As a result banks have benefitted from lower-than-expected impairment charges which has boosted their profits. But it remains to be seen what shape banks are truly in following the pandemic and what kind of springboard that will offer in responding to current market conditions as stimulus packages are unwound.

Tier 1 capital grows

Looking beyond profits and profitability the overall resilience of the global financial system continues to look secure with aggregate Tier 1 capital continuing its upwards march. The minimum Tier 1 capital of a bank within the Top 1000 now stands at $556m up from $547m last year. Aggregate Tier 1 capital topped $10tn for the first time hitting $10.38tn — a 4.7% increase compared to last year. Aggregate Tier 1 assets also hit their highest-ever level growing 3.8% year-on-year to hit $154.21tn. However the growth rate of both Tier 1 capital and assets has slowed significantly compared to last year. Between 2020 and 2021 aggregate Tier 1 capital rose by 12.7% and assets by 16.0%.

There are some significant regional disparities. While Tier 1 capital grew by 9.1% for Asia-Pacific to hit $5.19tn (the first time it has topped $5tn for any one region) in western Europe it decreased by 3.6% to $2.37tn. In North America Tier 1 capital increased by 6.2% to hit $1.95tn. In Africa the Middle East and South America Tier 1 capital grew by 9.3% 11.1% and 7.6% respectively.

Increases for Asia-Pacific continue to be driven by China which accounts for $3.38tn of the region’s Tier 1 capital with aggregate Tier 1 capital for the country’s banks growing by 14.4% year-on-year. This is in stark contrast to Japan which saw its Tier 1 capital decrease by 10.3% to $642.6bn — its lowest value since 2017. Japan’s figures however have been skewed by the yen’s slumping exchange rate against the US dollar. All data in the Top 1000 is converted into US dollar values (if not already provided in that currency) to enable aggregation and international comparison.

In western Europe just seven of the 22 countries saw their aggregate Tier 1 capital increase year-on-year and this only includes two major banking economies — Switzerland and the UK which had increases of 3.4% and just 0.9% respectively. France which has the highest aggregate Tier 1 capital of any western European country in the Top 1000 saw an annual decrease of 4.6%; Spain saw a decrease of 0.9% and Germany a decrease of 4.1%. Turkey and Greece both saw particularly substantial decreases in percentage terms of 30.0% and 26.2% respectively. In Turkey’s case it was negatively impacted by the currency devaluation.

Chinese dominance continues

Chinese banks have continued to consolidate their increasingly dominant position within the Top 1000. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has now made it a full decade at the top of the Top 1000 rankings. Its Tier 1 capital has continued to swell growing by $68.9bn since last year to hit a massive $508.85bn — a 15.7% increase and the first time an individual bank in the Top 1000 has held more than $500bn in Tier 1 capital on its balance sheet. It has more than twice the Tier 1 capital of JPMorgan the highest non-Chinese bank in the rankings in fifth position. It also holds a mammoth $5.52tn in assets on its balance sheet.

Four other Chinese banks join ICBC in the top 10 with China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China each maintaining their second third and fourth positions respectively in the ranking. Bank of Communications has also moved from 11th to 10th position. This marks the first time that Chinese banks have made up half of the top 10.

China also now makes up half of the top 20 — increasing its share from nine of the 20 in 2021 — with China Citic Bank entering the top 20 for the first time. Its 18.0% increase in Tier 1 capital saw it leapfrog from 24th to 19th position.

At an aggregate level Chinese banks are also increasingly dominant — accounting for a third of Tier 1 capital across the whole Top 1000. This is a slight increase from last year when they accounted for 30%. Within Asia-Pacific Chinese banks account for 65% of aggregate Tier 1 capital up from 62% last year. Japan the next nearest this year accounts for just 12% — down from 15% last year.

China’s aggregate pre-tax profits increased by 15% year-on-year to reach $400bn. Its relative share of global net income has fallen from 37% last year to 27%; although similar to last year it continues to account for two-thirds of Asia-Pacific pre-tax profits.

Compared to last year Asia-Pacific overall also accounts for a smaller total of global profits. In 2021 its share of total global net income was 55.1% compared to 43.0% this year. North America and western Europe have picked up that slack. North American banks represented 28.5% of net income this year compared to 23.9% last year and for western Europe its share has increased from 10.3% to 17.3%.

Although China has by far the most dominant position by size of banks the number of Chinese banks in this year’s Top 1000 has decreased by four to 140. But China remains second only to the US in total banks in the Top 1000 which has 186 — an increase of eight from last year.

European changes

It is a year of significant change for Europe for this year’s rankings. In western Europe merger and acquisition (M&A) activity was the main driver behind a reduction of seven banks in this year’s Top 1000.

The central and eastern Europe (CEE) region has 13 fewer banks than last year. We have been unable to gather data from the two Ukrainian banks — PrivatBank and State Savings Bank of Ukraine — which were part of the ranking last year. There are also fewer Russian banks in our ranking this year just six banks compared to 21 in 2021 as we have not been able access the necessary data.

US holds steady

There has been little change for the US’s biggest three universal banks — JPMorgan Chase Bank of America (BofA) and Citi — with them retaining their fifth sixth and seventh positions in the Top 1000 ranking respectively. Their Tier 1 capital levels have generally remained relatively stable although JPMorgan’s has increased by 4.8% compared to last year to hit $246.16bn while BofA’s Tier 1 capital decreased by 1.8%.

The most significant US mover and shaker in the top 20 is Goldman Sachs which saw its Tier 1 Capital increase by 15.1% to hit $106.77bn — the first time it has surpassed $100bn.

In recent years Goldman has been expanding outside of its traditional investment banking focus. Its Marcus digital banking platform for retail customers has now grown to a customer base of more than 10 million with more than $110bn in deposits since its 2016 launch in the US and 2018 launch in the UK. The bank plans to push this expansion much further with the launch of a digital chequing account by the end of this year. It is also pushing ahead with further expansion of its transaction banking services which it launched in the US in 2020 and in the UK in 2021. It already has more than $50bn in deposits in this division and is targeting $100bn by 2024.

Goldman Sachs also succeeded in increasing its pre-tax profits by 116.2% building on a relatively strong performance last year where it was one of the few large US banks to achieve growth in pre-tax profits compared to 2020 (16.1%).

Overall it was a good year for pre-tax profits across the US banks with aggregate pre-tax profits increasing by 97.7% compared to last year. Just nine of the 186 US banks in the Top 1000 had smaller profits compared to last year.

Wells Fargo the US’s fourth-biggest bank in particular saw its pre-tax profits jump from just $581m last year to $28.82bn this year — a 4860% increase. It was able to benefit from a $4.1bn reduction in its provision for credit losses compared to last year when it recorded a $13.4bn provision for credit losses.

The bank also benefited from gains in areas such as in its affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and sales of its student lending asset management and corporate trust businesses. It remains subject to the $1.95tn asset cap imposed on it by the federal reserve in 2018 (with some limited exemptions for Covid-19-related lending). Although CEO Charlie Scharf has commented that the bank is “making significant progress” in addressing regulatory concerns he says “there is still work to do” which will take time.

JPMorgan Citi and BofA recorded pre-tax profit increases of 68.4% 78.9% and 96.2% respectively.

Top 20 shake-up

HSBC is once again the only European bank in the top 10; it has reversed its one position gain of last year returning to ninth position with its Tier 1 capital decreasing by 2.4%. It was able to boost its pre-tax profits by 115.4%; this was largely driven by a reversal in impairment charges. The bank is likely to see further adjustments in its assets and capital as it continues to progress its plans to withdraw from the US mass-market retail banking.

In February this year HSBC completed sales of 80 branches to Citizens Bank and 10 branches to Cathay Bank along with associated deposits and loans; these sales will be reflected in its 2022 annual report. In March it also announced it had entered into a deal to sell its Greek retail operations covering 15 branches to local bank Pancreta although this deal is not expected to be completed until the first half of 2023.

However the changes are part of its wider strategy to pivot towards Asia and the Middle East and it is likely to make new investments in that region. For instance HSBC Insurance subsidiaries in Asia-Pacific are currently pursuing plans to take full ownership of HSBC Life China (from the current 50%) and to increase ownership in Indian life insurer Canara HSBC Oriental Bank of Commerce Life Insurance Company from 26% to 49%.

Turning to the other banks in the top 20 France’s two largest banks Crédit Agricole and BNP Paribas have also slipped down the rankings from 12th and 13th last year to 14th and 15th positions this year with their Tier 1 capital falling by 3.6% and 6.6% respectively and assets by 3.6% and 2.6%. It is important to note the euro has fallen in value against the US dollar so if considered in local currency there is not the same fall. Each increased their pre-tax profits by 55.5% and 27.8%.

Japan now has just one bank remaining in the top 20 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group which shifted from 10th to 12th position its Tier 1 capital dropping by 12.4%. However its pre-tax profits grew by 29.3%. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group with its Tier 1 capital falling 9.7% has dropped from 16th to 21st position. The Tier 1 values have been negatively impacted by the falling value of the yen.

Profits recovery

This was a year when several banks had an impressive turnaround in fortunes with their pre-tax profits. Santander which last year recorded its first loss in its 160-year history of $2.56bn has recorded pre-tax profits of $16.5bn this year.

In 2020 the bank made a non-cash adjustment to the valuation of goodwill and deferred tax assets on its balance sheet which had a significant negative impact. Much of this adjustment applied across its subsidiaries Santander UK Santander Bank Polska and Santander Consumer Nordics and US businesses Santander Bank National Association and Santander Consumer USA. It attributes its improved performance to growth in loans and deposits and an improvement in credit quality.

NatWest which last year made a pre-tax loss of $468m recorded pre-tax profits of $5.82bn. This was in part down to an impairment release of $1.7bn but the UK lender also attributes the results to growing its lending cost reductions and digital transformation.

UniCredit has also moved from a $3bn loss to pre-tax profits of $1.41bn. The bank which gained its new CEO Andrea Orcel in April 2021 is currently engaging in a major strategic plan UniCredit Unlocked to deliver growth and long-term profitability. However the bank faces some risk given its exposure to Russian markets.

Germany’s Commerzbank which last year made the second-largest loss in the Top 1000 at $3.2bn has also moved back into the black albeit with modest pre-tax profits of $119m. Last year was the first year of its major restructuring programme which included planned staffing cuts of 10000 people as well as the closure of 340 of its 790 branches. It has benefitted from a significant year-on-year reduction in impairment charges.

This year the biggest loss in the Top 1000 was Greece’s Alpha Bank which made a pre-tax loss of $3.37bn closely followed by Piraeus Bank also of Greece which made a loss of $3.07bn. Both banks have been undergoing restructuring within their balance sheets to improve asset quality.

Impairment charge falls

Global pre-tax profits at an aggregate level reached $1.44tn a 53.7% increase compared to last year. This is in stark contrast to previous year when pre-tax profits fell by 19.2% year on year. At a regional level South America saw the biggest annual increase in profits at 128.8% followed by western Europe at 102.8% and North America at 90.2%. Spain was the country with the biggest annual increase in pre-tax profits at 621% followed by Poland at 464%.

In many cases this reversal in fortunes for pre-tax profits reflects the opposite trend for provisions and impairment charges. Impairment charges are costs that recognise the diminishing value of assets (for instance loans where there is a reasonable expectation of it not being paid back) and are included on bank-income statements — as such increased impairment charges have a direct impact on profits. Last year aggregate global impairment charges ballooned from $472bn to $754bn. This year they have fallen back down to $411bn.

North America saw the biggest regional fall in impairment charges with an annual decrease of 124.2% followed by western Europe at 63.9% and CEE with a decrease of 56.1%. At an individual country level some of the biggest reductions were seen in the US with a 129.0% fall in impairment charges the UK with a 114.6% drop and Australia with a 102.5% fall.

Interestingly China’s impairment charges only fell by 1.5% year-on-year but unlike many other countries its banks did not see significant increases in the year prior. Last year impairment charges at Chinese banks had increased by 22% compared that to its next nearest peer by size of banks the US which last year had a 157% increase.

A similar trend is visible when comparing China’s pre-tax profits to the US’s. China’s banks had by far the largest aggregate pre-tax profits of any country at more than $400bn this year. Yet this was just a 15% year-on-year increase. This compares to the US which had pre-tax profits of $342.73bn this year an increase of 97.7% compared to last year.

At first glance it may appear the US banks are more profitable based on these figures; however the significant increase in US pre-tax profits is largely attributable to the annual fall in impairment charges following a one-off major increase whereas China’s pre-tax profit growth has been more stable in recent years.

Post-crisis performance

Indeed China’s bank did not suffer a drop in pre-tax profits between 2008 and 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Looking across the period since then as an overall trend its aggregate pre-tax profits have gradually climbed.

For western European banks even 13 years later their pre-tax profits have never recovered to 2008 levels. In 2008 western European pre-tax profits stood at $355bn and they fell the following year by $390bn to a loss of $35bn. Since then they have been up and down and this year’s figure of $258.75bn is the highest level they have reached since 2008.

North American banks experienced an even bigger loss in 2009 with pre-tax profits falling by $216bn from $140bn in 2008 to a loss of $76bn. Unlike western Europe however aggregate pre-tax profits at North American banks had been consistently increasing until last year. They recovered to 2008 levels in 2011 overtook western European profits in 2012 and this year stand at $408.27bn. For Asia-Pacific it is clear the extent to which China has come to dominate the region’s banking industry in the post-crisis period. In 2008 China’s aggregate pre-tax profits were $77bn compared to $121bn for Asia-Pacific excluding China. As of this year China’s pre-tax profits stand at $400bn compared to the rest of the region at $206bn.

Lending activity

In order to benefit from rising interest rates banks will need to boost their lending particularly to customers they can be confident will not default during potentially challenging economic circumstances. This year’s Top 1000 figures (although not reflective of current market activity) suggest that banks in most regions have remained relatively cautious. For instance although gross total loans in Africa increased by 10.2% year-on-year their gross total deposits increased by 11.0%. Similarly gross total loans in the Middle East increased by 10.2% but total deposits also grew by 10.6%.

In North America deposit growth has far outstripped loan growth with gross total loans increasing by 7.4% and total deposits increasing by 11.8% year on year. In western Europe this trend is even more pronounced with gross total loans decreasing year-on-year by 3.0% and gross total deposits increasing by 0.4%. However the overall health of western European banking loan books appears to have improved. Aggregate allowances fell by 19.8% year-on-year and allowances as a percentage of the total loan book fell by 30.25 basis points (bps). In North America the decrease was even greater with aggregate allowances falling by 27% and allowances as a percentage of the total loan book falling by 62bps.

Big M&A deals

Although only 12 M&A transactions were completed within the Top 1000 during the 2021 financial year there were some major deals. The largest by far was the merger between Samba Financial Group and National Commercial Bank to create Saudi National Bank. The combined bank is now the largest banking entity in the Middle East with Tier 1 capital of $32.62bn. It is in 67th position in the rankings leapfrogging Qatar National Bank (77th this year) which was previously the region’s largest bank.

The next largest deal was Spain’s CaixaBank’s acquisition of Bankia which was completed in March 2021 having first been announced in September 2020. CaixaBank says the combined bank now has almost 20 million customers in Spain making it the largest retail bank in the domestic market by share of customers (Santander is Spain’s largest bank by Tier 1 capital and assets). The combined entity is Spain’s third-largest bank by Tier 1 capital and second-largest by assets at $772.77bn. Western Europe was the most active region for M&A accounting for five of the 12 deals taking place in 2021.

For comparability and consistency we convert all the data used in the Top 1000 into US dollar values. However year-on-year depreciation in the value of some currencies can have the effect of suppressing the position of some banks within the ranking. For transparency the table ‘The Foreign Exchange Effect’ lists the 50 banks within the Top 1000 that would move up rankings the most if the effects of the depreciation were recalibrated. Typically smaller banks are affected the most. This year the largest bank affected is TC Ziraat Bankasi which could have been in 111th position in the rankings rather than 177th without the effects of currency depreciation.

In the first year of the change participation in the recycling program also called the ""set-out"" rate has increased from 53 percent of households to 70 percent according to data provided by the city. (Since all residents that receive trash service from the city are mandated to sign up for recycling too the participation rate is the measure of whether households are making use of the recycling program.)

The amount of materials recovered through recycling increased eight-fold after the switch to carts. Under the old bagged-recyclables system the city's trash hauler Republic Services had reported recovering about 5 pounds of recyclable materials per household per month. Under the cart system Republic is now recovering 39 pounds of recyclable materials per household per month.

Households in Holland received recycling carts in May 2021 after the city council voted to make the switch.

The changes came following the results of a 2019 audit of the bagged recycling program that found high rates of bag failure and contamination among recyclables. In that system recyclables were bagged and placed in the same container as trash bags. The distinctive yellow bags were then sorted from trash bags at Republic's recycling center.

The study of that program found 75 percent of bags were either partially or fully damaged by the time they arrived at Republic's sorting facility after being compacted in a truck along with garbage bags. Recyclable items were mixed in with trash or contaminated.

An audit of the city's waste showed that while 51 percent of the city's waste is recyclable only 12.6 percent of the city's waste was being captured through the ""yellow bag"" recycling system below the overall recycling rate for the state of Michigan which was 19.3 percent in 2018.

Dan Broersma sustainability manager for the city of Holland said the carts are ""a raving success from a metrics perspective.""

""I think the big success is the percentage of people participating"" Broersma said.

The recycling carts are much larger — capable of holding 96 gallons compared to the 32-gallon bags — and easier to use. For example residents no longer have to remember to order more recycling bags when they run out.

The city put out a blast of recycling education with the changeover to the carts including setting up a website recycleholland.com to answer frequently asked questions and delivering educational materials along with the carts.

Republic Services has reported cleaner materials coming through their system from the carts too which results in more successful recovery of materials.

""The City of Holland’s carted recycle program is off to a great start"" said Jack Brown manager of municipal services for Republic Services. ""We have seen high participation and low contamination which is what we hoped to accomplish when the program was rolled out in May 2021. We appreciate the residents commitment to providing clean recycling products that comply with the approved list of recyclable materials.""

Delran is unhappy with the regularity of missed residential trash collection which is not a new problem or one limited to the township. The waste management industry generally is tied in knots with worker shortages inflation and supply chain problems.

Mayor Gary Catrambone last week petitioned Burlington County government to consider organizing a shared services collection system. The mayor said he also spoke with county Board of Commissioners Director Daniel O’Connell on the topic and got a promise the idea would get reviewed.

“And I don’t want to put them under pressure to solve our problem” Catrambone said. “What I’ve done is just ask them ’Could you consider it?’ Because they do the recycling program in cooperation with the OTC (Occupational Training Center). And they do a hell of a good job.”

A county spokesman acknowledged receiving the letter.

The township’s collection issues are with Republic Services. The mayor said residents lodge hundreds of complaint calls per week and the company has been fined regularly.

On Thursday Catrambone said that based on recent talks with officials of surrounding communities sentiment is cresting in Burlington County for an alternative trash collection system more answerable to member communities.

Republic Service was given a three-year contract worth nearly $2.57 million in September 2021. It was the only company to enter a bid last year with Delran which also used the company the prior three years — although at a much lower cost.

The mayor noted neighboring Willingboro also has Republic Services under contract. And it too has been and publicly vocal with complaints about collection breakdowns he said.

“And this has just grown organically” Catrambone said. “You know it’s like ‘We have to do something. We can’t just put up with this.’ Especially now in the summer because trash doesn’t stay well if it’s sitting out for days and days.”

Catrambone said his own trash went to the sidewalk on Thursday for Friday pickup. But if the truck does not come as scheduled he wonders if the kart still will be sitting out until after the 4th of July.

“So (for) myself and my neighbors it’s certainly not the end of the world but it’s a holiday” Catrambone said. “So we’re going to have all those trash cans out and neighbors having parties and that sort of thing. I don’t want to trivialize it.”

Sights and smells aside the mayor said the issue really is concern about public health impacts.

“Short term we could deal with it” he said. “But if this is the way it’s going to go all summer long then we have to start planning for a solution.”

In September 2021 after awarding Republic Services a new contract the township messaged residents that it was looking at an alternative collection approach that would be cheaper and more controllable. An in-house system through the Public Works department was put forth as a possibility.

If a county approach is ruled out Catrambone said he would be open to a shared service agreement with other municipalities.

“That’s what we’ve been doing today reaching out to the other towns and saying ‘If this were a possibility would you be interested in doing this when your contract runs out?’” he said. “And overwhelmingly people are saying ‘Yeah. We would.’”

Catrambone declined to say what communities were interested saying he wanted to leave that disclosure to them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vY2l0cnVzaGVpZ2h0c3NlbnRpbmVsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL3doYXQtZ29lcy1pbi10aGUtZ3JlZW4tY2FydC1jaXR5LXNheXMtZG9nLXBvb3AtZG9lc250LWNvdW50LWFzLW9yZ2FuaWMtd2FzdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"What goes in the green cart? City says dog poop doesn't count as ""organic waste"" – Citrus Heights Sentinel","Sentinel staff report–

Residents in Citrus Heights wondering what counts as “organic waste” under new requirements will find some clarification in the city’s annual waste collection calendar for the month of July.

The 2022 calendar lists waste collection dates and includes an infographic that was also shared on the city’s social media pages on July 1.

Food-soiled paper items like paper plates napkins pizza boxes and coffee filters should all go in the green waste cart along with meat nut shells fruits and vegetables and bones. Residents should also continue placing grass leaves branches and untreated wood in the green cart as well.

Items not suited for the green bin include dog and cat poop treated wood dirt or sod lawn rocks and concrete beverage containers and tree stumps the calendar says.

Residents will be receiving a kitchen pail sometime this month from Republic Services the city’s waste collection contractor. Food waste collected in the pail is to be taken to the green waste cart now called the “green organics cart.”

The new state-mandated organics waste recycling program was initiated with the passage of Senate Bill 1383 by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 and aims to curb methane emissions by reducing the amount of organic waste in landfills. The law requires jurisdictions to provide weekly organic waste collection services or face hefty penalties.

Under the new changes required by the bill green waste carts will be collected weekly instead of bi-weekly and residents are required to place food scraps and food-soiled paper in the green bin. Fees are also increasing to cover the extra collection cost.

Ron Kovic literally “Born on the Fourth of July” author of his classic anti-war memoir and subject of the Oliver Stone film based on the book marks the day of patriotic zealotry with dread. Kovic was inspired to enlist as a US marine and fight in Vietnam answering President John F. Kennedy’s call to serve country before self. The result failed both the country and the young marine who was severely wounded in action in a war that he believes betrayed the nation’s stated ideals and left him a paraplegic bound for a half century to his wheelchair but freeing his voice to speak as clearly as anyone on the dark folly of war.

It’s a folly that has suddenly reasserted itself in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and NATO expansion with a dangerous fury matching the most frightening events of the Cold War and carrying an even greater prospect of a nuclear war that would end life on this planet. Most alarming is that the worldwide peace movement that Kovic came to embody and which he vigorously attempts to rally is almost non-existent.

That collapse of the peace movement is an alarming development to Kovic and Scheer who covered the Vietnam War as a correspondent and has known Kovic since the two of them met 52 years ago in the Los Angeles Veterans Cemetery following an anti-war demonstration. In the following interview they are joined by writer TerriAnn Ferren who has been Kovic’s closest friend and most reliable supporter during the last 16 years of his strenuous and often medically fraught effort to bring a message of peace to a world that seems ever more in denial about the terminal destructiveness of war.

Robert Scheer:

Hi this is Robert Scheer with another edition of Scheer Intelligence. And the intelligence this time comes from somebody I know that is an incredibly important sentient human being Ron Kovic. I was really excited about doing this. It’s going to be more of a conversation than an interview. I’ve done a number of interviews over the years with Ron. But the 4th of July is very special as people know from the movie where Tom Cruise played Ron Kovic. They know from his book Born on the 4th of July which is one of the really great I wouldn’t say just anti-war war books dealing with the horror of war. And Ron Kovic was paralyzed in Vietnam from the chest down. And I’ve known him after he got out of the VA hospital. But I’ve known him for about a half century. No exaggeration I think it’s precisely a half century. And his birthday is always on the 4th of July. And you’re now 76.

And now I know what you want to do is seize this interview and I really can’t stop you. What am I going to do? Do what the police did in San Diego and toss you out of your wheelchair? So go have at it.

Ron Kovic:

Yeah Bob it’s great to be with you tonight. Thank you so much. I turned 76. And I think it was just a few months ago in the spring you turned 86 years old. You’ve had an extraordinary life. You were talking about how we first met it. I’m going to help you a little bit on this see if you can remember. It was Memorial Day 1971. Do you remember what we did that day?

Robert Scheer:

Well I remember it was the veterans cemetery in Westwood Los Angeles not far from UCLA.

Ron Kovic:

Right.

Robert Scheer:

And there had been a demonstration and then everybody went home after that. And we started talking and I think we were there for I don’t know what three four hours.

Ron Kovic:

A couple of hours until it got dark in the cemetery.

Robert Scheer:

Yeah well we stayed. And I was amazed that they didn’t throw us out. And it was a very meaningful conversation because I knew about Vietnam from having gone there as a journalist and writing about it. And warning quite a few years before you went as a Marine and I warned about what war does. I warn about it right now. And everybody is sort of giddy fighting for freedom in Ukraine and everything. And I just think of all the Ukrainians and Russian soldiers and so forth that will be killed maimed and suffer as you have an injury that’s over half a century now. In the process let me just say I think we’ve become very very close friends and I’ve learned a great deal from you. And so let’s not get away from the subject. You wrote this really important book Born on the 4th of July. You wrote another one after that about the Veterans’ Movement. I know you are working on a book right now.

Ron Kovic:

Yeah.

Robert Scheer:

And there was a famous movie where Tom Cruise I think brilliantly portrayed you and Oliver Stone of course was the director. But go ahead. You want to ask me questions.

Ron Kovic:

Yeah. Yeah I don’t think we were thrown out of the cemetery that day were we? 50 years ago?

Robert Scheer:

No no they just let us sit there. Maybe they didn’t even know we were there.

Ron Kovic:

We stayed there until dark. And when I was in your class I remember describing that day that I met you. I was leading Vietnam Veterans Against the War down Wilshire Boulevard and we ended up in the graveyard. And to just make it short we were there for several hours and everybody left. And there were gravestones and American flags a sea of red white and blue on that Memorial Day. 50 years ago I was 26 years old and you were 36 years old. We were young then and we’re still young today. But I remember-

Robert Scheer:

And the senseless wars continue to this day. That’s what gets me. It’s not a war game. You’ve been in that wheelchair and it’s been very difficult. And you just recently had yet another infection. You’ve got all these tubes going into you. And you’ve done an incredible job as a public intellectual as a writer raising these issues. But there have been a number of times when I’ve invited you to my class and you were back in the VA hospital the spinal cord injury section. I remember one President’s Day I went down there to visit you and most of your fellow patients kind of looked spaced out and miserable. There were no visitors. They were the forgotten wounded.

Ron Kovic:

That’s right.

Robert Scheer:

And I even took a picture of you in your wheelchair in front of that big poster welcoming everybody. But nobody had come. They were the forgotten.

Ron Kovic:

It was a difficult day for us. Those were the forgotten wounded. You said it correctly. And I was so grateful that you came down that day. Not only did you come down but you interviewed me again that day. I think back to in the early years when I was speaking. And I’ve been speaking out I’ve been raising my voice on behalf of peace and nonviolence and the senselessness of war and what it does to human beings whether they be Ukrainians whether they be Russians. A Ukrainian young man right now is beginning to deal with having to be paralyzed for the rest of his life just as a young Russian is beginning to deal with having to be paralyzed for the rest of life. We don’t think of these things. There is a Ukrainian mother weeping tonight still weeping for a son who has been recently lost in this war that we read about every day and see on television and the papers. No one talks about the fact there is a Russian mother too weeping as well for her son.

War is a terrible way to solve problems. There’s got to be an alternative to war. And it’s been a message that I’ve repeated again and again that we must find an alternative to this behavior to this way of dealing with our problems around the world and here at home as well. Here at home as well there’s got to be dialogue. There’s got to be a diplomatic approach. And you encouraged me. You taught me. You taught me about the need to respect every human being even those who we may even vehemently disagree with. That’s the influence you’ve had on my life. That you’ve influenced me to realize that it’s not so black and white that we’re all human beings in this world all human beings.

And that there are always two sides not just one side. And we have to understand that we’ve got to begin to move away from this type of behavior. I just want to say that… I’m just thinking about what this time means to me. What you said about the hospitals and yes I’m so grateful. I’ve been speaking in your class I can’t count how many years now. I can’t count how many in all these 50 years. I can remember phone calls when I lived up in San Francisco or in Marin County in Sausalito getting phone calls from you on a payphone wanting to interview me for the Los Angeles Times. And when people didn’t want to hear what I had to say when people didn’t want to listen to me you were the one who would call me.

You were the one who would share my voice with people who I might never have been able to reach. But because of you and because of our friendship and your interest in my struggle to speak out on behalf of peace I was able to reach many more people than I would’ve been able to reach. I can remember you would call me in New York when I lived there on Long Island. You called me up in the Bay Area when I lived there. And I would get calls from time to time throughout believe me and even up until the other night you wanted to interview me for this and I so much wanted to interview you.

Robert Scheer:

Well I think there is a division of labor here because yes journalists have been killed and wounded. Citizens are wounded. But the key thing is war gets written about and it’s important on the 4th of July to question notions of patriotism and national glory and obligation. And one thing that’s happened now in the Ukraine we’re hearing discussion of “Oh the Russians are using terrible weapons. Civilians are getting killed. They’re using fragmentation bombs anti-personnel weapons.” Well first of all those weapons… And by the way the US and Russia and the old Soviet Union never signed the international agreements against using them. But yet yes they’re terrible weapons and most weapons are terrible whether they’re bombs dropping. Whether they’re anti personnel devices or whatever they are. And the fiction now is somehow finally we have found our good war. We always thought of World War II as our good war. But people forget Vietnam was supposed to be the good war. We were supposed to be saving the Vietnamese from communist tyranny.

Everybody’s forgotten that now Russia is no longer a communist country. Putin in fact is an anti-communist. He defeated the communists. Vietnam is still a communist country. And now the US is pivoting to a whole new conflict with China communist China. And who do we favor? We favor Vietnam. And we think that maybe we can move some of this production of phones and everything to Vietnam more than we have. And everybody forgets. You don’t know when we went to Vietnam we thought we were on this side of the angels or claimed to be. And yet remember Martin Luther King said about that war that his government had become the major purveyor of violence in the world today.

So how was he going to talk about nonviolence when he is in a ghetto community? And we forget that. We demonized the Vietnamese just like everybody is now saying the Russians have no reason they’re barbarians. Yet when we were doing carpet bombing when we smashed and burned all these villages and everything and then who changed that whole mood? It was Richard Nixon who had been a big red-baiter and everything. He says “Do you know what? We can do business with the Chinese communists.” Not even the current ones who mostly are into capitalism. No Richard Nixon went over to see Mao Zedong and they developed a peace which has held up until now when that good work seems to be threatened now.

Ron Kovic:

Well I refuse to have my government tell me that I have to hate another human being to tell me this person is my enemy. I’m very skeptical now about that. I want to know who this person is that I’m supposed to hate. Who is this person that I’m supposed to cheer when bombs start dropping and civilians start dying? Who am I supposed to hate and who is the enemy? And to me this type of behavior is the greatest enemy of all. I was thinking you ran I believe it was for Congress. Is that correct? In Oakland?

Robert Scheer:

Yeah.

Ron Kovic:

Let me say this you ran as an anti-war candidate against a Democrat who was for the war. Who was for the war at the time who eventually lost to Ron Dellums. Eventually lost to Ron Dellums. But you almost beat that Democrat as an anti-war candidate. So you were speaking against the war running for Congress. When was that?

Robert Scheer:

That was ’66. And I must say I went to Vietnam the first time in ’64 and then ’65. And I went to Cambodia. I was in Cambodia both before the big carnage and after. And I was in North and South Vietnam. But when I wrote about Vietnam my first pamphlet How the US Got Involved in Vietnam it was in ’65 ’66 and then I ran for Congress. When did you go into the Marines? When were you first in Vietnam?

Ron Kovic:

I joined the Marines out of high school in the fall of 1964. I went straight to Parris Island. I wanted to be a Marine. I had been born on the country’s birthday. I was born on the 4th of July. That’s my real birthday. I was proud to be an American and I wanted to serve my country. I had been inspired by John F. Kennedy “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” And I asked what I could do. Look I came from a working class background. I didn’t have a lot of options. I wasn’t particularly a great student either. And I didn’t particularly like school so I wasn’t going to one of the colleges that many of the other kids were headed toward.

And I felt a bit insecure. I also felt a lot of pressure from my parents. My father in particular “Get a job do something with your life.” So I thought I’d make everybody proud by becoming a Marine and I joined. And so that was the fall of ’64. And I was wounded January of ’68 after two tours of duty in Vietnam.

Robert Scheer:

Okay. But I was there in Vietnam in ’64 ’65. And I’ve told you this before if I had been more effective in communicating how absurd this war was… And I feel the same way now about what’s going on with Ukraine. It’s becoming an excuse now. Just today as we’re speaking they had the NATO meeting and they’re going to rush more planes and more guns everywhere. And we’re going to take on China and NATO is now… We don’t even talk about the UN. We talk about NATO a military alliance that was supposed to have to do with the Cold War. Now we’re going to just send more of these weapons. And the whole assumption is somehow… There isn’t even talk about peace movement. There wasn’t even one Democratic member of Congress who voted against the latest military appropriation. This $50 billion put more weapons there. There’s no one talking about making peace. Now that’s considered old fashioned and yet who’s dying? We’re going to fight that until the last Ukrainian maybe the last Russian.

And as I say there’s that kind of a giddiness the only way I can describe it. And what’s really scary now is the possibility of nuclear war. People can maybe hit a city in Russia and then they hit “Well that came from France or it came from Germany.” Or maybe they take out some target in France and Germany. Oh next thing you know what have you got? You’ve got nuclear weapons and a lot of countries have them. And I am really personally so depressed about the inability of an anti-war movement that I was involved with to drive home and you obviously were involved in. Where’s the peace movement now? Where’s the anti-war movement?

Ron Kovic:

Let me just say this at our government this administration they’re playing with fire right now. Playing with fire. It’s dangerous what’s happening. It’s dangerous and anything could set this off. Look back at history. Look at what has happened throughout history just over the last century or so what’s happened how wars have started. What was it? Sarajevo by a single gunshot. And how many people at the end ended up suffering because there’s millions of people who died. We’ve got to be much more circumspect much more cautious much more thoughtful and diplomatic. We need to find alternative solutions. We need diplomacy. We need to find ways to solve this problem without getting ourselves in an even greater war.

Robert Scheer:

If you talk about diplomacy now people say you’re unpatriotic. It’s unbelievable. Robert McNamara our former Secretary of Defense the last podcast I did or two weeks ago was with his son who wrote a great book about his father who could never ever really finally say what was so obvious even to Robert McNamara that that war never made any sense. The war that caused you to be paralyzed for more than a half century. And Robert McNamara ended up going to Vietnam and meeting with General Giap the so-called victor of the war and admitted that he used the figure three and a half million people had died but actually it’s more like five 6 million people died and a lot more injured and so forth and he said it never made any sense.

And it’s very interesting. It was John Kennedy who said “Oh we’ll get involved.” Oh just a little bit like we’re doing now. We’ll just send this aid and these troops and this thing and it ended up 58 almost 59000 Americans and the four or five million Vietnamese died in that. And I see that’s what’s happening now. And again it’s like it’s giddy “Okay. Yes the enemy is doing terrible things. Then we do terrible things in return.” And the idea that maybe you’ve got to negotiate maybe you’ve got to figure out what’s… If Nixon could negotiate with Mao Zedong okay? For God’s sake when you think of the barbarism that had taken place under Mao’s leadership. And Nixon who was not faultless by any means but they could do that how in the world could we now talk about “No just more military more arms more death” and no one’s talking about negotiating?

I want to make one point about Kennedy that you and I happened to talk about the other day. But the Ambassador Hotel where Bobby Kennedy was killed I happened to interview Bobby minutes before he went down to be shot.

Ron Kovic:

That night that very night right?

Robert Scheer:

Yeah that very night. And the interesting thing is that Bobby Kennedy had come to see the folly the horrible folly of a war that his brother actually had initiated and what a trap it was. And he was running and had a real good chance of becoming president as an anti-war candidate. And it wasn’t out of disloyalty to his brother who he had great respect for. But he saw what happens when you go to war and the horrible violence and destruction. And it’s not just one shopping area that’s killed but that leads to another shopping area and that leads to houses being blown up and schools. And we’re just seeing that. And we are actually at a more dangerous moment I think maybe than we were even in the Cold War. It’s kind of like… We don’t have a draft. People “Okay I’m rooting this or that.” They’re not going to go. And they even do it so well it’s not going to mess up “We’ll get inflation under control and we’ll get the price of gas down.” That shocked everybody there might be an economic cause.

But I just think… I hate to say this Ron. Maybe it’s a way of starting to wrap this up. But you’ve devoted your life your whole life. And I know sometimes it’s been really painful to get out of your small apartment get in that wheelchair go speak at some rally write about this and so forth. And it’s really depressing that we don’t have a peace movement now. I’m not saying you take one side or another you apologize to anybody. But we just don’t have people say “Wait a minute this is not a game. This is deadly serious.” And what civilian casualties? That’s the norm.

Ron Kovic:

I wonder what Martin Luther King would think if he were alive today what he would think about all of this. I know I know that he would be on the side of peace. I know that he would be on the side of a diplomatic solution. I know that he would be struggling with everything within him to avoid the dropping of bombs or the killing of human beings. Do we ever think about the human cost of war? The physical psychological effects that war has on human beings? Human beings not just one particular country. The Vietnamese as well as the Americans. There’s a young Vietnamese boy out there somewhere in a wheelchair. There’s a young Russian who’s in a wheelchair or a Ukrainian. We don’t think about the fact that war has a terrible effect on human beings especially those young men who go off to war so enthusiastic about serving their country only to return home to often in my case dilapidated VA hospitals. At the time it’s improved greatly thank God over the years. But when I came back from that war I lived amongst the wounded of that war. It affected me deeply.

When I was in that intensive care ward I saw what war was and I’ve lived with that for the last what will it be? How many? 54 years. What I wanted to say was you talk about my small apartment. It’s actually a little bit more spacious than that and I’ve got a pretty good view. But I just want to say that more than anything as I approach my 76th birthday 76 years I’m grateful to be alive. I’m thankful for every day. It’s a thrilling adventure to me. Regardless of the fact that three quarters of my body is paralyzed I’ve met a wonderful woman. I’ve been able to love again. I’ve been able to write to write to publish books. I’ve been able to speak and to be heard to be listened to because of you and others like you who’ve been willing to listen to what I’ve had to say.

Robert Scheer:

No Ron. No Ron. No Ron it’s because of you. You found the inner strength you had the incredible willpower to overcome. I’m not going to bullshit you. I see what you go through on a daily basis. I can’t believe it. I can’t believe it. I complain about a backache or something. Really. And I think we disrespect your wisdom and that of… You’re not the first one. You mentioned Martin Luther King for example. We’ve had great prophets you could say Jesus Christ is one of them who have warned us about what violence does and so forth. And not seeing the soul in others a very important idea. And we’ve got to remind people when you join the Marines and it’s all brilliantly laid out in your own work Born on the 4th of July and the movie that was made out of it your friends there in Long Island some thought “Wait Ronnie what are you going for? Get out of the draft.” And you weren’t even drafted you volunteered.

And I was a very strong critic of that war. I wrote a lot about it. But one could make an argument a moral argument of why intervention was required right? “Oh there were Catholic refugees from the north.” And “The communists were in the north and Ho Chi Minh. And there was this issue and that issue.” And it’s always complex and there’s always good and evil floating around. And you could say the same thing about every single conflict. And the point is you then say “Okay let’s step back and put sanity into it.”

Now I do want to say something. You mentioned this wonderful woman and I want to give her credit. Usually at the end of these podcasts I thank I’ll even do it now I thank Christopher Ho and Laura Kondourajian at KCRW. I thank Joshua Scheer our executive producer Natasha Hakimi Zapata who writes all this the JKW Foundation for giving support. But I’m not ending the show there because the woman you just alluded to made this interview possible. She’s our techie tonight. So could TerriAnn speak into the mic? And what I’d like to ask you is your view of what Ronnie goes through and where he finds the strengths. If you don’t want to do it’s okay. I didn’t warn you in advance and I don’t want to put you on the spot. But I’ve seen you I know how important you are to Ronnie’s survival and brilliance. So could you say something?

TerriAnn:

I would love to. Thank you very much even for asking me. It’s an honor. Ronnie is an incredible person. And from the first time I met him I knew something was special about him. Where he gets his strength I don’t know. Some days… He never has a bad day. I call him in the morning and I say “Good morning.” And he’ll say “Isn’t it a beautiful day? It is a fabulous day.” He says “It’s Wednesday it’s Thursday” whatever day it is. And at that point he can’t even see outside his window because his blind isn’t open yet because he’s still in bed. Ronnie’s optimism his faith the way he looks at life and the way he treats people it has been like a moving drama in front of my eyes. I’ve seen this man get more and more beautiful each day.

I can’t explain how special he is. I’m telling you Bobby he’s just the most amazing man I’ve ever met with the way he looks at life and the way he loves and the way he loves everyone every single person who comes up to him. I’ve never seen him turn anyone away. He is gracious humble and polite to everyone. I don’t know if that’s what you’re looking for but I feel blessed to have met Ronnie Kovic. He is an incredible human being and my image of what a true man is.

Robert Scheer:

Well let me just have you add one story to that because I’m going to post that video of when they honored Bruce Springsteen and I forget a couple other people at the Kennedy Center. Bruce Springsteen who had met Ronnie after having read his book I believe at a hotel swimming pool I think I mentioned it. But you went back to Washington. And it’s a human story. And I just want you to tell me about it. We’re talking about a person who now has to be lifted into his bed and has someone who comes in the morning and comes back at night and yet has managed to travel all over the world give speeches be out there and do it. And the way you just so beautifully described without self pity which he’s certainly entitled to without bumming everybody out. And yet you’ll know better than anyone the threat of his injuries how close he is to death on one occasion after another when he has to rush back to the hospital. But just tell that scene in the hotel room. I want to end on a positive note.

TerriAnn:

Okay.

TerriAnn:

Yeah I will. Okay. A lot of people don’t understand what it’s like to travel with Ronnie. And when we were traveling to Washington DC we were staying at this lovely hotel the Mandarin Oriental and we had this lovely suite. And we got there after… It’s a lot to travel in a wheelchair because you go from a manual wheelchair to a…

Ron Kovic:

Aisle chair.

TerriAnn:

Aisle chair yeah. And then you have to be transferred back from the aisle chair into the manual chair. And then by the time we get to the hotel we’re pretty exhausted. And we come in like I say it was a beautiful beautiful room. And after a long day we are getting ready to get into the bed. And Ronnie looks at the bed and he says “I don’t know how I’m going to get in there. It’s very high.” And it truly was. It was very very high. And he says “I’ll sleep on the couch.” I said “No you’re not.” I said “You can’t sleep on the couch.” And I said “We’ll figure it out.” I said “Get the wheelchair.” So I put the wheelchair close up to the side of the bed. And the way Ronnie would get into bed is he would use his upper arms. In other words if you were sitting in an arm chair you hold onto the sides of the wheelchair the arms lift yourself up and he would lift himself into his bed.

Well his mattress was low. He could do that. This was high. So we’re up against the side of this bed. There’s no way he can lower himself into it. So I said “Okay you get yourself high enough just so I could get in back of you.” And what I did is I went under his little tokus and … I flipped him onto the bed. And poor guy I think he might have been airborne there for a second. And I was a little too strong. I almost pushed him off to the other side of the bed. But he hung on. And so we were able to get him in the bed which worked quite well. And then getting out he just kind of aimed and tried to fall in the right spot. And I just tried to have the chair there in the right place. So we did this for a few nights. It was…

Ron Kovic:

Springsteen.

TerriAnn:

… an experience. Yeah. Yeah. It was an experience. He was there to honor Bruce. So that was an amazing story. Bruce Springsteen. And by the way tomorrow is our anniversary.

Ron Kovic:

16 years ago.

TerriAnn:

16 years.

Ron Kovic:

16 years ago tomorrow we met at Joyce Sharman’s house Bill Sharman the great basketball star. But we met a Joyce Sharman’s house 16 years ago. We’re still together. It’s amazing.

Robert Scheer:

I’ve been with you with the Sharmans and the late Sharman. And that’s a beautiful story in a way the support that different people give each other and how they related. We talk about do we remember and honor the veterans. And you have. Yes you’ve been thrown about at demonstrations by police and everything else. But nonetheless there’s been a circle of people. TerriAnn is number one of course who’ve really I wouldn’t say welcomed your illness but learned to get strength from it. Learned to get strength from your struggle. I certainly am among them. I’m still a crybaby and I still complain a lot. But then I think really. And a lot of people around me who know you they feel the same way “What are we talking about?” And even when I went through COVID I thought “Well wait a minute. This is nothing compared to what Ron lives with on a daily basis.”

And I do think TerriAnn maybe you should just say something about that circle of friends. Because they might not always agree on politics. They might not always vote for the same people. But I’ve seen a lot of love and devotion in that group of people around Ron. Yeah and we are almost all Laker fans probably because of Bill Sharman more than anything else. But maybe we could close on that because it’s a very positive story of support and welcome for what is always forgotten the wounded in war. And on the 4th to July okay there were a lot of wounded and that’s not stopped. Before the 4th of July there were a lot of indigenous people wounded. After the 4th of July whether you call them good or bad wars a lot of people around the world have been hurt killed. And so I’ll leave it to you TerriAnn. Do you want to give the last word? We can also let Ron pipe in and call it a night. I know he’s got to get some sleep.

TerriAnn:

Oh well that’s okay. Your comment about circle of people and the people that Ron touches it’s really true. Because with our friends I can say 100% of the time people have learned about what it is to have the type of injury that Ronnie has. They’re much more aware of it. I’m very aware of it because when Ronnie drives he drives his own car and of course we go around together his hand control car. Many many times even to this day it happened not that long ago a couple weeks ago people park in the hashtag where it’s van accessible. They’re not supposed to park there. They just park there. But a lot of people have come to know what it’s like to have this injury through Ronnie. Do you know what I mean? So he also educates people as we go along everyone we meet. And when I talk about Ronnie they learn too about his injury and about how he deals with it so elegantly and so graciously. He really does. He’s precious.

Robert Scheer:

Well I’ll tell my little story maybe to close out then I’ll let Ron have the last word. But when Ron came to one of my classes I guess it was just before the pandemic and I teach at University of Southern California and they had built this new auditorium and they had met the regulation by having an elevator that could get you up to the stage. But they neglected to build the kind of elevator that could take the modern wheelchair electronic and heavier up. And we warned them about that and we’d had trouble before. And when we got Ron up on the stage we couldn’t get the elevator to take him down. And we were all there if I remember over an hour or so with a kind of ramp going up and it was scary because if you went down that ramp or the wheelchair went over. And do you know what? They still haven’t fixed that elevator.

TerriAnn:

Oh no.

Robert Scheer:

Yeah for all the talk in our society about the handicapped and special parking and special this but the fact of the matter is whether it’s injury from war or injury just being human that you’re born with or accidents or what have you most people just don’t want to think about what life is like under that kind of circumstance. And in Ron’s case three quarters of your body paralyzed and yet and I think it’s important to draw a very positive message that is I can’t think of a more useful public citizen that we’ve had. Public intellectual let me use that word. And I’m thrilled that Ron is now working I know I’m not supposed to talk about it too much but I know that his publisher that they’re going to bring out yet another great piece of literature. So that’s a good positive point. You’ve got to keep going Ron. You’ve got to stay alive. And I’m 10 years older than you so even if I kick off I’ve got other people-

TerriAnn:

You better not.

Robert Scheer:

I’ve got other people out there. They’re going to…

Ron Kovic:

I need you. I need you Bob. I need you as much as you need me. Believe me.

Robert Scheer:

Yeah. Yeah but if it does happen I am getting up there. 76 just a kid to me. I’m 86. But seriously Ron you’ve got to promise me you don’t need my encouragement but really that book is really going to say it. And it comes out in about a year and people should be waiting for it already. But if anybody has not read Born on the 4th of July man this is time to do it. And get a copy give it to your grandchildren or what have you. It is the book to read about war. So should we wrap that up? You got a last word?

Ron Kovic:

Yes my last word to you is I love you Bob. I love you. Happy 4th of July. And you’ve inspired me for so many years and I’m so grateful to know you. I love you so much and I’m so proud of you. And you’ve been an inspiration not only to me but to literally millions of other people. What a wonderful gift you’ve been.

Robert Scheer:

Okay. I’ll take it because it’s coming from you. But all right. This is not going to be our last interview. I don’t want to get maudlin here.

Ron Kovic:

Hey Robert Bob listen you’re talking about yourself. I’m amazed that I’m still here. Give me a break.

Robert Scheer:

No hey tell me…. Look I do want to end on this because people don’t… You handle it great. Yeah I know that. But the fact of the matter is I just can’t describe what I’ve seen of your life. I’m sure what TerriAnn has seen. And and the fact it’s not that you’re just sitting off on some porch somewhere and telling stories you’ve been active. You’ve been probably the most active human being that I know of.

Ron Kovic:

What else is there to do?

Robert Scheer:

No but it takes work man. You know that. It takes getting up in the morning. Because I bug you early in the morning and I ask you to come speak to my class. And your passion your passion that this not happen to another kid from Long Island or anywhere else Ukraine or Russia wherever. We lost that now. We don’t have a draft. Most people don’t get called up unless war comes to them. Whether in the middle east or wherever now in Russia what have you or Ukraine. And most of us can treat it as kind of an event that’s going on. And what you are do you have those words that you have at the end of your book? I’d love to end with that “I am your 4th of July.”

Ron Kovic:

“I’m the living dead. I am the living dead your Memorial Day on wheels. I am your Yankee Doodle Dandy. Your John Wayne come home your Yankee Doodle Dandy. Your 4th of July firecracker exploding in the grave.”

Robert Scheer:

Okay. I can’t add to that “Your 4th of July firecracker exploding in the grave.” We’re in a world now where the drums of war are beating louder than any time since World War II in my life. And it’s starting again with a giddiness an indifference to human suffering because we put a label on the people that “Oh the bad guys are getting killed” or “Let’s help the good guys kill more bad guys.” And if those of you who haven’t seen Born on the 4th of July it begins with Ron Kovic as a young kid in Massapequa Long Island being influenced by the stupidity of that war movie culture. So I think we should a little bit in this interview to try to reverse that. See you guys. And please get me a picture so I could put TerriAnn up there with you when I post this podcast all right? Try to get me a good one okay in the next eight hours? Okay. Take care guys. Thank you.

Ron Kovic:

Happy 4th of July Bob. Happy 4th of July.

TerriAnn:

Thank you Bobby.

Robert Scheer:

Bye bye.",,,,,,,,,
ROK,Rockwell Automation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoYXJtdGVjaC5jb20vdmlldy9hdXRvbWF0aW5nLWJpb3BoYXJtYS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Automating Biopharma Manufacturing,"Automation—using machines rather than people to perform tasks—offers benefits to biopharmaceutical manufacturers in multiple facets of plant operation such as transporting materials taking samples and controlling the process. Digitalization—replacing manual records with digital ones and using data in a variety of digital tools and connected systems—works synergistically with automated processes. Data collected from equipment that is connected via the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) and analyzed with artificial intelligence (AI) for example allow the control system to know when a process is trending out of specification or when a piece of equipment needs maintenance. The digital or “intelligent” plant makes use of both automation and digitalization.

“With the advance of data science enabling factors such as easy access to scalable memory and computing resources; our growing competence in collecting storing and contextualizing data; advances in robotics; [and] the quickly evolving method landscape driven by the open-source community the benefits of automation and simulation are becoming accessible in the notoriously complicated realm of biopharma manufacturing” says Marcel von der Haar head of product strategy data analytics at Sartorius.

Business benefits of the digital plant include getting new products to market faster; faster changeover of products which enables flexible and multi-product manufacturing; improved operational integrity which includes predicting and correcting potential problems before they occur; and real-time release which makes production faster and minimizes inventory says Nathan Pettus president of process systems and solutions at Emerson. Digital tools accelerate the pipeline and help commercialize products faster by easing technology transfer. “For example cloud-enabled knowledge management software that manages product and process specifications through the entire drug development lifecycle is enabling biopharma manufacturers to minimize errors in the tech transfer process” says Pettus.

Automation leads to improved product quality and compliance reduced risk and improved productivity says Heather Coglaiti global industry strategy and marketing lead for life sciences Rockwell Automation. An increase in right-first-time occurrences leads to fewer deviations and investigations. Predictive or adaptive mechanisms to prevent equipment failure as well as real-time asset management help reduce operational risk she explains.

“Automation even partially digitized reduces the human errors associated with batch-to-batch variability” adds Dennis Brandl BRL Consulting. For example automated dispensing systems have less variability than manual dispensing. Automation also eliminates human error associated with manual data entry.

Automation provides consistency in performance quality and process agrees Dushyant Arora life sciences industry manager for Siemens Pharma USA. He explains that automation and digitalization enable online quality testing and review-by-exception which can enable real-time release.

Automating flexible and intensified processes

Adoption of these technologies in biopharma is driven in part by the ongoing push for speed-to-market and the trend to flexible and multi-product manufacturing. Digital technologies are also a crucial part of continuous processing.

“As life sciences plants have moved away from manufacturing a single product and are focused more on developing a wider range of specialized treatments the importance of flexible manufacturing has taken center stage” explains Pettus. “Plug-and-play” capabilities of automation systems which enable flexible manufacturing and faster technology transfer are more important than ever he says.

For scaled-down and distributed systems that use multiple identical manufacturing lines located in one facility or at multiple sites the ability to collect and share information across the enterprise is crucial adds Pettus. “Today’s automation platforms leverage scalable ‘data aggregators’ often based on software-as-a-service models and cloud-architectures. [This ability to scale allows] companies to use automation from the beginning develop the right process and then scale the solution as they build their business and infrastructure globally” he explains. Pettus concludes “At any scale there is too much at stake to dismiss automation and digitalization as they are truly critical pieces of the quality puzzle.”

Intensified and continuous processes rely on real-time testing for process control. “We are focusing our efforts for the ‘factory of the future’ on process intensification and connecting unit operations together which is enabled by single-use technology automation and process analytical technology (PAT)” says Darren Verlenden head of bioprocessing at MilliporeSigma the US and Canada life science business of Merck KGaA.

MilliporeSigma’s good manufacturing practice (GMP) PAT platform for bioprocessing includes a Raman spectroscopy analyzer and software that can achieve in-line real-time monitoring of process parameters and quality attributes. These data can be used to automate control of the bioreactor. In April 2022 the company acquired Lonza’s MAST platform an automated sterile bioreactor sampling system; upon closing it will become part of MilliporeSigma’s BioContinuum platform. The GMP MAST system will help processors evolve from manual sampling to automated sampling says Verlenden.

Digital transformation is an ongoing journey says Verlenden. He adds that some customers may want to run a fully continuous automated process while others want to intensify and automate certain unit operations.

Future facilities

The digital biopharmaceutical manufacturing plant is the “facility of the future” but it is also a reality today. Sanofi’s digital and paperless facility in Framingham Mass. for example won the 2020 overall Facility of the Year Award (FOYA) from the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE). The company says that the manufacturing facility is 80 times more productive than a traditional facility and has a smaller environmental footprint (1). ISPE’s 2022 FOYA category award for innovation went to another digital plant located in Framingham Mass.: CRISPR Therapeutics’ facility which uses digital systems and automation for production and filling operations (2). Digital tools allow this facility to manage multiple production suites and products at different stages of development (2). Takeda Pharmaceuticals International’s vaccine facility in Singen Germany won ISPE’s 2022 Pharma 4.0 category award for its use of digital technologies which include an electronic batch record system an embedded warehouse management system and autonomous mobile robots to transport materials (3). ISPE’s Honorable Mention-award winner Iovance Biotherapeutics’ autologous cell therapy facility in Philadelphia uses digital tools including electronic batch records and centralized equipment monitoring (4).

Walvax Biotech’s new COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine plant in China is another example of an intelligent and digital plant; it uses Honeywell’s batch process control building and energy management solution systems and digital twins to monitor assets (5).

“As the need for speed and agility increases biopharma production facilities need some way to better visualize and integrate batch processing across various equipment and systems” says Shawn Opatka vice-president and general manager life sciences at Honeywell. He explains that the data capture recording and reporting systems used by Walvax will help maintain auditability as well as optimize production. Opatka says that data from the live process will be sent to the digital twin where operators can proactively watch for problems and fix them before they occur.

“The application of AI is paramount and will continue to grow as many organizations progress in their digitalization journey” says Opatka. “We see more biopharma customers interested in having plants with planning and production executed automatically and using advanced analytics.”

Digital twins and AI

Using AI in predictive analytics to anticipate manufacturing problems—the predictive plant—is the next level of digital maturity after a connected plant says Yvonne Duckworth Industry 4.0 specialist director of digital technology and senior automation engineer at CRB. “Predictive analytics can reduce downtime and promote quality” says Duckworth. She points to a real-life example of a vibrating agitator that unthreaded itself before the operators noticed; if a vibration sensor had been attached to the agitator the control system would have flagged the vibration as a concern before it could have been seen by a human eye. “Some equipment vendors don’t yet offer this capability; some have vibration or temperature sensors available as options and others offer a fully integrated predictive analytics platform” says Duckworth. “Vendors have been challenged over the past year to have an answer to the question of predictive analytics capability.”

Another step forward on the digital journey is the use of digital twins which are digital models of a physical system. Brandl says that digital twins have been used for the past 30 years in process industries where the chemistry of the processes is well understood. Only recently however enabled by AI and data availability have digital twins been developed for biological processes where there is no ‘first principle’ development possible he says. “Automation brings in the data for machine learning to model the dynamic processes of cell growth and map it against the multiple dimensions provided by advanced sensors” explains Brandl.

Digital twins are being used today in biopharma process development to optimize the process in a simulated environment. They can also be used for collaborating in real-time across the value chain and validating new lines and processes virtually says Coglaiti.

“We will likely see biopharma manufacturers moving from using the digital twin primarily as a simulation and training component to making it a key part of the overall dynamic control of the process” suggests Pettus. “Manufacturing models are becoming more well defined and well understood and measurements that were virtually impossible to understand in the past are now enabled with various technologies such as spectral-based techniques. As the industry becomes more comfortable with this more complex closed-loop control and includes the digital process response predictions with advanced control techniques we will see the digital twin become even more relevant than it already is today.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Campbell called the proposed shopping center Project Whale.

The shopping center will be located along National Parks Highway near the intersection with Chapman Road.

Campbell said the Carlsbad Department of Development (CDOD) noticed the community’s population density shifted south along National Parks Highway during the past five years.

“There’s been at least two apartment complexes that have opened. There’s been several housing developments right off of National Parks Highway and further south between National Parks Highway and Old Cavern Highway. There’s been a lot of infill with housing developments there” Campbell said.

Carlsbad’s population density a measurement of population in a unit area was 10008 people per square mile according to data from the World Population Review. the population grew in Carlsbad from 26138 people in 2010 to 32238 in 2020 according to data from the U.S. Census.

Pegasus Group from Albuquerque are the land developers of the project which saw two national retailers commit to leases said Carlsbad Mayor Dale Janway.

He said Massachusetts-based Marshalls Department and Oklahoma City-based arts and crafts retailer Hobby Lobby would open new locations at the center.

Hobby Lobby’s impending location in Carlsbad would be the third in southeast New Mexico according to the company's website. The store has one location in Roswell and one in Hobbs.

Marshalls has locations in Albuquerque and Las Cruces according to the company’s website.

Campbell said the new stores could prevent “retail leakage” - money that leaves Carlsbad when people shop in larger communities.

“That hurts us on the bottom line in terms of gross receipts taxes (GRTs) that we cannot recoup because it’s going into other markets” he said.

“When we see it we see a lot of needs that are here we view those as opportunities to try and go fill in a consumer base” Campbell said.

He said CDOD worked for nearly 10 years to bring established national retailers to the community.

“It just turns out that different circumstances didn’t allow them to be here in the past whether it was population or their own expansion plans. It looks like some of the stars are aligning better for us. The Pegasus Group is the backbone of this” Campbell said.

Janway said Pegasus assisted the City of Carlsbad in past retail recruiting efforts including Ross Dress for Less at 811 West Pierce.

“It’s going to help us keep gross receipts dollars here in town and finally give people what they’ve been asking for in terms of restaurant and retail needs” Campbell said.

Efforts to bring national retailers and restaurants involves commitments from all parties in Carlsbad and Eddy County said Campbell.

“The Mayor the City Councilor’s everybody is always looking for things to come to Carlsbad. They’ve been behind a lot of the projects from the get-go” he said.

Campbell credited the City of Carlsbad Planning Engineering and Regulation Department for fostering business retail industrial and housing growth in the City.

He said construction on the shopping center could last two years and no firm date was set for groundbreaking and building.

“This is a monumental development for Carlsbad and further proof that our city is continuing to grow” said Janway.

Port Klang the gateway to Malaysia’s capital of Kuala Lumpur had the honor on Friday.

The call by Spectrum of the Seas is a prelude to a further expansion of cruises in the region. Genting Dream the ship chartered by Resorts World Cruises called in Bintan and Batam in Indonesia.

Both ships sail from Singapore which has been the center of the cruise industry in Asia as the only consistently open cruise homeport.

Spectrum of the Seas arrives in Malaysia.

A cruise ship arrived in Port Klang Malaysia for the first time in more than two years. Spectrum of the Seas arrived at the gateway to Kuala Lumpur early on Friday July 1.

The call marks a significant milestone for the cruise industry which has resumed operations to near normal levels worldwide except in Asia. The region is only slowly opening up again although major players such as Thailand and China traditionally popular cruise destinations remain closed.

Angie Stephen VP and MD Asia-Pacific Royal Caribbean International: “The return of cruising to destinations is timely as countries around the region re-open to welcome visitors revitalise their tourism sectors and embrace the new normal… We look forward to developing more exciting itineraries for our guests in this region.”

According to the Singapore Tourism Board the resumption of international cruises is essential for Singapore and the entire region. Since December 2020 Singapore has hosted several cruise ships although these only offered so-called Seacations where the ships remained at sea during 2- to 4-night cruises.

The 168670 gross tons Spectrum of the Seas is sailing a series of three-night and four-night cruises from Singapore calling in Port Klang on the three-night cruises with the addition of Penang on the four-night cruises. Only from October 21 will Royal Caribbean add a third port Phuket in Thailand.

Genting Dream Makes First Call To Indonesia

After Spectrum of the Seas had the honor of the first call to Malaysia the 151300 gross ton Genting Dream had the privilege of being the first ship in two years to make a call in Indonesia.

The ship is under charter from Genting Hong Kong to Resorts World Cruises the company operated by former Genting Hong Kong CEO Lim Kok Thay who is still the Chairman of Genting Group.

“We are committed to Singapore’s vision to be a premier cruise hub in Asia. Together with STB we look forward to growing the cruise sector including the fly-cruise segment; and to making Singapore and Southeast Asia one of the largest year-round cruise destinations in the world” said Mr Michael Goh President of Resorts World Cruises.

The ship made two calls to Indonesia both relatively close to Singapore. Bintan is a small island of Indonesia located 48 km southeast of Singapore and east of Sumatra; Batam is its neighbor.

Singapore At The Center Of The Asian Cruise Restart

The growth in Asia was one of the most critical factors for the positivity prevalent in the cruise industry before the Pandemic. However since then that attitude has changed significantly. The region remains mostly closed except for the country now showing itself as the leader Singapore.

The Singapore Tourism Board chief executive Keith Tan: “Cruising is a key tourism driver and as Asean’s lead coordinator for cruise development Singapore will continue to work with our counterparts to strengthen the region’s attractiveness as a cruising destination and source market.”

Before the pandemic more than 1.8 million passengers sailed from or called in Singapore in 2019. This includes 400 cruise ships across 30 cruise brands.

Singapore now aims to steadily increase cruises sailing from the city-state with Spectrum of the Seas and Genting Dream playing an important role. Later this year ships from Oceania Cruises Silversea and Cunard will be sailing from Singapore.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL3Utcy1hdXRob3JpdGllcy1hcHByb3ZlLWVsb24tbXVza3MtYmxhemluZy1pbnRlcm5ldC1mb3ItZmxpZ2h0cy1hbmQtY3J1aXNlLXNoaXBzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Authorities Approve Elon Musk's Blazing Internet For Flights And Cruise Ships,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

On Thursday The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authorized SpaceX —business magnate Elon Musk’s company— to provide satellite Internet to vehicles in motion such as airplanes vessels and trucks. Now commercial airlines and cruise lines can offer travelers this company’s internet service Starlink.

Tom Sullivan the FCC international bureau chief said: “Authorizing a new class of [customer] terminals for SpaceX’s satellite system will expand the range of broadband capabilities to meet the growing user demands that now require connectivity while on the move whether driving an RV across the country moving a freighter from Europe to a U.S. port or while on a domestic or international flight.”

This is great news for businesses in the travel industry interested in offering this service to their customers and to those already providing Starlink satellite internet. A few weeks ago Hawaiian Airlines had already announced the implementation of Starlink internet service and Royal Caribbean recently became the first cruise line to request the service.

Companies already offering SpaceX’s internet service have been experiencing limitations in the US. In a recent post on the Royal Caribbean blog it was explained: “Before you can expect to get super-fast wifi on a Royal Caribbean ship the FCC needs to approve the technology because right now Starlink isn't allowed on moving vehicles.”

But now that the FCC approved the use of the service travelers can expect a better Internet connection. SpaceX had been waiting for an answer since March and now it has the green light. However the US agency imposed a few conditions that SpaceX has been required to accept like “interference received from both current and future services authorized” and other conditions and requirements.

Very soon travelers will start experiencing this blazing Internet connection during flights and while cruising. Hawaiian Airlines will provide the service for free next year on all of its 42 airplanes —all fleet including Airbus A330 A321neos and Boeing 787 Dreamliner— and Royal Caribbean already started testing Starlink on its Freedom of the Seas vessel.

Travelers Will Get High-Speed Satellite Internet Everywhere

SpaceX’s satellite coverage provides services in 36 countries. Since 2019 the company has already launched 2700 satellites in low to medium Earth orbit for low latency and fast speed. The company is already being used by over 400000 users.

Now that this satellite internet service has been approved to be used on the move users will be able to experience high-speed internet connections anywhere across the globe.

Royal Caribbean Group's Vice President Operational Excellence John Maya said in a letter to FCC: “Working with SpaceX Services Inc. we believe we have identified a true next generation solution for our vessels that meets the rigorous technical and operational requirements commensurate with our growth plans.”

The cruise line has already equipped its vessel Freedom of the Seas with satellite dishes Starlink’s Dishy McFlatfaces to provide customers Internet through its wifi service Voom—prices currently range from $17.99 per day to $32.99 per day with streaming options. According to the information provided by Crew Center the cruise company’s Internet service is expected to increase considerably: from 3 to 5 Mbps to 50 to 250 Mbps.

Hawaiian Airlines on the other hand will be offering its customers wifi service for free in 2023. As reported by Beat of Hawaii the download speeds will range from 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps.

When the alliance was announced in April Peter Ingram Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO said: “We waited until technology caught up with our high standards for guest experience but it will be worth the wait. Our guests can look forward to fast seamless and free Wi-Fi to complement our award-winning onboard Hawaiian hospitality.”

Travelers will start experiencing Starlink’s fast internet connection soon and since Hawaiian Airlines will be offering this service for free many expect that other cruise lines and airlines will do the same.

If as my Little Oxford dictionary says being ‘royal’ means suited to worthy of a king or queen or belonging to a family of royals or in service or under patronage of king or queen or splendid on a grand scale then all fit categories fit and come together at Sandals Royal Curacao the latest splendid hotel to open on a grand scale on a grand plantation suited to making you feel like being royal.

That feeling of belonging to and touched by royalty is how couples from Planet Earth who couldn’t or didn’t want to wait for the grand opening of Sandals Royal Curacao felt last weekend on Opening Night June 24.

Specially-invited by Sandals Resorts International (SRI) Executive Chairman Adam Stewart to share the curtain-raising opening-night launch ceremony with him and Sandals crews from across the Caribbean those gathered for the occasion at the Caribbean’s leading exclusive luxury resort chain’s 16th property on a 9th island included many who’d already felt royal at other Caribbean properties.

But each also admitted Curacao was their best experience staying at the globally-branded Caribbean chain’s palatial resorts.

Each had arrived days before and was personally invited through a tropically-gilded envelope from Stewart directly-delivered to their rooms on arrival by a suite of smartly-suited courtiers accompanied by a signed expression of his sealed ‘pleasure to personally welcome you’ to SRI’s ‘latest home-away-from-home’ in its first move from the English-speaking to ‘the colorful and captivating Dutch Caribbean.’

The man at the helm of the Sandals realm told the Royal Curacao’s first guests he felt ‘honored that you chose to be part of our story as we not only write but experience and celebrate the next chapter in our beloved brand’s history during our commemorative 40th anniversary year.’

Committing to offering them and future guests ‘the very best always from the tapestry of Sandals Royal Curacao’ Stewart on opening night told Group Chief Executive Officer Gerhardt Rainer group and property managers gathered guests and friends from far and wide they were living a dream his legendary father Gordon ‘Butch’ Stewart only dreamt of.

His dad had a decade earlier dreamed of acquiring the property and ‘Sandalizing it’ and while he was not on hand to live that dream today Sandals Royal Curacao represents ‘a labour of love years in the making’ inspired just as much by ‘the natural beauty and pulsating culture that surrounds it’ as by them its royal guests — ‘and the meaningful ways’ SRI invites them ‘to connect with this coveted slice of paradise.’

Citing the ‘Innovation Heart and Soul’ behind the group’s designation of its latest Royal luxury resort as ‘Where Amazing Comes Together’ SRI’s helmsman invited the gathered guests to continue to absorb the royal feeling for the rest of the weekend ‘with every breathtaking view each delectable bite and sip the warm smiles of our Team members and the immersive experiences our team has curated for you beyond the resort…’

Those who’d thus-far been to both sides of the pastel-painted capital Willemstad or out on any of the daily catamaran tours or fishing trips or simply chose to live simply relax in the homely excellence of ‘living at one and playing at all’ of the brand-new branded resort’s overwhelming number of facilities all felt the added variations of style and luxury associated with the brand — except more so at this latest extension of the ever-growing Sandals Caribbean realm.

Each couple was welcomed on arrival by a dedicated Club Sandals Concierge with an individual plan ‘to elevate’ their luxury-included vacation ‘to a new level of indulgence’ through provision of ‘flawless personalized attention and exceptional hospitality’ throughout their stay.

Press and travel writers from near and far invited to share Sandals’ latest serving of the brand’s royal feeling in Curacao did feel the exclusive attention and treatment normally reserved for guests — from me being driven into happiness around and across Willemstad and the sprawling 44-acre Sandals Royal’s space within the ocean-wide 3000-acre Santa Barbara Plantation by exclusive (and almost verifiably know-it-all) taxi operator Marlon Frans to the European couple who simply couldn’t stop tracking and photographing the resort’s colorful lizards and friendly iguanas to the ‘retired American globetrotter’ who likened the picturesque and quarry-laden ‘Table Hill’ overlooking Willemstad to South Africa’s Table Mountain to the Mexican who said she’d ‘never seen such a concentration of cacti per square inch…’ even in Mexico.

Thanking General Manager Kevin Clarke the Caribbean ‘Task Force’ members and the Curacao first-timers for the success of the seamless transition from the earlier Santa Barbara property to the current oasis of picturesque beach-side and terraneous Caribbean the man with the helm at the Sandals realm thanked all present (and absent) for their roles in SRI ‘not only being voted the world’s best luxury vacation resort company for the last 27 years in succession’ but also ‘having the highest rate of return visitors’ regionally.

SRI’s ultimate and unending objective being ‘to always outperform others’ Adam Stewart promised to maintain the elevation of Sandals standards even beyond royalty each and every time at all the other 15 resorts while always planning ahead with new ways to remind loyalists and royalists that although Sandals Royal Curacao ‘is as good as it gets on the planet’ they should still ‘Put on your seatbelts because we’re about to take-off again!’

Indeed if royalty is meant to be splendid and on a graduating scale of grandiose grandeur it’s all wrapped and enveloped in scale and style branded and sealed at Sandals Royal Curacao where royalty and amazing Caribbean realities come together like nowhere else!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHN0b3J5LmluL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1ub3ctdXNlcy1zdGFybGluay1pbnRlcm5ldC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1vbmJvYXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean now uses Starlink internet services onboard,"A couple of weeks earlier it was known that the Royal Caribbean Group applied for a license to use Starlink internet dishes on its ships. A letter was written to the FCC asking license to operate the internet dishes. Earlier this week Royal Caribbean announced that its ship ‘Freedom of the Seas’ now has Starlink dish antennas outfitted onboard.

SpaceX did not have approval from the FCC earlier to operate on moving vehicles including airplanes trains sea-going vessels trucks and RVs. Early June Driveteslacanada.ca stated that the ship was installed with the dishes already ahead of the approvals. There is no information on the approval officially. However in the Royal Caribbean blog there is a post stating a user experiencing the Starlink satellite internet service. It was stated that the service is being tested quietly for now. It appears that the passengers on board can currently try the service as it is active. In a way it is being offered on the cruise.

The experience was noted in comparison to other internet services. Both packages were easily showing videos without any buffer. However when they were on a zoom call the difference was seen. Many other such details were included.

Satellite internet

The customer who tested the Starlink network aboard the cruise ship said that when they accessed the internet -“It was instantly clear that this internet service was above and beyond what Voom typically offered.”

“The next morning we docked in Perfect Day at CocoCay Royal’s private island in the Bahamas. We were excited to test the speeds while on the island which includes wifi access if you purchased a package on the ship” they shared “To our surprise the [Starlink] service remained strong even on the south side of the island with Surf showing download speeds of 19.93 Mbps and upload speeds of 8.19 Mbps while Surf & Stream showed download speeds of 52.50 Mbps and upload speeds of 10.10 Mbps.”

In the letter to FCC it was stated “We believe our work with SpaceX the first of its kind in the cruise industry will set the standard for other cruise operators and will mean a leap in terms of guest experience and business operations while at sea. […] For this reason we are eager to advocate for new market entrants to drive a marketplace innovation step change.”

This is a change not only for cruise ships but also for SpaceX who has been wanting to test the services on moving vehicles. As the services seem to work fine more applications could be used in the coming months."

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RveW90YS13aWxsLWNoYWxsZW5nZS10aGUtbWF6ZGEtbWlhdGEtZGlyZWN0bHktd2l0aC1pdHMtcy1mci1zcG9ydHMtY2FyLXJlcG9ydNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toyota Will Challenge the Mazda Miata Directly With Its S-FR Sports Car: Report,"Way back in 2015 Toyota tantalized us with the prospect of a Mazda MX-5 competitor called the S-FR concept. This big-mouthed sports car promised two-plus-two seating in an even smaller lighter package than the 86 contrasting the two-seat Mazda. Though the S-FR fell off the radar Toyota apparently didn't forget about it as Japanese media indicates the S-FR is finally cleared for production.

Citing Best Car Magazine which typically publishes original reporting in print before sharing it online Forbes says the S-FR will launch in late 2026 or early 2027. It's reported to be in co-development with Daihatsu and Suzuki which were previously rumored to be working on a small mid-engined model together. It seems that project has evolved into a more conventional front-engined rear-wheel-drive coupe that'll become the S-FR—with a larger more powerful engine.

Toyota S-FR Racing Concept. Toyota

Specifically the S-FR is reported to use a three-cylinder turbo engine making around 150 horsepower to turn the rear wheels. Curiously rumors of a revived Toyota Starlet with a GR performance version specify a similar engine; 150 hp from a 1.3-liter engine downsized from the one in the GR Corolla. This also matches the displacement of the engine in the Daihatsu Vision Copen concept from October which would seem to preview Toyota's next sports car. Or at least Daihatsu's version of it.

The S-FR's design will reportedly be overhauled for production with a smaller grille and altered headlights. There was no word as to the potential implementation of the S-FR Racing concept pictured above with its aggressive rear wing canards splitter and diffuser. These could feasibly be offered as accessories or even as exclusives on a hypothetical GR model. That's purely speculative on our part though.

Price-wise Toyota is reportedly targeting the equivalent of $22700. That wouldn't just undercut the Mazda MX-5 by around $6000 but also make it one of the cheapest new cars on sale in the U.S. period—if it makes it here. Toyota is reportedly undecided about selling the S-FR in the States where it already sells the similar GR86. Offering both could easily cannibalize sales potentially without taking as much share of Mazda's pie as intended.

There's also the question of where it'd fit with the supposed Celica reboot which could culminate in a thrifty fun rear-wheel-drive coupe to compete with the Honda Prelude. It too seems like it'd contend for S-FR and GR86 customers weakening the prospects for all involved. If the S-FR does come around my money's on it staying out of the States just like the Starlet is supposed to. I mean with Mazda locking down the small sports car market and the GR86 addressing one size up why even bother?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9yb3NzaS1icm90aGVycy1sZWxsaW8tZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2thcmVuLXMtcmVudHoteW91bmdzdG93bi1vaGlvL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9yb3NzaS1icm90aGVycy1sZWxsaW8tZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2thcmVuLXMtcmVudHoteW91bmdzdG93bi1vaGlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karen S.

George Frank Ripple Jr. age 98 of Fairview and formerly of Irwin PA passed away peacefully on Monday June 27 2022 at his son’s residence surrounded by his family and his faith as he entered eternal life.

George was known by a variety of names throughout his years; George Frank Junior Rip Uncle Rip Pop and for the last 24 years he was known simply as “Pappy”.

He was born on August 14 1923 in Windber PA a son of the late George and Irma Abbott Ripple.

Following high school he served his country both in WWII as an Army Air Corp radio operator in the South Pacific and in the Korean Conflict. He was a proud veteran who received numerous commendations and enjoyed sharing his memories and stories. Upon his return he worked for Berwind White Coal Company as a painter/contractor. He later owned and contracted through Windber Paint and Wallpaper. Windber was always in his heart and he enjoyed reminiscing of his early years and life.

Taking employment with Sherwin Williams Company until his retirement in 1983 he and his wife moved to Irwin PA and raised their family. His paint store was located in in Monroeville PA at the famed “Miracle Mile” and became the local stomping ground where contractors and local celebrities frequented.

Throughout his years George belonged to several different Roman Catholic parishes and was always active and supportive of whatever project or event was occurring.

For the last twenty five years he lived with Michael Wendy and Isaac. It was during these later years that he took on the name and became known as “pappy”. He always busied himself with some home projects from dipping the paint brush to refinishing furniture and riding the mower. Pappy’s deep love of music inspired a few musicians in the family and on occasion he was known to pick up his old violin. He loved automobile treks and travel from grocery store trips to religious pilgrimages to Medugorje Pappy enjoyed the moment. He continued to stay in touch with family and friends up to his last days looking forward to the calls from his sister and was grateful to his nephews for their continued relationship.

Pappy was always there to share a smile and lend support. He lived through the many paths and lives of his children grandchildren and great grandchildren. Pappy will be remembered in many different ways from his witty smile to a simple word of encouragement but there was always that one moment of a soft look from his blue eyes that invited you into his heart faith and love.

In addition to his parents he was preceded in death by his wife Alberta Rosenbaum Ripple in 1991 and his sisterGeraldine (John) Ivey.

He is survived by his sister Doris (John) Ripper a daughter Claudia (Kirk) Schabacker of New Jersey; two sons George “Uncle G” Ripple of Fairview; Michael (Wendy) Ripple of Fairview; three grandchildren: Matthew (Chrissy) Schabacker Elizabeth Ann (Aaron Avalos); and Isaac Ripple; five great grandchildren: Cami Allie Jason Nico and Mila; and several nieces and nephews.

A private Mass of Christian Burial will be held at St. Peter’s Cathedral and burial in Irwin Cemetery. Arrangements Entrusted to the Burton Quinn Scott Cremation and Funeral Services Downtown 602 West 10th St. Send condolences at BurtonQuinnScott.com

The family wishes to thank everyone for their prayers support care and love during this time.

“In the tender compassion of our God the dawn from on high shall break upon us to shine on those who dwell in the darkness and shadow of death”

Well done Pappy!

Pike and MBTA stations the complexity of such mega-projects is ...,"“We are excellent project managers and had obtained 14 out of the 15 required approvals needed to proceed with the tower and expected to get the last one” Simon told analysts on a conference call a few weeks later. “Unfortunately the goalpost kept moving.”

It was fall 2016 and the CEO of Simon Property Group — the largest owner of shopping malls in the US — had spent nearly a decade trying to build a skyscraper at Copley Place. Developing a 52-story tower in Boston’s Back Bay is complex under the best of circumstances and this one was made far more complicated by its proposed location: On a deck above the Massachusetts Turnpike with tens of thousands of cars a day whizzing underneath. The safety and engineering review was endless. Eventually Simon pulled the plug.

It was the latest in a long string of failed plans to build so-called “air rights” projects above the Pike. And Simon’s words served as a wake-up call to Governor Charlie Baker’s administration said Scott Bosworth undersecretary and chief strategy officer at MassDOT.

“Simon had some very critical points they made and our answer to the governor was: They’re right. We’re not a great partner on these things” Bosworth said. “That changed everything. It changed our focus and our drive to get this done.”

MassDOT has since streamlined the intensive review process and devoted more attention to pushing these projects — which sit atop some of the most valuable pieces of undeveloped “land” left in Boston — across the finish line. Today some of the largest projects underway in Boston are towers rising over the Pike along Massachusetts Avenue and near Fenway Park as well as over a submerged portion in the Seaport. At South Station a long-planned skyscraper is finally underway over the railhead where thousands board commuter rail trains daily. More are in the works.

The failed Simon project at Copley Place was one wake-up call. But last month the Baker administration got a wake-up call of a different kind when inspectors found a severely deteriorated support beam for a different and far older type of air rights project: the Government Center Garage. Inspectors discovered the beam deteriorated by decades of water damage below ground in a shuttered part of Haymarket station. Service on the Orange and Green lines was halted immediately and only resumed after a weekend’s worth of emergency work to shore up the beam with steel bracing. (The reason the inspectors were even in the tunnel to begin with was to study its structural integrity following an accident above in March when a portion of the garage collapsed during demolition killing a worker and halting T service for several days.)

The episode shows how rapidly circumstances can change with these complicated mega-projects — derailing not just construction of a building but vital public needs like roads and trains — and how complex agreements about how to maintain private infrastructure in public space can blur over the decades. And all of it comes at a time when the city is desperate to have workers return to the office and bring vitality and life back to downtown.

In dueling statements issued as outrage spread over the latest T shutdown both the MBTA and the HYM Investment Group which owns and is redeveloping the Government Center Garage essentially blamed the other. HYM and general contractor John Moriarty & Associates later said they’re “not in the business of pointing fingers” but also made sure to note that “these tunnels are inaccessible without the permission of the MBTA.” Meanwhile T officials sent reporters copies of a typewritten easement drafted in 1966 with the then-Boston Redevelopment Authority outlining how whoever owned the hulking garage would be responsible for maintaining the support columns that slice through the T station below.

Questions about who is ultimately at fault could take years to settle in court one expert said. But either way as prime plots of developable land in Boston dwindle real estate experts expect more major projects will be built atop highways and rail stations — which means grappling with complicated questions of economics and engineering not to mention multiple public agencies.

These projects are phenomenally expensive upping the risk to investors and often limiting the range of uses to those that command the highest rent. These days that usually means lab space.

As developer John Rosenthal searched for partners to help finance the $1 billion second phase of his long-planned Fenway Center air rights project he found life science developers were most receptive. So he pivoted away from a previously approved plan for residential to incorporate lab space instead and reached a deal with developer IQHQ — a California-based firm that by late 2020 had raised $2.4 billion to finance lab projects nationwide — to launch construction. Those deep pockets meant IQHQ could take on a challenge.

“Not a lot of investors are willing to invest over $1 billion” Rosenthal said “and [then wait] 4½ years to complete a project to start to get a return.”

Altogether it’s a challenge that has bedeviled Boston developers for decades.

Failures have been epic ranging from Columbus Center over the Pike along Clarendon Street — whose prominent developer Arthur Winn ultimately pled guilty to illegal campaign contributions — to so-called Parcel 15 near the Hynes Convention Center which ended in ugly lawsuits between former business partners John Fish and Stephen Weiner after the project fell through.

But lately there have been successes too.

Samuels & Associates recently celebrated completion of a deck over the Pike along Mass. Ave. which will eventually house the headquarters of CarGurus a park and a hotel. The public-private partnership was also much touted and Baker noted the “incredible feat of engineering” necessary to build over a highway and train tracks which have to operate day and night.

And a mile down the Pike sits Fenway Center where work is now underway on a 2-acre deck that will span the eight highway lanes below.

Crews have spent the past year drilling hundreds of concrete and steel support beams called piles into bedrock to hold up the deck which will in turn hold up the tens of thousands of tons of building above.

There are mini piles that are encased in concrete between the highway and the railroad tracks and larger steel H piles drilled between 230 and 270 feet deep into the ground below. Each pile is capped with 75000 pounds of steel and stretches about 700 feet Rosenthal said. Much of this work happens late at night to prevent commuting disruptions.

The deck alone will cost about $200 million Rosenthal said and there’s another $55 million in upfront rent to the state. The construction cost includes not just Rosenthal’s engineers designers and consultants but the army of experts employed by MassDOT and MBTA to monitor the project as well. When it’s done the state will technically own the project site — Rosenthal’s team has a 99-year lease — and therefore must approve every plan and document.

“That’s like the seller having an ongoing interest in your property — which they do — and therefore it doubles all of your legal your engineering your design” costs Rosenthal said. “It’s just another example of why air rights are so difficult to do so expensive to develop. ... We paid $55 million for air.”

Mitigating risk and ensuring public safety is always top of mind on any construction project and especially for projects where a fallen beam or errant tool could land on roads or train lines below experts from the Wentworth Institute of Technology told the Globe.

“The care that has to be taken during [the] construction process is really of extreme importance and that becomes very very challenging” said Ilyas Bhatti a professor of construction management at Wentworth. “There are risks involved and the challenge is: How do you mitigate those risks?”

And construction is only the beginning of a relationship between developers and public agencies that can last decades noted Wentworth civil engineering professor Jim Lambrechts.

“After the project’s done the risk then becomes the continued longevity the continued structural integrity of the structure you’ve built” Lambrechts said. “Who inspects it? Who takes care of it?”

And as the brouhaha over Haymarket and its ailing beam shows those questions can last for a long long time.

Average property values in more than half of Tauranga's suburbs are lower now than they were in January new data shows.

Bellevue had the biggest fall of $72000 to $864000 since January followed by Mount Maunganui with a $71000 drop to $1.64 million.

The latest OneRoof House Price Report showed the region-wide property slowdown had started to drag some of the region's strongest performing suburbs.

Tauranga's average property value took the biggest hit in the region over the quarter dropping 2.7 per cent - or $34000 - to $1.213m.

Just three suburbs in the city Pāpāmoa Maungatapu and Poike registered value growth with Bellevue recording the biggest drop of 6.6 per cent to $864000.

Head of valuations at OneRoof data partner Valocity James Wilson said Tauranga property values were dropping as buyers digest the impact of rising mortgage rates and higher cost of living.

Wilson said property values were returning to levels from the highs seen in early 2022 in some suburbs as buyers adopted the ""fear of overpaying"" and took advantage of reduced competition in the market.

""First-home buyers had retreated from 33 per cent of the buyers to 28 per cent in the past quarter.""

Bay of Plenty's average property value was $1071000 down 0.7 per cent - or $8000 - in the last three months.

But house prices were still 2.72 per cent above where they were at the start of the year and 14.3 per cent - or $134000 - above June 2021 levels.

Whakatāne was the only other territorial authority to register growth over the quarter with its average property value up 2.2 per cent to $819000.

Managing director of the Realty Group Ltd which operates Eves and Bayleys Heath Young said the price drop was not surprising for Tauranga and Rotorua markets.

""Over the last three months there have been a large number of factors that have impacted on the property market all at once in a real sharp noticeable change in market conditions.""

The reasons were namely interest rate rises inflationary pressures and to a lesser extent the direct impact of Covid illnesses resulting in fewer deals being made and property taking longer to sell he said.

""We are however still seeing well-presented well-marketed property perform well and are starting to see more and more activity in our auction rooms.""

First National Real Estate Tauranga general manager Cameron Hooper said there had not been a flood of listings to the market which had reflected the ""slow-landing"" of average prices.

First-home buyers remained quiet and price expectations had been ""sliced in half"" he said.

Hooper said most buyers had to sell their property before going unconditional on another home.

""It is almost like anybody in a position to purchase straight away have been eroded. Those cash buyers have gone.""

Tauranga Harcourts managing director Simon Martin said the data reflected the current supply and demand dynamic.

There were about 700 properties for sale in Tauranga last month but only about 100 sales whereas this time last year it was almost the opposite he said.

""We started noticing a change in February and it certainly happened quite quickly.""

Property Brokers Bay of Plenty regional manager Simon Short said there were restrictions happening in Tauranga's property market.

Short said there was a ""massive"" supply of property for sale but demand had dropped as buyers were no longer in a rush to buy.

""But it is not as dire as everyone thinks.""

First-home buyers were in a ""prickly position"" with rising interest rates and had not been as active in the market.

""They are trying to track the bottom of the market and are just sitting and waiting.""

The trail mix at a local grocery store?

How about those dark-chocolate covered cranberries you picked up to satisfy a sweet tooth?

Chances are good they were all prepared and packaged at Hickory Harvest a Coventry Township business that started as a family operation and remains one — a much bigger one — three generations later.

On July 19 Hickory Harvest will celebrate a half-century of growth and transformation from a portable enterprise that Joseph and Pauline Swiatkowski founded in 1972 by selling smoked sausage and cheeses at county fairs.

Flashback to 2012:Family business leader Joe Swiatkowski says don’t stray from who you are

“When my dad and grandpa started the company 50 years ago [it] was not in traditional supermarkets” Hickory Harvest President and CEO Joe Swiatkowski said in a recent interview.

The fair booths led to a store by the late 1970s and development in the 1980s of current product lines that include roasted nuts dried fruits and confections.

“In 1982 dad bought a french-fryer” Swiatkowski said. “He [cooked] 20 pounds of nuts in it. Now we roast 30000 to 40000 pounds a day.”

From the mall to the world

At one time the company operated a cheese and wine shop in Rolling Acres Mall.

Swiatkowski’s parents met there later getting engaged during a date at Parasson’s Swiatkowski said. By the ’90s Hickory Harvest was expanding into grocery stores and national convenience store chains.

The company built its current headquarters on Logan Parkway in 2009 moving from the Killian Road location it had operated at for 20 years.

Since it moved to the Coventry Township location the company has added expansions to the facility in 2013 and 2018 and another is in the works Swiatkowski said.

The nuts fruits and flavors that make up Hickory Harvest trail mix products place it in a high-growth and highly competitive segment of the food industry.

Technavio a market research company forecasts the trail mix sector will grow about 12% this year and 12.7% a year through 2026. It’s a wave Hickory Harvest is riding to new heights.

The company stays nimble by keeping track of industry trends and developing products to meet consumers’ changing appetites Swiatkowski said.

“You stay in business by listening to your customers” he said. “We’re a fast follower.”

Hickory Harvest invested about $750000 this year in new equipment to make those new products and streamline operations for the products it makes he said including 10000 to 15000 pounds of trail mix per day.

The toughest year

Swiatkowski said his company continued to grow last year pushing through the same labor shortages and supply-chain disruptions that businesses throughout the country had to overcome.

“2021 was a very difficult year” he said. “The most difficult I ever had to deal with.”

The company went from 85 employees in February 2021 to 50 full-time employees in June.

By summer staffing was so depleted that Swiatkowski drafted one of his three daughters to work.

“If you don’t want to work [here] you have to get me five people [who do]” he told her. “She got me eight.”

His daughter recruited people she knew who helped fill the void keeping production lines going and giving Hickory Harvest time to hire new workers.

“They were really key to last summer” he said. “It would have been dire without them.”

A year later the company still has positions open it’s seeking to fill Swiatkowski said.

“We’re short on direct manufacturing employees like everyone is” he said.

Orders to suppliers too were affected as they struggled with their own labor and supply issues.

“We went from a three-week lead time to 12 weeks” he said.

Changes expansion at Hickory Harvest

Swiatkowski who bought the family business from his mother in August 2020 had handled Hickory Harvest’s operations side since the death of his father George Swiatkowsi in 2003.

“My mom wanted to have nothing to do with operations” Swiatkowski said. “She said ‘You have to run it or we’re going to have to sell it.’ And we figured it out from there.”

The company’s nut-roasting machine pays homage to his father with a large sign hanging over the production line designating it as “Big George.”

Swiatkowski became involved with the family business at an early age he said working in the warehouse as a teen before taking a job outside the company after college. It didn’t take long for him to return with his role expanding rapidly.

“I always enjoyed the business” he said. “I’ve known how to do everything in here [since] I was 12.”

By 2004 he was president of the company his grandfather founded adding CEO to his title after the purchase. His mother Darlene became chair emeritus after retiring.

Swiatkowski said the company has evolved as consumer tastes have changed and food safety regulations have stiffened. Hickory Harvest continues to invest heavily to ensure its 250-plus products stay on top of trends and are safe he said. Six employees work to comply and exceed food safety regulations.

“We [have] a budget of about $600000 a year for our quality personnel and programs” he said.

Swiatkowski said his company is looking to expand by adding new products that capture consumer interest and by acquisitions.

“We’re definitely looking at acquisitions” he said. “We have aggressive growth plans.”

The company distributes in all 48 contiguous states and has some overseas clients most notably in South Korea. Swiatkowski said the company will concentrate on the U.S. for its growth plans.

It recently introduced dark chocolate almond and peanut butter products that have been well received Swiatkowski said.

Trail mix flavors are constantly evolving he said with dill an emerging flavor to watch.

“Sweet and savory is where trail mixes are going” he said.

He plans to continue adding new products as market trends develop.

“Our biggest foray right now is into private label [products]” he said. “...Branding is where you get a lot of notice.”

A player among giants

The trail mix market is dominated by household names like J.M. Smucker General Mills Kellogg Co. and PepsiCo but Swiatkowski said he hopes to keep a family feel at Hickory Harvest.

The 50th anniversary celebration on July 19 will include family-themed activities like a cornhole tournament a DJ and food trucks he said.

“It started out as family [and] we treat our workers as family” he said. “I want to continue that as we go.”

He’s not sure if the company will be led by a fourth generation of Swiatkowskis but doesn’t appear overly concerned about it. All three of his daughters ages 10 14 and 19 have career plans that may lead in other directions.

“Only 3% of family businesses get to the third generation” he said.

Swiatkowski said he has his own go-to snacks among the many varieties the company produces.

“My favorite is a honey-roasted pecan” he said. Cashews are a close second.

Although he plans to expand Hickory Harvest’s reach Swiatkowski hasn’t forgotten the company’s roots.

“We had one small machine here when my dad passed away” he said. “One roaster and one [packager].”

In the first picture she's squatting in a white one piece with a sexy cut out design and eating a bright red popsicle. She has on a backwards white baseball cap white sneakers and white socks with red stripes and looks at the photographer as she wipes her mouth.

The next photo is also pretty sexy because Hailey is straddling her husband Justin Bieber who is laying flat on the floor. He is wearing only basketball shorts and laying on a yoga mat. As his wife looks down on him he tenderly cups her head.

The others pics show a red room and a mirror selfie in her black leather jacket she's been favoring lately. She captioned the pictures “into the weekend.”

Hailey has been busy promoting her new skin care line Rhode which puts a heavy emphasis on hydration and moisturization. Many of her recent timeline posts have included some hype for the brand but this collection just seems like a fun summer photo dump.

The last few days Hailey and Justin have been photographed out together frequently. First they were spotted on their way a service at Churchome their place of worship and then while out on a date night at one of their favorite restaurants Sushi Park. Justin was recently diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome which can happen when the varicella-zoster virus infects a nerve in the head. Initially the infection causes rashes by the ear on the face but one possible outcome is facial paralysis.

In the pic Kidman wears a gorgeous one-shouldered wedding dress with a veil cascading behind her. Meanwhile Urban rocks a snazzy black tux.

Tesla plans to build an enormous electric vehicle supercharger station off of Interstate 5 in Sutherlin Oregon.

With a population of just over 8000 Sutherlin might not seem like the obvious choice for the largest supercharger station outside of California.

“Other than this being the greatest small town in the United States we happen to be strategically located almost exactly halfway between San Francisco and Seattle” says Sutherlin City Manager Jerry Gillham.

Gillham explains the station will expose Sutherlin to outsiders who might not otherwise explore the small city. Because of the potential for marketing the city plans to put up a billboard next to the station advertising its attractions.

The Sutherlin station will have 51 charging stalls. Springfield has the current largest supercharger station in Oregon with 14.

Tesla says superchargers can charge a car up to 200 miles in 15 minutes. Right now the chargers are only available for Tesla vehicles but the company is considering a way to make them available to all electric vehicles in select countries.

The station is set to open in 2023 according to Tesla.

From Friday through Sunday airlines that fly within into or out of the United States canceled more than 1400 flights according to FlightAware a flight-tracking website stranding and angering some passengers headed for long-awaited summer vacations. In addition more than 14000 flights were delayed this holiday weekend according to the site’s data.

Some airlines seemed to be struggling to handle passenger volume that approached or in some cases even exceeded prepandemic levels. On Friday the Transportation Safety Administration screened more passengers — 2.49 million people — than on any other day this year. That surpassed the 2.18 travelers screened on July 1 2019 before the pandemic.

The experience was frustrating for some passengers on U.S. carriers. On Saturday 1048 — or 29 percent — of Southwest Airlines flights were delayed as were 28 percent of American Airlines flights according to FlightAware. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines had similar problems with 21 percent and 19 percent of their flights also delayed.

People across the U.S. are expected to fly in the highest numbers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic for the July 4 holiday weekend stressing a beleaguered transportation system experiencing tens of thousands of cancellations and delays.

Nearly 8000 flights within into or out of the U.S. were delayed on Friday and 587 were canceled. Another 2100 were delayed and 523 canceled as of around 11:20 a.m. in New York on Saturday according to FlightAware.com.

July 4 travelers might also have to contend with bad weather. Thunderstorms are on tap for a stretch of the East Coast from Washington to Boston on Saturday. Further south Tropical Storm Colin formed “unexpectedly” off the coast of South Carolina according to the National Hurricane Center.

The Transportation Security Administration said it screened about 2.5 million passengers at U.S. airports on Friday in what it expects to be the year’s busiest travel weekend yet.

As many as 12.3 million people are expected to pass through airport security between June 30 and July 4 according to the Chaddick Air Travel Bulletin by DePaul University — about 8% more than on Memorial Day weekend in May the traditional kickoff of the summer travel season.

Passengers are being asked to shell out hefty prices for tickets despite the increasing likelihood of hassles as airlines try to wring out profits amid surging costs. Domestic fares are expected to average $437 round-trip the highest in five years according to travel app Hopper Inc.

“Unfortunately the summer of 2022 is going to be a very unpleasant one for far too many airline passengers” said Henry Harteveldt founder and travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group.

U.S. carriers are eager to show that they can be reliable during times of heavy demand but have struggled to cope with travelers returning to the skies after two years of COVID-19 foiling summer plans. Airlines huddled with Biden administration officials this week to game plan for the days ahead.

From May 27 through June 30 the seven largest U.S. airlines scratched 2.7% of flights or 13783 according to FlightAware.com. Another 25.3% or 126620 were delayed for an average 50 minutes. Using a conservative estimate of 100 passengers per flight that means at least 14 million travelers have been affected over the past five weeks.

By comparison in the same period in 2019 1.7% of flights were canceled and 19.4% delayed.

Mounting frustration

Delta Air Lines Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian apologized Thursday to customers for an “unacceptable” level of flight disruptions this summer an unusual step that reflects mounting frustration among waylaid travelers.

In a letter to members of Delta’s frequent flier program Bastian warned that “things won’t change overnight” despite the airline’s efforts to improve. The apology followed Delta’s unusual offer to let passengers change travel plans across its network during the “potentially challenging” holiday without paying a fare difference or change fee.

On a recent flight from Michigan to Minnesota Delta said it would give $10000 to eight passengers who would give up their seats on the oversold plane and offered immediate payment for those with Apple Pay according to a magazine writer who said he was on the plane. (He didn’t take the offer.)

Offering passengers money to give up a seat on an overbooked flight is one of the tools gate agents have to take care of customers and get aircraft out on time a Delta spokesman said. He wouldn’t confirm the $10000 offer.

After a 15% increase in passenger complaints this spring Transportation Department Secretary Pete Buttigieg has pressed carriers to adopt more reasonable summer schedules. Airlines and regulators have been at odds over who is most to blame for the recent disarray with carriers pointing in part to air-traffic-control staffing shortages.

The Federal Aviation Administration held a call with airlines Thursday to discuss minimizing disruptions.

“We look forward to continuing to work closely and collaboratively with the federal government to address a range of shared challenges including inclement weather not only over the holiday weekend but year-round” Airlines for America the lobbying group for major carriers said after the call.

The FAA didn’t immediately comment.

Despite the growing frustrations U.S. airline stocks haven’t done much worse than the broader market. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines Industry Index is down 24% this year compared with a 21% drop in the S&P 500 Index. But as concerns about the economy deepen investors and analysts are wary.

“Airlines have a pretty poor track record during recessions and I would not recommend the group at this point” said Rob Anderson investment research analyst at Ned Davis Research.

Limited alternatives

About 74% of leisure passengers who took or planned a flight from May 20 through Sept. 12 said they regret their choice to fly according to Atmosphere Research’s second-quarter U.S. Travel Survey. But there are limited alternatives in the U.S. for medium- to long-distance trips Harteveldt said.

On top of higher demand a persistent pilot shortage at regional carriers has led to flight reductions and cancellations. Weather a deficit of airport workers and employees out sick with COVID have also snarled traffic. Delta American Airlines Group Inc. United Airlines Holdings Inc. Southwest Airlines Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. have pared their summer schedules to try to smooth out bumps.

Airline seat capacity remains about 7% below 2019 while demand this weekend will reach 93% of pre-pandemic levels according Cirium data cited in the DePaul report. With planes packed that means travelers on canceled flights could have trouble securing another seat.

“The difference with this holiday lies in the sheer magnitude of the travel volumes” said Joseph Schwieterman who authored the DePaul report. “If cancellation rates hit 6% industrywide as they did on certain days in the recent past the problem would likely reach crisis proportions with tens of thousands of passengers being stranded for a day or more.”

Domestic round-trip fares are up 45% from 2019 and the highest since 2018 Hopper said. Flights out of the country are averaging $1200 up 31% from before the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2pvdXJuYWxzdGFyLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMtbG92ZS1maWVsZC1yZW9wZW5zLW1haW4tcnVud2F5LWFmdGVyLTE0LW1vbnRoLXJlYnVpbGQvYXJ0aWNsZV8zYmFjNjMwNi02M2U3LTU1ZTUtOTA1NS1iNGIyZmMwMzI5MGMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dallas Love Field reopens main runway after 14-month rebuild,"Dallas Love Field reopened its primary runway Tuesday after a 14-month teardown and rebuild a project that came in four months late and irked neighbors because commercial jets had to fly closer to neighborhoods.

The airport runway project faced construction slowdowns from ice storms last winter rainy weather supply and labor shortages as well as unexpected utility work.

It's a project that likely drew the attention of Lincoln Airport officials as they ponder whether its long runway is necessary while also recognizing the need to replace its surface.

As part of a 10-year master planning process airport officials here have determined that the runway which has been rehabbed several times but never reconstructed needs to be completely rebuilt.

At almost 13000 feet long Lincoln one of the longest runways at any commercial airport in the U.S. the Journal Star reported last month.

The nearly 2½-mile-long strip of concrete and asphalt is a relic from the airport's past as an Air Force base that was home to B-47 bombers in the 1950s and '60s.

While commercial airlines and private planes don't need a runway anywhere near that long its length has always been a feather in the cap of the airport and by extension the city itself because it was able to accommodate most aircraft including the space shuttle.

But Lincoln's runway length potentially presents a problem. The Federal Aviation Administration which pays for 90% of most airport-related capital projects will only pay to reconstruct a runway long enough and wide enough to accommodate so-called ""critical"" aircraft — defined as those that have a minimum of 500 operations annually. And it only includes civilian flights in those calculations.

Love Field now has two runways to use as the airport heads into the busiest travel stretch in two years although the reconstructed runway on the Denton Drive side will get most of the commercial jet traffic. Friday is expected to be the busiest travel day of the summer with 56670 possible passengers at Love Field and 264681 at nearby DFW International Airport.

“It is no secret that this project faced many challenges from ice storms to supply and labor shortages stemming from the pandemic” Love Field director of aviation Mark Duebner said in a statement. “But we are extremely grateful to our partners and construction teams for joining us in our commitment to ensure the operational safety and efficiency of the Dallas Love Field airfield.

“And to our community members we appreciate your patience during the duration of this project.”

Love Field is the only airport in North Texas served by Southwest Airlines which is headquartered next to the reopened runway on Denton Drive. Southwest has more than 10000 flights scheduled to take off and land at Love Field or about 345 a day.

The 20-gate airport also is served by Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines along with hundreds of charter and private aviation flights because of Love Field’s close proximity to downtown.

The 8800-foot Denton Drive runway is primarily used by commercial airlines to reduce noise for neighborhoods on the other side of the airport.

It was built in 1990 with concrete that was projected to have a 20-year lifespan. But the airport has seen major increases in traffic with changes to the Wright Amendment over the past two decades that greatly enhanced landings and takeoffs at Love Field.

The $141 million project was financed with Federal Aviation Administration grants and facility fees paid by travelers.

Love Field only uses two parallel runways during the busiest of times such as those following a storm.

Since the construction started Love Field has had one of the worst on-time arrival rates for a major airport in the country just 69% between April 2021 and April 2022 according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That compares with 78% for all airports and 75% between April 2018 and 2019 at Love Field.

Runways such as those at Love Field are thicker than traditional roads but face the same kind of wear and tear from potholes cracks and other defects caused by weather and the force of 70- to 80-ton jets landing hundreds of times a day. The runways sometimes get refinished but every two decades need complete reconstruction. For Love Field it had been more than 30 years since the last rebuild.

The runway was set to be rebuilt in 2020 which would have been convenient during the decline in traffic from the COVID-19 pandemic. But financial uncertainty with the city which owns the airport prevented the project from happening for about a year."

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

facility exit and re-configuration costs of $10.0 million. In 2023 transfers and closures of targeted manufacturing sites including Fort Worth Texas

and Cheraw South Carolina as previously announced in March 2023 resulted in accelerated depreciation of production equipment of $17.0 million

and non-cash asset write-downs of $42.2 million (predominantly tooling raw materials and WIP).











3 Strategic Sourcing & Operational Excellence costs in 2023 primarily relate to third-party consultant fees to provide expertise in identifying and

quantifying opportunities to source in a more integrated manner and re-design in-plant operations following footprint rationalization developing

a detailed program and related governance and assisting the Company with the implementation of actions necessary to achieve the related objectives.

(A screenshot from a Starbucks ad.) A screenshot from a Starbucks ad.

At a local parking lot you push a button to get your ticket.

The ticket emerges and a voice says: ""Take the ticket.""

It's a female voice attempting to be as erotically alluring as possible. It's a robot female voice of course and it always makes me wonder why this parking lot believes it should offer an erotic experience.

Yet robot voices have become part of our lives. Who hasn't thanked Siri at least once when she's answered a question or found the very song we just asked for?

But we still like respect and trust other humans right? Even if at times it seems we have ill-disguised contempt for most of them.

I fear the emergence of robots may have permanently changed us.

I was moved you see by the tale of a Starbucks barista called Drey.

Her location had plumbing problems. She tried to tell customers who rolled up to the drive-thru that it was closed. She tried to tell them again when they offered disbelief.

Then as she claimed on TikTok she tried something a little different. She put on a robot voice.

It went like this: ""Sorry. Our location is now closed."" (Please imagine Siri saying it.)

You might imagine people would ignore this roll up and shout their orders impatiently. But no. Drey insists: ""And they roll right through. I was like…wait a minute this shit works let's try it again.""

She did. It worked again.

And then Drey offered a startling insight into the psychological trigger of this interaction: ""No rebuttals no nothing you know why? Cause you can't argue with a robot.""

Anyone who has screamed down the phone at a customer service robot knows this. Yet still we scream. We're frustrated and perhaps in our inner depths we hope that some human any human may overhear our screaming and come to our aid.

But if you roll up to a Starbucks and a robot tells you it's closed you make the assumption that there's no point screaming. The robot must be right.

Because robots are unfeeling unresponsive and uncomprehending but they're never wrong. Or at least we're conditioned to believe they are.

So we trust their (supposed) objectivity in a way that we can never trust any human's sincerity.

They're taking over anyway so what's the point of arguing?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL3N0YXJidWNrcy0yLXJlZC1mbGFncy10by1leHBsYWluLXRoZS00MC1kZWNsaW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks: 2 Red Flags to Explain The 40% Decline,"Starbucks is sliding for a reason.

The stock market is volatile dragging share prices down across the board. But don't let that become an excuse; some stocks are falling for a reason.

That might include coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX -0.55%); its share prices have fallen nearly 40% from highs over the past year.

There's no arguing the brand power that Starbucks has but investors should keep an eye on these two potential problems for the company.

1. Leadership uncertainty

Starbucks is a multidecade growth story but it isn't without ups and downs. Howard Schultz took over the company in the late 1980s when there were just 20 stores and he grew the company into a juggernaut with 2500 locations when he first stepped down in 2000.

However he returned to the role during the financial crisis in 2008 to rescue the company and lead it to its next growth phase before stepping down again in 2017.

After former CEO Kevin Johnson left the position this past April Schultz was again thrust back into the CEO role. Starbucks is looking for its next CEO while Schultz serves in the interim.

He's been there every time Starbucks has run into trouble over the decades but Schultz is now 68 and there might not be much time left for him to lead the company.

Investors will soon have unproven leadership at Starbucks. The restaurant business is notoriously competitive and while Starbucks is a powerful brand that might function just fine without Schultz it's an unknown right now. Uncertainty is frowned upon in bear markets.

2. Unions are gaining momentum

The mounting problem of labor unions is adding more questions for investors to ponder. Roughly 70 stores have unionized across 25 states with 225 more petitioning for votes just six months after the first store a location in New York became the first to form a union.

Unions can dramatically increase business operating costs; union members cost companies 40% more than non-union workers in 2021 according to Statista.

Howard Schultz has campaigned and met with Starbucks workers to try to discourage unionization. The next CEO will have to deal with this challenge potentially as it swells to a head.

Such an increase in operating costs across the company could force dramatic price increases and could put Starbucks at a disadvantage against non-unionized competitors.

Here's the bottom line

No company goes decades without challenges; it's the businesses that overcome adversity that become great long-term investments and Starbucks has answered the bell before.

The stock's decline has put shares at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 20 well below its median P/E of 30 over the past decade.

A bear market will contribute to that but Starbucks' drop seems to go beyond Wall Street. Starbucks could navigate these rough waters come out stronger than ever and reward investors with excellent returns from a depressed valuation.

But these things could take time to settle and Starbucks could remain a volatile stock in the meantime. Don't hurry to buy shares; patience could pay in this situation.

Simpson said the next steps are for the employees to work toward negotiating a contract.

“I’ve been watching the campaign all over the United States for awhile. So I wanted to get involved"" said Ash Macomber a Starbucks Supervisor at the store.

In Biddeford employees at the Alfred Street Starbucks are rallying Saturday for support in their efforts to unionize.

They would become the first store in the state to do so.

“Pay is our number one concern right now"" said Macomber. ""We want a set reliable schedule. We want to have better benefits that are accessible to all partners and safe to use.”

“The bottom line is it gives you empowerment in the work place you don’t have otherwise"" said Doug Born President of the Southern Maine Labor Council.

Employees claim there has been push back from their store about forming a union.

""All people are looking for is a voice at the table"" said Jason Schedlock an organizer for the Laborers Union. ""When management pushes back on that. We think that’s for a reason.”

“There’s a lot of union busting things that were going on"" said Macomber. “There were a lot of rumors that weren’t really true about unions. Basically referring to us as a third party. Other things like we can’t transfer stores or borrow partners from other stores which isn’t true.”

A representative with Starbucks told CBS 13 ""we unequivocally support our partner's voice to be heard"" in response to Saturday's rally.

They also say they disagree with the term ""union busting.""

Saying that the people who spoke with employees were the store's local leadership team.

They argue that they encourage workers to do their own research on unions and participate in the decision to unionize.

“Right now we just felt like we were essential workers one day and disposable the next"" said Macomber.

Starbucks workers expect to find out the result of their vote to form a union on July 14th."

More about St. Vincent-St. Mary

In 1972 St. Mary High School merged with St. Vincent High School to create St. Vincent-St. Mary. The Irish compete as an independent program in Division 3 Region 9. St. Vincent-St. Mary was 4-6 in the regular season last year and qualified for the playoffs for the twelfth time in thirteen years. The Irish lost to Dover 18-15 in the first round of the playoffs last season.

The football program won the state championship during the school's inaugural year in 1972. The Irish have won a total of six state titles including consecutive championships in 1981-82 and 2012-13. Parris Campbell and Dante Booker were teammates on the latest state title teams.

Across all sports St. Vincent-St. Mary has won 34 OHSAA-sponsored state championships. The boys' basketball team won a state title in 2022 and leads the way with 11 titles. Other programs with multiple state championships are baseball boys’ track girls’ basketball girls’ cross country and softball.

LeBron James football player

Yes LeBron James is known for his exploits on the basketball court. However one of the greatest cagers in the world also played three years of football for St. Vincent-St. Mary's. Not only did James play he earned All-Ohio honors as a sophomore. During his junior year the Irish made it to the final four of the state football playoffs.

Since 2003 the best wide receiver for St. Vincent-St. Mary has earned the LeBron James Best Wide Receiver Award.

Many have wondered about James' ceiling in football. He was recruited by some Division I programs and might have had the talent to play in the NFL. During the NBA's lockout in 2011 contracts were offered to James by the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks.

How dominant would the 6-foot-8 250-pound tight end have been in the NFL? Something to ponder. Then again his basketball career turned out to be fairly decent.

Another standout on the basketball court for St. Vincent-St. Mary was Columbus native Malaki Branham. This talented Irish star played for the Buckeyes and shined during the latter part of his freshman season.

The San Antonio Spurs selected Branham with the 20th pick of the 2022 NBA draft.

Cistone coaching legacy

John Cistone made his mark on Akron. He was a graduate of St. Vincent and an All-District fullback. Cistone was hired by St. Vincent High School in December of 1964. During his 32 seasons as head coach of the Irish the Hall of Fame coach won four state championships and 207 games.

In 1993 the school's football stadium was named in Cistone's honor. The name of the legendary coach is also bestowed upon the annual award presented to the Irish's defensive MVP.

Today the Cistone name is back in charge of Irish football. Following the conclusion of the 2021 season Terry Cistone was hired as head coach of the Irish. Following in his dad's footsteps is not lost on St. Vincent-St. Mary's latest coach.

“I cannot begin to tell you how honored and excited I am to be named head football coach at St. Vincent-St. Mary” Cistone shared in a school press release.

The younger Cistone head coach is also a graduate of the Catholic high school and was on his dad's staff during the championship runs of 1981 and 1982.

Other famous alumni

In addition to the nine Irish who have gone on to play football at Ohio State there are many other alumni from St. Vincent-St. Mary who have achieved success in the sports world and elsewhere including:

Ohio State's official rosters did not list players’ high schools before 1970.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGV0aW1lc2hlcmFsZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA3LzAzL3N0LWNsYWlyLWZsYXRzLXN0YXRlLXdpbGRsaWZlLWFyZWEtaGVscHMtY29uc2VydmF0aW9uaXN0cy1yZXNlYXJjaC1kZWNsaW5pbmctYmxhY2stdGVybi83NzU0MzQ2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Clair Flats State Wildlife Area provides refuge and research opportunities for declining water bird,"Erin Rowan and Ava Landgraf were on a mission.

Rowan a Michigan conservation manager with Audubon Great Lakes and Landgraf a research coordinator for Detroit Audubon scanned the water from their boat Thursday on the marshes of Harsens Island for black tern nests.

""There's a chick!"" Rowan said holding up her binoculars.

She jumped out of the boat trudging through the water in waist-high waders. Landgraf followed after her and they searched through the floating mats formed by dead vegetation for the nest.

""I got it!""

Landgraf waded back to the boat a tiny fluffy brown chick cradled in her hand.

Rowan attached a tiny stainless steel band and another pink band around the chick's legs and weighed it while Landgraf recorded the chick's information. When they were done Landgraf returned to the water to gently deposit the chick back in its nest.

Studying the Black Tern

Rowan and Landgraf were banding birds as a part of a larger statewide effort to study the reasons for the black tern's population decline. Once conservation partners understand why the black tern population is dwindling they can identify conservation practices to protect the bird.

Rowan said the St. Clair Flats State Wildlife Area has one of the largest colonies of nesting black terns in the state making it the perfect area to study the migratory bird. The birds returns to its breeding grounds in Michigan and North America in the summer after spending the winter in the coastal areas of Central and South America.

The bird's population has rebounded this summer after several years of high water from 2018 to 2020 Rowan said. High water floods the vegetation black terns need to nest on.

The bird is a state wildlife action plan focal species.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources' wildlife action plans uses conservation partners to identify conservation priorities and goals for the 10-year period of 2015 to 2025. Breaking down the action plans by habitat they identify priority species within those habitats needed actions and connections to other Michigan wildlife conservation and restoration plans.

St. Clair Flats State Wildlife Area is also one of 55 black tern historic breeding sites currently undergoing population surveys by state conservation partners. After further study conservation partners will develop a conservation action plan for four or five of the sites Rowan said.

The black tern is also a Michigan species of special concern which indicates a species is declining in the state. While the species is not protected by law they need protection to prevent them from becoming threatened or endangered.

Rowan said between 1966 and 2019 the Michigan population of Black Terns decreased by 98%.

Black terns are important to protect because they are strong indicators of a habitat quality Rowan said. The birds are sensitive to changes in water quality invasive species and changing water levels giving researchers a good indicator of whether a habitat is healthy.

Rowan said the bird banding program began in 2013 and is a partnership between Audubon Great Lakes Detroit Audubon and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and is meant for chicks and adults.

If a banded bird is recaptured researchers can learn where and when the bird was banded which helps researchers determine population and the survival rate of adult black terns Rowan said.

Conservation partners from the bird banding program also began NanoTagging chicks in 2019 with funding from the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Joint Venture.

The lightweight NanoTags send out radio signals that can be picked up by Motus Towers stationed in other areas of the black tern's migration route. When a tower picks up a bird's signal it records the bird's location and how long it stays in the area giving researchers a better understanding of birds' migration routes and how many chicks survive to adulthood.

Since 2013 partners have banded more than 700 birds and recaptured 35 Rowan said.

How local residents can help protect and study the black tern

Rowan said residents should be mindful of nesting birds when out boating. Black terns like to nest on the mats formed by dead bulrush and cattails. A large wave could flip over nests so boaters should avoid large clumps of vegetation or keep a low wake when passing them.

Residents can also find volunteer opportunities for the statewide black tern population survey as well as other volunteer opportunities with Audubon Great Lakes and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources at MI Birds. Visit their website at gl.audubon.org/conservation/bird-friendly-communities/mi-birds their Facebook page at MIBirdspage their Instagram at mibirdspage or their Twitter at birds_mi.

Birders and wildlife photographers can also submit their black tern sightings to eBirds a data recording service that allows birders to record their findings and shares that information with conservation researchers.

Retired U.S. Army Col. William Pruitt 102 and Edward Trester 95 held up their Congressional Gold Medals in front of the crowd at the St. Johns County Auditorium on Thursday night.

Both risked their lives by serving in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II.

Around Anastasia Island:Local men to receive Congressional Gold Medals

'This is hallowed ground':Ceremony at St. Augustine National Cemetery marks Memorial Day

Merchant mariners bring supplies to worldwide ports and can be called upon to serve during emergencies and war according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Close to 250000 merchant mariners served as part of the U.S. military during WWII taking not only supplies but also armed forces to foreign countries.

""Roughly 4% of those who served were killed a higher casualty rate than that of any of the American military services during World War II. … Though they did not see combat mariners risked their lives supplying the various branches of the armed forces and joint operations with the tools needed to win the war"" according to The National WWII Museum in New Orleans.

Congress passed and then-President Donald Trump signed the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act in 2020 to honor them for their service.

The Congressional Gold Medal will be displayed at the American Merchant Marine Museum in Kings Point New York and surviving merchant mariners will receive a bronze replica of the award according to the Department of Defense.

The U.S. Capitol hosted a ceremony in May with WWII merchant mariners present.

But Trester and Pruitt both St. Johns County residents chose to receive their awards in front of their hometown crowd on Thursday surrounded by family friends neighbors and other supporters including elected officials and fellow veterans.

Congressman Mike Waltz a combat veteran and former Green Beret presented the medals.

""A quarter million of (merchant mariners) stepped up in our time of need to go into those ships in the frigid Atlantic often completely unarmed when Hitler had a strategy of starving Europe starving Britain winning the battle of Britain by what? By sinking those ships and by sinking so many of those ships that Britain and the United States would just throw up their hands"" Waltz said.

Waltz saluted Pruitt and Trester and thanked them for their service.

The Congressional Gold Medal is the top honor given by the U.S. Congress.

""We do not give out many Congressional Gold Medals"" Waltz said. ""And it is really my honor to give it to these two gentlemen.""

'Too few people know'

Trester was 17 when WWII was ""raging"" and he wanted to do something to help he said.

Somewhat of a brash young kid he quit high school and went down to a U.S. Navy recruiting office in Brooklyn New York he said. The man told him to go back to school.

But he went to a Merchant Marine office and came away with paperwork for his parents to sign.

After a tough conversation with his dad he walked away with his parents' blessings. He was quickly sent to training and then assigned a liberty ship he said.

""As I was walking down the dock to join the ship I noticed they were loading bombs into the hull of the ship"" he said.

He recalled on a trip to a North African port seeing ships ""as far as your eye could see"" and two ships were hit with torpedoes in the convoy he said.

Trester stayed in the Merchant Marine until around 1950.

Following that he worked for MetLife in New York City and in the late '70s headed a district office for the firm in Jacksonville.

Trester co-founded the St. Augustine Jazz Society which awards music scholarship to high school students. His longtime friend Lorri Gill who sings in his jazz band accompanied him at the ceremony.

""I feel very proud and very honored … to be recognized because the merchant service over the years has never really been recognized by our government and too few people know about the Merchant Marine"" Trester said.

Crossing the Atlantic

Pruitt's story began in Alabama where he was born and raised. After graduating from high school he worked for the Department of Defense in Birmingham Alabama and went into the Merchant Marine in 1942.

""I crossed the Atlantic four round-trips on the way to the Mediterranean Sea"" he said.

The journeys carried tanks personnel munitions and other supplies for the European and North African theaters according to a biography provided by his daughter Dinah.

Pruitt served as a purser handling customs signing people aboard running ship stores and paying the crew he said. He reached the rank of lieutenant junior grade.

He came to St. Augustine in 1950 to work with the state's Military Department and was a Florida National Guard member according to his biography. He reached the rank of full colonel after becoming the United States Property and Fiscal Officer for the state and he retired on May 31 1980.

Pruitt remained involved in the community after retiring including serving on the advisory board for Flagler College at its creation.

He thanked everyone in the crowd for celebrating his award.

""I have so very very many friends and they've made my life in St. Augustine the last 72 years wonderful these citizens of St. Augustine and St. Johns County"" he said.

Waiting for recognition

After the war the Merchant Marine still transported men and supplies for the occupation of Japan according to the National WWII Museum.

Despite their war and post-war efforts ""The Department of Defense maintained that mariners did not qualify as veterans not because their duties were not perilous but because they did not meet its criteria based upon training and the organization of the service.

""In 1988 however a U.S. District Judge ruled that the Department of Defense’s views were arbitrary and unfair prompting recognition of mariners who served in specific defense capabilities between 1941-1945 as veterans and eligible for GI Bill benefits"" according to The National WWII Museum.

Waltz said the merchant mariners were in many ways forgotten over the last 70 years.

""And things that their Navy brothers and sisters got automatically and men in women in uniform got like the GI bill in 1944 the Merchant Marine did not get then and that outrage has never been corrected"" he said. ""They never received it. It wasn't until 1988 that they finally received VA benefits.""

Waltz said he was honored to help get Trester and Pruitt and other merchant mariners during that era the recognition they deserve.

""To you two gentlemen we will never forget"" Waltz said.

'Eternally grateful'

One by one officials came forward to honor the two men on Thursday. They sat Pruitt in a wheelchair and Trester on a chair next to him in front of a nearly packed auditorium room.

During the speeches St. Augustine Beach Commissioner Dylan Rumrell called the men ""national treasures.""

Among the officials in the audience were members of the Veterans Council of St. Johns County which hosted the event as well as State Rep. Cyndi Stevenson and officials representing Congressman John Rutherford Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott and State Rep. Paul Renner.

""I think often as an elected official of the privilege that we have to choose our own representatives and that we should very well work to be worthy of the sacrifices that have happened over hundreds of years here"" Stevenson said. ""But to think it was a young 17-year-old man and volunteers like him who were the thin line that held our success together for WWII … I am eternally grateful."""

ith its sleek glass facades and Lego-like design it would look right at home on the grounds of an elite major university. But in truth the sprawling new building known as “Communiversity” graces the campus East Mississippi Community College (EMCC) described by its president as “a small rural” school in the town of Scooba in Mississippi’s Golden Triangle. Built at a cost of $42 million and also known as the Center for Manufacturing Technology Excellence 2.0 it serves as a bold symbol of the region’s commitment to advanced manufacturing.

Major manufacturers that have landed in the Golden Triangle the loosely defined economic region driven by the trio of Starkville Columbus and West Point include Yokohama Tire Paccar Steel Dynamics Airbus Aurora Flight Sciences and International Paper according to Dr. Scott Alsobrooks EMCC’s president. Their influence has driven a post-NAFTA renewal of regional manufacturing that’s been likened to a renaissance. The handsome new facility in Scooba is all about sustaining that surge Alsobrooks says.

“We’ve got to keep the talent pipeline going” he explains. “It’s up to us to heighten awareness and to bring in state-of-the-art training programs and to get more young people into advanced manufacturing and its auxiliary fields that are needed to run advanced manufacturing plants. And that extends” he says “into IoT and those professions.”

The Appalachian Regional Commission which invested $10.7 million toward Communiversity led a coalition of supporters that included the state legislature and the eastern counties of Clay Lowndes and Oktibbeha. Opened in the summer of 2019 the 135000-sq.-ft. facility features laboratory space a robotics lab 21 high-bay training stations for advanced machining technology incubation bays for startups and meeting and administration space. Composites research performed in conjunction with nearby Mississippi State University has led to a training arrangement with Aurora a division of Boeing one of EMCC’s growing list of workforce development partners.

As a potentially lucrative career with multiple pathways to entry advanced manufacturing says Alsobrooks continues to “fly under the radar” among potential workers a tendency that EMCC is addressing head on. Communiversity’s museum-like “Imagination Center” is open to the public and features displays from Aurora and other regional manufacturers.

“Young people” he says “still don’t know of the fabulous careers that are available in advanced manufacturing. We can bring them in and not only show them the educational facilities but also show them the products that are built. The Imagination Center can open their minds and help them to imagine career possibilities in manufacturing in our area and maybe get them to choose some of these really cool degree programs and short-term training programs we have that help prepare them to go into the world of manufacturing. It’s really the hot thing in jobs.”

Innovations such as these have landed EMCC on the Aspen Institute’s list of Top 150 Community Colleges in the nation five times since 2015. Alsobrooks says that 75% of EMCC’s student population of about 3500 qualifies for and receives financial aid.

“Some of our students come from poverty” he acknowledges. “And our goal is to help them out of that low end low skill low wage or no job situation. Help them into a situation where they can support a family. That’s what we’re all about. Trying to move them in that direction. Move them up and elevate them.”

Keeping the Goods Flowing

Just below the state line with Tennessee a cluster of counties in northern Mississippi rests within the gravitational pull of Memphis and its massive logistics hub. The concomitant growth of distribution centers leveraging Mississippi’s lower operating costs is generating tremendous demand in the region for workers with the training to keep those increasingly high-tech facilities up and running.

“We’re the distribution capital of the United States” says Dwayne Casey associate vice president for workforce solutions and career and technical education at Northwest Mississippi Community College which has locations in Senatobia Oxford and DeSoto County. “The biggest skillsets these companies are looking for” he says “are those of industrial maintenance technicians.”

“You come out of our program and you can do very very well.”

— Dwayne Casey Northwest Mississippi Community College

Winchester Ammunition William-Sonoma and Helen of Troy are among the major brands with logistics operations in DeSoto County. The DeSoto campus’s Industrial Electronic Engineering and Technology program a hybrid apprenticeship model is designed to serve the needs of employers such as those and to jump start careers in northern Mississippi.

“It’s a two-year associates degree” Casey says. “First semester they are with us seven hours a day Monday through Friday. If they have good grades and good attendance they interview with our employer partners and then for the next three semesters they go to school Monday Wednesday Friday and intern with the company on Tuesdays and Thursdays.”

The companies guarantee interns 16 hours a week in an industrial maintenance position and pay them at least $16 an hour. It is says Casey “the best possible setup and it’s worked very well for our employers and for our students. We have some great equipment and instructors” he says “but you can’t possibly teach them everything in the classroom alone.” The school he says has plans to offer a similar program in industrial automation. It also is adding programs in trucking and diesel technology.

“Right now” he says “we have students coming out of our electronic engineering program making $30 an hour to start. That’s very good money here in northern Mississippi. These jobs are in high demand. You come out of our program” says Casey “and you can do very very well.”

Enviva Partnership

In the spring of 2022 Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College’s George County Center some 40 miles north of Pascagoula launched a workforce development program with Maryland-based Enviva which recently opened its second of three planned biomass pellet facilities in Mississippi. The $140 million plant in Lucedale is producing some 750000 metric tons of wood pellets a year. The pellets are taken by rail to the Port of Pascagoula from which they are shipped around the world as a renewable energy source.

The new program offered in partnership with Accelerate MS the state’s lead office for workforce development strategy and coordination provides training to current and prospective Enviva employees. Running 18 weeks it is designed to enhance safety awareness and preparedness strengthen on-the-job skills and to promote continuous improvement and advancement.

“Through this workforce training initiative these students will be prepared for a career in their hometown with an outstanding company” says MGCCC president Mary S. Graham.

Enviva associates at the company’s new Lucedale plant can receive paid time off to attend training classes twice a week at the George County campus. Areas of instruction include critical plant continuity functions including transmitter operations hydraulics and pneumatics chain belt tension and alignment and preventative maintenance project training. Participants emerge from the program with certificates of completion.

“Successful workforce development happens when we build and nurture collaborative partnerships between Mississippi employers and community colleges like MGCCC that so ably serve our state” said Ryan Miller Executive Director of Accelerate MS. “Employee centered investment is a hallmark of great companies and I’m appreciative that Enviva has shown such a strong commitment to its employees and to George County as a whole.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s been over two years since T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint went through April of 2020 including its network stores assets spectrum towers and customers.

T-Mobile has decommissioned Sprint’s wireless spectrum from its 3G and LTE networks to accelerate add bandwidth and accelerate the coverage of its nationwide 5G network. With 66.7 million subscribers before the merger T-Mobile now has over 109 million subscribers as of Q1 ‘22 (Source) and is the number 2 carrier in the US. (Verizon has the most subscribers: 143 million in Q1 22 [Source]) launch its 5G home broadband service across areas of the rural United States.

My local Sprint store was one of the ones converted to a T-Mobile showroom store (Aug 2020)

T-Mobile faced many obstacles and pushback from regulators and critics who opposed the merger for anti-competitive decisions that potentially harmed consumers and threatened jobs and businesses (third-party dealers).

Sprint does bring back memories to me personally. I was a Sprint customer in the years leading up to an iPhone revolution and recall to days of push to talk a wider variety of phones in the showrooms and the days when CDMA 3G download speeds were a blazing fast 2.7Mbps. There are too many factors to pinpoint a single event in its history that could have caused Sprint’s downfall.

Goodbye Sprint it was nice knowing you.

It’s basically a slightly cheaper slightly worse version of the Samsung Galaxy A13 5G that only works on T-Mobile. But it’s $200 and at that price it’s about the best phone you can get.

For a $200 phone the 30 XE 5G’s day-to-day performance is snappier than I expected. That’s also a low price to pay for 5G service on T-Mobile’s very good network. These things make it easier to forgive the 30 XE’s weak points because it does what a good budget phone should: it just works. If you really want 5G are paying full price and need to keep costs down it’s the best you’re going to get on T-Mobile. But if you’re eligible for one of your carrier’s “free” phone offers there’s certainly a better option among them.

The TCL 30 XE uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor and 4GB of RAM which is on the low side even by budget phone standards. Even so jumping from app to app is quick. It’s not perfect — there are infrequent but noticeable hesitations here and there. As I go about my scrolling and typing I generally just don’t notice the 30 XE getting in my way. The phone’s 64GB of built-in storage is definitely on the low side so budget an extra $15–25 for a microSD card.

Battery life is another bright spot. The 30 XE’s 4500mAh battery isn’t the biggest by any means but overall the device is fairly power-efficient. Light users who spend the majority of their time on Wi-Fi will get very good performance — well into a second day on one charge. It should also stand up to heavier use but I’d only expect to get through a single day.

Unfortunately that healthy battery stamina is likely thanks to the relatively dim low-resolution screen. The 30 XE offers a 6.52-inch LCD screen which would be fine — LCDs have poor contrast compared to their pricier OLED counterparts but you’re not going to find an OLED screen on a $200 phone — but it happens to be a bad LCD. For starters it’s just 720p resolution which is really not enough for a screen this big. Icons and images look a little rough around the edges. It’s also just not very bright. Using it next to a window on a mostly overcast day sent the automatic brightness to 100 percent just to keep the screen comfortably visible.

The TCL 30 XE’s 6.5-inch screen offers a smooth 90Hz refresh rate but it’s dim and only 720p.

That said the screen’s 90Hz refresh rate is noticeably smoother than the standard 60Hz. It contributes to the phone’s overall feeling of responsiveness so it’s nice. But personally I’d rather have a screen with adequate resolution and a standard refresh rate than a smoother-scrolling but low-res panel.

For a carrier-locked device the 30 XE includes mercifully few pre-downloaded T-Mobile apps most of which can be uninstalled (or skipped altogether during setup). That was not the case with Verizon’s TCL 30 V 5G which I reviewed earlier this year. The 30 XE also supports T-Mobile’s very good mid-band Ultra Capacity 5G network which is included on all of T-Mobile’s 5G plans — also not the case at Verizon where you need a pricier unlimited plan to access the best 5G bands.

The 30 XE ships with Android 11 installed which is well behind the times given that Android 13 is just around the corner. TCL spokesperson Isabelle Braun says the phone will get an update to Android 12 but didn’t say when. The company is also promising just two years of security updates for the 30 XE. That’s not long but it’s not totally unexpected for a $200 phone unfortunately.

TCL claims the 30 XE 5G has a “triple rear camera system” but that’s being a little generous. There’s a 13-megapixel main camera 2-megapixel depth camera and a 2-megapixel macro camera. The depth camera’s only purpose is to provide more information for portrait mode (which isn’t very good) and the macro camera’s images are (predictably) low res and mediocre.

TCL claims the 30 XE has a “triple rear camera system” but that’s being a little generous

That leaves the main rear camera and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera both of which do enough to get a passing grade. In bright light they produce very saturated almost fluorescent colors. None of the filters available in the native camera app tone this down very much so that’s something you’ll have to either prefer or make peace with. This contributes to some weird-looking results in mixed lighting too.

Dim indoor lighting and very low light are challenging for the camera. Shots are often blurred due to low shutter speeds autofocus hunting noise reduction or a combination of the above. You can get usable shots of static subjects but forget about pets and kids — moving subjects in low light are a challenge for even the best smartphone cameras. Video recording is available at up to 1080 / 30p and clip quality is unremarkable.

One main camera and two low-res sensors do not a triple-camera system make.

The TCL 30 XE 5G does just what a budget phone should do: for the most part it gets out of your way. For a phone at this price its performance is snappy and that’s a major benefit if you’re looking to just live your life with as little frustration as possible from your mobile device. But if you want a little more from your phone you have some other options to consider.

The Samsung Galaxy A13 5G has very similar specs to the 30 XE 5G: the same processor and RAM same 64 GB storage with a microSD slot and a similarly sized 720p screen. It costs a bit more outright but it offers a bigger battery and a better camera. Samsung’s software is a little further from stock Android than TCL’s which means a little more clutter and pre-downloads. At the time of this writing it’s also another $0 / month option from T-Mobile if you buy it on contract. If my free upgrade were at stake I’d opt for the Samsung.

Speaking of free phones if T-Mobile is offering the OnePlus Nord N20 5G then that’s an even better option. It has a better camera an excellent OLED screen and fast charging. Though at $282 it’s basically in another price bracket if you’re paying for it outright.

Finally if you can take or leave 5G and buying an unlocked phone outright is an option then the unlocked Motorola Moto G Stylus (2022) is worth considering. You’ll get better battery life and an additional year of security updates. It’s still quite a bit pricier with a $299 MSRP but it’s almost always marked down well below that; it’s $250 at the time of this writing.

The TCL 30 XE 5G is a budget phone that will get you through your day with as little hassle as possible given the price. It’s a good fuss-free option if you’re paying full price up front and want to keep costs as low as possible. But if you’re subsidizing your purchase by signing a wireless contract then you can do better.

A special report on the rise of ‘digital amnesia’,"Last week I missed a real-life meeting because I hadn’t set a reminder on my smartphone leaving someone I’d never met before alone in a café. But on the same day I remembered the name of the actor who played Will Smith’s aunt in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 1991 (Janet Hubert). Memory is weird unpredictable and neuroscientifically not yet entirely understood. When memory lapses like mine happen (which they do a lot) it feels both easy and logical to blame the technology we’ve so recently adopted. Does having more memory in our pockets mean there’s less in our heads? Am I losing my ability to remember things – from appointments to what I was about to do next – because I expect my phone to do it for me? Before smartphones our heads would have held a cache of phone numbers and our memories would contain a cognitive map built up over time which would allow us to navigate – for smartphone users that is no longer true.

Our brains and our smartphones form a complex web of interactions: the smartphonification of life has been rising since the mid 2000s but was accelerated by the pandemic as was internet use in general. Prolonged periods of stress isolation and exhaustion – common themes since March 2020 – are well known for their impact on memory. Of those surveyed by memory researcher Catherine Loveday in 2021 80% felt that their memories were worse than before the pandemic. We are – still – shattered not just by Covid-19 but also by the miserable national and global news cycle. Many of us self-soothe with distractions like social media. Meanwhile endless scrolling can at times create its own distress and phone notifications and self interrupting to check for them also seem to affect what how and if we remember.

So what happens when we outsource part of our memory to an external device? Does it enable us to squeeze more and more out of life because we aren’t as reliant on our fallible brains to cue things up for us? Are we so reliant on smartphones that they will ultimately change how our memories work (sometimes called digital amnesia)? Or do we just occasionally miss stuff when we don’t remember the reminders?

Endless scrolling can at times create its own distress and phone notifications seem to affect what we remember

Neuroscientists are divided. Chris Bird is professor of cognitive neuroscience in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex and runs research by the Episodic Memory Group. “We have always offloaded things into external devices like writing down notes and that’s enabled us to have more complex lives” he says. “I don’t have a problem with using external devices to augment our thought processes or memory processes. We’re doing it more but that frees up time to concentrate focus on and remember other things.” He thinks that the kind of things we use our phones to remember are for most human brains difficult to remember. “I take a photo of my parking ticket so I know when it runs out because it’s an arbitrary thing to remember. Our brains aren’t evolved to remember highly specific one-off things. Before we had devices you would have to make a quite an effort to remember the time you needed to be back at your car.”

Professor Oliver Hardt who studies the neurobiology of memory and forgetting at McGill University in Montreal is much more cautious. “Once you stop using your memory it will get worse which makes you use your devices even more” he says. “We use them for everything. If you go to a website for a recipe you press a button and it sends the ingredient list to your smartphone. It’s very convenient but convenience has a price. It’s good for you to do certain things in your head.”

Hardt is not keen on our reliance on GPS. “We can predict that prolonged use of GPS likely will reduce grey matter density in the hippocampus. Reduced grey matter density in this brain area goes along with a variety of symptoms such as increased risk for depression and other psychopathologies but also certain forms of dementia. GPS-based navigational systems don’t require you to form a complex geographic map. Instead they just tell you orientations like ‘Turn left at next light.’ These are very simple behavioural responses (here: turn left) at a certain stimulus (here: traffic light). These kinds of spatial behaviours do not engage the hippocampus very much unlike those spatial strategies that require the knowledge of a geographic map in which you can locate any point coming from any direction and which requires [cognitively] complex computations. When exploring the spatial capacities of people who have been using GPS for a very long time they show impairments in spatial memory abilities that require the hippocampus. Map reading is hard and that’s why we give it away to devices so easily. But hard things are good for you because they engage cognitive processes and brain structures that have other effects on your general cognitive functioning.”

Map reading is hard and that’s why we give it away to devices so easily. But hard things are good for you

Hardt doesn’t have data yet but believes “the cost of this might be an enormous increase in dementia. The less you use that mind of yours the less you use the systems that are responsible for complicated things like episodic memories or cognitive flexibility the more likely it is to develop dementia. There are studies showing that for example it is really hard to get dementia when you are a university professor and the reason is not that these people are smarter – it’s that until old age they are habitually engaged in tasks that are very mentally demanding.” (Other scientists disagree – Daniel Schacter a Harvard psychologist who wrote the seminal Seven Sins Of Memory: How The Mind Forgets and Remembers thinks effects from things like GPS are “task specific” only.)

While smartphones can obviously open up whole new vistas of knowledge they can also drag us away from the present moment like a beautiful day unexperienced because you’re head down WhatsApping. When we’re not attending to an experience we are less likely to recall it properly and fewer recalled experiences could even limit our capacity to have new ideas and being creative. As the renowned neuroscientist and memory researcher Wendy Suzuki recently put it on the Huberman Lab neuroscience podcast “If we can’t remember what we’ve done the information we’ve learned and the events of our lives it changes us… [The part of the brain which remembers] really defines our personal histories. It defines who we are.”

Catherine Price science writer and author of How to Break Up With Your Phone concurs. “What we pay attention to in the moment adds up to our life” she says. “Our brains cannot multitask. We think we can. But any moment where multitasking seems successful it’s because one of those tasks was not cognitively demanding like you can fold laundry and listen to the radio. If you’re paying attention to your phone you’re not paying attention to anything else. That might seem like a throwaway observation but it’s actually deeply profound. Because you will only remember the things you pay attention to. If you’re not paying attention you’re literally not going to have a memory of it to remember.”

If you’re not paying attention you’re literally not going to have a memory of it to remember

The Cambridge neuroscientist Barbara Sahakian has evidence of this too. “In an experiment in 2010 three different groups had to complete a reading task” she says. “One group got instant messaging before it started one got instant messaging during the task and one got no instant messaging and then there was a comprehension test. What they found was that the people getting instant messages couldn’t remember what they just read.”

Price is much more worried about what being perpetually distracted by our phones – termed “continual partial attention” by the tech expert Linda Stone – does to our memories than using their simpler functions. “I’m not getting distracted by my address book” she says. And she doesn’t believe smartphones free us up to do more. “Let’s be real with ourselves: how many of us are using the time afforded us by our banking app to write poetry? We just passively consume crap on Instagram.” Price is from Philadelphia. “What would have happened if Benjamin Franklin had had Twitter? Would he have been on Twitter all the time? Would he have made his inventions and breakthroughs?

“I became really interested in whether the constant distractions caused by our devices might be impacting our ability to actually not just accumulate memories to begin with but transfer them into long-term storage in a way that might impede our ability to think deep and interesting thoughts” she says. “One of the things that impedes our brain’s ability to transfer memories from short- to long-term storage is distraction. If you get distracted in the middle of it” – by a notification or by the overwhelming urge to pick up your phone – “you’re not actually going to have the physical changes take place that are required to store that memory.”

It’s impossible to know for sure because no one measured our level of intellectual creativity before smartphones took off but Price thinks smartphone over-use could be harming our ability to be insightful. “An insight is being able to connect two disparate things in your mind. But in order to have an insight and be creative you have to have a lot of raw material in your brain like you couldn’t cook a recipe if you didn’t have any ingredients: you can’t have an insight if you don’t have the material in your brain which really is long term memories.” (Her theory was backed by the 92-year-old Nobel prize-winning neuroscientist and biochemist Eric Kandel who has studied how distraction affects memory – Price bumped into him on a train and grilled him about her idea. “I’ve got a selfie of me with a giant grin and Eric looking a bit confused.”) Psychologist professor Larry Rosen co-author (with neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley) of The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World also agrees: “Constant distractions make it difficult to encode information in memory.”

You can’t have an insight if you don’t have the material in your brain

Smartphones are of course made to hijack our attention. “The apps that make money by taking our attention are designed to interrupt us” says Price. “I think of notifications as interruptions because that’s what they’re doing.”

For Oliver Hardt phones exploit our biology. “A human is a very vulnerable animal and the only reason we are not extinct is that we have a superior brain: to avoid predation and find food we have had to be really good at being attentive to our environment. Our attention can shift rapidly around and when it does everything else that was being attended to stops which is why we can’t multitask. When we focus on something it’s a survival mechanism: you’re in the savannah or the jungle and you hear a branch cracking you give your total attention to that – which is useful it causes a short stress reaction a slight arousal and activates the sympathetic nervous system. It optimises your cognitive abilities and sets the body up for fighting or flighting.” But it’s much less useful now. “Now 30000 years later we’re here with that exact brain” and every phone notification we hear is a twig snapping in the forest “simulating what was important to what we were: a frightened little animal.”

Smartphone use can even change the brain according to the ongoing ABCD study which is tracking over 10000 American children through to adulthood. “It started by examining 10-year-olds both with paper and pencil measures and an MRI and one of their most interesting early results was that there was a relationship between tech use and cortical thinning” says Larry Rosen who studies social media technology and the brain. “Young children who use more tech had a thinner cortex which is supposed to happen at an older age.” Cortical thinning is a normal part of growing up and then ageing and in much later life can be associated with degenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s as well as migraines.

Obviously the smartphone genie is out of the bottle and has run over the hills and far away. We need our smartphones to access offices attend events pay for travel and to function as tickets passes and credit cards as well as for emails calls and messages. It’s very hard not to have one. If we’re worried about what they – or the apps on them – might be doing to our memories what should we do?

Rosen discusses a number of tactics in his book. “My favourites are tech breaks” he says “where you start by doing whatever on your devices for one minute and then set an alarm for 15 minutes time. Silence your phone and place it upside down but within your view as a stimulus to tell your brain that you will have another one-minute tech break after the 15-minute alarm. Continue until you adapt to 15 minutes focus time and then increase to 20. If you can get to 60 minutes of focus time with short tech breaks before and after that’s a success.”

“If you think your memory and focus have got worse and you’re blaming things like your age your job or your kids that might be true but it’s also very likely due to the way you’re interacting with your devices” says Price who founded Screen/Life Balance to help people manage their phone use. As a science writer she’s “very much into randomly controlled trials but with phones it’s actually more of a qualitative question about personally how it’s impacting you. And it’s really easy to do your own experiment and see if it makes a difference. It’s great to have scientific evidence. But we can also intuitively know: if you practice keeping your phone away more and you notice that you feel calmer and you’re remembering more then you’ve answered your own question.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL29uZXBsdXMtbjIwLTVnLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Surprisingly good — and not just for the money,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL29uZXBsdXMtbjIwLTVnLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9vbmVwbHVzLW5vcmQtbjIwLTVn0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: The best phone under $300,"The OnePlus Nord N20 is a beautiful budget phone that looks like it costs hundreds more.

Fresh off the heels of the OnePlus 10 Pro  OnePlus has another phone targeting bargain hunters. The OnePlus Nord N20 is a $282 budget-friendly handset that has some features you usually see limited to more premium devices such as an AMOLED display and 33W fast charging. And after debuting as a T-Mobile exclusive the OnePlus Nord N20 is now available unlocked for those who want to use the phone with a carrier of their own choosing.

A beautiful housing wraps around all of that. Even though its body is plastic the Nord N20 looks like it should cost a whole lot more. The gold accents around the two big camera lenses the deep blue hue of the back and the flat sides all come together to make for something that immediately catches your eye.

In this OnePlus Nord N20 review I’ll walk you through why I think this is the best phone for those on a tight budget despite some limitations typical of cheap phones.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Price and availability

The OnePlus Nord N10 in 2020 clocked in at $299 while the OnePlus Nord N200 in 2021 came in at $239. The OnePlus Nord N20 sits right between them at $282. It comes with 128GB of storage (expandable up to 512GB) and 6GB of RAM. This is a lot of phone for less than $300.

When the Nord N20 first arrived in the U.S. You could only buy it through T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile. Availability has since expanded with the phone now available unlocked at Amazon Best Buy and the OnePlus online store. The device will be able to work with carriers who use T-Mobile's 5G network which includes Mint Mobile Google Fi Ultra Mobile and Simple Mobile.

In terms of price the OnePlus Nord compares favorably to the Moto G Stylus (2022)  which costs $299. That phone sports a stylus as the name implies but it is overall similar enough to the Nord N20 that you might consider it as an alternative.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Design

I love the OnePlus Nord N20’s design. The clean and dare I say professional aesthetic appeals to my sensibilities especially the deep blue colorway. The two large camera lenses surrounded in light gold accents draw your attention right out of the gate. The smooth plastic back has a sparkly effect to it that makes the phone almost glitter in the sun.

The flat edges also contribute to a premium look. At 2.9 inches wide the Nord N20 is easy to hold without those edges digging into your hand (unlike the iPhone 13 Pro Max that I use on a daily basis). One thing I like about plastic phones is the weight — the Nord N20 is just 6.1 ounces which feels positively light.

The OnePlus Nord N20 also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and an in-display fingerprint sensor which I love to see. The power and volume buttons all feel solid and clicky too. But this is a budget phone which means compromises. One of the most notable hardware trade-offs to me is the shoddy vibration motor which is noisy and feels cheap. You can’t have everything at this price.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Display

Measuring 6.43 inches the OnePlus Nord N20’s AMOLED display certainly impressed me even if it is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. With an FHD+ resolution content of all kinds looks great. Videos like Blade Runner 2049 and the Thor: Love and Thunder teaser trailer are vivid and vibrant even in the Nord N20’s Gentle color calibration.

Here’s what we measured for the OnePlus Nord N20’s display.

The Nord N20 easily beats the Moto G Stylus (2022) in color reproduction but both phones are right in line with each other when it comes to their max brightness. They are very visible in all but direct sunlight where it becomes extremely difficult to see them especially with sunglasses.

The Nord N20 had the lowest Delta-E color accuracy score (where 0 is perfect) compared to the Moto G Stylus (2022) and iPhone SE (2022). Both of those handsets use IPS LCDs but the Nord N20’s AMOLED panel achieves deeper blacks.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Cameras

With the OnePlus Nord N20 you get a triple rear camera setup. The 64MP main sensor does the heavy lifting but its 2MP monochrome and 2MP macro companions are dubious at best. Around front there’s a 16MP selfie shooter.

To test the OnePlus Nord N20’s cameras I used the latest Moto G Stylus. Starting outside with this photo of some books you can see that both phones produced a presentable image. To my eye the Nord N20’s shot is a tad brighter than the Moto’s but that comes at the cost of approaching overexposure. The colors still look vibrant in either picture but I think I prefer the Moto G Stylus’ photo since it doesn’t appear to have as much of an overexposure near-issue as the Nord N20.

Heading inside to photograph the same set of books on their shelf I see problems in both shots. The Nord N20’s focus is extremely soft even blurry on some of the spines. The Moto G Stylus (2022) has brightness issues making for a dim picture. I don’t think either photo is good but at least the Moto offers stronger focus. On the spine of Where the Sidewalk Ends I see the Nord getting right up to the line of overexposure again.

I headed into my basement to test both handsets in a low-light environment without their night modes. In this shot of my Mass Effect helmet the clear winner is the Moto G Stylus (2022). You can see more details of the helmet whereas the Nord N20’s image is dark and almost grim. The carbon fiber effect is not as easy to see in the Nord’s picture. Both devices struggled here but the Moto came out on top.

For this portrait of me the Nord N20 won out slightly. The Moto G Stylus (2022) produced a softer image that I do not like despite its pleasant bokeh effect. The Nord N20 has a warmer and more inviting look to it even if I don’t care for the overall shot. You can still make out my ruddy complexion while the Moto applied too much face smoothing and beauty effects making me look unnatural.

Wrapping up with the rear cameras here’s how the two phones handled those books from before but this time at night. Unsurprisingly based on its earlier low light performance the Nord N20 fell flat on its face with only one of the books being legible and discernible. The Moto G Stylus (2022)’s image is brighter but the phone struggles with blurriness and noise. However I can make out that there are five books there and I can see the red towel I put down. Both photos are atrocious but the Moto wins out again.

Finally when it comes to selfies the Nord N20 once again falls behind the Moto G Stylus (2022). The former ironed out the lines and wrinkles in my face making me look unnaturally smooth. However you can more clearly see the blue of my eyes.

The Moto’s selfie meanwhile is much truer to life. It captured the ruddiness of my face and beard even if it has harsher shadows than the Nord. The background is also warmer like with the red car behind me.

Since the Nord N20 comes equipped with macro and monochrome sensors I captured a few samples. The macro shot is bad with terrible brightness and horrible focus. I attempted this image multiple times and this is the best the phone could do.

As for the monochrome sensor there isn’t a dedicated monochrome mode on the Nord N20 so I used the B&W filter. I suspect that the sensor is merely used for “details” to aid the main camera as we’ve seen on other phones in the last five or so years.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Performance

A Snapdragon 695 serves as the Nord N20’s brains. We hadn’t gotten a phone with the Snapdragon 695 in for testing before this one so I definitely wanted to see what this chip can do. This is an octa-core system-on-chip with a max frequency of 2.2GHz and equipped with a X51 5G modem which supports sub-6GHz and mmWave. You don't get Wi-Fi 6 on this chip so that's a connectivity standard still reserved for the more expensive phones.

Here’s how the Nord N20 fared in our benchmarks.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 OnePlus Nord N20 Moto G Stylus (2022) iPhone SE (2022) CPU Snapdragon 695 Helio G88 A15 Bionic Geekbench 5 (single-core / multicore) 696 / 1995 368 / 1324 1718 / 4482 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited (FPS) 7 4 50 3DMark Wild Life Extreme Unlimited (FPS) 2 1 12

The Nord N20 smokes the Moto G Stylus (2022). And in my experience the Snapdragon 695 has far fewer performance hiccups than the Moto’s Helio G88 making the Nord N20 much more pleasant to use. But I brought out the iPhone SE (2022) to show you what performance you can get if you can spend about $140 more.

As decent as the Nord N20’s performance is it still struggles with higher-end gaming. Not only did it stumble more than once on the 3DMark benchmarks but I had to lower the settings considerably in Genshin Impact and Call of Duty: Mobile to have a playable frame rate. Simpler games like Dead Cells weren’t as taxing.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

As the name suggests the OnePlus Nord N20 sports 5G connectivity but you just get sub-6GHz support. There’s no mmWave or C-band here. T-Mobile’s sub-6 network is pretty reliable (and C-Band is not really a part of T-Mobile’s 5G setup for now) so you’re not losing out on too much with the Nord N20.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Battery life and charging

With a 4500 mAh power pack the OnePlus Nord N20 stands to last a long while on a charge. OnePlus’ flagship the OnePlus 10 Pro is one of the longest-lasting Android flagships in our best phone battery life list so I went into this Nord N20 review with high expectations. And based on our testing I wasn’t disappointed.

Here’s how long the Nord N20 lasted.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 OnePlus Nord N20 Moto G Stylus (2022 iPhone SE (2022) Battery size 4500 mAh 5000 mAh 2018 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins) 11:20 12:30 7:38 Charging 33W 10W 20W Charging percentage (15 mins) 31 10 31 Charging percentage (30 mins) 56 21 61

We test phone battery life by setting the display to 150 nits and then tasking the device to endlessly reload web pages over a 5G connection. The Nord N20 turned in a respectable result though still about an hour shy of the Moto G Stylus (2022). But at a whopping four hours longer than the iPhone SE (2022) the Nord N20 wins a gold star. It misses a spot on our best phone battery life list by just 20 minutes.

As for charging the OnePlus Nord N20 leads the best cheap phones at 33W. That blows the Moto G Stylus (2022) out of the water. Just look at how much battery percentage the Nord regained compared to the Moto — 56% versus 21% after 30 minutes. (The new Stylus charges at a measly 10W.)

A 33W charger comes included with the Nord N20 so you won’t spend any of the money you save buying a separate charger.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Software

Other than the cameras the Nord N20’s other major failing is the software. The phone comes equipped with Android 11 with Oxygen OS 11 on top. Android 11 is a great platform and Oxygen OS 11 was pretty stable in my experience but the problem here is one of timing.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Android 11 is more than a year and a half old and Android 12 has been out since last fall. I asked OnePlus to comment on its update policy for the Nord N20 and the company told me that the Nord N20 will only get to Android 12 with three years of security patches.

Phone makers had months of access to the betas in the months leading up to the Android 12’s launch. To that degree I think OnePlus should be ashamed. I didn’t think any company could do as bad with updates as Motorola but OnePlus sure tried. At least your Nord N20 will remain secure for three years.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

As for what the software can do Oxygen OS 11 sports some nice customization options and a clean look. The improvements in version 12 that we saw on the OnePlus 10 Pro will hopefully come in due time. For example I’d really like to see the Nord N20 get access to the three different dark mode options something I’m quite fond of on the 10 Pro.

OnePlus Nord N20 5G review: Verdict

For $282 the OnePlus Nord N20 is definitely the best phone for the money. Even with lackluster cameras and the shamelessly bad software update policy this phone is still a good buy if your phone budget maxes out at $300 especially now that you can buy the Nord N20 unlocked.

The Nord N20 and Moto G Stylus (2022) trade blows pretty evenly. The Nord looks and feels better not to mention the stronger performance and better display. But the battery doesn’t last quite as long (a little more than an hour shy of the Moto) and the cameras are pretty bad — I didn’t think I could see cameras worse than the Moto in 2022.

And then there’s software support. Again I didn’t think a phone maker could do as bad as Motorola but OnePlus managed to. You’re only guaranteed to get a version of Android that’s already six months old. That’s pathetic.

However if you’re strapped for cash and need a new phone then the OnePlus Nord N20 should be at the top of your list. If you have more flexibility then I’d suggest checking out the $429 iPhone SE (2022) or $449 Galaxy A53 as more fully featured alternatives. Otherwise the OnePlus Nord N20 is the phone to get when money most definitely is an object.

The decision comes following the ongoing tension between Ukraine and Russia. Take-Two’s Vice President Alan Lewis issued a statement informing the media outlets on this matter. This might be a red alert for all fans of Rockstar because this could mean they might not be able to get their hands on new content provided by the company till the decision-makers have the decision reversed.

New content won’t release in Russia Belarus after Take-Two’s latest announcement!

Industry insider and scooper Ben T on Twitter shared this massive news on his account. He informed the users about Take-Two Interactive’s latest statement.

The conflict in Europe has escalated rapidly and as some other companies have done Take-Two is following suit by no longer extending its services to Russia and Belarus.

Vice President Alan Lewis released a huge statement in the wake of a series of events. The publisher of the upcoming GTA 6 won’t continue to operate starting now in Russia and Belarus.

By immediate effect it’s suspending all “new sales installations and marketing support” in the two European nations. There won’t be any kind of involvement across their Rockstar and 2K labels in any form in these regions.

This implies that all the fans of Grand Theft Auto and just Rockstar in general living in these two countries won’t be getting any new content at all.

But that doesn’t mean there’s no hope. This is likely a response to what could be a temporary situation meaning when things improve the decision to ban operations could be flipped. Till that happens gamers have to find products from other publishers to enjoy.

Cowabunga dudes; it’s time for the official Retro Dodo Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge review!

And if you thought that was a mouthful to say then try saying it with a mouthful of pizza!

Yes our favourite heroes in a half shell are back with a brand new track. Get ready for some classic side-scrolling beat-em-up action with a mode twist.

From the first seconds of the opening sequence to the epic beatdowns with Splinter’s cane this game is a one-stop-shop for fans of the Turtles cartoons and arcade games.

Available on PS4 Switch Xbox and PC gamers can enjoy a slice of the action on any platform anytime anywhere. I’ve been playing it non-stop for a couple of weeks now so it’s time to get out my reviewing hat and dive right in!

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtlers: Shredders Revenge Review

For those of you that that don’t know anything about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles then this might all get a little confusing. Still in the interest of not judging or asking what shell you’ve been hiding inside all these years I’ll try to play nice and give you the lowdown.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are four walking talking humanoid-turtles that fight crime. They live in a sewer with a Rat called Splinter who trained them and they’re friends with a news reporter called April who doesn’t seem to find any of this weird.

The main antagonist Shredder never knows when to give up hence him getting his revenge in this latest offering in the long line of Turtles titles.

That last part was real fun to say!

In this latest game Shredder has concocted another diabolical scheme and brought his minions along to cause havoc for the Turtles.

Bebop Rocksteady and a whole bunch of cronies are on hand to steal gear run amok and provide the Turtles with a chance to pull out some gnarly moves.

In terms of sticking true to the franchise Dotemu and Tribute games have absolutely nailed it. It feels like watching the cartoons as a kid jumping into the action and kicking ass alongside my favourite heroes.

And that probably more than the gameplay is what is most important about this game. If you can’t capture the feel of an iconic series like this in terms of music gameplay and that same kind of feeling you get on Christmas Day as a child then it’s already a no-go.

Luckily it’s totally radical!

How Does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge Work?

If I tell you that Dotemu are the people behind Streets of Rage 4 then you’ll already get a feel for how this game is going to play and feel.

Players move from left to right defeating all enemies on the screen before being able to move towards the next area and doing the same thing again.

Where Shredders Revenge stands out is the cool collectibles that have to be met that make things a little trickier.

By smashing bins phonebooks and other objects players will discover NPCs and other objects that need to be gathered to fill certain criteria.

See it’s not just about button-mashing… though it mainly is.

In the loading area players can swot up on combos and special moves. There aren’t that many to remember and most of the time just hitting the attack button will get you the desired results.

Although I can’t get enough of throwing my enemies towards the screen and watching them soar out of sight!

Health comes in the form of pizzas and combo moves help to fill up a special bar that sends your chosen turtle into hyper-attack mode defeating all enemies in close proximity in a blur of your characters signature colour.

If you’ve been paying close attention to the pictures in this Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge review so far then you’ll notice how detailed the backgrounds are too.

That’s what separates this title with the classic beat-em-ups from the Mega Drive days; there’s so much to look at and interact with. It might be retro-inspired for nostalgic gamers but the work that’s gone into the level creation is second to none.

Oh and the graphics don’t make your eyes bleed.

Which Is The Best Character In Teenage Mutant Shredders Revenge?

The answer will undoubtedly be which ever is your favourite turtle. Still there is a little method to the madness if you want to go on stats and not favouritism.

There are six characters to choose from; the four turtles Splinter and April. Each player has a speed strength and attack range stat.

Donatello can attack enemies from further away with his staff but isn’t as powerful as Raphael. Michelangelo is fast but has to get closer to enemies with his Nunchucks than Leonardo does with his sword.

Still we’re al going Michelangelo first right? The dude loves pizza more than I do!

If you’re looking for a measured all-rounder then Leonardo is the character to go for. He has two stars for each stat and is a good choice if you want to run away fast and not attack too close.

Pulling off moves with each character is pretty straight forward with rolls backflips and jumping kicks adding to the action.

I really like the faces that the turtles pull while attacking too; like I said attention to detail is high in this game.

And what’s more the music is pretty pumping too keeping you in that old-school 80s arcade feel rather than the fact I’m sat at home alone eating biscuits while writing this. Sure it’s a little tinny but show me an arcade-style game that doesn’t sound like this.

What’s the Gameplay Like?

The gameplay is fast-paced fun and hella’ addictive. Players can tackle Story Mode and save their progress or go for the old-fashioned Arcade Mode with no save states.

That means completing the game all in one go and no safety nets!

Playing this game doesn’t take any skill; it’s a simple title with a simple premise.

That isn’t a dig towards Dotemu or Tribute games at all. The story isn’t the main draw here and that’s fine. It’s not trying to be Breath of the Wild or Horizon Forbidden West and nor should it. Shredders Revenge is unashamedly a stress-relieving game that takes us back to the golden age of gaming.

I just wish that it spent a little longer doing it that’s all.

The game doesn’t take long to finish. The collecting elements are there to make sure that players really explore the levels and I’m a big fan of that.

What I’m not a fan of is the pointless challenges that take away the fun such as ‘failed to finish without being hit’ or ‘failed to finish without using a power-up’.

Lighten up; there are enemies everywhere and I have zero patience. I’m gonna get hit!

Still one saving grace is that players have the option to go back through and play the game as different characters giving you 6 different playing experiences for your money.

And with a low price tag of £34.99 that’s not bad value for money at all.

Is Shredders Revenge Difficult?

No not really. Still that doesn’t mean that it’s not fun.

Sure there are lots of enemies to battle back and the bosses pose a bit of a challenge but it’s all fairly straight forward… quite literally as that’s the direction you’ve got to move in to get to the end of the level.

The only real difficulty you’ll face is not rushing in and attacking hell-for-leather and playing it cool. It’s too easy to just dive in fight like crazy but health goes down so fast this way and sometimes there’s not a pizza in sight.

I can’t believe I wrote that sentence; I become more like Howard Wolowitz every day.

Final Thoughts

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredders Revenge provides a nostalgic feel-good blast from the past that is easy to enjoy no matter your age or ability.

Whether you pull off combos or just hit the Y button it doesn’t really matter. What’s most impressive about this game is that it’s impossible not to have fun while playing it. The sights sounds actions and themes of the game are 100% TMNT through and through and that’s what’s most important.

Do I wish it had more substance? A little yeah.

It would have been nice to have more going on in the levels that made the game longer without following the challenges that have been thumbed in there for this purpose. Perhaps more collectables longer levels and more areas to delve into with some special zones.

Still if you love the turtles classic side-scrollers and still can’t get past the best arcade games then this is £34.99 well spent.

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade major corporations are adding abortion travel costs to their employee benefits.

The goal is to ensure their employees can seek abortion care if they live in states where the procedure is now or will soon be illegal. About 26 U.S. states are expected to swiftly outlaw abortion following the overturn of the landmark 1973 ruling according to the Guttmacher Institute which researches reproductive issues.

A trickle of companies announced abortion travel coverage earlier this year after states including Texas introduced restrictive abortion laws. But more corporations have followed in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on Friday with dozens of companies representing millions workers now pledging to cover travel costs in case their employees need abortion care.

Here's a rundown companies that have expanded coverage:

Amazon.com

The e-commerce giant — which employs 1.6 million workers — said it will reimburse up to $4000 in travel costs for abortions. ""Amazon has expanded the travel and lodging benefit to cover travel for a number of non-life threatening conditions if a provider is not available within 100 miles of an employee's home"" an Amazon spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.

Bank of America

The nation's second-largest bank said it would cover travel costs for employees who need to go out of state to get reproductive services including abortions.

Bumble

The dating-app company in September said it was setting up a fund to help organizations that support reproductive rights after Texas — the state where Bumble is based — banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy.

BuzzFeed

The media company is among those announcing they'd pay abortion-related travel expenses according to the New York Times.

Cigna

""Cigna has employees in all 50 states and we are committed to ensuring that they each have access to comprehensive health care no matter where they live. We already offer our employees and their families travel reimbursement for certain health services and we are expanding that benefit to include abortion care gender-affirming care and behavioral health services in states where access is restricted"" the health insurance provider said in an emailed statement.

Citigroup

The bank added the travel benefit to its workplace offerings after several states enacted restrictive reproductive health care laws. ""Beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources"" Citigroup stated in a regulatory filing on March 15.

CNN

The media company is among those covering abortion-related travel costs for workers according to the New York Times.

Comcast

The parent of NBCUniversal will cover up to $4000 a trip and up to three a year for employee medical travel with an annual cap of $10000 the newspaper said.

Condé Nast

The magazine publisher is also covering abortion-related travel costs for workers the Times reported.

CVS Health

The drugstore chain has reportedly made out-of-state medical care including abortion accessible for employees.

Dick's Sporting Goods

After the Supreme Court ruling the retailer said it will reimburse as much as $4000 in abortion travel costs ""to the nearest location that care is legally available"" for workers their spouses and dependents.

Estee Lauder

The cosmetics company said earlier this month it will cover travel and lodging for reproductive health care in the U.S. starting in August.

Goldman Sachs Group

The bank reportedly will cover travel costs for U.S.-based employees who need to go out of state to get abortions or gender-affirming care starting July 1.

Hewlett Packard

The company is among those that cover travel costs for medical procedures not available in a worker's home state.

Ikea US

Tesla sells more electric cars than any other company and until recently was expanding rapidly in China Europe and the United States as the rising price of gasoline increased the appeal of battery power. The company continues to withstand supply chain turmoil better than rivals like General Motors and Toyota both of which reported steep declines in sales on Friday.

There is plenty of demand for cars especially electric cars but shortages of semiconductors and other key components are forcing buyers to wait many months for deliveries.

Tesla delivered more than 254000 vehicles in the quarter compared with 310000 in the first quarter. It was the first quarterly decline in deliveries since the beginning of 2020 when the onset of the pandemic undercut car sales worldwide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL3Rlc2xhLXEyLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtZmFsbC1jaGluYXMtY292aWQtcmVsYXRlZC1zaHV0ZG93bi0yMDIyLTA3LTAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's deliveries fall hurt by China's COVID shutdown,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-q2-deliveries-fall-chinas-covid-related-shutdown-2022-07-02/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL3Rlc2xhLXEyLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtZmFsbC1jaGluYXMtY292aWQtcmVsYXRlZC1zaHV0ZG93bi0yMDIyLTA3LTAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvdmlkLXR3aXR0ZXItaW5jLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktaGVhbHRoLTg2MmQyOWVhNThhOWZiOTcyYTVmNTczMTgxZDcyNDQ30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's 2Q sales drop amid supply chain pandemic problems,"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla’s sales from April through June fell to their lowest quarterly level since last fall as supply chain issues and pandemic restrictions in China hobbled production of its electric vehicles.

The company on Saturday disclosed it sold more than 254000 cars and SUVs from April through June an 18% drop from the first three months of this year and also well below the pace in last year’s final quarter.

The last time Tesla sold fewer vehicles globally was in the third quarter of 2021 when it delivered 241000.

On Friday the rest of the industry reported a 21% drop in sales during the second quarter as the average price for vehicles skyrocketed to a record of $45844 amid soaring inflation according to J.D. Power.

Tesla’s sales drop may be a harbinger of weaker second-quarter earnings for the Austin Texas company which is the world’s top-seller of battery-powered vehicles and has posted net profits for nearly three years. Tesla plans to release its full results for the April-June period on July 20.

Like many other stocks Tesla shares have been hard hit this year. But the 35% decline in Tesla’s stock price hasn’t been entirely tied to the company’s see-sawing fortunes.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk also has made a $44 billion bid for Twitter which he placed on hold after complaining that it has too many spam bot users who aren’t humans. Much of the erosion in Tesla’s value has occurred since Musk became Twitter’s largest shareholder and then launched a takeover bid that has raised concerns he has too much on his already crowded plate

Musk has used his own Twitter account which now has more than 100 million followers to discuss the pandemic restrictions that forced the Shanghai factory to temporarily close during the quarter. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimates that more than 40% of Tesla’s sales come from China and that the Shanghai factory produced about 70000 fewer vehicles due to the shutdowns.

But Tesla signaled things are getting better Saturday saying it produced more vehicles during June than in any other month in its history. The company didn’t disclose the number of vehicles manufactured during June.

As of early Saturday afternoon Musk hadn’t tweeted about Tesla’s second-quarter sales. But he created a bit of a stir late Friday with ending an uncharacteristically long nine-day silence on Twitter. His Friday tweets included one with him and four his children meeting with Pope Francis.

Tesla’s latest delivery numbers came out a week after the release of an interview with Musk in which he described new factories in Austin and Berlin as “money furnaces” that were losing billions of dollars because supply chain breakdowns were limiting the number of cars they can produce.

In a May 30 interview with a Tesla owners’ club that was just released last week Musk said that getting the Berlin and Austin plants functional “are overwhelmingly our concerns. Everything else is a very small thing” Musk said but added that “it’s all gonna get fixed real fast.”

Musk also has discussed making salaried workers return to offices and a possible 10% cut in Tesla’s work force due to a possible recession.

Supply chain breakdowns since the onset of COVID-19 two years ago have been especially debilitating for automakers who get parts from all corners of the globe. A lack of computer chips needed to run cars’ computers compounded automakers’ problems and sent prices for used and new cars skyrocketing.

As the pandemic erupted in the U.S. in 2020 automakers had to shut factories for eight weeks to help stop the virus from spreading. Some parts companies canceled orders for semiconductors. At the same time demand for laptops tablets and gaming consoles skyrocketed as people stuck at home upgraded their devices.

By the time auto production resumed chip makers had shifted production to consumer goods creating a shortage of weather-resistant automotive-grade chips. Although Tesla has fared better than other automakers the industry still can’t get enough chips.

AP Business Writer Michael Liedtke contributed to this story from Berkeley California.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5jby9uZXdzL3Rlc2xhLWRvdWJsZXMtZG93bi1yZW1vdGUtd29ya2luZy1iYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Doubles Down on Remote Working Ban Tracks Office Attendance,"It seems that Elon Musk was serious when he said working from home was not an option for Tesla workers with employees now finding their movements being actively tracked by the company.

According to an internal message from Tesla staff who don’t come into the office are starting to receive automated emails from the company shaming them for not turning up.

Musk’s company is one of the few big tech organizations going against the grain of remote working with others such as Twitter AirBnB Reddit and countless others recognising that flexibility can be both rewarding and productive for staff.

Paying the Price for Working from Home

It’s no secret that Musk is no fan of his employees working from home. Just last month the CEO sent an email to all staff at Tesla informing them that they either headed to the office or found employment elsewhere:

“Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla.” – Elon Musk

Now it seems that the company is actively recording who is and isn’t showing up at the Tesla offices by keeping records of which employees are scanning their work passes in the building. According to a message received by a member of staff that was shared with The Telegraph those who are avoiding their office desk will receive an automated email informing them that their absence has been noted:

“You are receiving this email because there is no record of you using your badge to enter a Tesla facility on at least 16 days over the 30-day period ending on June 28.” – Tesla message to staff

Those who receive the message are also purportedly invited to explain their absence to their managers.

Musk is Behind the Times on Remote Work

We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again – Musk is wrong about remote work. The shift to hybrid and remote working may have happened suddenly but countless studies show that employees have quickly adjusted and are happier than ever. Not only that but they’re more productive too. Removing the commute has readdressed the work/life balance for many employees leaving them feeling less drained and more motivated.

In addition the cat is well and truly out of the bag when it comes to remote work. One study posits that 25% of professional jobs in North America will be remote by the end of 2022.

Remote working has also become a huge draw for prospect employees. Companies which don’t offer it will struggle to attract top talent with workers choosing to work for companies that do offer flexibility rather than those that don’t. Ultimately it’s this that could be Tesla’s undoing – the prospect of receiving snippy automated emails for not turning up to the office five days a week is unlikely to be that appealing when another company may offer the same position totally or partially remote.

So yes we’ll chalk this one up to another case of Musk being wrong just like the time he said the US would have zero Covid-19 cases by April 2020 (we’re currently at 87 million – bad call Elon).

Remote Working is Here to Stay

Despite what Musk might think remote working is the new normal. While Tesla might not have a remote working policy you’ve only got to look to its contemporaries to see that most tech companies think the opposite. Twitter employees have been told that they may work from home indefinitely (at least until Musk becomes the CEO presumably) while Microsoft Meta and Google have all adopted a hybrid working plan.

The switch to remote work has been sudden but then as they say necessity is the mother of invention and the pandemic accelerated the move to remote working considerably.

This move has been made infinitely easier thanks to the prevalence of systems such as web conferencing and VoIP not to mention remote desktop software. The move to many of us working from our homes just twenty years ago would have seemed nigh on impossible but tech has ensured that we can collaborate as easily as if we were sat in the same room as our colleagues no matter what our location.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMDIvdGVzbGEtdHNsYS1xMi0yMDIyLXZlaGljbGUtZGVsaXZlcnktYW5kLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbnVtYmVycy5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDcvMDIvdGVzbGEtdHNsYS1xMi0yMDIyLXZlaGljbGUtZGVsaXZlcnktYW5kLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbnVtYmVycy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla delivered 254695 electric vehicles in the second quarter of 2022,"A giant cowboy boot is on display outside the Tesla Giga Texas manufacturing facility during the ""Cyber Rodeo"" grand opening party on April 7 2022 in Austin Texas.

Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2022. Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2022: 254695

Total production Q2 2022: 258580

Delivery numbers which are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla fell just shy of analysts' expectations.

According to a consensus compiled by FactSet-owned Street Account analysts were expecting deliveries of 256520 vehicles for the quarter which was marked by Covid restrictions supply chain snarls semiconductor chip and other parts shortages.

Last year Tesla delivered 201250 vehicles in the second quarter its first time delivering more than 200000 units in a three-month period. In the first quarter of 2022 Tesla delivered 310048 vehicles.

Today's delivery numbers represented sales growth of 26.5% year-over-year and a 17.9% decrease sequentially for Elon Musk's electric vehicle venture.

The company has soft-guided to around 50% average annual growth long-term depending on manufacturing capacity and other factors.

In Tesla's first-quarter shareholder deck the company said ""We plan to grow our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible. Over a multi-year horizon we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries."""

Texas Instruments (TXN 1.27%) has raised its dividend every year since 2004. Between 2004 and 2021 the diversified chipmaker also grew its free cash flow (FCF) per share by an average of 12% annually while reducing its number of outstanding shares by 46%.

If you had invested $10000 in TI at the beginning of 2004 your shares would be worth about $52000 today. If you had reinvested your dividends as well your investment would now be worth more than $75000. Let's see why TI generated such consistent returns over the past 18 years and if it will remain a reliable blue chip stalwart for the foreseeable future.

How did Texas Instruments evolve?

Texas Instruments emerged in 1951 from the remnants of an older seismic exploration services company called Geophysical Service. It went public in 1953 and invented the world's first silicon transistor and transistor radio the following year. Over the following decades it expanded its business and manufactured a much broader range of chips for a wide range of markets.

In 2011 TI became the world's largest supplier of analog chips after acquiring National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion. In 2012 it abandoned the mobile application processor market which was quickly being taken over by Qualcomm and focused on producing less capital-intensive analog and embedded chips instead.

TI's chips are cheaper than CPUs or GPUs but they provide crucial power management wireless and data processing features for consumer electronics cars industrial machines and communications infrastructure. Those devices generally require a higher number of TI's chips with every upgrade cycle. That secular demand has been particularly strong in the auto and industrial markets which together contributed 62% of its revenue in 2021.

Over the past several years TI has also been transitioning from 200 mm to 300 mm wafers which will reduce its production costs by about 40%. If we track TI's gross margin expansion over the past 10 years we can clearly see the benefits of its transition toward cheaper chips and 300 mm wafers. Those strategies have also enabled it to maintain much higher margins than other major chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm.

Between 2011 and 2021 TI's annual revenue rose from $13.74 billion to $18.34 billion which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of only 3% but its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 16%. It squeezed out that strong earnings growth from its slower revenue growth by implementing its margin-boosting strategies and constant buybacks.

Over the past 12 months TI spent 62% of its FCF on dividends and 12% on buybacks which supports its long-term strategy of returning most of its FCF to its investors. It currently pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 3%.

Plenty of room for future growth

TI's stock tumbled nearly 20% this year as investors fretted over its slowing growth its spending plans for new 300 mm plants and the near-term macro headwinds for the auto industrial and consumer electronics markets.

However that pessimism has also reduced TI's forward price-to-earnings ratio to 17. That makes it a bit pricier than Intel and Qualcomm which trade at 11 and 10 times forward earnings respectively. But TI arguably deserves that slight premium because its business is more broadly diversified and less capital-intensive than either of those industry peers.

TI might remain out of favor this year as rising rates drive investors away from all tech stocks but I firmly believe it will recover in the future and generate solid returns for long-term investors. I'm not sure if it can replicate its impressive multibagger gains from the past two decades but it should continue to grow as its core markets consume more analog and embedded chips.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9lY29ub215LzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvaG93LXNoZXJtYW4taXMtbWFraW5nLWl0c2VsZi1pbnRvLWFuLWVwaWNlbnRlci1vZi10aGUtdXMtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci11bml2ZXJzZS_SAZYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS8yMDIyLzA3LzAzL2hvdy1zaGVybWFuLWlzLW1ha2luZy1pdHNlbGYtaW50by1hbi1lcGljZW50ZXItb2YtdGhlLXVzLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItdW5pdmVyc2UvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Sherman is making itself into an epicenter of the U.S. semiconductor universe,"In downtown Sherman markers explain the city’s past and restaurants and coffee shops boast about the historic buildings they call home.

Founded in 1846 the city is named after a Texas Revolution hero who led one of the militias shouting the “Remember the Alamo” rallying cry. Almost two centuries later residents still pass beneath an ancient sprawling pecan tree that shades the county courthouse and the former town square. They know their neighbors’ names professions and family trees. They visit shops restaurants and expansive antique stores in the city’s preserved downtown.

But there’s a new lifeblood of Sherman’s economy.

No longer built around railroads or mail routes or cotton trades it’s now a high-tech town largely bolstered by the jobs and investments provided by Texas Instruments GlobalWafers and Apple supplier II-VI. As the city’s tech sector expands its population is growing and new housing developments and businesses are popping up left and right.

“It’s a little scary for us” said 37-year-old Sherman resident Lauren Sims. Still she said “It’s a good scary.”

Sherman the bigger part of the 120000-person Sherman-Denison metro area is no stranger to change.

Its transformation into a key U.S. hub for semiconductor manufacturing is made possible by natural resources infrastructure and savvy local leadership but also by a business-friendly tradition dating back decades.

“It’s in our DNA” said Kent Sharp president of the Sherman Economic Development Corp. which helped land the GlobalWafers deal that’ll bring the first facility of its kind to the U.S. in two decades.

Semiconductors the tiny chips that power modern computers and other electronic devices are at the heart of city leaders’ plans. The city wants to be home to companies along all steps of the supply chain from crafting silicon wafers to creating circuit boards for consumer products.

Striking a deal

In 1990 the U.S. accounted for 37% of semiconductor production capacity. In 2020 that number dropped to 12% according to a study by Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association.

During the coronavirus pandemic supply chain issues in securing chips from overseas and record demand caused a shortage that persists today prompting calls to bring more production to the U.S. The shortage has been exacerbated by continued lockdowns in China and ripple effects from the war in Ukraine.

Semiconductor supply chains are still vulnerable and long-term demand is skyrocketing thanks to increasing digitization.

“Automobiles vacuum cleaners you name it everything’s running on chips these days” said Michael Savoie professor of operations and supply chain management at the University of North Texas’ Ryan College of Business. If semiconductor production in southeast Asia is disrupted “you could cause a global catastrophe within the supply chain.”

For Taiwan-based GlobalWafers and its GlobiTech subsidiary supply chain issues mean high demand and an impetus to add capacity through a $5 billion expansion in Sherman.

“We and our peer competitors have been sold out especially on advanced products (300-millimeter) where the supply will remain tight possibly through year 2024 which is the timing of new expansions” GlobiTech president Mark England said in an email.

Before semiconductors can roll off the line and into cars consumer electronics and industrial machinery fabrication plants start with a silicon wafer — a large mirrorlike sheet of ultrathin silicon that yields thousands of chips.

The new GlobalWafers plant will craft those wafers in addition to being capable of applying a crystalline coating. GlobiTech’s existing facilities will receive some of the raw wafers and apply that coating.

GlobalWafers’ expansion will be a long-term investment. Samples will begin making their way to customers in the second half of 2024 and mass production — starting at 350000 wafers a month — will begin in 2025.

The site could eventually ramp up to 2.4 million wafers produced a month England said.

“It will be our expansion vehicle for the next 40 years” he said.

Stiff competition

GlobiTech and city leaders weren’t certain Sherman would win the project especially since construction costs in the U.S. are three times more expensive than overseas. Sites in Ohio and South Korea were also being considered and all three locations offered big economic incentives.

“It’s like dating” England joked with competing cities putting their best foot forward.

Winning the faceoff required collaboration between the Sherman Economic Development Corp. four local taxing bodies and state government — as well as a promise of future federal incentives. The economic development agency was “the point of the spear” City Manager Robby Hefton said organizing different groups during negotiations with companies like GlobiTech.

The economic development agency offered $20 million in cash payments and the sale of over $14.4 million in land for $1 an acre. The Texas Enterprise Fund contributed a $15 million grant.

The city Grayson County and Grayson College chipped in tax incentives and the city offered a discount on water bills. Though it needs school board approval the company should also receive a break on taxes paid to the local school district.

While Ohio had a 100% tax abatement deal ready to go in a week efforts in Texas took months of negotiation between taxing entities. Each Sherman negotiator could have busted the deal with just one hangup.

Luckily for the city GlobiTech and its president have strong Sherman roots.

“We’ve been working with the city for over 20 years and we know everyone” said England a Sherman native.

Sherman had several other advantages.

GlobiTech’s existing management team can oversee the new plant which is helpful because the wafer production process involves trade secrets. The city has an ample supply of workers land power and other utilities boasting some of the best water access in Texas thanks to Lake Texoma one of the few reservoirs in the state that’s at full capacity.

The GlobalWafers project will be eligible for incentives under the CHIPS Act approved in January 2021 but Congress still needs to provide $52 billion in funding for subsidies to spur domestic semiconductor investment. For GlobalWafers that funding is essential.

Intel has said it may delay or reduce its plans to build a $20 billion chip plant in Ohio depending on what happens with the bill and England said GlobalWafers could scale back plans in Sherman or move its new production overseas if the money doesn’t come through.

“We’re in the same boat with Intel” England said. “We don’t feel secure about the decision until the concrete dries.”

Dealmakers are anxious to see the bill funded before Congress recesses in August and city leaders have talked to elected officials about its importance. But there is debate over whether $52 billion is enough to bring more of the nearly $500 billion semiconductor industry to the U.S. thereby decreasing supply chain vulnerability.

“With the CHIPS Act it may be an uphill battle: Is it enough to provide $52 billion to the industry? Absolutely not. It’s just a start” Bloomberg semiconductor analyst Paula Penkal said.

A legacy of encouraging industry

After wafers come off the assembly line companies use them as the base for microchips. In the United States that’s where companies like Texas Instruments come in.

Sherman has been home to manufacturers for more than a century but the modern-day city’s efforts — including the high-tech manufacturing push that brought Texas Instruments to the city — have their roots in a group active in the middle of the 20th century called the Young Turks.

Led by local business leaders and named for an Ottoman revolutionary group the Young Turks pooled money to attract businesses to Sherman.

“I would hear stories about them flying off to the East Coast and wining and dining the IBM executives before IBM came here and Johnson & Johnson” the son of one of the Young Turks said in a video commemorating the Sherman economic development agency’s 25th anniversary.

That business-friendly spirit guided Sherman as it carved out a place as a high-tech hub. The city created an industrial district on land the Young Turks raised money to buy. Leaders in the 1980s worked to secure the water supply according to Hefton.

This aerial map shows the Sherman industrial area along U.S. 75 where GlobiTech currently operates and plans to expand. The Young Turks raised funds to purchase the city's industrial areas shaded in blue. (Sherman Economic Development Cor)

The results? Texas Instruments IBM and Johnson & Johnson opened plants in Sherman in the middle of the century. GlobiTech began operations in 2001. II-VI’s factory opened in 2018 producing parts for the Apple iPhone.

Last year Sherman won the $30 billion Texas Instruments expansion that will be the crown jewel of the city’s manufacturing sector and secure its place in the middle of the semiconductor supply chain. Like GlobalWafers TI got big tax incentives to pick Sherman.

It’s been over half a century since the heyday of the Young Turks. Still Sharp cites the Turks as inspiration.

“We’re trying to emulate what those guys did back then” the economic development corporation president said.

Sherman’s roots as a small city have helped it grow into a tech hub said Tyson Bennett superintendent of the Sherman Independent School District. He pointed to the relationships among local leaders which make it easier to work together to attract companies.

Three steps of the semiconductor supply chain will soon be concentrated in Sherman: making the wafers applying the coating and transforming those wafers into semiconductor chips. This clustering is characteristic of the semiconductor industry.

“Suppliers will set up shop in the area to be closer to the chip producer so that you have more direct access both logistically for easier cheaper delivery and for better collaboration” analyst Penkal said.

Vertical integration — the phrase industry leaders use to describe that clustering — is Sherman’s goal.

“We envision the complete semiconductor ecosystem developing with chip manufacturers and starting materials” England said in an email. “It should completely change the landscape of Sherman.”

Sharp said the next step is attracting companies that make circuit boards for consumer products in the growing number of industries that rely on chip technology: laptops phones cars microwaves electric toothbrushes and more.

In response the city’s population could double over the next five to 10 years Hefton said.

“Part of the challenge is … how do you keep [Sherman’s] heritage and legacy kind of authentic in the face of all this other growth?” he said.

Residents want the city to thrive and like the amenities growth brings said Sims who grew up in Sherman and raised two children there. At the same time she said home values have risen in Sherman in recent years. Property taxes have gone up too.

Compared to 2021 the median house price in Sherman increased 31.2% this May hitting $305000. The city released a plan for 8000 new homes before the GlobiTech announcement. Sherman also ranks second in the U.S. for the most overpriced housing market signaling prices could be on their way down soon.

Evan Martin a realtor who works for Real Broker LLC in Sherman said the city experienced an “extreme shortage of inventory” in the first part of this year sometimes resulting in 10 or more offers on a home in its first few days on the market. Martin also noticed an influx of out-of-state buyers.

A 12-year resident of Sherman Martin knows a growing population leads to other issues.

“No longer does it take five minutes to get anywhere in Sherman” he said. “It’s definitely grown but there is still that small-town feeling. It’s what makes living here so enjoyable.”

Hefton pointed out that as property values increase revenue from industry helps the city keep tax and utility rates low.

Right now Sherman’s entire property tax base is about $4.5 billion wrote community and support services manager Nate Strauch in an email. Even after tax breaks the taxable value of just the first phase of the TI project is between $150 million and $280 million and each of the four phases of the GlobalWafers project will have a taxable value of $40 million to $60 million he wrote.

Each of the taxing bodies will get its own slice of the pie. City leaders want to invest in parks infrastructure police and firefighters. The school district will get a big chunk of money to finance new buildings through debt.

In addition to public revenue the tech industry brings new businesses and amenities Bennett said. But it’s more than that: People who grow up in Sherman don’t have to choose between living there or pursuing career opportunities elsewhere.

“I love my kids” Bennett said. “And I want them to stay here close to me and raise the family and have kids [so] my grandkids aren’t three hours from here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vY2FuZHlzZGlydC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMy9tbW0tY2hpcHMtYW5uYS1wcm9qZWN0LWlzLWEtc2lnbi1zaGVybWFucy1zaWxpY29uLWNvcnJpZG9yLWlzLXBvd2VyaW5nLWRldmVsb3BtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mmm Chips … Anna Project is a Sign Sherman's Silicon Corridor is Powering Development - CandysDirt.com,"A rendering of the Palladium East Foster Crossing. (Palladium USA)

Ground has been broken on another housing development obviously aimed at the rapidly developing silicon corridor in Texoma.

Dallas-based apartment builder Palladium USA plans to build a 239-unit 8.3-acre project north of McKinney in Anna. Called Palladium East Foster Crossing the project is less than a half-hour drive from where all the technology development is happening.

In the span of a few months Texas Instruments and GlobiTech have announced plans to build billion-dollar chipmaking plants a domestic answer to the worldwide chip shortage. They’re two of the 34 planned development projects coming to Sherman.

That means jobs jobs jobs. It also means thousands of skilled workers need places to live.

Already several neighborhoods are under construction in Melissa Van Alstyne and Howe. Palladium USA is the latest to take advantage. Palladium’s rental community will be built east of U.S. 75 on East Foster Crossing near State Highway 5 and not far from Palladium Anna a mixed-income development that features one- two- and three-bedroom apartment homes.

“The northward expansion that we’ve been talking about for 30 years well it’s here” Sherman City Council member Josh Stevenson told The Real Deal.

The Palladium USA development will have apartments in a four-story building and includes a resort-style swimming pool fitness center conference center dog park computer lounge kids’ playroom and clubroom. In other words a nice place to chillax after a hard day at the chipmaking quarry.

“Construction has started and we will be delivering the clubhouse and first units in November of 2023” Tom Huth president and CEO of Palladium USA said in a statement.

The Anna Public Facilities Corp. issued $33 million in tax-exempt bonds to help fund the development.

“Our community understands the need for quality diverse housing options and this project helps further that vision” Anna Mayor Nate Pike said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlLzIwMjIvMDcvMDMvbW90bGV5LWZvb2wtdGV4YXMtaW5zdHJ1bWVudHMtc2hhcmVzLWFyZS11cC1vdmVyLTU0MC1pbi10aGUtbGFzdC1kZWNhZGUv0gGXAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvMjAyMi8wNy8wMy9tb3RsZXktZm9vbC10ZXhhcy1pbnN0cnVtZW50cy1zaGFyZXMtYXJlLXVwLW92ZXItNTQwLWluLXRoZS1sYXN0LWRlY2FkZS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motley Fool: Texas Instruments shares are up over 540% in the last decade,"The Motley Fool Take

Richardson-based Texas Instruments Inc. is a semiconductor company that competes primarily in two markets where it’s the top player: analog chips and embedded processors. The former are used in every electronic device while the latter are used in most meaning demand is widespread across the automotive industrial and consumer electronics industries.

Texas Instruments handles most manufacturing assembly and testing internally enabling it to control its supply chains and inventory better than many of its peers. Perhaps more important it currently has two fabrication facilities that build chips on 300-millimeter wafers while most rivals use a 200-millimeter process that produces more costly wafers. Last year it announced that it will invest up to $30 billion to build as many as four new semiconductor fabrication plants in Sherman.

Not surprisingly Texas Instruments has been a rewarding investment. The stock has gained more than 540% over the past decade — for an average annual rate of more than 20% — and the company has raised its dividend at a pace of 25% per year since 2004. The stock was recently reasonably priced with price-to-earnings ratios below five-year averages — and its dividend yielded 3% too. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Texas Instruments.)

Ask the Fool

From P.L. in Lawrence Kan.: Is the number of shares of a company that can be bought limited in any way?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: Yes. Each publicly traded company has a certain number of “shares outstanding” — and that number stays fixed until or unless it issues more shares buys back shares or splits its shares.

Companies first issue shares when they “go public” via an initial public offering. They sometimes issue more later via “secondary” offerings. (The more shares a company has the smaller stake in the company each share represents.)

In theory you might try to buy all available shares of a company but in the process of doing so your demand would drive up the price of the shares. (This is why big investors such as Warren Buffett don’t publicize their purchases and why they try to buy chunks of shares over time.)

Buying all the shares of most companies would be very costly too: FedEx for example recently had around 259 million shares outstanding and a recent share price of $233. To buy all those shares you’d need around $60 billion.

From K.W. in Arlington Va.: What is “Nasdaq”?

The Fool responds: The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system was launched in 1971 to help investors access stock prices. It later became the first electronic stock market through which investors could trade shares.

The Nasdaq Stock Market is now the largest electronic stock market where more than 5000 companies are listed. These include Costco and Starbucks as well as lots of technology-focused businesses such as Amazon.com Apple Microsoft and Netflix. The other main U.S. stock market is the New York Stock Exchange.

Fool’s School

It’s smart to seek strong dividend-paying stocks for your portfolio. But don’t just focus on dividend yields. Yield is important but so is the dividend’s growth rate.

A dividend’s yield expresses how much of the stock’s current price you’ll receive annually in dividend form. To calculate it you divide the annual dividend amount by the current stock price. (Thus when a stock’s price falls the yield rises and vice versa.)

As an example if Buzzy’s Broccoli Beer pays 25 cents per quarter or $1 per year and is trading at $33 per share its yield will be $1 divided by $33 which is about 0.03 or 3%.

Advertisement

It’s great to have dividend payers in your portfolio because they tend to keep paying you regularly no matter what the overall economy is doing or whether the stock is rising or falling. (If a dividend-paying company is really struggling though it’s possible that it will reduce suspend or eliminate its payout.) Another great thing about dividends from healthy and growing companies is that they tend to be increased over time.

Check this out: Imagine that you bought 100 shares of Buzzy’s for $3300. You’d receive $100 in dividends in the first year (100 shares times $1 each in dividends). Let’s say that Buzzy’s increases its dividend by about 7% annually. In 10 years its dividend will be nearly $2 per share delivering $200 in annual income. Fifteen years after that the dividend will pay around $543. On your $3300 purchase you’re now receiving $543 for the year. That’s an effective dividend yield of 16% on your original investment!

Better still assuming that Buzzy’s is still healthy and growing the shares themselves will have increased in value over those years too. If they’re at $180 per share that $5.43-per-share dividend will still sport a yield of 3%. But those who bought long ago will be getting a yield that’s effectively much higher.

My Dumbest Investment

From T.L. online: My dumbest investment? Well to be honest it’s been self-help books. Success in life — and finances — all comes down to a few things: consistency high-quality effort and good habits. Do these and you are golden.

The Fool responds: Many people find self-help books well helpful. Many such books offer good — if not great — advice though others in the genre may be of questionable value. To benefit though readers need to recognize good advice when they see it — and act on it. That’s not always easy to do.

Your own advice — recommending consistent high-quality effort and good habits — is solid. To make it more specific to the financial realm we might say: Live below your means invest in high-quality companies (or low-fee index funds) and hang on for many years through market booms and downturns.

Good habits would include being diligent about saving and investing and cultivating patience. It’s also smart to have low expectations in the short run and high expectations about the long run — because great wealth can be amassed through stock market investing over decades as long as you don’t lose focus faith or determination.

Reading up on investing can help you build confidence in what you’re doing. Perhaps start with John Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing (Wiley $25).

Last week’s trivia answer: Hallmark Cards",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FucmlmbGVtYW4ub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvYm9uZC1hcm1zLWEtZGVkaWNhdGVkLW1ha2VyLW9mLW1vZGVybi1kZXJyaW5nZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bond Arms: A Dedicated Maker Of Modern Derringers | An Official Journal Of The NRA,"There’s no shortage of westerns with a derringer pulled from a card-playing desperado’s boot. The scene is almost iconic featuring guns designed to imitate the looks of the classic double-barreled but diminutive Remington Model 95. As a backup or primary carry gun the approach is ideal but the original carries a large inventory of safety concerns. Bond Arms elegantly addressed each of them in a clever over-under derringer design that adds versatility without sacrificing fight-stopping performance.

Greg Bond—former tool-and-die maker and engineer at Texas Instruments—became interested in simple single-action handguns after working with another firearm manufacturer. His knowledge of modern manufacturing materials and systems however made it obvious the original derringer design was more of a single-use option almost more dangerous to the person behind the trigger than the assailant.

His first improvement on the single-action design was to use stainless steel construction for adequate use of today’s high-pressure cartridges. He deemed the zinc and somewhat questionable alloys employed in other versions as subpar for the gun that was to bare his namesake. A trigger guard was added as well for additional safety—the gun's purpose was to be pulled fast and whether coming out of a boot or pocket it’s likely to encounter obstacles.

Bond didn’t stop there. “Each time the gun is fired the hammer rebounds and locks in a half-cock position away from the frame” B. Gil Horman explains in his review of the company’s derringer design for American Rifleman. “This means the hammer never rests against the firing pins. A push-button cross-bolt safety commonly found on rifle and shotgun triggers can block the hammer from striking the firing pins even if the pistol is fully cocked and the trigger is pressed. The third safety to note is simply stated a hook on the trigger that locks the barrel release lever into the closed position as the pistol is fired. This prevents the barrel release lever if accidentally bumped by the shooter’s thumb as the pistol recoils from popping the barrels open as the pistol fires. This is a patented safety feature not available on other Remington 95-based handguns.”

Then came a modern touch—interchangeable barrels. The user-friendly swap takes seconds and allows owners to even alter caliber quickly and efficiently. Despite the versatile design sales were lethargic at first. The gun company he worked eight months for even filed a lawsuit that was ultimately dismissed as frivolous. Defending his design took a serious toll on cash flow but he secured a financial partner and established Bond Arms in Granbury TX—where it remains to this day—in early 1995.

The help of his brother Gordon was ultimately enlisted to boost sales. He brought with him a wealth of business knowledge and marketing savvy elevating the company above what had been before a single salesperson calling on gun shops in an aging Toyota Corolla. It wasn’t long until competitors in the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS) noted the gun and began ordering. Today Bond Arms guns have claimed 19 SASS championships.

The company flourished and continued to introduce new models and barrels with regularity. In 2007 Gordon bought out Greg’s interest in the company and the sales have continued to increase. There are more versions and barrels in its catalog than ever before.

Despite the success Bond Arms has never lost sight of its local community. It’s always been active but most recently in April 2020 it provided masks for local first responders as the pandemic put them in short supply. Last year it introduced Double Brew Coffee—in partnership with San Antonio’s Texas Grounds Coffee Company—with 100 percent of the profits going to community organizations dedicated to helping disaster victims.

Today Bond Arms is the nation’s largest manufacturer of double-barreled handguns. It also manufactures the semi-automatic Bond Arms Bullpup pistol chambered in 9 mm."

Vero-TMPRSS238 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRRS239 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3 1 mM sodium pyruvate 1× non-essential amino acids and 100 U/ml of penicillin–streptomycin. Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were supplemented with 5 μg/mL of blasticidin. Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were supplemented with 10 µg/mL of puromycin. ExpiCHO-S cells were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All cells routinely tested negative for mycoplasma using a PCR-based assay.

Viruses

The Beta (B.1.351) and Omicron (BA.1 (R346) BA.1.1 (R346K) and BA.2) strains were obtained from nasopharyngeal isolates. All virus stocks were generated in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and subjected to next-generation sequencing as described previously39 to confirm the presence and stability of expected substitutions (see Supplementary Table 2). All virus experiments were performed in an approved biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility.

Monoclonal antibody purification

The mAbs studied in this paper S309 AZD8895 AZD1061 and the AZD7442 cocktail have been described previously91820.

S309-LS and S309-GRLR were produced in ExpiCHO-S cells and affinity-purified using HiTrap Protein A columns (GE Healthcare HiTrap mAb select Xtra #28-4082-61) followed by buffer exchange to histidine buffer (20 mM histidine 8% sucrose pH 6.0) using HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns. The final products were sterilized after passage through 0.22 μm filters and stored at 4 °C. VIR-7831 (clinical lead variant of S309-LS) was produced at WuXi Biologics.

AZD8895 and AZD1061 mAbs were cloned into mammalian expression vectors and expressed as IgG1 constructs with the TM (L234F/L235E/P331S) Fc modification with or without a second YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E) modification to extend half-life in humans. MAbs were expressed in 293 F cells after transfection with 293fectin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and isolated from supernatants by affinity chromatography using Protein A or Protein G columns (GE Healthcare). MAbs were eluted with 0.1 M glycine at low pH and dialyzed into PBS.

Mouse experiments

Animal studies were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (assurance number A3381–01). Virus inoculations were performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

Heterozygous K18-hACE2 C57BL/6 J mice (strain: 2B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Human FcγR Tg mice21 (FcγRα−/−/hFcγRI+/hFcγRIIAR131+/hFcγRIIB+/hFcγRIIIAF158+/hFcγRIIIB+) were a generous gift (J. Ravetch Rockefeller University) and bred at Washington University. All animals were housed in groups of 3 to 5 and fed standard chow diets. The photoperiod was 12 h on:12 h off dark/light cycle. The ambient animal room temperature was 70° F controlled within ±2° and the room humidity was 50% controlled within ±5%.

For experiments with K18-hACE2 mice eight- to ten-week-old female mice were administered the indicated doses of the respective SARS-CoV-2 strains (see Figure legends) by intranasal administration. For hFcγR Tg mouse experiments 12-week-old male mice were administered 105 FFU of a Beta (B.1.351) isolate by intranasal administration. In vivo studies were not blinded and mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups. No sample-size calculations were performed to power each study. Instead sample sizes were determined based on prior in vivo virus challenge experiments. Mice were administered the indicated mAb dose by intraperitoneal injection one day before or after intranasal inoculation with the indicated SARS-CoV-2 strain. AZD7442-TM (lacking the YTE modification that accelerates antibody elimination in rodents) was used in mouse studies.

Focus reduction neutralization test

Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with 102 focus-forming units (FFU) of different strains or variants of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibody-virus complexes were added to Vero-TMPRSS2 cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM. Plates were harvested 48–72 h later by removing overlays and fixing with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and incubated with an oligoclonal pool of SARS2-2 SARS2–11 SARS2–16 SARS2–31 SARS2–38 SARS2–57 and SARS2–7140. Plates with Omicron variant strains were additionally incubated with CR3022 and a pool of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs that cross-react with SARS-CoV41. Subsequently samples were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma 12–349) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma A6029) in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. SARS-CoV-2-infected cell foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and quantitated on an ImmunoSpot microanalyzer (Cellular Technologies).

Measurement of viral RNA levels

Tissues were weighed and homogenized with zirconia beads in a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 1 mL of DMEM medium supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Tissue homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at approximately 10000 × g for 5 min and stored at −80 °C. RNA was extracted using the MagMax mirVana Total RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the Kingfisher Flex extraction robot (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse transcription was carried out at 48 °C for 15 min followed by 2 min at 95 °C. Amplification was accomplished over 50 cycles as follows: 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Copies of SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA in samples were determined using a previously published assay42. Briefly a TaqMan assay was designed to target a highly conserved region of the N gene (Forward primer: ATGCTGCAATCGTGCTACAA; Reverse primer: GACTGCCGCCTCTGCTC; Probe: /56-FAM/TCAAGGAAC/ZEN/AACATTGCCAA/3IABkFQ/). This region was included in an RNA standard to allow for copy number determination down to 10 copies per reaction. The reaction mixture contained final concentrations of primers and probe of 500 and 100 nM respectively.

Viral plaque assay

Vero-TMPRSS2-hACE2 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well tissue culture plates. The following day medium was removed and replaced with 200 μL of material to be titrated diluted serially in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. One hour later 1 mL of methylcellulose overlay was added. Plates were incubated for 72 h then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (final concentration) in PBS for 20 min. Plates were stained with 0.05% (w/v) crystal violet in 20% methanol and washed twice with distilled deionized water.

Transient expression of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein and flow cytometry

ExpiCHO-S cells were seeded at 6 × 106 cells/mL in a volume of 5 mL in a 50 mL bioreactor. The following day cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-encoding pcDNA3.1(+) plasmids (BetaCoV/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 accession number MN908947 Wuhan D614; Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 generated by overlap PCR mutagenesis of the Wuhan D614 plasmid) harboring the Δ19 C-terminal truncation27. Spike encoding plasmids were diluted in cold OptiPRO SFM (Life Technologies 12309-050) mixed with ExpiFectamine CHO Reagent (Life Technologies A29130) and added to cells. Transfected cells were then incubated at 37˚C with 8% CO 2 with an orbital shaking speed of 250 RPM (orbital diameter of 25 mm) for 24 to 48 h. Transiently transfected ExpiCHO-S cells were harvested and washed twice in wash buffer (PBS 2% FBS 2 mM EDTA). Cells were counted and distributed into round bottom 96-well plates (Corning 3799) and incubated with serial dilutions of mAb starting at 10 μg/mL. Alexa Fluor647-labelled Goat Anti-human IgG secondary Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch 109–606–098) was prepared at 2 μg/mL and added onto cells after two washing steps. Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in wash buffer for data acquisition at ZE5 cytometer (BioRad).

Fc-mediated effector functions

Primary cells were collected from healthy human donors with informed consent and authorization via the Comitato Etico Canton Ticino (Switzerland). ADCC assays were performed using ExpiCHO-S cells transiently transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (Wuhan D614 BA.1 or BA.2) as targets. NK cells were isolated from fresh blood of healthy donors using the MACSxpress NK Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec cat. no. 130-098-185). Target cells were incubated with titrated concentrations of mAbs for 10 min and then with primary human NK cells at an effector:target ratio of 9:1. ADCC was measured using LDH release assay (Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (LDH) (Roche; cat. no. 11644793001) after 4 h incubation at 37˚C.

ADCP assays were performed using ExpiCHO-S cells transiently transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (Wuhan D614 BA.1 or BA.2) and labelled with PKH67 (Sigma Aldrich) as targets. PMBCs from healthy donors were labelled with CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) and used as source of phagocytic effector cells. Target cells (1000 per well) were incubated with titrated concentrations of mAbs for 10 min and then mixed with PBMCs (200000 per well). The next day cells were stained with APC-labelled anti-CD14 mAb (BD Pharmingen) BV605-labelled anti-CD16 mAb (BioLegend) BV711-labelled anti-CD19 mAb (BioLegend) PerCP/Cy5.5-labelled anti-CD3 mAb (BioLegend) APC/Cy7-labelled anti-CD56 mAb (BioLegend) for the identification of CD14+ monocytes. After 20 min cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before acquisition on a ZE5 Cell Analyzer (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 software. The % ADCP was calculated as % of monocytes (CD3- CD19- CD14+ cells) positive for PKH67.

MAb affinity measurements

(a) S309. SARS-CoV-2 RBD constructs contain residues 328–531 of the spike protein from GenBank NC_045512.2 with an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal 8xHis-AviTag. Proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C and 8% CO 2 . Transfections were performed using the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell culture supernatants were harvested five days after transfection by spinning at 4000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were then filtered through a 0.22 µm filter and supplemented with 10× PBS to a final concentration of 2.5× PBS (342.5 mM NaCl 6.75 mM KCl and 29.75 mM phosphates). SARS-CoV-2 RBDs were purified using HisPur Cobalt resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by buffer exchange into PBS using Amicon centrifugal filters (MilliporeSigma). S309 Fab binding measurements using surface plasmon resonance were performed on a Biacore T200 instrument. A CM5 chip with covalently immobilized anti-Avi polyclonal antibody (GenScript Cat #: A00674-40) was used for surface capture of His-Avi tag containing RBDs. Running buffer was HBS-EP + pH 7.4 (Cytiva) and measurements were performed at 25 °C. Experiments were performed with a 4-fold dilution series of monomeric S309 Fab: 571 143 and 36 nM and were run as single-cycle kinetics. Data were double reference-subtracted and fit to a binding model using Biacore Evaluation software. The 1:1 binding model was used to estimate the kinetics parameters. The experiment was performed in triplicate with technical replicates for each ligand (RBDs). Kinetics values out of instrument’s limit were omitted. K D values were reported as the average of all replicates.

(b) AZD8895 or AZD1061. Purified SARS-CoV-2 BA.2 RBD protein was purchased from AcroBiosystem. SARS-CoV-2 RBD constructs for D614G (residues 334–526) BA.1 and BA.1.1 (residues 319–537) were cloned with an N-terminal CD33 leader sequence and C-terminal GSSG linker AviTag GSSG linker and 8xHisTag. Recombinant proteins were expressed in FreeStyle 293X or 293 F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following transfection with 293fectin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s directions. RBD proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography using a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion column chromatography (GE Healthcare). AZD8895 and AZD1061 mAbs were isolated from expression supernatants by affinity chromatography using either MabSelect protein A or protein G columns (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 0.1 M glycine at low pH. MAbs were dialyzed into PBS. Fab fragments were prepared using papain immobilized on agarose resin (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s directions followed by purification over either MabSelect or protein A columns (GE Healthcare/Cytiva).Purified proteins were pooled and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to ensure purity and appropriate molecular weights as well as further evaluation by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering for some proteins.

Kinetic rates (k a  k d  and K D ) of AZD1061 and AZD8895 binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein were evaluated by biolayer interferometry using an Octet model RED384 instrument (FortéBio). Anti-His (HIS1K) biosensors (Pall FortéBio/Sartorius Part#18–5120) tips were first soaked in 1x kinetics buffer for 10 min followed by a baseline signal measurement in 1x kinetics buffer for 60 sec. His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD diluted in kinetics buffer to 5 μg/mL was loaded onto the tips for 180 sec. Antigen containing tips were then added to wells containing serial dilutions of AZD8895 or AZD1061 (at concentrations ranging from 3000 nM to 200 nM). Association and dissociation measurements were made for 300 sec each. All steps were performed at 30 °C and 1000 rpm shaking. Data were reference subtracted and fit to a 1:1 binding model using Octet Data Analysis Software 12.0. The fitted data were plotted with GraphPad Prism software (version 9.0).

Cytokine and Chemokine protein measurements

Lung homogenates were incubated with Triton-X-100 (1% final concentration) for 1 h at room temperature to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Homogenates were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines by Eve Technologies Corporation (Calgary AB Canada) using their Mouse Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 31-Plex (MD31) platform.

Lung pathology

Animals were euthanized before harvest and fixation of tissues. Briefly lungs were inflated with approximately 1.2 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde using a 3 mL syringe and catheter inserted into the trachea. Tissues were allowed to fix for 24 h at room temperature embedded in paraffin and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were scanned using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer slide scanning system and the images were viewed using NDP view software (ver.1.2.46).

Statistical analysis

All statistical tests were performed as described in the indicated figure legends using Prism v8.0 or 9.0. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way ANOVA when comparing three or more groups. When comparing two groups a Mann-Whitney test was performed. The number of independent experiments performed are indicated in the relevant figure legends. For correlation analyses best-fit lines were calculated using a simple linear regression. Two-tailed Pearson correlation was used to calculate the R2 and P values indicated within each panel.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was utilized to determine the level of pBADS99 and the expression of BAD in EOC tissue specimens. The potential association between pBADS99 and clinicopathological characteristics of EOC patients was determined. As observed in Fig. 1A higher levels of pBADS99 positively correlated with higher labeling of Ki67 (ρ = 0.274 p = 0.014*) and higher International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (ρ = 0.629 p < 0.001***) (Fig. 1A). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was also performed in the EOC patient cohort which sub-categorized the level of BADS99 as low or high using a receiver operating characteristic curve (Supplementary Fig. 1A B). It was observed that EOC patients with higher cancer levels of pBADS99 (IRS = 6–12) (n = 51) exhibited significantly poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05) compared to those patients whose cancers possess no/low levels of pBADS99 (IRS = 0–4) (n = 29) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore Cox regression analysis demonstrated a significant association of high cancer pBADS99 levels with decreased PFS and OS (Supplementary Fig. 1C). No significant correlation was observed between BAD protein expression and EOC patient PFS or OS (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Thus phosphorylation of BADS99 is increased in EOC and predicts poor survival outcomes for patients.

Fig. 1: Increased phosphorylation of BAD at Ser99 (pBADS99) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is significantly associated with reduced survival of patients. A Clinicopathological association with pBADS99 levels: Spearman correlation analysis between pBADS99 expression and clinicopathological features of the EOC patient cohort. B Kaplan–Meier analysis: relapse and survival times were compared by Kaplan–Meier analysis and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) were tested for significance by using the log-rank test. The immunoreactive score (IRS) 0–4 categorized was categorized as low pBADS99 (n = 29) and IRS 6–12 as high pBADS99 respectively (n = 51) as described in the methods section. C pBAD/BAD levels in EOC cell lines: western blot analysis was used to assess the levels of pBADS75 and pBADS99 and BAD expression in EOC cell lines. Soluble whole-cell extracts were run on an SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described in the methods section. β-ACTIN was used as input control for cell lysate. The sizes of detected protein bands in kDa are shown on the left side. Densitometries of protein bands were determined using ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Specific gene mutations in the EOC cell lines are indicated by the green-colored square described in the methods section. D pBADS99 levels in EOC cell lines: association between pBADS99 and BRCA-deficiency or platinum-resistance in EOC cells. E Correlation of pBADS99 to IC 50 of Olaparib: correlation of pBADS99 with Olaparib half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values in EOC cells. The IC 50 of Olaparib was calculated by total cell number counting (n = 3). Elevated levels of BADS99 phosphorylation exhibited a negative correlation with decreased Olaparib sensitivity in EOC cells. Statistical changes were measured using Pearson correlation analysis between pBADS99 and IC 50 values of Olaparib in EOC cells. Columns or points are mean of triplicate experiments; bars ±SD. ***p < 0.001 *p < 0.05. Full size image

Next the level of pBADS99 and expression of BAD were determined in eight EOC cell lines as described in the methods section. All EOC cell lines exhibited phosphorylation of BADS99 and expression of the BAD protein as demonstrated using western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). After normalization with the level of BAD protein BRCA-deficient OVCA433 HEYC2 A2780CisR and AFC cells exhibited significantly higher levels of pBADS99 compared to BRCA-proficient Anglne A2780 OVCAR3 and CAOV2 cells. Similarly platinum-resistant OVCAR43357 HEYC258 A2780CisR and AFC cells exhibited higher levels of pBADS99 compared to platinum-sensitive A2780 Anglne OVCAR3 and CAOV2 cells (Fig. 1D). In addition elevated levels of pBADS99 in EOC cells were observed to be positively correlated with the mutation of PI3KCA and KRAS but negatively associated with TP53 (Supplementary Fig. 1E).

Olaparib monotherapy has been approved as front-line maintenance for patients with either germline or somatic BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer or recurrent EOC regardless of BRCA status 58. Therefore the correlation of pBADS99 with Olaparib response was determined. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of Olaparib (after 6 days) in EOC cells positively correlated with the levels of pBADS99 (Fig. 1F). However it should be noted that the IC 50 values of Rucaparib or Talazoparib after 6 days of treatment did not exhibit a positive correlation with the levels of pBADS99 in EOC cells (Supplementary Fig. 1F). However the IC 50 of Rucaparib at 48 h and the IC 50 of Talazoparib at 72 h positively correlated with the levels of pBADS99 in EOC cells respectively.

Furthermore the functional contribution of BADS99 in regulating EOC cell survival was assessed by transient-transfection of human BAD and an S99 mutated human BAD (hBADS99A) with a flag-tag (construct described in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 8) into CAOV2 cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1G forced expression of hBAD-flag in CAOV2 cells increased BAD expression and pBADS99 levels compared to vector-transfected cells. Forced expression of hBADS99A-flag increased hBAD compared to vector-transfected cells and produced equivalently increased hBAD (and flag-tag) as was observed in hBAD-flag transfected cells compared to vector-transfected cells. Forced expression of hBADS99-flag did not appreciably decrease hBADS99 compared to vector-transfected cells but pBADS99 was significantly less than that observed in hBAD-flag transfected cells. Hence the densitometric analysis showed that the ratio of pBADS99/BAD decreased after the forced expression of pBADS99A. Functionally forced expression of hBADS99A in CAOV2 cells resulted in decreased cell viability (p = 0.002) and increased CASPASE 3/7 activity (p = 0.0003) compared to control vector-transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 1G). To confirm the Flag-hBADS99A construct was appropriately located within the cell immunofluorescence (IF) was performed with BAD pBADS99 and flag antibodies in Flag-tagged wild-type hBAD and hBADS99A transfected CAOV2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1H). The results are consistent with the western blot data. Note that similar to wild-type BAD protein Flag-tagged constructs are largely localized within the cytoplasm of the cells (Supplementary Fig. 1H).

NPB synergizes with PARP inhibition in EOC cells to decrease survival

It was next examined whether the small molecule inhibitor of BADS99 phosphorylation NPB44 synergized with PARP inhibition in EOC cell lines (Fig. 2 Supplementary Fig. 2). Based on different PARP-trapping capacities59606162 (Supplementary Table 6) Olaparib was tested along with Rucaparib and Talazoparib for combination efficacy with NPB in EOC cells. Utilizing combination index (CI) analysis NPB exhibited a synergistic response with all PARPis in all eight EOC cells (Fig. 2 Supplementary Fig. 2). Next the effect of NPB on the IC 50 of the PARPis was determined. The addition of 1 µM NPB produced a substantial decrease in PARPi IC 50 in EOC cell lines. For example NPB decreased the IC 50 of Olaparib in BRCA-deficient AFC cells by ~350-fold or in OVCAR433 cells by ~400-fold. In addition NPB decreased the IC 50 of Olaparib in platinum-resistant A2780CisR cells by ~50-fold. NPB also decreased Olaparib IC 50 in wild-type Anglne cells by ~120-fold (Supplementary Fig. 2). Similar directional fold changes were also observed with NPB in combination with Rucaparib or Talazoparib in EOC cell lines. Moreover NPB in combination with PARPis exerted synergistic effects with significant cell fraction affected (Fa = 0.50~0.99) in all EOC cell lines (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Hence NPB synergized with PARPis to decrease the survival of EOC cells. To confirm the functional specificity of NPB directed to BAD CAOV2 cells were treated with NPB after siRNA-mediated depletion of BAD expression (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Transient-transfection of CAOV2 cells with siRNA directed to the BAD transcript decreased BAD expression and decreased levels of pBADS99 compared to control cells (transfected with scrambled oligo) as observed by WB analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3A). No significant changes in CASPASE 3/7 activity nor cell viability were observed upon siRNA-mediated depletion of BAD in CAOV2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A) and as previously reported in various carcinoma cells (44). NPB treatment of control transfected cells decreased phosphorylation of BADS99 compared to vehicle-treated CAOV2 cells. Consistently exposure of CAOV2 control cells to NPB increased CASPASE 3/7 activity and decreased cell viability compared to vehicle-treated cells. In contrast NPB did not affect CASPASE 3/7 activity nor cell viability in CAOV2 cells with the depleted expression of BAD. Furthermore no synergistic effect was observed between NPB and PARPis in CAOV2 cells with siRNA-mediated depletion of BAD compared to control transfected CAOV2 evaluated by a total cell number assay (Supplementary Fig. 3B).

Fig. 2: NPB synergizes with PARP inhibitors in EOC cells to decrease cell survival. Chou-Talalay analysis was used for NPB (N) in combination with three PARP inhibitors namely Olaparib (O) Rucaparib (R) and Talazoparib (T) in a panel of EOC cells including CAOV2 (BRCA-proficient/Platinum sensitive) A2780 (BRCA-proficient/Platinum sensitive) A2780cisR (BRCA- proficient /Platinum resistant) and AFC (BRCA-deficient/Platinum-resistant). Cells were treated with the indicated concentration (Conc. log 10 scale) of NPB and mentioned PARP inhibitors for 6 days. The survival fraction (SF) was assessed using a total cell number assay. The logarithmic combination index (CI) value corresponding to cell fraction affected (Fa) was determined using the CompuSyn software (http://www.combosyn.com) as described in the methods section. CI value indicates: <1 synergism; =1 additive synergy; >1 antagonism (n = 3). Dose-response curves (DRC) for a panel of cells treated with the indicated concentration of PARP inhibitors with or without 1µM NPB in total cell number assays. Arrow indicates fold reduction in respective PARP inhibitor IC 50 in the presence of NPB (n = 3). Points are mean of triplicate experiments; bars ±SD. Full size image

NPB synergizes with PARP inhibition to stimulate apoptotic cell death attenuating PARPi-induced HR repair

Pre-grown colonies of CAOV2 cells in 3D Matrigel were treated with NPB and PARPis either alone or in combination. Live/dead cells analysis of the CAOV2 colonies was evaluated. Markedly increased red staining (indicating loss of plasma membrane integrity) and decreased green staining were observed with combined treatment of NPB and Olaparib compared to NPB or Olaparib alone (Fig. 3A). To determine the survival fraction (SF) ApoTox-Glo Triplex assays were used to evaluate live-cell protease activity (cell viability) and caspase 3/7 activity (apoptosis) of the colonies cultured in 3D Matrigel. NPB in combination with Olaparib significantly decreased cell viability and increased caspase 3/7 activity compared to NPB or Olaparib-treated CAOV2 colonies (Fig. 3B Supplementary Fig. 4A). Moreover treatment of CAOV2 colonies with NPB in combination with Olaparib significantly promoted early (PI negative FITC-Annexin V positive) and late apoptotic cell death (PI-positive FITC-Annexin V positive) compared to NPB or Olaparib-treated cells (Fig. 3C Supplementary Fig. 4B). Concomitantly CAOV2 cells treated with NPB and Olaparib marginally increased cell populations in the G1-phase along with reduced G2M-phase compared to cells treated with Ola (Supplementary Fig. 4C). In addition CAOV2 cells treated with NPB and Olaparib exhibited significantly reduced capacity for colony formation on monolayer compared to NPB or Olaparib-treated cells (Fig. 3D Supplementary Fig. 4D). A similar synergy between NPB in combination with Rucaparib or Talazoparib to stimulate apoptotic cell death was also observed in CAOV2 cells.

A Live/dead cells in 3D matrigel: microscopic visualization of calcein-AM (green) stained colonies (live) and BOBO-3 Iodide (red) stained cell debris (dead) generated by CAOV2 cells cultured in 3D Matrigel after exposure to NPB (N) PARP inhibitors (Olaparib (O) Rucaparib (R) Talazoparib (T)) and combination (n = 3). White arrows indicated positive staining. Scale bars 100 µm. B 3D matrigel growth: Survival fraction (SF) was evaluated using the ApoTox-Glo triplex assay Kit in CAOV2 cells treated with NPB (N) PARP inhibitors (OlaparibO Rucaparib = R Talazoparib = T) alone or in combination with the indicated concentrations for 14 days in 3D Matrigel culture (n = 3). C Apoptosis: flow cytometry analysis of Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining of apoptotic cell death of CAOV2 cells measured after treatment with NPB (N) Olaparib (O) Rucaparib (R) and Talazoparib (T) or combinations using flow cytometry analysis at 72 h as described in methods. Apoptotic cells refer to Annexin-V positive (early apoptosis) + Annexin-V and PI double-positive (late apoptosis) cells (n = 3). D Foci formation: CAOV2 cells were incubated in the indicated drug concentrations of NPB (N) Olaparib (O) Rucaparib (R) and Talazoparib (T) or combinations for colony formation stained with 0.2% crystal violet (n = 3). E Western blot: western blot analysis was used to assess the level of various proteins and protein activities in CAOV2 cells after treatment with NPB (N) Olaparib (O) Rucaparib (R) Talazoparib (T) or combinations thereof. Soluble whole-cell extracts were run on an SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described in the methods section. β-ACTIN (ACTB) was used as input control for cell lysate. The sizes of detected protein bands in kDa are shown on the left-hand side.

The mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of the combination treatment on apoptotic cell death in CAOV2 cells were analyzed using western blot. NPB treatment of CAOV2 cells produced significantly decreased pBADS99 levels compared to vehicle-treated cells (normalized to BAD expression). In contrast Olaparib treatment of CAOV2 cells did not alter the pBADS99/BAD ratio compared to vehicle-treated cells. Compared to NPB or Olaparib alone the cells treated with a combination of NPB and Olaparib exhibited further decreased levels of pBADS99/BAD. Olaparib treatment of cells increased phosphorylation of CHK1 at Ser345 and CHK2 at Thr383 (normalized to CHK1 and CHK2 protein respectively). In contrast NPB did not produce a significant change in the phosphorylation of CHK1 or CHK2 protein compared to vehicle-treated cells. In contrast the NPB-Olaparib combination decreased phosphorylation of CHK1 (Ser345) and CHK2 (Thr383) compared to Olaparib-treated cells. NPB treatment of CAOV2 cells exhibited decreased CCND1 protein levels compared to vehicle-treated cells. Increased levels of γH2AX were observed in CAOV2 cells after Olaparib treatment compared to vehicle or NPB and a combination of NPB and Olaparib significantly increased the levels of γH2AX. A significantly decreased level of KI67 and increased levels of cleaved CASP7 were observed in CAOV2 cells after treatment with NPB. Similar directional changes were also observed with combined treatment of CAOV2 cells with NPB and Rucaparib or Talazoparib (Fig. 3E Supplementary Fig. 5A).

Olaparib treatment of OC cells has been reported to increase the expression of the DNA damage signaling marker γH2AX along with RAD51 an indicator of HR repair in OC cells63. γH2AX expression was enhanced in cells treated with NPB or Olaparib and further increased in combination (Fig. 3F Supplementary Fig. 5B). Olaparib induced RAD51 foci formation in the nuclei of CAOV2 cells and which was significantly impaired in combination with NPB (Fig. 3F Supplementary Fig. 5B). Similar directional changes were observed in the expression and foci formation of γH2AX or RAD51 in OVCAR433 cells treated with NPB-Olaparib (Supplementary Fig. 5C). It has been reported that dephosphorylated BAD sequesters BCL-XL BCL-2 and BCL-W which results in BAK/BAX activation and apoptosis24. Treatment of CAOV-2 cells with NPB enhanced the interaction of BAD with BCL-2 BCL-XL or BCL-W as observed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays (Supplementary Fig. 5D). It is recognized that sub-lethal apoptotic stresses trigger a caspase-dependent increase in γ-H2AX expression6465666768. As DNA fragmentation is a classic apoptotic hallmark mediated by caspase-activated DNase (CAD) DNA laddering assays were performed. After NPB treatment apoptotic DNA laddering increased accompanied by increased CASPASE-3 and PARP cleavage and γ-H2AX expression consistent with previous studies reporting that increased γ-H2AX levels may also indicate apoptosis666768 (Supplementary Fig. 5E). Transient-transfection of Ser99 phosphorylation deficient human BAD (hBADS99A) construct into CAOV2 cells also produced increased levels of γ-H2AX protein as evaluated by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 5F). Given that NPB treatment diminished PARPi-induced CHEK1/CHEK2 phosphorylation and RAD51 foci which both have an important role in HR69 it was therefore determined whether NPB modulated HR. A HR reporter assay demonstrated that NPB treatment suppressed HR efficiency both in BRCA wild-type (CAOV2) and BRCA mutant (AFC) EOC cells (Supplementary Fig. 5G). Hence NPB attenuated the repair of DSBs induced by PARPi by suppression of HR. Thus NPB synergizes with PARPi in EOC cells to promote DNA damage and impair DNA repair after PARPi treatment.

NPB synergizes with PARP inhibitors to decrease cell survival in patient-derived EOC organoids

Patient-derived EOC organoid (PDO) cultures were established from four patients with recurrent EOC namely PDO1-4 (Supplementary Fig. 6A–C): PDO1 is derived from post-chemotherapy metastatic cancer cells of ascites; PDO2 and PDO4 both are derived from resected primary cancer and PDO3 is derived from residual cancer after 3-cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. To determine the effect of NPB in combination with PARPis on apoptotic cell death in EOC PDOs the effect of NPB PARPis and the combination was first assessed using PDO1 cells on 2D Matrigel. Both NPB and Olaparib alone decreased PDO1 cell survival. Compared to either Olaparib or NPB alone PDO1 cells treated with the combination of NPB and Olaparib exhibited significantly decreased cell survival (Supplementary Fig. 6D). Combined NPB-Olaparib treatment of preformed PDO1 cell-derived colonies in 3D Matrigel markedly increased apoptotic cell death (indicated by red staining) compared to NPB or Olaparib alone (Supplementary Fig. 6E). In addition compared to either NPB or Olaparib alone PDO1 treated with the combination of NPB and Ola exhibited significantly increased CASPASE 3/7 activities and decreased cell survival (Fig. 4A). Moreover the combined NPB-Olaparib treatment of PDO1 also significantly reduced organoid growth in 3D Matrigel (Supplementary Fig. 7A B) and foci formation capacity in monolayer culture (Fig. 4B). Similar directional changes in cell survival CASPASE 3/7 activities and organoid growth were observed when PDOs2-4 were treated with PARPis either alone or with the NPB-PARPi (Olaparib Rucaparib and Talazoparib) combinations (Fig. 4A Supplementary Fig. 7A B).

Fig. 4: NPB synergizes with PARP inhibitors to decrease cell survival in patient-derived EOC organoids. A NPB and PARP inhibitor combination efficacy in PDOs: effect of NPB (N) PARP inhibitors (Olaparib (O) Rucaparib (R) Talazoparib (T)) or combination treatment for 9 days in 4 EOC patient-derived organoids (PDOs) namely PDO1-4 were evaluated using the ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay Kit for survival fraction (SF) and caspase3/7 activity. Organoid growth was determined by counting organoids with diameters >100 µm number on the 7th day of culture and images of organoids growth on the 9th day were shown Scale bars 100 µm. B Foci formation (PDO1): survival fraction (SF) of ascitic fluid cancer (AFC) cells (from PDO1) treated with NPB (N) Olaparib (O) Rucaparib (R) and Talazoparib (T) or combinations for foci formation.

C Western blot (PDO1): western blot analysis of ascitic fluid cancer (AFC) cell-derived organoids (also designated as PDO-1) in 3D Matrigel after treatment with NPB (N) alone or in combination with Olaparib (O) Rucaparib (R) or Talazoparib (T). Organoids were harvested after depolymerization of Matrigel using Cultrex® organoid harvesting solution (R&D systems US) and organoid pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitors. Extracts were run on an SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described in “Methods”. β-ACTIN (ACTB) was used as input control for cell lysate. The sizes of detected protein bands in kDa are shown on the left side. Treatment concentration of NPB 5 μM; Olaparib 10 μM; Rucaparib 5 μM; and Talazoparib 5 μM.

NPB treatment of PDO1 cells significantly decreased levels of pBADS99 compared to vehicle-treated cells (normalized to BAD expression). In contrast PARPi treatment of PDO1 cells did not alter the pBADS99/BAD ratio compared to vehicle-treated cells. Compared to PARPis alone cells treated with a combination of NPB and PARPis exhibited decreased phosphorylation of CHK1 at Ser345 and CHK2 at Thr383 residue (normalized to CHK1 and CHK2 protein respectively). The combined NPB-Olaparib treatment of PDO1 cells also exhibited decreased levels of CCND1 protein compared to Olaparib-treated PDO1 cells whereas no significant change was observed compared to NPB-treated PDO1 cells. Markedly increased levels of γH2AX in PDO1 cells were observed after combined NPB-Olaparib treatment compared to single-agent treatment. Levels of cleaved CASP7 subunit protein also increased after combined NBP-Olaparib treatment of PDO1 cells compared to either NPB or Olaparib-treated cells. Similar directional changes in protein levels were observed with NPB in combination with Rucaparib in PDO1 cells. However combined NPB-Talazoparib treatment of PDO1 cells did not produce significant changes in γH2AX nor cleaved CASP7 levels compared to either NPB or Talazoparib treated cells (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. 6F). To confirm the functional specificity of NPB to BAD the effect of NPB exposure after siRNA-mediated depletion of BAD expression was examined in PDO1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6G) transient-transfection of PDO1 cells with siRNA directed to the BAD transcript decreased BAD expression and decreased levels of pBADS99 compared to control PDO1 cells (transfected with scrambled oligo) as observed by WB analysis (Supplementary Fig. 6G). No significant changes in cell viability nor CASPASE 3/7 activity were observed upon siRNA-mediated depletion of BAD in PDO1 as previously reported for various carcinoma cells (44). As observed in Supplementary Fig. 6G NPB treatment of the control transfected PDO1 cells decreased phosphorylation of BADS99 compared to control transfected PDO1 cells treated with vehicle. Consistently exposure of control transfected PDO1 to NPB decreased cell viability and increased CASPASE 3/7 activity compared to vehicle-exposed PDO1. In contrast NPB did not affect CASPASE 3/7 activity nor cell viability in PDO1 with the depleted expression of BAD (Supplementary Fig. 6G).

NPB and Olaparib synergize to suppress the growth of cisplatin-resistant EOC xenografts

The effect of NPB in combination with Ola in a xenograft model of recurrent EOC was examined. Xenografts were generated by subcutaneous injection of A2780 and A2780CisR cells into immunocompromised mice. Xenograft-bearing (volume 50~100 mm3 for A2780 cell line/volume 100~150 mm3 for A2780cisR cell line) mice were randomly grouped (n = 6) and were injected i.p. with the vehicle Olaparib (50 mg/kg) NPB (20 mg/kg) and the combination of NPB and Olaparib daily at the same respective concentrations. The treatment regimen is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 8A. All mice were sacrificed 8 days after commencement of drug treatment. The A2780/A2780CisR generated xenograft volume and mouse body weight was measured daily and are represented in Fig. 5A. Xenografts derived from A2780 and A2780CisR cells in all treated groups (Olaparib NPB or Olaparib-NPB) exhibited a significant reduction in volumes after 3 days of treatment compared to the vehicle group. The NPB-treated group exhibited significantly decreased A2780 and A2780CisR cell-generated xenograft volume compared to Olaparib-treated animals. In addition the A2780 and A2780CisR cell-generated xenografts treated with NPB-Olaparib exhibited significantly decreased volume compared to either Olaparib or NPB-treated animals (Fig. 5A). Statistical significance was analyzed based on endpoint xenograft volume. No significant changes in body weight (Fig. 5A) were observed in the treatment groups compared with the vehicle group during the treatment period. Consistently all treated groups from both A2780 and A2780cisR cell-derived xenografts (NPB Olaparib and NPB-Ola) exhibited decreased xenograft weight as compared to the vehicle-treated group. Animals treated with the combination NPB-Olaparib exhibited significantly reduced xenograft weight compared to either NPB or Olaparib alone. Notably the NPB-treated group also exhibited reduced xenograft weight compared to the Olaparib-treated animal group although the change for both A2780 and A2780CisR cell-derived xenografts (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. 8B) was not significant.

Fig. 5: NPB and Olaparib synergize to suppress the growth of cisplatin-resistant EOC xenografts. A Xenograft: A2780 or A2780 cisplatin-resistant (5 × 106) cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of 5-week-old BALB/c athymic mice respectively. When the xenograft reached 100–150 m3 in each cell line group the mice were randomized into the four indicated treatment groups (n = 6). Mice were treated daily with vehicle (V) 20 mg/kg NPB (N) 50 mg/kg Olaparib (O) or a combined NPB-Olaparib by i.p. injection. Xenograft growth was monitored daily by the measurement of the xenograft volume. The statistical change between treatment groups was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test on endpoint xenograft volume. Mean animal weights of each treatment group are indicated. Animal weight was monitored daily. The yellow triangle points to the start of the treatment. The brown triangle points to the end of the treatment. Results represent the mean ± SEM of six animals.

C Immunohistochemistry evaluation: pBADS99 BAD KI67 cleaved-CASP3/7 and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) positivity was assessed in resected xenografts treated with vehicle (V) 20 mg/kg NPB (N) 50 mg/kg Olaparib (O) or a combined NPB-Olaparib by i.p. injection using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described in the methods. Quantification of positive staining cells from the indicated treatment group for pBADS99 BAD KI67 cleaved-CASP3/7 and TUNEL are shown in individual value plots (n = 6). D Patient-derived xenograft: confluent cultured cancer (5 × 106) cells from the patient’s ascites were injected subcutaneously into the flank of 5-week-old BALB/c athymic mice. When xenografts reached 150–200 m3 the mice were randomized into the four indicated treatment groups (n = 6). Mice were treated daily with vehicle (V) 20 mg/kg NPB (N) 50 mg/kg Olaparib (O) or combined NPB-Olaparib by i.p. injection for 21 days. Xenograft growth was monitored daily by measurement of the xenograft volume until the humane endpoint. Below: the mean animal weights of each treatment group are indicated. Animal weight was monitored daily. Results represent the mean ± SEM of six animals. E Kaplan–Meier curve: Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed median survival to the humane endpoint and surrogate survival rate in the vehicle (V) NPB (N) Olaparib (O) or a combined NPB-Olaparib-treated group. Six animals in each group. Log-rank test χ2 = 75.0054. p < 0.001. F The drug response evaluation: waterfall plot of responses to the vehicle (V) NPB (N) Olaparib (O) or a combined NPB-Olaparib are described by xenograft volume changes (%) from Best Average Response (The minimum value of the average of ΔVolt for t ≥ 10 d); each bar represents an individual PDX. The criteria for response (mRECIST) was used to make response calls (as described in “Methods”). mRECIST were defined as followed: complete response (mCR): best response < −95% and best avg response < −40%; partial response (mPR): best response < −50% and best avg response < −20%; stable disease (mSD) best response < 35% and best avg response <30%; progressive disease (mPD) not otherwise categorized. A total of four treatment groups were tested in 6 PDXs respectively. Xenograft studies were performed according to the animal research: reporting in vivo experiments (ARRIVE) 2.0 guidelines. Columns or points are the mean of triplicate experiments; bars ±SEM. *symbols above the bar of different groups represent the statistical significance compared to vehicle. *p < 0.05 **p < 0.01 ***p < 0.001 .

Histological analyses were performed on the resected xenograft specimens. Stable pooled A2780-Vector and A2780-BAD-knock out (KO) cells using CRISPR-CAS9 (Supplementary Methods) mediated deletion of the BAD gene were generated in A2780 cells to confirm the specificities of the pBADS99 and BAD antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 8C). Xenograft specimens resected from animals treated with NPB exhibited significantly reduced pBADS99-positive cells in both A2780 and A2780cisR cell-derived xenografts compared to vehicle-treated control. No significant change in the percentage of pBADS99-positive cells was observed between Olaparib and vehicle-treated xenograft specimens. The combination of NPB-Olaparib reduced the percentage of pBADS99-positive cells compared to either NPB or Olaparib-treated xenograft specimens. No significant differences were observed in the percentage of BAD-positive cells between the different treatment groups. NPB-Olaparib-treated A2780 and A2780cisR cell-generated xenograft specimens exhibited a decreased percentage of KI67-positive cells and a significantly increased percentage of cleaved-CASP3 positive cells compared to either NPB or Olaparib-treated specimens. No significant change was observed in cleaved-CASP7 positive cells between the groups of xenograft specimens treated with either combined NPB-Olaparib or with single agent (Supplementary Fig. 8D). However NPB-Olaparib-treated specimens exhibited significantly increased TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells compared to either NPB or Olaparib-treated specimens (Fig. 5C).

Next the potential efficacy of NPB Ola or combined NPB-Ola in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of recurrent EOC was examined (obtained from PDO1: gBRCA2MUT (KingMed Guangdong China) and acquired resistance to cisplatin therapy) (Supplementary Table 2). The PDX was generated by subcutaneous injection of AFCs into immunocompromised mice. After 3 days xenograft-bearing (volume 150~200 mm3) mice were randomly grouped (n = 6) for treatment with vehicle NPB (20 mg/kg) Olaparib (50 mg/kg) or NPB-Olaparib. The mice were euthanized when xenografts reached the humane endpoint (volume ≥ 1100 mm3) as a surrogate for lifespan70. Vehicle-treated mice reached the humane endpoint first and were euthanized on days 15 (n = 2) 16 (n = 2) 17 (n = 1) and 18 (n = 1). As observed in Fig. 5D rapid growth in the AFC-generated xenograft volume was observed in animals in the vehicle control group. In contrast animals treated with either NPB or Olaparib exhibited an initial regression and then delayed growth in xenograft volume. From the 12th treatment day onwards an increase in the xenograft volumes in mice treated with either NPB or Olaparib was observed. Olaparib-treated mice reached the humane endpoint and were euthanized on days19 (n = 1) 20 (n = 3) 24 (n = 1) and 25 (n = 1) days; NPB-treated mice reached the humane endpoint later than animals in the Olaparib group and were euthanized on days 20 (n = 2) 24 (n = 1) and 25 (n = 3) day. The combined NPB-Olaparib treatment exhibited a durable regression in xenograft volume and a significantly more potent effect compared with either NPB or Olaparib-treated AFC-generated xenografts. No xenograft in the combined NPB-Olaparib group reached the humane endpoint during the 21-day treatment period. The mice reached the humane endpoint and were euthanized on the 29th (n = 1) 30th (n = 1) and 36th (n = 2) day. In addition the xenograft in 2/6 animals treated with the combination exhibited a complete response. The median survival of animals in the control group was 16 days Olaparib 20 days NPB 24.5 days and combined NPB-Olaparib 36 days as demonstrated using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (Fig. 5E). No significant changes in animal body weight were observed during the treatment period (Fig. 5D).

The best average response to the Olaparib NPB and combined NPB-Olaparib was examined utilizing Waterfall plots of response as represented in Fig. 5F. After that the modified response evaluation criteria in solid cancers (mRECIST) categorized the response into progressive disease (PD) stable disease (SD) partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) according to the best response and the best average response to the treatment55. All 6/6 vehicle-treated xenografts were categorized as PD 2/6 Olaparib and 5/6 NPB-treated xenografts were categorized as PR and 3/6 Olaparib and 1/6 NPB-treated xenografts were categorized as SD. The response in 1/6 Olaparib-treated xenografts remained progressive (PD). In contrast the response in 4/6 xenografts treated with the combination was sorted as PR and the remaining 2/6 showed a CR.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQyMDAzLTAyMi0wMzYwNS000gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Low-dose sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ameliorates ischemic brain injury in mice through pericyte ...,"Study animals

All mice were maintained and handled according to the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments by the National Science Council of Japan. The Animal Care and Use Review Committee of Kyushu University approved the animal experimental protocol (protocol number A20-107-1). C57BL/6JJcl mice were purchased from CLEA Japan (Tokyo Japan). Male mice aged 8–11 weeks and weighing 20–35 g were used in the experiments. All experiments were reported according to the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Sample size was calculated based on the previously published studies3436.

Luseogliflozin administration

Mice were randomly assigned into two groups: vehicle (no SGLT2 inhibitor) and experimental. The experimental group received the selective SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin that was added to the CLEA Rodent Diet CE-2 powdered mouse chow (CLEA Japan) at a concentration of 0.0001% which was sufficient to deliver an average daily dose of 0.1 mg/kg. We set the dose at a very low concentration to avoid any effect on the plasma glucose level according to a previous study37 in which 0.3–3.0 mg/kg luseogliflozin increased urinary glucose excretion and reduced non-fasting plasma glucose levels in db/db mice. Both groups had free access to food and water throughout the study period.

Blood pressure and heart rate measurement

Blood pressure and heart rate in mice were measured using a noninvasive tail-cuff BP system (BP-2000; Visitech Systems Apex NC USA). Briefly mice were acclimatized to the blood pressure monitoring procedure for 3 consecutive days prior to the experiment. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured immediately before and 3 days after pMCAO.

Glucose tolerance test and urine glucose determination

Casual plasma and urinary glucose levels were measured at approximately 10:00 a.m. Blood was collected from the tip of the tail (approximately 1 mm) and the glucose level was measured using FreeStyle Precision Neo (Abbott Chicago IL USA). For the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test mice were injected with 1 g/kg of d-glucose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Osaka Japan) intraperitoneally after an overnight fast. Blood glucose levels were measured before and 30 60 and 120 min after the glucose injection.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion model and exclusion criteria

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by pMCAO of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) using a laser-induced photochemical reaction3436. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 2% isoflurane and maintained under anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane. Rectal temperatures were maintained at 35 °C–37 °C using a heating lamp. The right jugular vein was exposed and a catheter was inserted into the superior vena cava for intravenous administration access. After the right distal MCA was exposed carefully a diode-pumped solid-state laser was used to irradiate the distal MCA at a wavelength of 561 nm with an emitted power of 6 mW. Upon laser irradiation a photosensitizing Rose Bengal dye solution (20 mg/kg) was administered intravenously for 90 s. After 4 min of irradiation the laser beam was refocused on the MCA proximal to the first position followed by another 4 min of irradiation. The right common carotid artery was ligated with a 6-0 silk suture.

We subjected a total of 129 male mice to the stroke model. To reduce the variability of infarction we subjected only male mice to this study. Mice that prematurely died within 24 h after pMCAO (n = 15) and those with subcortical hemorrhage (n = 8) were excluded from the analysis.

Measurement of CBF by laser speckle flowmetry

Relative CBF was determined using laser speckle flowmetry (Omegazone OZ-2; Omegawave Inc. Tokyo Japan) which generates high-resolution two-dimensional images showing a linear relationship with absolute CBF. Recordings were made through the skull under anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane. The average CBF of the ischemic core located 2 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral to the bregma was measured in a region of interest (ROI; 900 pixels)34.

Assessment of blood-brain barrier breakdown

The permeability of the BBB in the infarct areas was assessed by the leakage of Evans blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich #E2129). Briefly the mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline and whole brains were isolated 180 min after intravenous injection of 2% solution of Evans blue dye (4 mL/kg body weight). The brains were homogenized and immersed in 50% trichloroacetic acid to extract the dye. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature the samples were centrifuged at 15000 g for 20 min. The optical density of the supernatant was measured at 650 nm using a microplate reader (ARVO X4; Perkin Elmer Waltham MA USA).

Behavioral tests

All behavioral tests were performed in a blinded manner 3 days after the pMCAO. The rotarod test evaluated the balance and coordination of mice38. Prior to surgery the mice were trained to balance on the rotating drum for 3 days with 3 trials per day. After a 1-minute adaptation period on the rod at rest the rod was continuously accelerated at 40 rpm for 10 min and the length of time the mice remained on the rod (fall latency) was recorded. The neurological deficit score was evaluated using a six-point scale test with some modifications (Supplementary Table 3)39.

Microvessel isolation

Brain microvessels were isolated from 8-week-old mice. Meninges were carefully removed from the forebrains. The gray matter was minced into approximately 1-mm3 pieces in ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). Cell pellets containing the brain microvessels were separated by centrifugation in 20% bovine serum albumin-HBSS (2000 g 10 min) and then filtered through 100-µm cell strainers and trapped using 40-µm cell strainers.

Immunostaining

Mice were euthanized by deep anesthesia using intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital (75 mg/kg body weight) and were transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Wako Pure Chemical Industries). For paraffin sections the brains were fixed with 4% PFA for 24 h. PFA-fixed 1 mm coronal slices were embedded in paraffin and cut into 4-μm thick sections using a microtome (Leica Biosystems). The sections were then deparaffinized dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions washed in PBS and subjected to epitope retrieval treatments. For frozen sections the brains were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h. PFA-fixed 3-mm coronal slices were embedded in an optimal cutting temperature compound and dissected into 10-μm thick sections using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems). After blocking with 5% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature the sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight: anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich #M4403) anti-CD31 (1:200; BD Biosciences #550274) anti-CD31 (1:100; Abcam #ab56299) anti-CD13 (1:200; R&D Systems #AF2335) anti-PDGFRβ (1:100; R&D Systems #AF1042) and anti-SGLT2 (1:200; Abcam #ab85626). After thorough washing the sections were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor dyes (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) or stained with 33-diaminobenzidine (DAB) using an appropriate kit (Nichirei Tokyo Japan). For DAB staining endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min before blocking with 5% skim milk. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The sections were observed under a BIOREVO BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence Corporation Osaka Japan) or an A1R confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Melville NY USA). We used sections of the renal cortex of C57BL/6JJcl mice as a positive control of the SGLT2 expression (Supplementary Fig. 2a–b). To test the specificity of anti-SGLT2 antibody with the immunizing human SGLT2 peptide (Abcam #ab101414; the amino acid sequence was not available) the antibody was incubated overnight with the peptide (peptide/antibody molar ratio = 20:1) at 4 °C prior to immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence use as described above.

For the quantification of images the objective fluorescent signal above the threshold was measured by a blinded investigator who was not involved in animal procedures using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). SGLT2-positive areas were quantified by assessing three random high-powered ROIs (200 × 200 μm) in peri- and intra-infarct areas at the bregma of each section. CD13- and CD31-positive areas were quantified by assessing five random high-powered fields (400 × 400 μm) in the infarct area at the bregma of each section. Infarct volumes were measured using a total of five sections spaced 1 mm apart (from bregma +2.0 mm to bregma –2.0 mm) as follows: Infarct volumes (%) = [(contralateral hemisphere) − (ipsilateral MAP2-positive areas)] × 100/ (contralateral hemisphere).

Cell culture

Human brain vascular pericytes isolated from the normal brain were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad CA USA). Pericytes were cultured on poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated dishes (Iwaki Tokyo Japan) using Pericyte Medium (ScienCell) containing 1% growth supplement 2% fetal bovine serum 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . HEK-293T cells and HK-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and used as controls.

SLC5A2 overexpression

The cDNA encoding human SLC5A2 was purchased by from Addgene (plasmid #132241) and cloned into pcDNA3. The pcDNA3-FLAG-SLC5A2 construct was verified by DNA sequencing using BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing (ABI 3500xL DNA analyzer; Applied Biosystems Waltham MA USA).

Lipofectin Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher Scientific) or the Nucleofector Electroporation system (Amaxa Biosystems Cologne Germany) was used for the transfection of HEK-293T cells and pericytes respectively using the plasmid according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After transfection the cells were cultured for 48 h and then were used for the experiments.

2-NBDG uptake measurement

Glucose uptake was measured using a fluorescent substrate 2-NBDG (Peptide Institute Osaka Japan). Cells were plated at a density of 10000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated in a culture medium for 24 h. The culture medium was then replaced with the following HEPES-buffered saline with 0 100 or 1000 nmol/L luseogliflozin for 15 min: 140 mmol/L NaCl 5 mmol/L KCl 2.5 mmol/L CaCl 2  1 mmol/L MgCl 2  1 mmol/L KH 2 PO 4  and 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4). In the Na+-free solution NaCl was replaced with 140 mmol/L choline chloride. We added 200 μmol/L 2-NBDG and Hoechst 33342 incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 30 min. After washing the cell plate we measured 2-NBDG fluorescence with a filter for 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission and Hoechst 33342 fluorescence with a filter for 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission using a plate reader (ARVO X4; Perkin Elmer). To evaluate the 2-NBDG uptake per cell the fluorescence intensity of 2-NBDG was normalized to that of Hoechst 33432.

Oxygen and/or glucose deprivation and low- or high-glucose stimulation

Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or oxygen deprivation (OD) was performed using an airtight hypoxia chamber. Culture dishes were washed once with glucose-free DMEM (osmolality: 300–340 mOsm/kg; Gibco) and then subsequently filled with glucose-free DMEM (OGD) or 5 mmol/L glucose-containing DMEM (310–340 mOsm/kg) (OD) incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2  1% O 2  and 94% N 2 for 16 h. Glucose deprivation (GD) was achieved using glucose-free DMEM incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 for 16 h. High glucose stimulation was performed on the cells maintained in DMEM with 2% FBS at 20 mmol/L glucose levels (320–355 mOsm/kg) incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 for 24 96 and 168 h. The medium was changed every 24 h.

Lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxic assay

Cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using the Cytotoxicity Detection KitPLUS (Roche Diagnostics GmbH Mannheim Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly cells were seeded onto PLL-coated 96-well plates (Iwaki). After incubation with the reaction mixture for 30 min the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a microplate reader (ARVO X4; Perkin Elmer).

RT-PCR

Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells or brain tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo Osaka Japan). Using the reverse transcription product as a template PCR was performed using primers specific for the target genes. After preincubation at 94 °C for 5 min PCR was performed with 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min.

Quantitative PCR was performed in duplicate using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Reaction volumes (20 μL) included 10 μL KOD SYBR qPCR mix (Toyobo) 0.5 μmol/L primers and 2 μL cDNA. The mRNA copy numbers were normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as the internal control.

The following primers (Sigma-Aldrich Tokyo Japan) were used: mouse SGLT2 (Slc5a2; forward 5′-GGTGCCTGGCTGGAAAGAATCTG-3′; reverse 5′-TGCCACCTCATCTGGGTAGAGAATG-3′) human SGLT2 (SLC5A2; forward 5′-ACGCCTGATTCCCGAGTT-3′; reverse 5′-GCGGTGGAGGTGCTTTCT-3′) human GLUT1 (SLC2A1; forward 5′-CTTCACTGTCGTGTCGCTGT-3′; reverse 5′-TGAAGAGTTCAGCCACGATG-3′) human GLUT2 (SLC2A2; forward 5′-TGGTTTTCACTGCTGTCTCTG-3′; reverse 5′-CATTCCAATTAGAAAGAGAGAACGTC-3′) human GLUT3 (SLC2A3; forward 5′-CAATGCTCCTGAGAAGATCATAA-3′; reverse 5′-AAAGCGGTTGACGAAGAGT-3′) human GLUT4 (SLC2A4; forward 5′-CACAGTCTTCACCTTGGTCTCG-3′; reverse 5′-GTAGCTCATGGCTGGAACTCG-3′) human SGLT1 (SLC5A1; forward 5′-CCCTGGTTTTGGTGGTTGTG-3′; reverse 5′-TCACCACCCCAGCCTTAATATAG-3′) human NRF1 (NRF1; forward 5′- CCAGACGACGCAAGCATCAG-3′; reverse 5′- GGGATCTGGACCAGGCCATT-3′) human NRF2 (NRF2; forward 5′-AAACCAGTGGATCTGCCAAC-3′; reverse 5′- ACGTAGCCGAAGAAACCTCA -3′) and human/mouse 18 S rRNA (RNA18S/Rna18s; forward 5′-AAACGGCTACCACATCCAAG-3′; reverse 5′-CCTCCAATGGATCCTCGTTA-3′).

Immunoblotting

Cultured cells and brain tissues were homogenized in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for SGLT2 or in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5 150 mmol/L NaCl 1% NP-40 0.5% deoxycholic acid 0.1% SDS 5 mmol/L EDTA 10 mmol/L Na 4 P 2 O 7  0.1 mmol/L Na 3 VO 4  1 mmol/L NaF and protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma-Aldrich) for the others. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology Waltham MA USA). Reduced samples by 5% β-mercaptoethanol and SDS were subjected to SDS-PAGE (20 μg/lane) and then transferred onto PVDF membranes using Criterion Blotter tank (Bio-Rad Laboratories Hercules CA USA) at 30 V for 90 min at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated for 60 min with ECL-advance blocking reagent (GE Healthcare Chicago IL USA) at room temperature and probed overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies anti-SGLT2 (CST #14210) anti-CD13 (R&D Systems #AF2335) anti-β-actin (Sigma #A5441) anti-TFAM (CST #8076 S) anti-PGC-1α (Millipore #AB3242) anti-phosphorylated-AMPKα (Thr172) (pAMPKαT172 CST #2535) anti-AMPKα (CST #5831) and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma #F3165). Membranes were then washed and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (1:50000 dilution CST) for 60 min at room temperature. Blots were developed using ImmunoStar LD (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

To obtain membrane fractions homogenized cell samples were centrifuged at 20000 g for 10 min to pellet tissue debris followed by centrifugation at 150000 g for 60 min to remove cytosolic supernatant (Optima MAX-TL; Beckman Coulter Brea CA USA).

Human kidney lysates (#PK-AB718-1345-N; PromoCell GmbH Heidelberg Germany) were used as positive control for SGLT2 expression. For glycosidase treatment cell lysates were treated with PNGase-F (P0704S; New England Biolabs Ipswich MA USA) at 37 °C for 60 min.

Immunocytochemistry

Cells or microvessels were fixed in 4% PFA permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 or methanol and processed for immunostaining. The cells or microvessels were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with a blocking solution (3% BSA or 5% skim milk). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-SGLT2 (1:200; Abcam #ab85626) anti-CD31 (1:200; BD Biosciences #550274) anti-CD13 (1:200; R&D Systems #AF2335) and anti-TFAM (CST #8076). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI or Hoechst 33342. An A1R confocal microscope was used for viewing (Nikon Tokyo Japan).

Mitochondrial activity

Quantitative PCR analysis was used to assess the mtDNA copy number in cells. Total intracellular DNA was isolated and purified using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Takara Bio Shiga Japan). Quantitative PCR was performed using the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) to represent mtDNA and 18 S rRNA for nDNA. The following primers were used: ND1 (forward 5′-ATGGCCAACCTCCTACTCCT-3′; reverse: 5′-GCGGTGATGTAGAGGGTGAT-3′) and RNA18S (forward: 5′-CATTCGAACGTCTGCCCTATC-3′; reverse: 5′-CCTGCTGCCTTCCTTGGA-3′).

To visually detect active mitochondria in living cells a low-toxicity cell-permeable fluorescent probe MitoTracker Red CMX-Ros (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to label high-potential mitochondria. The cells were probed with MitoTracker Red at a final concentration of 100 nmol/L for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. MitoTracker Red fluorescence was measured using a fluorescent plate reader with an excitation wavelength of 540 nm and an emission wavelength of 600 nm.

Statistics and Reproducibility

Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test or a One-way analysis of variance with post-hoc tests (Bonferroni’s test). GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software San Diego CA USA) was used for all analyses. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xNTU0OS0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Protein and functional isoform levels and genetic variants of the BAFF and APRIL pathway components in systemic ...,"In agreement with most of those previously published our study reports higher levels of sBAFF and sAPRIL in female SLE patients than in healthy controls ethnically gender and age-matched (revised in910). Our results suggest no influence of the serum levels of these cytokines with the dsDNA antibodies or the activity. Several studies reported discrepancies regarding the relationship between the concentration of these cytokines the clinical features and the activity score910. Characteristics of the different cohorts and the index of activity used may influence the results. In this sense our cohort consisted of patients with a low activity index. Also the number of patients with and without nephritis is equivalent but it is unbalanced regarding the dsDNA antibodies and the activity. These characteristics could influence the relatively low serum concentration of both cytokines found. In the case of sBAFF only two patients had concentrations over those established as an independent prognostic factor for flares (2 ng/mL)21. Regarding sAPRIL patients with sAPRIL values above and below the cut-off point reported as a predictor of the resistance to treatment (4.0 ng/mL)22 were not significantly different concerning the clinical variables analyzed.

A previously investigated question that has reported contradictory results is the coexistence of both molecules in the serum of SLE patients232425. Our results strongly support the coexistence of both cytokines in the serum of patients with nephritis with a moderate correlation. This correlation in the subgroup of patients with nephritis may be due to parallel changes in the levels of both cytokines but also to the fact that the levels of heterotrimers are higher in this subgroup (because both BAFF and APRIL ELISA assays detect heterotrimers) Previous studies reported higher levels of heterotrimers in patients with SLE compared with healthy control and patients with rheumatoid arthritis78. The restriction to patients with nephritis could explain the contradictory results on the coexistence of both molecules in SLE patient sera and be relevant in the treatment options. Thus Belimumab which blocks BAFF without neutralizing APRIL has a minimal inhibitory activity on heterotrimers BAFF 2 APRIL 1 and no activity in BAFF 1 APRIL 2 2627. Theoretically patients with the most elevated levels of both cytokines or heterotrimers would respond worse to the Belimumab treatment. There are studies which are reported differences in the kinetic sBAFF and sAPRIL in immunotherapy without BAFF blockade. The sAPRIL levels decreased after treatment predicting the response in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis. sBAFF levels under 1.5 ng/mL at baseline are a good predictor of response in patients with lupus nephritis but remain unchanged afterwards. So even with conventional immunotherapy sBAFF and sAPRIL could be used as biomarkers predictors of response28. Further studies are necessary to establish how the coexistence of both cytokines or levels of heterotrimers influences the response to treatments.

Another remaining question is about urinary excretion of BAFF and APRIL proposed as biomarkers of SLE. The urinary excretion of BAFF seems to be an uncommon event whereas the urinary excretion of APRIL may be a physiological process because it was detected often in controls. Although these results may seem surprising similar findings have previously been published29. Therefore our results do not support the utility of these urinary cytokines as biomarkers of SLE. It hypothesized that the urinary excretion of the cytokines could reduce their serum levels. In our study the correlation between uAPRIL and sAPRIL levels in controls is robust although moderate and lacking in patients. The meaning of the lack of correlation between uAPRIL and sAPRIL levels in patients could be related to the disease though this result would need replication.

BAFF and APRIL as a result of alternative splicing events have different mature forms of mRNA. The non-functional isoforms such as ΔBAFF βAPRIL and εAPRIL may regulate the active form of the protein but their functional impact is not well characterized yet. To our knowledge there are no previous assessments of the role of the non-functional isoforms of these cytokines in SLE. The mRNA simultaneous transcription of the two isoforms of APRIL may be a physiological process because their levels correlate in patients and controls. εAPRIL underproduced in the patient group is a non-coding variant which could have regulatory functions30. The positive correlation between εAPRIL and sAPRIL in healthy controls that is lacking in patients could indicate that physiologically the production of this isoform is a mechanism of response to elevated protein levels. This control mechanism may be disturbed in patients the group in which this isoform is underproduced. Our results do not support any influence of βAPRIL and ΔBAFF on the serum protein levels because there was no correlation in patient or control groups. In addition βAPRIL was underproduced in patients with nephritis and ΔBAFF in patients with anti-dsDNA antibodies suggesting an influence of the regulatory activity of these isoforms in some patient subgroups.

Many studies investigated the genetic factors related to SLE by comparing the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients and controls. The high-throughput genetic studies (such as Genome-Wide Association Studies GWAS) have been very informative in SLE and other polygenic diseases. Nevertheless GWAS are not approaches designed to detect rare variants which are lost even with imputation processes because their extremely-low frequency. The NGS permits the analysis of the common and the rare variants. This fine-mapping approach could help solve the missing heritability problem and validate therapeutic targets. Concerning the common variants included in our study the results suggest an association of the TNFSF13 p.Gly67Arg in our population (risk variant Arg67) although the p-value became non-significant after correction. Several studies reported an association of this position with SLE in Japanese and to a lesser extent in African-Americans and Hispanics (risk variant Gly67) but not in American white people313233. TNFSF13 p.Gly67Arg is a B variant according to the ACMG criteria and its functional significance remains unknown. Altogether results suggest an association with the region but rule out p.Gly67Arg as the causal variant. In agreement with most of the previously published studies34353637 there were no common variants associated with SLE in the other four genes inside the region included in our study3435363738 although the association with other diseases has been described39404142. Regarding the individual analysis of rare variants TNFRSF13B p.Val220Ala was associated with the disease being Ala220 lesser common in patients. This variant is considered B but it could disturb the stability centres of the protein42. In any case the individual associations study of rare variants in complex diseases has difficulties because of the lack of statistical power. To get around this question specific statistical methods: grouping variants and checking the association of the entire gene have been designed. In the present study TNFRSF13B was associated with the disease independently of the strategy used. Variants in TNFRSF13B have been associated with antibody deficiency finding a high frequency of variants in patients with common variable immunodeficiency and IgA deficiency43. But the accumulation of variants in TNFRSF13B could confer some evolutionary advantage since the gene has an unexpected diversity and the IgA deficiency is often asymptomatic44. In this sense the number of rare variants in TNFRSF13B in our cohort of patients was lower than in controls. The other gene with associated rare variants was TNFSF13B but only in the analysis restricted to variants VUS + LP + P. Previous studies reported a rare INDEL variant GCTGT>A located outside the region included in our study (in the 3´UTR region of TNFSF13B gene) as associated with SLE and other autoimmune diseases45. Association was not detected for the remaining genes although their study has more limitations and in general our findings with rare variants need replication in other cohorts.

In conclusion our study supports differences among patient subgroups in the coexistence of both cytokines or the levels of heterotrimers. It suggests a role of the non-functional isoforms that may also be related to clinical features. In addition it supports the involvement of rare variants in TNFSF13B and TNFRSF13B in the disease."

HESPERIA Calif. (VVNG.com) — A semi caught fire after crashing with a car and knocking out a high-pressure water valve on Main Street in Hesperia.

It happened at about 8:48 am on Sunday July 3 2022 at the intersection of Main Street and Mesa Linda Avenue in front of the Tractor Supply store.

Witnesses said the sedan had a green light and was attempting to turn left onto Mesa Linda from Main Street. The semi honked on its horn before running through the light and colliding with the vehicle.

After the impact the semi continued traveling for several hundred feet knocking over a fire hydrant and a high-pressure water valve along the edge of the sidewalk.

Debris from the semi scattered across the east side of the roadway before eventually coming to a stop in front of the Beyond gas station where it caught fire.

Water from the ruptured lines sprayed an unknown amount of water into the roadway continuously for approximately an hour before the valves were shut off.

The male driver of the sedan was helped out of the vehicle by San Bernardino County Fire. He was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital with minor injuries.

The official cause of the accident remains under investigation by the Hesperia Police Department. Additional information will be updated as it becomes available.

Little did the shelter know it was just a stop on the pigeon's international adventure.

The Monroe County Animal Shelter said a man from Mexia walked into the shelter with the pigeon Thursday. The bird had bands around its legs and would not leave the man's home so the man decided to go to the shelter for help.

A worker at the shelter identified as Monica Leigh Morris followed the man back to his home where they were able to successfully catch the pigeon. Once the bird was back at the shelter the work began to track down the owner.

The shelter said they were able to get the tracking numbers off the band and also used a microchip scanner to help track down a webpage called North of England Homing Union located in Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom. On the website there is a form to fill out if you find a stray pigeon. The shelter followed those instructions and was immediately contacted by the owner Alan Todd.

""We are currently working on a game plan to return this champion pigeon to its owner which was extremely happy to hear from us"" the animal shelter posted on Facebook. ""Until then we had to go shopping at our local Tractor Supply Store. We met up with Bonnie and Lala Lilley to purchase food for this hungry baby. We also did a quick stop by Airport Animal Clinic to see Dr. Compton. Other than being under weight from its travel it looks pretty good.""

The pigeon a four-year-old bird named Bob set off on a 10-hour journey it has taken before when it left the Channel Islands in England three weeks ago to return to Newcastle. However the bird instead ended up in Alabama about 4000 miles from its home.

On Saturday the shelter said the pigeon is still in good condition and is gaining weight. According to  Todd has been reunited with his bird over video calls several times over the past few days. He plans to travel to Alabama to get the pigeon and take it back to Newscastle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oZXJhbGRvbmxpbmUvbmFtZS9yb2JlcnQtYmxha2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzU1MTEzMjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Blake Obituary (1950 - 2022) - Chester SC - The Herald,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/heraldonline/name/robert-blake-obituary?id=35511326 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oZXJhbGRvbmxpbmUvbmFtZS9yb2JlcnQtYmxha2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzU1MTEzMjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlY2FsbHMvYXJ0aWNsZTI2MzEzODk3OC5odG1s0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWlhbWloZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3MvcmVjYWxscy9hcnRpY2xlMjYzMTM4OTc4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is your outdoor chair one of 780000 recalled after causing concussions and bruises?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.miamiherald.com', port=443): Read timed out.

At the recent Ripon Planning Commission Planning Director Ken Zuidervaart indicated that a public hearing on a request to build a 7498 square foot building to accommodate an upscale liquor and spirits store is scheduled for the July 18 meeting.

That’s the same project that went before Commissioners at the February meeting. Commissioners opted to postpone the site plan permit due to parking concerns.

“The applicant is planning a BevMo-type (liquor) store” said Zuidervaart referring to Beverages & More featuring the latest in spirits wine and craft beers.

The previous plan called for a multi-tenant commercial building in the same location at 798 N. Jack Tone Dr. next to Tractor Supply and adjacent to Les Schwab Tires.

“A project down the pipeline for August is the fitness club which is the last parcel (in Ripon Crossing)” Zuidervaart said.

Ride 209 Fitness and Recovery Studio is currently located at 1475 Moffat Blvd. in Manteca and offers more than 60 classes a week including indoor cycling HIIT strength training Pilates reformer barre boxing and various types of yoga.

The fitness club is looking to move into the space at 720 N. Jack Tone Rd. near Canal Drive and across from the new Happy Daze RV Dealership.

The future of Ride 209 is a 25554 square foot fitness facility."

AAA predicts roughly 42 million Americans will take a road trip by car of 50 miles or more.

But the real crunch: 3.5 million people are expected to fly this holiday weekend. Airfares cost on average 14% more and in some markets have quadrupled. And hotel rates are up a whopping 23% since 2021.

On Saturday flight cancellations rose to over 600 while delays topped 4300 according to FlightAware an organization that tracks flight data.

And all this is happening as the major airline and travel stakeholders spar over delays and cancellations. The airlines are blaming the Federal Aviation Administration for delays the FAA claims the airlines are flying schedules they can't physically support pilots are blaming the airlines for increased workloads and flying hours they claim could be a safety issue passenger complaints against airlines are up 300% over 2019 and the U.S. Department of Transportation is contemplating emergency rulemaking options.

London's Heathrow and Gatwick are preemptively canceling flights and government officials are considering implementing surge pricing for planes scheduled to operate during peak hours.

Airlines worked Saturday to deliver luggage to passengers around the world after a technical breakdown left at least 1500 bags stuck at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport the latest of several tangles hitting travelers this summer.

The airport's baggage sorting system had a technical malfunction Friday that caused 15 flights to depart without luggage leaving about 1500 bags on the ground according to the airport operating company. The airport handled about 1300 flights overall Friday the operator said.

Union activists said many more passengers flew without their bags apparently because of knock-on effects from the original breakdown.

It came as airport workers are on strike at French airports to demand more hiring and more pay to keep up with high global inflation. Because of the strike aviation authorities canceled 17% of flights out of the Paris airports Friday morning and another 14% were canceled Saturday.

Passengers on canceled flights were alerted days ahead of their flights. The scene at Charles de Gaulle on Saturday was busy but typical for the first weekend in July when France's summer travel season kicks off.

Unions plan to continue striking Sunday but no flights have been canceled so far. They have threatened to renew the strike next weekend if negotiations with company management don't succeed in finding a compromise.

Travelers at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport Frankfurt and Dublin have experienced hourslong lines thousands of flight cancellations and thousands of bags missing and lost.

In the U.S. the DOT reports that the airlines have lost or mishandled 21% more bags this year than last.

Earlier this week Delta issued an unprecedented July 4 weekend ""air waiver"" to its customers citing ""operational challenges."" The airline admitted it expected trouble in supporting its schedule — meaning they don't have enough pilots flight attendants baggage handlers and other employees to staff all their scheduled flights among other challenges — over the next four days and encouraged travelers to rebook for other flights and other days without being charged any fees or penalties. The airline was essentially asking their passengers not to fly. No other U.S. airline has so far matched that waiver.

Many U.S. airlines continue to blame staffing at air traffic control centers whose workers are Federal Aviation Administration employees. But the U.S. Department of Transportation says that the majority of airline delays have nothing to do with center staffing. Airlines are also parking dozens of 50-seat regional jets because they don't have the pilots to fly them — and because at current fuel prices the airplanes are unprofitable to operate. Translation: Secondary market cities in the U.S. such as Ithaca New York and Toledo Ohio will have severely reduced — or in some cases no — airline service by Labor Day.

In the U.S. the DOT is considering imposing financial consequences on airlines publishing unrealistic flight schedules -- and the rules could force airlines to show they can support flights with the proper allocation of staff before they are allowed to schedule those flights. They're also talking about charging airlines more to schedule flights at peak times of 8 a.m. or 5 p.m — known as congestion pricing — as well as considering asking airlines to reschedule 30% of their flights to depart between 8 p.m. and 12 a.m. because night flights experience fewer delays.

But while airlines are canceling flights and cutting frequencies Amtrak is a travel bright spot adding to its schedules and running trains more frequently as a growing number of passengers are switching to trains for short- and medium-haul trips. And while AAA is reporting the total number of Americans expected to drive this weekend they haven't estimated how many people will be in each car — and that number has also grown as the cost of airfares has once again risen dramatically. It won't just be crowded on the roads — it will be crowded in the cars.

A second ray of hope: Future airline and hotel and resort bookings for after Sept. 15 have fallen off a cliff. One reason is seasonality — kids are back in school parents are back at work. But the high cost of travel for the summer of 2022 could mean that for many Americans when September rolls around they will table travel for the remainder of the year. Those looking for better airfares and more seats available for frequent flyer awards might find bookings more affordable September through Dec. 15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbXlub3J0aHdlc3QuY29tLzM1NDI5MzAvc2VhdHRsZS1haXJwb3J0LWV4cGVjdHMtMTUwMDAwLXRyYXZlbGVycy1wZXItZGF5LWhvbGlkYXktd2Vla2VuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SeaTac Airport expects more than 150000 travelers per day this holiday weekend,"This holiday weekend air travelers should be prepared to face delays as large amounts of people are expected to pass through SeaTac Airport.

The largest days were predicted to be Thursday and Friday with about 155000 to 159000 people expected each day according to Perry Cooper Seattle Airport’s spokesperson.

The numbers for this weekend aren’t the largest the airport has seen. Last weekend more than 160000 people were recorded.

SeaTac Airport unveils program to help cut TSA security lines

“We are getting back closer to where we were pre pandemic probably at about 90% of what we saw back in 2019 is where our pasture levels are right now” Cooper said.

While the days with the most volume were expected to fall on Thursday and Friday Sunday and Monday could see anywhere between 130000 to 135000 travelers in the airport.

Flyers were advised to arrive to their flights two hours prior for domestic travel and three hours for international.

“We’re also encouraging people to just be aware of their entire travel experience even if it’s parking” Cooper said adding that around 1500 parking stalls in offsite airport parking lots were lost during the pandemic due to the lack of volume and haven’t reopened.

Other ways to arrive to the airport while also reducing any delay in travel could be rideshares or the light rail.

“I’d rather be there early and get through faster than trying to time it out” Cooper said.

One way travelers can save time when flying is by signing up for the SCA Spot Saver program available online or on the Fly SCA mobile app Cooper said.

A space can be reserved in the general TSA line as much as 72 hours in advance and it gives travelers a 15 minute spot at the checkpoint.

He also noted that Delta pilots who are picketing are off duty and that their strike won’t be connected to canceled flights.

Something to Think About

The Poconos have been buzzing about a revival since last week. The dormant Mountain Lauren Performing Arts Center including the Tom Ridge Pavilion were recently purchased by a new real estate development and venue management company From The Roots.

Once again the hills be alive with the sound of music and other events!

The company acquired more than 200 acres of land which includes the center and pavilion. The plans include a multi-million-dollar investment that will revitalize and redevelop the property into an entertainment complex to be renamed Pocono Park. Those plans include playing host to world-class tours and productions as well as special events expecting to begin this summer and fall.

The property has a long and storied history it is not the first time it has played host to the famous.

During the 1800s the tourism industry was in full swing in the Poconos especially between Delaware Water Gap through Shawnee and north to Bushkill. The area became well known much as it is today as an outdoor recreation destination. Whether you now know it as Pocono Park or Mountain Laurel Center for the Performing Arts or as Unity House it was the home of Forest Park Hotel.

This property dates back to 1892 when it became one of the earlier built hotels Forest Park Hotel. Larger hotels began to replace the many boarding houses and taverns that housed the travelers to the area. The hotel was successful until the World War I when anti-German hysteria and pressure from the Federal government forced the owners to sell the resort.

In 1919 the hotel buildings 750 acres and a lake were purchased by an affiliate of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union Locals 22 and 25 of the Dress and Waistmakers’ Union. The Union bought the hotel as a permanent home of its new “Unity House.”

It was a bold experiment designed to have a place for worker education and leisure activities. The experiment failed so by 1924 the property was sold to the General Executive Board of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) at the time the largest women’s union in the United States.

Of interestAdventurer beware: Why are abandoned resorts in the Poconos so thrilling?

The union made major improvements to the property and transformed it into Unity House a “workers’ play land” where rank and file members could take affordable vacations by charging minimal fees and subsidizing the operation. The members and their families were able to enjoy summer sports dramatic performances concerts and lectures presented by college professors union leaders and other public figures making it very popular during the 1920s.

During the Great Depression thousands of new members joined the ILGWU and the resort became the vacation location for these members. After World War II the resort became a showcase for the union. Eleanor Roosevelt wrote after a visit in 1945 “You could not put children in a more favorable environment.” Summers that followed found more than 10000 visitors coming to the resort for summer vacations retreats forums and conferences.

In 1956 Unity House opened a new 1200-seat theater modeled after Radio City Music Hall. It included a ninety-foot state and up-to-date lighting and sound. The performers featured comedians opera companies the Harlem Dance Theater Group and Radio City Music Hall entertainers.

During the 1950s the popularity of the resort grew and continued through the 1960s. In 1972 the membership in the union began to move from Italian and Jewish members to include Hispanics Asian Americans and African Americans. But the membership of the union fell from its 1968 peak of 451000 members to 360000 by the mid-1970s and by the late 1980s only 160000 members remained.

In January of 1990 with declining membership and annual subsidies of some $1 million the union made the decision to close the resort. Pocono Park inherits a long history in the Poconos

July Fourth weekend could likely be more of the same.

More flights have already been delayed in 2022 compared to any year in the past decade according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics with cancellations also near record highs. Airlines have offered travelers everything from pizza during delayed flights to $10000 cash to get off overbooked planes. And the CEO of Delta apologized to passengers for the flight disruptions.

More than two years into the COVID pandemic people have started to travel again and as demand rebounds experts say that airlines are struggling to accommodate with a labor pool of pilots that shrunk two years ago and has yet to recover.

“The pilot shortage for the industry is real said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby on a quarterly investor call in April. “And most airlines are simply not going to be able to realize their capacity plans because there simply aren’t enough pilots at least not for the next five-plus years.”

To confront the surge in travel disruptions lawmakers have threatened to impose punishments on airlines for overbooking flights while airlines themselves have moved to increase compensation packages to attract and retain pilots.

Here’s what’s going on with summer travel.

A pandemic-tightened labor supply

The airline industry took an enormous hit in early 2020 when the pandemic halted the majority of air travel and lockdowns kept millions of Americans and international fliers at home.

To keep airlines afloat Congress provided a total of $54 billion to the industry in three rounds of support over the course of 18 months. The funding was designed to keep payrolls intact so that there would be enough pilots maintenance staff and flight attendants once restrictions lifted and people began to fly again.

“All of it was to ensure two things” says Capt. Dennis Tajer who flies for American Airlines and serves as communications chair for the airline’s union the Allied Pilots Association (APA). “One the airline industry does not collapse. Two that the airline industry is ready for the recovery.”

The first he says was a success but the second a failure.

As part of the terms of the first round of federal support airlines could not furlough or lay off their workers. They could however incentivize workers to leave which they did by offering early retirement packages to pilots nearing 65—the age at which pilots must retire by law.

As a result thousands of pilots likely left the workforce early according to Tajer. At American alone 715 pilots volunteered for early retirement in 2020 the APA told the Dallas Morning News.

That smaller supply of pilots combined with this summer’s high demand for flights has resulted in the current strain on the pilot labor pool with airlines competing with each other for workers. Other major airlines have begun to recruit pilots from American’s regional affiliates to join their mainline staff says Tajer.

This year poaching pilots is “unlike anything we’ve ever seen” he says.

And while staffing shortages are impacting the industry acutely today it’s possible they’ll persist for years to come.

The aviation industry will require a total of 612000 new pilots along with over a million new maintenance staff and cabin crew over the next 20 years according to a report from aircraft manufacturer Boeing released last year.

“Meeting projected pilot aircraft mechanic and flight attendant demand is wholly dependent on industry’s investment in a steady pipeline of newly qualified personnel to replace those who have left or will soon exit the industry” wrote Boeing in its report.

That investment could take many forms according to the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) the largest pilot union in the world with over 65000 members including helping potential pilots finance expensive flight training and education and focusing on recruiting a more diverse workforce.

A plight of cancellations and delays

When demand for travel began to bounce back early last year Tajer hoped the summer would be a trial season for a more robust recovery this year.

“How are things looking right now?” he asks. “They’re looking horrid and there’s no break in the action.”

If one of his flights gets canceled others downstream are impacted as well he says. “That airplane doesn’t have a pilot because I didn’t make it” he says outlining the ripple effect that every flight delay and cancellation represents.

A spokesperson for American Airlines told Fortune that in response to the labor issues it has cut down on the number of flights it offers.

“Like many network carriers American has reduced our regional flying in recent months in response to the regional pilot shortage” wrote a company spokesperson in a statement. “That shortage could loom for some time.”

Delta Air Lines told Fortune that staff shortages have been compounded by other factors like weather and air traffic control constraints contributing to current flight disruptions.

“Canceling a flight is always our last resort and we sincerely apologize to our customers for any disruption to their travel plans” said a company spokesperson.

United Airlines did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

Airlines have begun to take drastic action—like offering thousands of dollars to passengers to take a different flight—to ease the impact that cancellations and delays have had on consumers.

Company leadership has also stepped up to apologize for the current series of delays and cancellations.

“We’ve spent years establishing Delta as the industry leader in reliability and though the majority of our flights continue to operate on time this level of disruption and uncertainty is unacceptable” Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote in a letter to the company’s frequent flier program members this week.

In May Alaska Airlines posted a video on YouTube featuring the company’s CEO Ben Minicucci apologizing for not anticipating a pilot shortage sooner.

“By the time we caught this error April and May schedules were bid on by our pilots and flight attendants making it impossible to sufficiently adjust schedules to avoid cancellations” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL3Utcy1hdXRob3JpdGllcy1hcHByb3ZlLWVsb24tbXVza3MtYmxhemluZy1pbnRlcm5ldC1mb3ItZmxpZ2h0cy1hbmQtY3J1aXNlLXNoaXBzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Authorities Approve Elon Musk's Blazing Internet For Flights And Cruise Ships,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

On Thursday The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authorized SpaceX —business magnate Elon Musk’s company— to provide satellite Internet to vehicles in motion such as airplanes vessels and trucks. Now commercial airlines and cruise lines can offer travelers this company’s internet service Starlink.

Tom Sullivan the FCC international bureau chief said: “Authorizing a new class of [customer] terminals for SpaceX’s satellite system will expand the range of broadband capabilities to meet the growing user demands that now require connectivity while on the move whether driving an RV across the country moving a freighter from Europe to a U.S. port or while on a domestic or international flight.”

This is great news for businesses in the travel industry interested in offering this service to their customers and to those already providing Starlink satellite internet. A few weeks ago Hawaiian Airlines had already announced the implementation of Starlink internet service and Royal Caribbean recently became the first cruise line to request the service.

Companies already offering SpaceX’s internet service have been experiencing limitations in the US. In a recent post on the Royal Caribbean blog it was explained: “Before you can expect to get super-fast wifi on a Royal Caribbean ship the FCC needs to approve the technology because right now Starlink isn't allowed on moving vehicles.”

But now that the FCC approved the use of the service travelers can expect a better Internet connection. SpaceX had been waiting for an answer since March and now it has the green light. However the US agency imposed a few conditions that SpaceX has been required to accept like “interference received from both current and future services authorized” and other conditions and requirements.

Very soon travelers will start experiencing this blazing Internet connection during flights and while cruising. Hawaiian Airlines will provide the service for free next year on all of its 42 airplanes —all fleet including Airbus A330 A321neos and Boeing 787 Dreamliner— and Royal Caribbean already started testing Starlink on its Freedom of the Seas vessel.

Travelers Will Get High-Speed Satellite Internet Everywhere

SpaceX’s satellite coverage provides services in 36 countries. Since 2019 the company has already launched 2700 satellites in low to medium Earth orbit for low latency and fast speed. The company is already being used by over 400000 users.

Now that this satellite internet service has been approved to be used on the move users will be able to experience high-speed internet connections anywhere across the globe.

Royal Caribbean Group's Vice President Operational Excellence John Maya said in a letter to FCC: “Working with SpaceX Services Inc. we believe we have identified a true next generation solution for our vessels that meets the rigorous technical and operational requirements commensurate with our growth plans.”

The cruise line has already equipped its vessel Freedom of the Seas with satellite dishes Starlink’s Dishy McFlatfaces to provide customers Internet through its wifi service Voom—prices currently range from $17.99 per day to $32.99 per day with streaming options. According to the information provided by Crew Center the cruise company’s Internet service is expected to increase considerably: from 3 to 5 Mbps to 50 to 250 Mbps.

Hawaiian Airlines on the other hand will be offering its customers wifi service for free in 2023. As reported by Beat of Hawaii the download speeds will range from 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps.

When the alliance was announced in April Peter Ingram Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO said: “We waited until technology caught up with our high standards for guest experience but it will be worth the wait. Our guests can look forward to fast seamless and free Wi-Fi to complement our award-winning onboard Hawaiian hospitality.”

Travelers will start experiencing Starlink’s fast internet connection soon and since Hawaiian Airlines will be offering this service for free many expect that other cruise lines and airlines will do the same.

The Yankees holding to what they believe is a firm but fair line ultimately fall short of Judge’s asking price which ends up in the seven-year $300 million range. As a result Judge returns to the Bronx in a Giants or Dodgers uniform fielding questions about his sentimental homecoming.

Honestly we doubt it will come to that. No player in the majors means more to his franchise than Judge does to the Yankees even beyond his on-field performance and Hal Steinbrenner surely realizes Judge’s transcendent value.

But the events of this past week involving Freeman’s departure from Atlanta and the potentially litigious fallout four months later show us that you can’t assume anything when it comes to free agency. Whether it’s a slip-up in communication or overplaying a negotiating stance things can and do go sideways as Freeman has implied since last weekend’s return to Truist Park in a Dodgers uniform.

Freeman basically broke down during an emotional news conference at the start of that series proclaiming his love for Atlanta through teary eyes. Maybe he forgot which clubhouse he had to return to when it was over because the Dodgers are paying him $162 million over the next six years to be their first baseman. If that’s not enough to turn the page in a more dignified manner toward his current employer it’s possible that Freeman made the wrong decision to sign there.

“I’m not looking for closure” Freeman said that day at the podium. “There’s nothing for me to close. Why would I close such a special time in my life?”

Well Freeman got anything but closure since uttering those words. Turns out chumming around Truist Park that weekend opened up a whole new can of what-ifs for the 2020 MVP along with some passive-aggressive pushback from Mr. Dodger himself Clayton Kershaw. The three-time Cy Young Award winner undoubtedly left money on the table in choosing to stay with the Dodgers for his 15th season including the one-year $17 million deal he signed in March (Max Scherzer who at 37 is three years older is earning $43.3 million this season). Hearing Freeman bemoan the fact that he no longer plays for Atlanta apparently didn’t sit well with Kershaw.

“He’s obviously been a big contributor for our team” Kershaw told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “And I hope we’re not second fiddle. It’s a pretty special team over here too. I think whenever he gets comfortable over here he’ll really enjoy it.”

That’s quite the slap. Freeman is a SoCal kid so the Dodgers were always looming as a favored landing spot in free agency aside from the fact that they also have plenty of cash. But Atlanta had the spiritual ties considering Freeman matured from a second-round draft pick into becoming what appeared to be the face of the franchise akin to a next-generation Chipper Jones. And it’s not as if Atlanta is broke either with the ninth-highest payroll in the game at $185 million (according to fangraphs.com).

A big chunk of that has to do with Freeman or rather his replacement. Figuring their talks with Freeman were over — the last contact reportedly was a five-year $135 million offer that he rejected — Atlanta moved to trade for A’s first baseman Matt Olson on March 14 then signed him to a long-term extension two days later for $168 million over eight years.

Two days after that Freeman signed his deal with the Dodgers. But it took until late June for everyone to find out just how unhappy he was about doing so.

Shortly after the Dodgers packed up and left Atlanta ESPN reported that Freeman was firing his agents — he’s represented by Excel Sports Management and lead rep Casey Close — because of his dissatisfaction with the agency’s handling of talks with Atlanta.

The saga took another wild turn when Fox Sports Radio broadcaster Doug Gottlieb said Freeman’s agent failed to brief him on Atlanta’s continued interest and most up-to-date offer. Gottlieb went as far as to say Close did so because he knew Freeman would accept it; the new Dodger found about that detail only during last weekend’s return to Truist Park.

Freeman’s only response to that was to call it a “fluid situation.” But Close who also represented Derek Jeter throughout his career and is one of the sport’s most influential agents took a much stronger stance with repeated email statements which included Newsday.

“Doug Gottlieb tweeted a wholly inaccurate characterization of our negotiations with Atlanta on behalf of Freddie Freeman” Close said in the first statement issued Wednesday evening. “We are immediately evaluating all legal options to address the reckless publication of inaccurate information.”

But after another day of consideration Close evidently felt that first email wasn’t sufficient. The next one a follow-up sent only 16 hours later had a more detailed breakdown of his version of the events.

“I will not stand by as the circumstances surrounding Freddie Freeman’s departure from Atlanta are mischaracterized” Close said. “Since March [Atlanta has] fostered a narrative about the negotiations which stated plainly is false. Part of that false narrative is the suggestion that I did not communicate a contract offer to the Freemans. To be clear we communicated every offer that was made as well as every communication Excel had with the [Atlanta] organization throughout the entire process.

“I have a 30-year reputation in this business for integrity and honesty and I have always operated with the utmost character. At Excel we are privileged to represent many exemplary athletes some of whom have chosen to spend their entire careers with one franchise. We always put the player’s goals and best interests first and will always continue to do so.”

Considering the damaging nature of these allegations Close’s reaction was fairly measured. Excel represents a number of high-profile athletes across the sports landscape including Kershaw and this is a cutthroat industry with heated competition for clients many scooped up by transfers. If Freeman is saying he was done dirty in his attempt to stay with Atlanta — a place he apparently still has trouble separating himself from — that’s a damning accusation to make.

Close did have a big-time ally come to his defense later in the week with the former Yankees captain tweeting support for his agent.

“I have known Casey since I was 18” Derek Jeter said on Twitter. “Over the last 30 years we have had our share of differences of opinion but to this day he remains a trusted adviser and friend. He is a man who values morals integrity and above all else honesty and transparency.”

After this past week it seems that some are calling that into question leaving Close vulnerable and understandably open to possible litigation against those making such accusations. The only thing without dispute in this entire ordeal is Freeman still being homesick for Atlanta. That much is crystal- clear.

“I thought I loved this city and this organization a lot” Freeman said upon last week’s return to Truist Park. “But you can tell how much I truly do love this organization and this city. I don’t even know how I’m going to get through this weekend.”

Freeman eventually did somehow. But it was a turbulent visit and how everyone will choose to navigate the other side remains unsettled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZG9kZ2Vyc3dheS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMi9kb2RnZXJzLWJyYXZlcy1zd2FwLWZyZWRkaWUtZnJlZW1hbi1tYXR0LW9sc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Debunking possibility of Dodgers-Braves Freeman-for-Olson trade amid drama,"Freddie’s all about eliminating clubhouse distractions when he plays for the Braves

Journalist Judd Legum who writes popular.info says he has obtained an internal email to that says Arkansas-based Tyson Foods which provides abortion coverage under its employee health insurance plan will provide travel expenses for those seeking abortions. The company has not commented publicly on its plans though a number of major corporations have made similar promises. This is in the face of threats by state legislators including in Arkansas to punish those who provide financial or other assistance to those who live in states like Arkansas where abortion is banned.

In 1982 Iowa Beef Processors Inc. a forerunner to Tyson purchased the then-vacant plant from Hygrade Food Products and remodeled it extensively. It was IBP's first venture into pork production.

Hygrade which had once been Storm Lake's largest employer made clear the pork plant wasn't doing well as early as 1978 and made plans to close due to a dwindling local hog supply increased operating costs and labor difficulties. It remained open for a time but by October 1981 with the plant losing money Hygrade closed it down. Roughly 500 jobs were lost.

Storm Lake civic leaders cheered IBP's $2.5 million purchase of the plant in April of the following year. When an IBP airplane landed at Storm Lake's airport on the day of the announcement they were met by an entourage of eight cars plus a police escort. Cheerleaders and a band played for the IBP delegation.

Hiring began in early September 1982 according to Journal archival information with a base hourly rate of between $6 and $7. Then-Iowa Gov. Robert Ray and U.S. Rep. Berkley Bedell were on hand for the occasion when the plant resumed operations that month under new ownership.

""There is a real positive attitude here. It's good to have the enthusiasm and support of the community"" Bruce Pautsch an IBP spokesman said in 1982 when hiring began at the Storm Lake plant.

IBP initially hired 350 employees for one daily production shift at the plant a Tyson spokeswoman said. Today the plant employs around 2300 and runs two production shifts and one maintenance and sanitation shift.

The plant has been expanded significantly from what IBP acquired 40 years ago -- it's now more than 300000 square feet. The sprawling facility was built in numerous phases: certain parts of the property date back to the early 1930s while other parts were built at various points between the 1940s and the 1990s. More recent additions were in 2016 and 2019 according to Buena Vista County property records.

Tyson would not disclose the amount of pork produced at the plant but a spokeswoman said it processes more than three times what it did in 1982. The plant produces fresh boxed pork products for retail and foodservice raw pork materials sent to case-ready plants (which take larger cuts of meat and prepare them into cuts for retail) and pork for export.

When IBP opened the plant in 1982 company officials expected 7000 hogs to be processed in an eight-hour shift.

IBP was acquired by Tyson in 2001 for $3.2 billion. (Tyson also operates a turkey complex in Storm Lake one of the largest turkey plants in the country which was acquired upon Tyson's purchase of Hillshire Brands for more than $8.5 billion in 2014. Tyson's turkey operations in Storm Lake employ around 750 people).

Mary Berg was 22 years old when she began a job with an IBP construction crew working on the remodeling of the pork plant. When the plant began production later that year she became a gam-cutter on the harvest floor.

""I came from Early Iowa and I was living in Sac City at the time. I was without a job and one of my best friends' dads said 'You'd better get up there if you want a job'"" said Berg now 62 and a training specialist at the plant. ""I went up right away and was hired right away.""

Berg is one of 10 current employees who've been working at the plant all 40 years Tyson has operated it. The others are Richard Zwemke Ivan Scwhaller John Wiley Jerry Morlan Ron Peters Mark Thompson Keith Benningsdorf Dan Coleman and Nick Lovan.

""When you're working in a place like that you become family. You work with everybody that many hours a day that many days a week they become your second family"" Berg said.

To celebrate the 40th anniversary Tyson donated more than 40000 pounds of meat to local food pantries and organizations and gave five donations of $4000 to five organizations: Upper Des Moines Opportunity CAASA Ready Set Grow Storm Lake Police Department’s Mini Pitch Project and the Storm Lake Rotary Club.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL255Y3MtOTktY2VudC1waXp6YS1qb2ludHMtY3V0dGluZy1iYWNrLW9uLWluZ3JlZGllbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NYC's 99 cent pizza joints cutting back on ingredients,"They’re trying to stretch their dough.

As inflation skyrockets NYC’s iconic 99 cent pizza joints are cutting back on mozzarella and marinara sauce in order to keep serving up slices for only a dollar customers griped to The Post.

“It doesn’t have that real New York pizza taste” Jerry Johnson 30 said of the 99 Cent Fresh Pizza in Times Square. “They’re skimping on the cheese sauce everything.”

Chowing down on a dollar slice at the 2 Bros. Pizza on the corner of W. 38th Street and 6th Ave. Luke Ericson 38 said something was missing.

“If I was making this at home I’d definitely add more cheese” he said.

While customers have noticed a dip in quality others are just happy the cheap meal is still an option.

“I eat a slice here at least once a day. It’s delicious and affordable” said Alex Garay who lives in a homeless shelter and frequently panhandles outside a Midtown dollar pizza joint. “It’d be a lot harder for me if they increased the price.”

The Deck family from Lancaster Pennsylvania were on their way to a Broadway show recently when they stopped for lunch at a 2 Bros. for some dollar slices.

“Where we come from this is pretty good pizza – high and above what you can get for $5 back home” said Casey Deck.

Despite its popularity the dollar slice is becoming scarce. Some shops have had to increase their prices while others struggle to remain a bargain.

“If I increase the price I lose the customer” said Quadeer Khan who runs Best Fresh Pizza in Hell’s Kitchen which still sells cheese slices for just under a buck.

The Pakistani-born pizza maker and his brother took over ownership of the shop in December 2019 and have since been slammed with supply chain issues not to mention rising prices for cheese sauce and flour.

As of May the average cost per pound of cheese was $5.90 compared to $5.33 during the same time in 2019 before the pandemic according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Natural gas shot up from up from $1.04 per therm to $1.57 a pound of flour had gone from 45 cents to 46 cents and a pound of tomatoes remained the same at $1.82.

“My profits are much lower and it’s hard to survive. I might have to close up shop soon” Khan said.

Now a Big Apple staple dollar slice shops only began popping up in droves around the Great Recession in 2008. The business model was all about volume instead of profit margins and quality pizza.

Even before the current economic downturn dollar slice shops had a limited shelf life said Scott Wiener the pizza aficionado who runs Scott’s Pizza Tours.

“We’ve started to hit the point where all these 10 or 15 year leases are up” he said. “So it’s not just the cost of ingredients that is increasing. Rent is going up too.”

Weiner said having the dollar slice disappear would be a blow to the city.

“There’s something to be said for living in a city where your rent is an arm and a leg but you can feed yourself for a few bucks” he said. “It’s kind of beautiful. It’s the dichotomy of New York City: It’s big and expensive but there’s a way to get by.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY29jYS1jb2xhLXRlYW1zLXdpdGgtZGotbWFyc2htZWxsby10by11bnZlaWwtbmV3LXVuZXhwZWN0ZWQtZmxhdm9yLTEzMjc0MjIxMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola teams with DJ Marshmello to unveil new unexpected flavor,"Coca-Cola (KO) is teaming up with DJ and music producer Marshmello in a limited-edition offering.

In the FEI CDI4* Grand Prix Freestyle Sarah Tubman (Wellington Fla.) and First Apple rode an upbeat freestyle to receive a 74.565 percent from the judges. Tubman and First Apple a 2010 Dutch Warmblood stallion owned by Summit Farm showcased their excellent passage and trot work in the choreography floor plan as well as several movements highlighting a challenging degree of difficulty in the canter tour. Adrienne Lyle (Wellington Fla.) and Salvino a 2007 Hanoverian stallion owned by Betsy Juliano LLC were trending above 80 percent in their freestyle before the judges paused their test and upon inspection Salvino was found to have blood in the mouth and the combination was unfortunately eliminated. Lyle noted that Salvino warmed up without issue and felt fantastic before entering the ring and will be thoroughly examined by the veterinary team and is resting well back in the barn.



Ashley Holzer (Wellington Fla.) and Bliss a 2012 Oldenburg mare owned by Holzer and Diane Fellows rode in the FEI Intermediate I class and received a 70.00 percent from the panel completing their weekend of Small Tour competition.



Christian Simonson (Ventura Calif.) and Miki Yang (Los Altos Hills Calif.) both participated in the FEI Young Rider classes this week with Simonson riding Son of a Lady a 2011 Danish Warmblood gelding owned by Christina Morgan & Clifton Simonson and Yang aboard Donavan a 2009 Hanoverian gelding owned by Four Winds Farm.

Underpinned by a strong domestic economy which grew by 8.1% in 2021 China expanded its aggregate Tier 1 capital by 14.4% (versus 4.7% for the US) and total assets by 10.9% (versus 8.8% for the US).

With 140 banks in the ranking four fewer than in 2021 China now has more than double the Tier 1 capital ($3.38 trillion) and almost double the assets ($41.53 trillion) compared to the US with 186 banks. Overall China holds 32.5% of the world’s Tier 1 capital 26.9% of its assets and 28.7% of its pre-tax profits.

Joy Macknight editor of The Banker said: “It has been another exceptional year for China’s banking sector. In particular lenders at the top of the ranking are growing faster than their counterparts in other countries with nine of the 10 Chinese banks in the top 20 reporting double-digit growth in Tier 1 capital.”

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China held onto the top four spots in the ranking for the fifth year in a row. With Bank of Communications edging into 10th position Chinese banks now make up half of the top 10 for the first time.

ICBC has now spent a decade at the top of the ranking and is the first bank to record Tier 1 capital of over $500 billion ($508.85 billion). It increased Tier 1 by 15.7% in 2021 total assets by 8.1% and pre-tax profits by 11.1%. It now has more than double the Tier 1 capital of the largest US bank JPMorgan ($246.16 billion).

Global results

Overall the global banking system is better capitalised than ever before. The 1000 largest banks’ aggregate Tier 1 capital has surpassed $10 trillion for the first time in the history of The Banker’s Top 1000 World Banks ranking.

The total Tier 1 capital which is a key measure of banking strength has reached $10.38 trillion an increase of 4.7% year on year. In addition aggregate total assets have broken the $150 trillion barrier for the first time – at $154.21 trillion.

Global profits saw a healthy rebound with aggregate pre-tax profits reaching a record-breaking $1.44 trillion. This is a 53.7% year-on-year increase compared to a decrease of 19.2% in the 2021 ranking. However much of this boost in profits can be attributed to a reduction or reversal in last year’s credit impairment charges for expected loan losses that didn’t materialise.

Tier 1 capital is the core measure of a bank’s financial strength under the Basel regulatory framework.

James Robinson 50 was arrested Tuesday at a Mitchell Street convenience store after two Clovis police officers recognized his car as the one used in one of the robberies.

According to an arrest affidavit Robinson is no stranger to law enforcement. Clovis Police Lt. Trevor Thron said in reviewing Robinson's criminal history he had served time for a 1993 robbery in Lubbock and a 2001 aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon in Dallas. The Texas crimes motivated the FBI to take the Clovis cases Stover said.

The first Clovis bank robbery was reported just after 10 a.m. June 17 at the Washington Federal Bank at Manana Boulevard and Prince Street.

The suspect approached the counter took out a clear plastic bag and demanded the clerks put the money from their tills into the bag court records show.

According to the arrest affidavit the suspect made off with $3331.

The second Clovis bank robbery occurred at US Bank of Clovis 2501 N. Prince St. on June 27.

A US Bank employee told authorities she recognized the robber as the same man suspected in the June 17 robbery by photos she had seen on social media.

The suspect made off with $18508 from the US Bank robbery.

Witnesses said the suspect did not appear to have a weapon in either robbery. Witnesses also noted distinctive tattoos on the suspect's neck which helped police identify Robinson.

One bank employee said she followed the suspect after the robbery and saw him get into the driver's side door of a black SUV.

Thron said he and a Clovis police detective visited businesses in the area from the vicinity of the US Bank to Manana Boulevard and looked at surveillance footage.

Bit by bit officials built a description of the black 2018 Lincoln SUV with Texas plates that Robinson apparently drove from the US Bank robbery.

That SUV was spotted by two Clovis police officers Tuesday as they were northbound on Mitchell Street.

The officers made contact with the vehicle's driver and noticed his features and tattoos matched those of the bank robberies suspect. Records show Robinson made a run for his SUV but was apprehended by Capt. Robert Telles after a brief struggle.

After his arrest Robinson was transported to Plains Regional Medical Center where he was treated for high blood pressure and alcohol intoxication records show.

Robinson was also found to be in possession of 26 grams of a ""white crystalline substance"" that tested presumptive positive as methamphetamine.

Robinson is charged with two counts of robbery trafficking a controlled substance and resisting arrest.

The FBI did not respond to questions about the case.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vaGlzdG9yeS1ob21lLWVxdWl0eS1sb2Fucy01MzI0Mzg30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,History of Home Equity Loans,"Home equity loans have been around for nearly a century offering borrowers a way to cover major expenses such as home repairs medical bills and debt consolidation. Despite their long history however the popularity of these loans has waxed and waned over the past several decades. They’ve also evolved over the years to meet the needs of consumers looking for more flexible ways to borrow against their homes.

Here’s a look at the history of home equity loans including their rise to mainstream use in the 1980s part in creating the Great Recession and sudden decline at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key Takeaways Home equity loans have been around since the Great Depression though they were originally used mainly as a last resort for low-income borrowers with few other alternatives.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 helped ignite home equity lending taking away the tax deduction for interest paid on non-mortgage debt.

Home equity loans continued to surge in the 1990s and early 2000s with major banks rolling out large marketing campaigns that touted them as an easy way to turn your equity into cash.

The Great Recession of 2008 put a damper on their use and the COVID-19 pandemic restricted access to them but they still remain popular.

Originally for the Less Creditworthy

Home equity loans which allow homeowners to turn their home equity into cash have been around since the Great Depression although they were relatively uncommon at first. Lenders were primarily consumer finance companies and specialized second mortgage companies with depository institutions accounting for only about two-fifths of loans issued. Economic conditions caused many property owners especially farmers to be at risk of foreclosure and with sources of credit difficult to find the loans began as a way to stave off disaster.

For example if an individual owned a home valued at $100000 and only owed $50000 on their first mortgage a lender might allow the individual to take out another $25000 in the form of a home equity loan. Alas this second mortgage rarely helped in the long run as the Depression deepened and many people lost their properties. As a result home equity loans were equated with poverty and carried a social stigma.

Becoming Mainstream in the 1970s and 1980s

This began to change in the 1970s and 1980s. A number of factors contributed to their explosion in those decades including the fact that more depository institutions—including big-name banks—decided to get into the market.

Banks had certain advantages over finance companies including the ability to offer home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that consumers could access by writing a check. Suddenly homeowners had the ability to borrow only the amount they needed when they needed it rather than taking out a lump-sum loan. Depository institutions also tended to have an older client base than finance companies did with more equity from which to draw.

The popularity of these loans only grew with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which removed the tax deduction for the interest paid on non-mortgage debt. This in conjunction with comparatively low interest rates made home equity loans much more attractive than unsecured loans which you could no longer write off on your tax return. As a result the sector grew at a staggering pace. The total value of outstanding equity loans jumped from $1 billion in 1982 to $188 billion in 1988.



Marketed to the Masses by Big Banks

The 1986 tax law wasn’t the only force driving the explosion of home equity lending however. Around the same time larger banks were undertaking a concerted effort to change the image of second mortgages once thought of as a last resort for the financially troubled.

One of the first things banks did was to change their advertising terminology. Pei-Yuan Chia a former vice chairman at Citicorp who oversaw the bank’s consumer business in the 1980s and 1990s told The New York Times in a 2008 interview: ""Calling it a 'second mortgage' that's like hocking your house but call it 'equity access' and it sounds more innocent."" Citigroup introduced a campaign in the early 2000s urging homeowners to “live richly.” Banco Popular had a “Make Dreams Happen” ad campaign that used the slogan “Need Cash? Use Your Home.”

“Banking started using consumer advertising techniques more like a department store than like a bank” Barbara Lippert of Adweek told The New York Times in 2008. “It was a real change in direction.” What these marketing campaigns usually left out were the dangers that come with these loans including the risk of foreclosure for borrowers who couldn’t pay them back.

Playing a Part in the Great Recession

The market for home equity loans continued to grow through 2005 when the value of new HELOCs reached nearly $364 billion. At that point the growth of the market was fueled in large part by a lowering of credit standards which meant even customers with weaker FICO scores or high debt-to-income (DTI) ratios could often get approved.

This all changed over the next couple of years which saw a dramatic decline in home values and a corresponding surge in defaults engendering the Great Recession. As a result loan originations dropped off dramatically while banks tightened their lending guidelines. As the housing market slowly recovered equity-based lending began picking up though not at the pace experienced during the 2005 peak.

COVID-19 Slows Recovery

Home equity lending dipped again early in the COVID-19 pandemic with banks such as JPMorgan Chase suspending HELOC originations on April 16 2020 based on economic uncertainty and the tumultuous job market. Citigroup followed suit nearly a year later on March 3 2021.

Even with the job market’s recovery and Americans sitting on a record amount of home equity—$9.9 trillion at the end of 2021 according to the data firm Black Knight—both of these major banks have yet to resume new equity loans. Bank of America however has continued to offer HELOCs including a hybrid model with a fixed interest rate that can mimic a home equity loan. According to reportage by The Wall Street Journal it initially implemented tighter lending standards to mitigate credit risk but has since reverted to its previous underwriting policies.



The absence of multiple large banks from the market hasn’t prevented home equity loans from making a comeback in 2021 however. The prospect of continued interest rate increases has made lower-cost home loans more attractive leading to substantial growth in home equity loan originations and new HELOCs.



How Long Have Home Equity Loans Been Around? Advertisements for home equity loans date back to at least the Great Depression. Back then they were relatively rare and usually used by homeowners with no other way to pay off their debts. Their popularity surged in the 1970s and 1980s when larger banks began to offer them and Congress passed legislation that phased out the tax deduction for other types of interest payments.

What Were the First Companies to Offer Home Equity Loans? For much of the 20th century most home equity loans were primarily originated by consumer finance companies companies specializing in second mortgages and even individuals. By the 1970s however more-traditional banks were starting to add these products. As depository institutions they could offer equity-based lines of credit that consumers could access by writing a check.

How Did the Tax Reform Act of 1986 Affect Home Equity Loans? Among other provisions the Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed the tax deduction for interest paid on non-mortgage debt. This made home equity loans a more attractive alternative to other loans.

The Bottom Line

Home equity lending has been around for nearly a century although the industry didn’t really come into its own until banks started reshaping the image of these loans in the 1980s followed by Congress passing legislation that made them more attractive than other forms of borrowing. The Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic both put a damper on their use but as of today home equity loans remain a tremendously popular vessel for borrowing money.

Two Summit County locals have found ways to provide driving services outside of the confines of Uber and Lyft while also serving the community with the inspiration to keep drunk drivers away from the wheel.

Liz Copan / ecopan@summitdaily.com

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct Summit County Sheriff Jaime FitzSimons’ name.

Alexandra Moran says her boyfriend Daniel Stangroom loves how practical she is. Moran says Stangroom finds her smart logistical and able to make good decisions — like not drinking and driving.

Moran who has been driving for Lyft since November 2021 said it all started when she used to work at a restaurant in Keystone the Big Horn Bistro and Bar. While most of the people she hung out with would drink after work Moran said “I was the person who got six glasses of water at the bar and maybe a burger.”

So when someone realized that it was about time to go home there was no bus and it wasn’t safe to walk Moran was the obvious choice. At that point it was around 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. so she agreed with one stipulation.

“I’m going to politely ask for $10 for every person in the car” she said.

Her coworkers she said immediately took to the offer excited that a ride from her would be so much cheaper than an Uber.

“I was almost getting what I did in a serving shift doing two maybe 30-minute car rides max and making $100 doing it” she said. Therefore thinking she could make just as much she applied to drive for Lyft.

However she found out that it’s hard to make a noticeable income through Lyft.

For example Moran said one day just because she was curious she decided to look up how much an Uber ride would be from her home in Keystone to Bluebird Market in Silverthorne. It was $49.

Moran said the company she works for Lyft sets the rates for you.

“As the driver I may — from Silverthorne to let’s say Dillon — I only got $8 for doing that ride” she said about a hypothetical ride.

Therefore Moran decided to keep doing private rides on the side which were not only cheaper for her riders but also put more money in her pocket at the end of the day. Plus she said it gave her an excuse to be out and about while five months pregnant with her baby who is now 4 months old.

Another reason Moran wanted to stay in the driving business was the moral inspiration to keep those who may otherwise drink and drive safe.

Summit County Sheriff Jaime FitzSimons said in 2021 there were 121 driving under the influence charges — just from the Summit County Sheriff’s Office. This year from Jan. 1 to June 30 there have already been 89. FitzSimons pointed out that it looks like there will already be more in 2022 than in 2021 just based on the numbers from those first six months of the year.

As well as driving her coworkers home Moran said she saw many people accidentally drink too much when she worked as an employee at Basecamp Wine and Spirits. In 2022 Moran also experienced the loss of ex-boyfriend Jarrod Russell who died after a night of drinking.

All of these experiences inspired her to try to keep others safe.

“It’s just basic” Moran said “Hey it’s Tuesday in July wear sunscreen. And wear a jacket when it’s cold bring water when it’s hot and it’s not ‘just don’t drink and drive’ — it’s (knowing) when to stop.”

Andrew Siegel the owner of Summit Black Car started his private rideshare business this spring.

Siegel similar to Moran said one of the reasons he was inspired to start his driving service was because of how many driving under the influence charges he saw in Summit County.

“When I socialize I realize that people make the decision to get in the vehicle and drive because there aren’t any rides available” he said. “They try they try and no one is available.”

Not only did he see a lack of driving services in Summit County Siegel also experienced after just two nights of driving for Uber that working under one of the big companies did not offer much in the way of income. He also said that Uber also doesn’t allow the driver to see the location or the rate before they accept the ride.

That’s why he thinks many people don’t want to work for driving services in Summit County.

Until there are more drivers there are free resources in Summit County for those who need a ride like the Summit Stage. However Siegel said many of those services do not run up until the bars are closing down.

“Use the card with DoorDash Uber Eats GrubHub and any other food delivery service. You can even order food delivery with your local restaurants that use their own delivery service” the post states.

BitPay states in the post that its card allows “fee-free instant conversation of bitcoin or more than a dozen other other cryptocurrencies into dollars every time you swipe.”

Once approved BitPay account-holders get virtual Mastercard debit cards that can be used at “millions of retailers” according to the company. Account-holders also can use Apple Pay or Google Pay for in-person transactions.

They include buying gift cards for the food delivery companies with the card or using service such as Menufy or Takeaway.com.

BitPay states on its website that the cryptocurrencies that cardholders can use with their accounts include: bitcoin ethereum bitcoin cash dogecoin Shiba Inu litecoin  XRP Dai wrapped bitcoin Gemini USD USD Coin and Binance.

In a recent research report produced by a cooperation of PYMNTS and BitPay “Paying With Cryptocurrency: What Consumers and Merchants Expect From Digital Currencies” one of the findings was that for all the activity around cryptocurrencies businesses and individuals aren’t using them much for transactions.

Ten years later the results are bitter but the experience is useful.

It's a story of brothers cousins neighbors and buddies all seduced by a promise that Boubekeur on the median strip at the Place d'Italie in Paris on April 7 summarized as follows: ""They told us: 'Go ahead buy your 40000 euro car and you'll see you'll be independent!'"" ""They"" refers to both the friends and family of this 43-year-old driver and a Californian company the world's number one in the sector: Uber.

That morning as he left his apartment in the 15th arrondissement Boubekeur who prefers not to have his last name mentioned didn't open the app to pick up a customer in front of a porte-cochère or at an airport exit. He double-parked at a rally of VTC (chauffeur-driven transport car) drivers to protest among other things platforms that ""exploit"" drivers as fuel prices are soaring. There have been recurring protests in recent years but with modest success.

Around Boubekeur bundled up in his down jacket about 50 drivers had made the trip in the mid-morning. The man (with almost 10 years of service with Uber) watched as dozens of other VTCs drove through the streets of Paris unaffected by the calls for a strike. ""Some of them are just starting out in the business I get it"" he said. ""No matter how much I criticize Uber I still work with it... I know there's a paradox."" Over the years his income has dropped as ""Uber has brought in more and more drivers."" ""The piece of the pie has shrunk"" he said bringing his hands together. ""But they're still the world leader. If we want rides we have to go through them.""

A controversial arrival

Uber arrived in France 10 years ago in December 2011. The start-up caught people off-guard as everything was previously divided into two main groups governed by separate legislation. On the one hand there was the so-called ""grande remise"" universe: a high-end service of hiring private drivers in suits and ties in sedans for a very privileged or professional clientele. On the other hand there were cabs. Uber began by competing with the first market then the second.

The platform has been the subject of countless controversies from the 2015 ban on UberPop a private ride-hailing service to an ongoing investigation by Urssaf (a private French network responsible for collecting employer and employee social protection contributions) and the gendarmerie for ""concealed work"" related to the self-employed status of drivers. However it made its name in France to such an extent that it provided the Larousse French dictionary with a new noun: ""uberization.""

Givens-Moore's prison term will be followed by 5 years of supervised release.

The carjacking and attack happened on August 30 2021 when he requested a ride using Uber — the driver picked him up and started driving towards his destination.

The driver was proceeding on her route when Givens-Moore asked her to pull up to an apartment complex off the designated route. He then pointed a Glock .40 caliber pistol in the driver's face.

While Givens-Moore was holding the gun to her face he moved into the passenger seat. He then demanded she give him her vehicle if she wanted to live.

The driver pleaded with Givens-Moore to not steal her vehicle. He then tried to push her out of the vehicle while hitting her in the head multiple times with his pistol.

The constant hits to her head caused her to almost lose consciousness and be seriously injured.

Givens-Moore was successful in pushing her out of the vehicle. He then fled from the apartment complex in her vehicle hitting other cars while doing so.

Residents of the complex saw the attack and called emergency services to report what had happened and offer help to the woman.

An officer from the Alachua County Sheriff's Office saw the vehicle exiting the scene.

The officer then followed Givens-Moore who accelerated onto I-75 southbound.

Multiple officers were dispatched to assist with the high-speed pursuit during which Givens-Moore exceeded 110 mph while driving recklessly.

When Givens-Moore tried to take the I-75 Micanopy exit he lost control on the shoulder of the exit ramp.

ASCO deputies arrived to see his vehicle stuck. They then removed him from the vehicle.

After searching the vehicle they found the loaded Glock .40-caliber pistol with an extended magazine.

Jason R. Coody United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida gave his take on the sentence.

""The horrific beating and armed carjacking perpetrated by this recently released felon is beyond the pale and he is unquestionably deserving of the imposed sentence"" said U.S. Attorney Coody. ""Due to the valiant efforts of the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation this violent felon has been held accountable for his continued criminal conduct and our community is safer as a result.""

Givens-Moore had been released from the Florida Department of Corrections only three months before this carjacking.

There were supervisions resulting from those convictions at the time of this offense.

The FBI chose the case for federal prosecution and further investigated the circumstances of the case.

The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Chris Elsey.

Givens-Moore had two armed robbery convictions and an attempted robbery conviction in 2017.

There were prior felony convictions including grand thefts of automobiles and burglary."

And though she hardly needed to prove herself in that regard the multifaceted artist and entrepreneur is still making a name for herself in an entirely new way. It was just announced that Treslúce Beauty Becky G’s beauty brand would be landing at Ulta Beauty with products immediately available on Ulta.com and in stores March 13 2022.

Remezcla had a chance to talk to Becky G about what Treslúce Beauty means getting not just a seat at the table but owning the conversation and testing all her products. It was clear from the first moment of our conversation that this is a project very close to Becky G’s heart. The brand which launched in June 2021 is the kind of undertaking that feels like a long time coming for her.

“My beauty journey started when I was a little girl and my mom would let me express myself through the artwork of beauty makeup especially” she shared as she contemplated the reason for Treslúce. The name which is a mashup of two Spanish words: tres and luz Becky’s lucky number three and the word for light is kinda magical even if we stick to the literal translation of the word “luz.”

There is however another meaning. In Spanish it’s a very common compliment to say so and so “te luce bien” or looks good which is the meaning Becky G wanted to give to the word “luz” in the case of Treslúce. This brand looks good on her – on us. It’s something that makes the name and the brand feel even more representative of our communities.

“I’m Spanglish speaking there’s no one or the other it’s both of them” she added as an explanation one that also informs the products the packaging and the way both languages are present. There’s a certain pride in that because “instead of it feeling like an identity crisis it feels like a superpower that I want more of our youth to be able to lean into.”

One thing that was made clear by our conversation is that Becky G is very aware of the fact that our communities have been for a long time avid consumers in the beauty space but we haven’t always been communicated to in the most authentic ways. For her there’s a reason for this.

“We know in our communities that not all Latinas look the same” but that hasn’t necessarily translated to products or marketing instead “there’s been this kind of one size fits all mentality when it comes to Latinas.”

Treslúce is then an attempt to create a brand that embraces the uniqueness in our communities as well as our differences while highlighting what does unite us which is our culture and how proud we are. And Becky G doesn’t want to be the only one instead she hopes to see many more Latine women-owned beauty brands.

“We should be owners in these conversations we should be participating in the product development and the creating of all of these things that represent us” she told us.

And Becky G though she hadn’t been able to confirm it before has done the hard work behind the scenes and is committed to her brand. So much so that on the cover art for her latest song “Mamiii” both she and Karol G are wearing Treslúce. Which just makes us even more excited to try the products out. If Becky G can wear it and wear it proudly that makes us feel like we can too.

Treslúce Beauty will be available online at Ulta.com beginning today and in 351 select Ulta Beauty store locations on March 13 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFrZXVwLWFydGlzdC1ob3ctdG8taW1wcm92ZS1iZWF1dHktcm91dGluZS10by1tYWtlLWNoZWFwZXItMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Makeup Artist Shares How to Make Beauty Routine Better Cost-Efficient,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

As someone who loves wearing makeup for the fun of applying it I've wanted to learn how to make my usual look last longer and appear smoother without drastically changing my routine.

To do so I consulted with Alyssia Chang a makeup artist who's taught masterclasses for MAC Cosmetics Tom Ford Beauty and Chanel and asked how I can improve my usual beauty routine.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

My biggest goals in changing my makeup were to find better ways to apply foundation and blush stop my mascara from flaking maintain glittery dramatic eye-shadow looks and prevent my lip gloss from fading during the day.

Chang offered advice on how I can slightly change the steps I was already doing and taught me how I can make my products last longer and save me from frequently rebuying some items.

I was using too much product in my pre-makeup skin-care routine

Skin care is the first step in my makeup routine. Erin Ajello

Before makeup I focus on caring for my skin. I typically apply a layer of Neutrogena's SPF 55 to my entire face before adding anything else and Chang approved of sunscreen being the first step.

""A chemical-based sunscreen like this product works best by fully absorbing into the skin and not having another product layer block it from being fully efficient like moisturizer or serums"" Chang said.

Next I apply First Aid Beauty's anti-redness serum to my forehead and cheeks and Chang agreed ""less is more"" with this product. Focusing on specific areas rather than my full face will allow the serum to target these spots and means I'll get more use out of the product.

A serum from First Aid Beauty and a moisturizer from Dermalogica prep my skin. Erin Ajello

I finish my pre-makeup skin care with Dermalogica Clear Start cooling aqua-jelly moisturizer. I usually apply a dime-sized amount but because my skin is on the drier side and this product is meant to combat oily texture Chang told me I'm using too much.

""If you apply more than this it may not perform as well or affect the overall look of the face makeup"" Chang said. I was surprised to hear this though admittedly I had never checked the application instructions before.

Her tip reminded me that I could find ways to use my products (especially expensive ones) more efficiently so they'll last longer.

Chang gave me a few tips to create a more natural eyebrow fill

I like to fill in my brows so they appear thicker. Erin Ajello

Next I'll apply some lip balm and fill in my eyebrows with the Ulta Beauty sculpting brow pencil. I keep my eyebrows fairly thick so my face doesn't look too feminine and typically apply the brow pencil more heavily on days when I want a more masculine look.

I usually apply in the direction of the hair grain but Chang recommended doing the opposite for a section of the brows.

""Go against the hair grain to fill in the last half of the eyebrows"" Chang said. ""It'll feel weird but by doing this you are getting the perfect fill from root to tip.""

I also don't tend to use the spoolie side of my eyebrow pencil but she recommended that I start because it can help shape the hairs and even out the pencil formula.

She said using it will also ""push down the formula so that it wears well throughout the day.""

I can upgrade my eye-shadow looks by using a primer and a blending brush

I like to create a cat-eye shape. Erin Ajello

Next I do my eye shadow so that any fallout can be easily brushed away before I apply foundation. Colourpop's Good as Gold palette is one of my go-to products because it has the neutral browns and bright golds I love.

I usually go straight in with eye shadow but Chang recommended I start using a primer for ""making the eye makeup last longer and achieving a well-blended shadow.""

Colourpop's Good as Gold palette is one of my go-to eye-shadow products. Erin Ajello

I typically start by applying a shade close to my skin color all over the lid which Chang said helps when blending the rest of the eye shadow.

She also recommended I add a blending brush to my tool kit — though my packed-bristle Elf eye-shadow brushes are useful for depositing color and defining the shape they don't create a polished seamless look.

To finish off the eyes I'll add a winged eyeliner shape fill in the waterline and apply an inner-corner highlight.

Not replacing my mascara often enough was causing my biggest makeup pet peeve

I typically use two mascaras to make my lashes appear thick and long. Erin Ajello

For my lashes I typically start with Tarte's Maneater to separate and lengthen my lashes and then go in with the brand's Big Ego mascara to make them darker and thicker.

Chang agreed that using two mascaras can help build the kind of lash look I want.

I love Tarte's Maneater and Big Ego mascaras. Erin Ajello

But at this point if I don't blot my mascara onto a tissue I'll end up with smudges on my face later in the day. Chang said this might be happening because my mascaras are too old or dry from not replacing my products every two to three months.

""If you do not hear the mascara wand make a 'kiss-smack' sound when you take it out of the tube then it is dried up or too old and needs to be replaced"" Chang said.

After taking Chang's advice I haven't had any fallout problems.

Changing how I apply foundation can make my skin look more natural and save time

I typically apply dots of foundation to my face. Erin Ajello

Next I'll wet my Real Techniques sponge and apply dots of the Maybelline Fit Me Matte and Poreless foundation to my entire face and blend it in.

This has been my favorite foundation since it doesn't oxidize on me but I've noticed it separates and makes my skin look dry if I apply a bit too much.

I'll apply a Maybelline foundation with the Real Techniques sponge. Erin Ajello

Chang told me I could prevent this cakey look by pouring some foundation on the back of my hand and using the sponge to apply a small amount to my face.

I won't need to move around the dots of product directly applied to my face so this method could also save time.

Chang gave me some pointers for applying a bright highlight and subtle blush

I usually go for a look with a bright highlight and subtle blush. Erin Ajello

I use the Tarte Weekender palette for blush and highlighter. A bright highlight is one of my favorite parts of wearing makeup and Chang recommended I use my finger to apply the product directly to the bridge and tip of my nose and the cupid's bow to make it pop.

I don't feel confident when applying blush so I'll usually skip it or I'll add a very small circle of product to my cheeks.

Chang gave clear instructions for where the blush should lie on my face for a subtle look.

""Stipple starting from the hairline where your cheekbone is and blend by sweeping the brush towards the nose but lift off the face where the apple of the cheek is"" she said.

I love having an easy method for knowing exactly where to apply blush because it encourages me to incorporate this product into my everyday looks.

I learned how to keep my lip gloss from fading throughout the day

I'll throw on some gloss to keep my lips moisturized and add some color. Erin Ajello

I apply two swipes of Fenty Beauty's Gloss Bomb almost every time I do my makeup. This is my favorite lip product but I've noticed that it fades on me throughout the day especially when I'm eating or drinking.

The Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb is one of my favorite lip products. Erin Ajello

To avoid this Chang suggested overdrawing my lips with the gloss. She said I can use my ring finger to smudge the remaining gloss onto the center of my lips as the product on the inside fades.

Changing how I use setting powder and spray can help my makeup last longer

As the final step in my makeup routine I'll put on some setting spray. Erin Ajello

Next I apply the Nyx HD Studio Finishing powder with a large brush. Though this is usually the second-to-last step in my makeup routine Chang recommended brushing this on right after applying foundation.

""This will help set your foundation and all the face products you used before so that it doesn't move"" she said.

This could also help my blush and highlighter to blend better and last throughout the day so I won't have to reapply both products.

I lock everything in place with a Nyx finishing powder and an Urban Decay setting spray. Erin Ajello

Finally I apply the Urban Decay All-Nighter setting spray. Though I usually just spray this on my entire face Chang also suggested applying it to specific areas with my Real Techniques sponge.

""Tap that concentrated amount in any area that tends to crease move or transfer"" said Chang.

Overall Chang's tips helped me improve my makeup and stopped me from overusing products

I was surprised to learn that there are so many ways to improve my beauty routine. Erin Ajello

Chang's critiques introduced me to new ways of applying the products I already know work well for me.

Using less moisturizer serum and foundation creates a smoother more natural look and means I won't have to frequently repurchase these products.

I can't wait to incorporate more makeup tips into my future looks. Erin Ajello

Learning new methods for applying brow product and a hint of blush also gave me more confidence in my beauty routine. Replacing my mascara solved my fallout problem and resolved my biggest makeup annoyance.

I hadn't realized how much a few small changes could improve my usual look and I'm excited to keep using these tips in my makeup routine.

In August Cornell Eugene Williams 23 and Emmoni Ann Walden 18 stole fragrances valued between $3000 to $5000 the DA's office said.

On two days in February Walden and a juvenile stole more than $12000 worth of perfume. Later in February Williams and Walden stole another $5335 in fragrances from the store aided by a driver waiting in a car.

A tracking device with the stolen merchandise led Ventura County Sheriff's deputies to the suspects prosecutors said.

Williams had already pleaded guilty to a felony count of commercial burglary. On Friday he was sentenced to a year in custody and a year's mandatory supervision and ordered to pay $8335 in restitution to ULTA Beauty prosecutors said.

People across the U.S. are expected to fly in the highest numbers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic for the July 4 holiday weekend stressing a beleaguered transportation system experiencing tens of thousands of cancellations and delays.

Nearly 8000 flights within into or out of the U.S. were delayed on Friday and 587 were canceled. Another 2100 were delayed and 523 canceled as of around 11:20 a.m. in New York on Saturday according to FlightAware.com.

July 4 travelers might also have to contend with bad weather. Thunderstorms are on tap for a stretch of the East Coast from Washington to Boston on Saturday. Further south Tropical Storm Colin formed “unexpectedly” off the coast of South Carolina according to the National Hurricane Center.

The Transportation Security Administration said it screened about 2.5 million passengers at U.S. airports on Friday in what it expects to be the year’s busiest travel weekend yet.

As many as 12.3 million people are expected to pass through airport security between June 30 and July 4 according to the Chaddick Air Travel Bulletin by DePaul University — about 8% more than on Memorial Day weekend in May the traditional kickoff of the summer travel season.

Passengers are being asked to shell out hefty prices for tickets despite the increasing likelihood of hassles as airlines try to wring out profits amid surging costs. Domestic fares are expected to average $437 round-trip the highest in five years according to travel app Hopper Inc.

“Unfortunately the summer of 2022 is going to be a very unpleasant one for far too many airline passengers” said Henry Harteveldt founder and travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group.

U.S. carriers are eager to show that they can be reliable during times of heavy demand but have struggled to cope with travelers returning to the skies after two years of COVID-19 foiling summer plans. Airlines huddled with Biden administration officials this week to game plan for the days ahead.

From May 27 through June 30 the seven largest U.S. airlines scratched 2.7% of flights or 13783 according to FlightAware.com. Another 25.3% or 126620 were delayed for an average 50 minutes. Using a conservative estimate of 100 passengers per flight that means at least 14 million travelers have been affected over the past five weeks.

By comparison in the same period in 2019 1.7% of flights were canceled and 19.4% delayed.

Mounting frustration

Delta Air Lines Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian apologized Thursday to customers for an “unacceptable” level of flight disruptions this summer an unusual step that reflects mounting frustration among waylaid travelers.

In a letter to members of Delta’s frequent flier program Bastian warned that “things won’t change overnight” despite the airline’s efforts to improve. The apology followed Delta’s unusual offer to let passengers change travel plans across its network during the “potentially challenging” holiday without paying a fare difference or change fee.

On a recent flight from Michigan to Minnesota Delta said it would give $10000 to eight passengers who would give up their seats on the oversold plane and offered immediate payment for those with Apple Pay according to a magazine writer who said he was on the plane. (He didn’t take the offer.)

Offering passengers money to give up a seat on an overbooked flight is one of the tools gate agents have to take care of customers and get aircraft out on time a Delta spokesman said. He wouldn’t confirm the $10000 offer.

After a 15% increase in passenger complaints this spring Transportation Department Secretary Pete Buttigieg has pressed carriers to adopt more reasonable summer schedules. Airlines and regulators have been at odds over who is most to blame for the recent disarray with carriers pointing in part to air-traffic-control staffing shortages.

The Federal Aviation Administration held a call with airlines Thursday to discuss minimizing disruptions.

“We look forward to continuing to work closely and collaboratively with the federal government to address a range of shared challenges including inclement weather not only over the holiday weekend but year-round” Airlines for America the lobbying group for major carriers said after the call.

The FAA didn’t immediately comment.

Despite the growing frustrations U.S. airline stocks haven’t done much worse than the broader market. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines Industry Index is down 24% this year compared with a 21% drop in the S&P 500 Index. But as concerns about the economy deepen investors and analysts are wary.

“Airlines have a pretty poor track record during recessions and I would not recommend the group at this point” said Rob Anderson investment research analyst at Ned Davis Research.

Limited alternatives

About 74% of leisure passengers who took or planned a flight from May 20 through Sept. 12 said they regret their choice to fly according to Atmosphere Research’s second-quarter U.S. Travel Survey. But there are limited alternatives in the U.S. for medium- to long-distance trips Harteveldt said.

On top of higher demand a persistent pilot shortage at regional carriers has led to flight reductions and cancellations. Weather a deficit of airport workers and employees out sick with COVID have also snarled traffic. Delta American Airlines Group Inc. United Airlines Holdings Inc. Southwest Airlines Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. have pared their summer schedules to try to smooth out bumps.

Airline seat capacity remains about 7% below 2019 while demand this weekend will reach 93% of pre-pandemic levels according Cirium data cited in the DePaul report. With planes packed that means travelers on canceled flights could have trouble securing another seat.

“The difference with this holiday lies in the sheer magnitude of the travel volumes” said Joseph Schwieterman who authored the DePaul report. “If cancellation rates hit 6% industrywide as they did on certain days in the recent past the problem would likely reach crisis proportions with tens of thousands of passengers being stranded for a day or more.”

Domestic round-trip fares are up 45% from 2019 and the highest since 2018 Hopper said. Flights out of the country are averaging $1200 up 31% from before the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm56aGVyYWxkLmNvLm56L3Byb21vdGlvbnMvYmUtaW4tdG8td2luLXJldHVybi1mbGlnaHRzLWZvci10d28tdG8tbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMvWlc0NEQzR1g2WkgzVk1VUkxLNzNURDVPUlkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BE IN TO WIN!

UPS,United Parcel Service,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYmVzdGxpZmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL3VzcHMtbWFpbC1zaXplLW1haWxib3gtbmV3cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USPS Warns You Not to Drop This Kind of Mail in a Mailbox,"There are a number of ways you can send mail through the U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) system whether you're stopping by your local post office or sticking it in your mailbox with the flag up. But many of us just rely on the agency's iconic blue collection boxes to drop off mail. If that's your M.O. you might be distressed to learn that they could soon be a thing of the past. According to Linn's Stamp News the number of these mailboxes has been dwindling with USPS spokeswoman Kimberly A. Frum telling the magazine that there were just 147000 blue collection boxes left as of May 2021.

For now however you can still use those mailboxes with ease—but that doesn't mean you can put just anything in there. In fact many people don't realize what's restricted from collection boxes and could end up paying the price. Read on to find out what the USPS is warning you not to drop in its blue boxes.

READ THIS NEXT: USPS Is Making This Unprecedented Change to Service Starting June 20.

The USPS has faced recent concerns over its collection boxes.

The dwindling number of blue collection boxes is not the only problem the USPS is facing with its mailboxes. Last month four U.S. senators sent a letter to U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy slamming the Postal Service for concerns over rising instances of mail theft occurring with these mailboxes.

""Reports that thieves are accessing USPS Blue Collection boxes to steal and then sort through mail to identify checks that they then use for personal gain are deeply troubling"" the senators wrote in their letter. ""Americans use the Postal Service to mail checks to pay their taxes and bills; they should not have to worry that those checks may be stolen.""

But thievery aside there are drawbacks to these mailboxes that people should be aware of.

There are some types of mail you can't put in these mailboxes.

According to the USPS there are actually restrictions on what can be deposited in its collection boxes when it comes to size. The Postal Service says that any mail that weighs over 10 ounces or is more than a half-inch in thickness is ""not allowed"" in the blue collection boxes unless it has postage from a postage meter strip.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

Per the agency postage meters print postage directly onto mailpieces or onto meter tape and are leased by authorized providers for use in your home or office. ""To use a Postage Meter you must obtain a permit to do so in the city of mailing"" the USPS explains.

The average person sending mail will need to be aware of the restriction: Both domestic or international mail that is only marked with postage stamps must weigh 10 ounces or less or be less than one-half inch in thickness in order to be shipped using a collection box.

Your mail could get returned to you if you don't send it correctly.

The USPS says that ""all mailpieces that are not acceptable for deposit in a collection box"" must be taken to the post office for processing. But don't try tossing these into a self-service dropbox in the lobby of the post office either. If you have mail that weighs more than 10 ounces or measures more than a half-inch in thickness with only postage stamps it ""must be brought to an employee at a retail counter in a Post Office"" the Postal Service says. And for those who ignore this restriction ""mail deposited incorrectly will be 'Returned to Sender' for proper deposit"" the agency notes.

Overall if you're not sure if your mail can go in a collection box or if you find that it's hard to fit your shipment in one of these boxes you might want to bring it to the post office just in case. ""Customers should never try to force their packages into a collection box"" Frum recently told eCommercebytes.com. ""Rather they should take the packages to their local Post Office for mailing.""

There are others reasons your mail might get returned to you.

Sending your mail off the right way is obviously a major factor in making sure it gets where it's supposed to but there are lots of other reasons it could end up sent back to you. According to the USPS any mail without enough postage or mail that doesn't include a full or accurate delivery address is likely to be returned to the sender. You won't even know this has happened until it arrives back at your home as the agency says it ""cannot provide a notification if a mailpiece you sent is returned to sender.""

And even if you fix the issue your mail could be returned to you again if you don't use a new envelope. According to the Postal Service a ""Return to Sender"" mark is usually ""very prominent and is designed to be eye-catching."" Since postal workers and postal equipment usually only have a few seconds to look at a piece of mail before sending it through they may end up incorrectly processing it if that mark is still there.

""For this reason we ask that any returned mail upon being mailed again be enclosed in a separate (new) envelope with new postage to ensure prompt processing. This also helps to avoid mail being returned to the sender a second time"" the USPS warns.",,,,,,,,,,,,

They were about the age of his young son who was happy at home.

Were all these kids really better off hospitalized?

""I just thought: 'This is all wrong. The incentives in this business are to fill beds and to see more patients and to spend more money'"" Ellwood said in a 2019 interview with the Star Tribune. ""And so that began a career of trying to reshape the incentives of the American health care system.""

Ellwood went on to develop a new form of health insurance in the 1960s and 1970s that he called the health maintenance organization or HMO. It was an idea that rose to national prominence from a Twin Cities think tank he established called InterStudy ultimately located on Christmas Lake in Excelsior.

The push for HMOs helped make the business of health care today a key pillar of the Twin Cities regional economy. Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group — the state's largest company by revenue — and other industry players can trace their origins to Ellwood's big idea. He died June 20 at an assisted-living facility in Washington at the age of 95.

""Many of the folks who started and ran some of the first HMOs in Minnesota came out of InterStudy"" said Jan Malcolm the state health commissioner who worked with Ellwood in the 1970s and 80s.

""Minnesota from early on was sort of a hot bed of innovation in health care delivery and in reform ideas"" Malcolm said. ""I do think it's fair to attribute a lot of that to Paul and InterStudy.""

The idea was to stop paying a fee for every discrete medical service provided by doctors and hospitals. Instead of this ""fee-for-service"" system health care providers would receive a per-patient sum paid in advance an arrangement that Ellwood believed would prompt doctors to efficiently manage care for groups of patients. One goal was to provide financial rewards for caregivers who helped patients stay healthy.

Ellwood arrived in the Twin Cities in the early 1950s for a pediatric neurology internship at the University of Minnesota. He soon found himself in the unexpected position of running the Sister Elizabeth Kenny Institute a Minneapolis facility that was busy at the time treating hundreds of polio patients.

Soon the public health triumph of the polio vaccination created a leadership dilemma for the young physician — there were so few patients to treat the hospital was practically empty.

Ellwood and colleagues shifted the institute's focus to comprehensive rehabilitation needs but the facility struggled again financially as clinicians became more skillful and patients didn't need to stay as long for care.

After admitting a number of children with learning disorders who likely didn't need to be in the hospital Ellwood heard their cries and had his epiphany: The incentives in health care needed to change.

Ellwood often was called the ""father of the HMO"" even though some groups that took the name health maintenance organization — like Kaiser Permanente in his home state of California — had been around for decades.

HMOs were embraced by President Richard Nixon's administration as a response to growing health care costs in the wake of Medicare's launch in the mid-1960s. The federal Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 helped drive adoption of the new health plans and it was ""no accident"" Malcolm said that employers and medical groups in the Twin Cities led the way.

Doctors at St. Louis Park Clinic created an HMO called MedCenter. In time it merged with Group Health — a prepaid health plan launched in Minnesota in 1957 — to create what's now Bloomington-based HealthPartners.

At the Hennepin County Medical Society physicians approached Ellwood for help developing their own HMO. He connected them with a researcher at InterStudy named Richard Burke who helped launch the non-profit Physicians Health Plan. Burke's company Charter Med which provided management services to the HMO eventually became UnitedHealth Group.

In time Physicians Health Plan merged with another local HMO to create Medica the health insurer based in Minnetonka.

""It was kind of a golden age for care improvement and enhancement — and that would not have happened without Ellwood. He triggered it"" said George Halvorson who was a top executive at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota at the time before becoming CEO at HealthPartners and then Kaiser Permanente.

In the 1980s Ellwood was a trusted advisor to former U.S. Sen. David Durenberger R-Minn. who led bipartisan health reform efforts during his Senate tenure.

""We were convinced by Ellwood and then by a few others that the health maintenance organization was the way to go"" Durenberger said. ""The emphasis should be on health maintenance and the rewards in the system ought to be for keeping people healthy as much as curing their ills.""

By the 1990s Ellwood had moved to Wyoming where he created what came to be known as the Jackson Hole Group a regular meeting of policy experts — including some from Minnesota — whose ideas informed the health reform push by President Bill Clinton. They promoted ""managed competition"" where partnerships of insurers and health care providers would compete to sell services to health insurance purchasing cooperatives.

But as the Clinton health reform idea moved forward Ellwood distanced himself from the proposal because he felt his ideas ""were just getting warped"" said Barbara Ellwood his wife. The Clinton plan was never adopted.

In 1997 Ellwood told the Star Tribune that despite Minnesota's reputation as a testing ground for managed care the state was ""a long way from"" being a model for the country because health plans were failing to compete on quality rather than price.

By the late 1990s there was a strong national backlash against HMOs amid criticism that health plans were profiting by blocking patients from needed care.

Like so many visions Ellwood believed the reality fell short of its noble intent. For HMOs specifically the measurement of patient outcomes got short shrift.

In the end Ellwood lamented that the HMO movement simply ""created more and more of a focus on money and how to game the system"" Barbara Ellwood said.

At the conclusion of a 2010 interview that reviewed his career Ellwood asked: ""Would you like to be labeled 'The Father of the HMO'?""

To Kip Sullivan a long-time Twin Cities activist for a single-payer health care system the HMO push was flawed from the start because Ellwood wrongly attributed health care inflation to excessive use of services rather than runaway prices. The emergence of large powerful health plans prompted hospitals to consolidate Sullivan said resulting in bloated administrative costs.

Lynn Blewett a health policy researcher at the University of Minnesota said Ellwood advocated for the state's model of well-coordinated and integrated health care and believed in principles at the heart of today's push for ""value-based care."" But she added in an e-mail: ""I don't think he could have predicted how these core principles would be co-opted by for-profit health care.""

Today millions of people are still covered through HMOs but features that made the coverage distinct in the 1970s and 1980s have been incorporated into standard health insurance. Other HMO goals — like the emphasis on preventing illness and measuring health outcomes to promote quality — just haven't been baked into the business model with coverage Malcolm said.

""It was a movement back then"" Malcolm said. ""HMOs were the reformers. They grew up to be the system but back then they were the rebels pushing for change.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWVmaGVhbHRoY2FyZWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS5jb20vdmlldy9tZWQtbW92ZXMtbWVtb3JpYWwtc2xvYW4ta2V0dGVyaW5nLWFubm91bmNlcy1uZXctY2VvLWFuZC1tb3Jl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MED MOVES: Memorial Sloan Kettering announces new CEO and more,"Selwyn M.

In this first “Conversations with Jody” feature she talks to Community Voices editor Jody K. Biehl about the end of Roe and what bans on abortions in dozens of states will mean for California Santa Cruz and for her personally.

Have something to say? Lookout welcomes letters to the editor within our policies from readers. Guidelines here.

Laetitia Oderman has never spoken publicly about her work.

She is an OB-GYN physician at Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF) and one of the two doctors in Santa Cruz County who perform second-trimester abortions.

I spoke to her on June 25 one day after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision to reverse Roe v. Wade. States across the nation (I counted 31) are enacting legislation to limit abortion in various ways and I figured Laetitia would be able to give me — and you — an inside informed look at what the reversal and the changing state laws will mean for her for the patients she treats in Santa Cruz and for others across the country who might be coming to California to seek help.

When Roe fell eight states immediately banned abortions. Five others will have bans in place within the next few weeks. More than half our country will soon see tighter restrictions particularly on second-trimester abortions.

California will be a big outlier.

We along with 19 other states and Washington D.C. are enacting legislation that will likely protect abortion rights. There is talk of becoming an abortion “sanctuary” state.

In this interview — the first of a new Community Voices series of “Conversations” — Laetitia talks about the terrible predicaments her patients face. And she helps explain why they and soon perhaps many more might seek second-trimester abortions.

She talks about why it’s sometimes hard to get an abortion in Santa Cruz County the conversations about Roe she has had with her two school-age children and the personal toll the work takes. And she cites a groundbreaking UC San Francisco study that compares the lives of women who have had abortions to those who were denied care.

You notice I refer to Laetitia by her first name. That’s part of the informal nature of this new feature. I’ll be meeting people in person — usually over coffee or some beverage of their choice — and I’ll try to capture the mood and feel of our conversation.

For instance Laetitia is petite warm and energetic. She is dressed in sports clothes. She has long dark hair she keeps trying to wrangle into a baseball cap. As we talk I see how passionately she worries about her patients and the hurdles they face.

We met at 11th Hour Coffee on the Westside. When I arrived she was talking animatedly to a woman with a toddler. A patient she tells me as she and the woman hug goodbye.

We find a table and talk for 90 minutes making her late to meet her family and friends. She drinks a latte and neither of us notices that her avocado toast never shows up.

She’s a real Californian — except she was born in France and lived there until she was 8. She fell in love with Santa Cruz while an undergraduate at UCSC During those years she worked at Planned Parenthood’s Santa Cruz office. She went to medical school at UC Davis and did her residency at UCSF where she met her mentor Jennifer Hastings a family practice doctor at Dominican Hospital.

UCSF’s hospital had (and still has) a progressive OB-GYN residency with a family planning fellowship on site. “The social justice piece is embedded really deeply into the curriculum” Laetitia said. “It has one of the only abortion clinics in California that goes out to 23 weeks and six days.”

That training — and her love for Santa Cruz — shaped her course.

Today Laetitia offers comprehensive women’s health services at PAMF. That includes advice on contraception — including implanting IUDs and Nexplanon (implanted in the arm) preconception counseling gynecologic surgery prenatal care births and when needed abortions.

She sees people at their most ecstatic and most anguished. Births. Fear of pregnancy. Infertility. Miscarriages. Abortions.

She sees dozens of patients a day and every day someone on her team of seven doctors will perform an abortion. Her team also includes six midwives but they don’t do surgical abortions.

Not yet. She thinks that’s coming particularly as the demand for abortions climbs in “sanctuary” states like California.

Currently most abortions — over 90% she says — in Santa Cruz County and across the country occur in the first trimester usually at under nine weeks. That could change soon as women have to wait longer and sometimes travel to other states to get care she says.

Some abortions — usually the women with the hardest stories — are already occurring later up to 23 weeks into a pregnancy.

She understands it’s “gory” and hard to think of ending a pregnancy that late when a fetus is more formed but what people miss she says and what is missing from our national dialogue are “the conversations happening in the exam rooms” the disenfranchisement these women face and the hurdles that prevent them from getting care. Few have any doubts about their choice she says.

“They are 100% clear this is what they want and need” she said.

Laetitia shares what she can here without violating patient confidentiality.

When we met she was late to join friends her husband a social studies teacher and their kids at the Westside farmers market.

But she made time — a lot of time — to talk to me to us.

I edited this interview for clarity.

Jody: We are here on a Saturday the day after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. You are a busy doctor and have a family that doesn’t see you nearly enough. Yet you are having coffee with me. Why did you feel that we needed to talk today?

Laetitia: Well I needed something productive to do with this deep sadness that I have that I feel for women mostly poor women and women of color who I think will be impacted the greatest by this decision. And just to sit around and not feel I’m making an impact was unthinkable. I want to help give them a voice.

Jody: Tell me about some of the women you treat the ones you want to give a voice.

Laetitia: Every story is different but often they are women who in general didn’t know they were pregnant initially and then had barriers to access health care whether it be financial or other. Maybe they didn’t have insurance. They may be immigrants.

I had a patient not long ago who was a new immigrant from Mexico. She didn’t know she was pregnant. She fell jumping over the border wall shattered her ankle and found out she was pregnant when she went to the ER for her ankle. She didn’t know she was pregnant because she hadn’t had voluntary sex. She had been probably drugged and raped while coming across the border.

And so yeah this is a rather extreme example of the fact that women who are seeking second-trimester abortions are generally not what people might think. It’s not that they didn’t take birth control or that they are putting it off or flip-flopping on their decisions. They may have had birth control failure. They may have had difficulty accessing health care due to finances and work/childcare issues. They may be in an abusive relationship. It’s mostly that they’re in these horrifically challenging situations.

Jody: In some cases women are ill and are choosing between their own lives and the lives of their babies right?

Laetitia: Yes. Those are almost the easier cases. It’s easy to pull people’s heartstrings when I talk about my patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer. The cancer is hormone receptor-positive and if she doesn’t terminate the pregnancy she’s risking her life and the life her existing child would have without her. I have lots of those stories.

And stories of women who really want their babies but whose water breaks before 23 weeks which risks them becoming septic or dying of a bad blood bacterial infection if they don’t terminate the pregnancy. There’s really almost zero chance of survival for the fetus. And so again in some cases we’re talking about a life-saving abortion.

There are of course other cases of women who really want their babies but the baby has a severe genetic and/or anatomic abnormality. It can take until 22-23 weeks to confirm this kind of diagnosis. Some of these are severe enough not to be compatible with life.

It’s really easy for people to get behind that or abortion in the case of rape or incest. And I really want people to take away from this the importance of really protecting the privacy of the conversations that happen behind closed doors between a woman and her physician. I want to emphasize that women seeking second-trimester abortions which is my major concern are often the most disenfranchised and need our support and care the most even in California. And so how do we really even in our most progressive states how do we fight to keep second-trimester abortion legal?

We women are going to have to be resourceful again. I say again with sadness I never thought I would see this in my lifetime. This is just to go backwards. Backwards in human rights which is really what this is. It’s a woman’s rights we are talking about.

Jody: There are arguments about when to cut off abortions often counting in weeks. How do you look at those debates?

Laetitia: Gestational age — the number of weeks — you know is it 15 weeks 14 weeks 13 weeks that’s so arbitrary. Especially because we’re a country where we don’t have universal health care. It’s not easy to access care. It’s expensive and it’s logistically challenging. And we don’t support the children once they’re born and you know we don’t provide a good safety net like many other countries do.

The most important thing is the double whammy of no universal health care and putting these arbitrary limits on women. Who can say when a woman is going to figure it all out and get to a health provider?

Jody: How easy is it to access abortion care in our county?

Laetitia: It’s actually quite hard. Even just the process of getting in to see a medical professional is daunting and challenging and then they might go to one provider who says “Oh it looks like you’re too far along for me you’ll need to go somewhere else.”

But then how do they even find out where that somewhere else is? It’s not like there’s a public directory of abortion providers in our community for safety reasons. So yeah second-trimester abortions are a small number compared to the rest of the care I do. But they’re always the women who need our care the most.

And it’s the question of what happens if care is denied. For me it’s both a question of pushing women to have children they don’t want but also what happens to those children? Statistically what we’ve seen is that those kids don’t fare well. And in fact there are higher incarceration rates higher mental health issues and higher poverty in many cases. Women who are already in precarious financial situations are then forced to have babies. Having that baby often puts them below the poverty line.

Jody: Do studies show this?

Laetitia: Yeah I was actually just pulling up this maternity study which is the Turnaway Study by the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at UCSF. It was published in the last few years [starting in 2013 and as a book in 2020] .

We had always assumed — and those of us who provide abortion care always knew — that women in horribly difficult situations who get turned away for abortions end up in dire circumstances just based on our circumstantial understanding of their lives. But this was the first study to really quantify that. It’s the first study to rigorously compare the effects on women who received abortions with the effects on women who sought abortions but were denied them.

It involved 1000 women from 30 facilities across 21 states and they conducted interviews over five years and compared the trajectories of women who received abortions for unwanted pregnancies to those who were turned away because they were past the facilities’ gestational age limit.

And so what they found was that abortion does not harm women. It does not increase their risk of having suicidal thoughts or developing PTSD depression anxiety low self-esteem or lower life satisfaction. And over 95% of women said abortion was the right choice for them in retrospect they were more likely to have a positive outlook on their future and aspirational life plans within a year.

And most women gave multiple reasons for seeking abortion including all the things we talked about. Finances timing issues with a partner need to focus on their own children need for education.

So here’s the crux here: Women denied an abortion had almost four times greater odds of household income below the federal poverty level and three times greater odds of being unemployed.

And at the five-year mark [the women denied abortions] had an increased likelihood of not having enough money to pay for basic medical basic family necessities like food housing transportation. Also if they were denied an abortion they were more likely to stay in contact with violent partners putting them and their children at greater risk than if they had received the abortion.

I want to emphasize that women seeking second-trimester abortions which is my major concern are often the most disenfranchised and need our support and care the most even in California.

Jody: So the impact is not just on the mother but also on other children she might have?

Laetitia: Yes. exactly. Existing children of women denied abortions were more than three times more likely to live in households below the federal poverty level. And they were less likely to achieve developmental milestones than the existing children of women who received abortions.

So it’s huge huge huge huge. And I again I worry the most about women poor women women of color who historically have not had access to abortion.

When it was illegal these sort of back-alley abortions that we knew about in the ‘60s before Roe were happening. And again now late-term abortions are needed for poor people because of delayed access to health care. They are more likely to seek abortion care in the second trimester when many states — even progressive states — will probably outlaw abortion. Just from a lack of understanding really.

Jody: Why do you say lack of understanding?

Laetitia: Well I think most people have this misconception about health care. Those of us who are wealthy enough to have health care and easy access to medical care we find that if we’re pregnant we get a pregnancy test we go to the doctor we get an ultrasound. We know. I think we assume that that’s how easy it is to access health care for others.

And that’s just not the case. Even in our own community. I see women who are 14-15 weeks pregnant. It literally took them six weeks just to get to me. They were 100% sure of their decision they just could not get to the right care faster.

Jody: Is that because they couldn’t get an appointment or is it because they didn’t know how to get to you?

Laetitia: Yeah often they didn’t know they were pregnant. You know not everyone has regular periods. And so you might be six eight weeks before you find out you’re pregnant. And then they had to go get a pregnancy test to confirm. Then they didn’t have health insurance. So then they have to navigate like how do you apply for MediCal if you are pregnant? Do you Google that?

And then what? Do you go to the county building? Maybe there’s a huge line or maybe you’re working that day or you don’t have child care or you wait in line for two hours but you can’t wait in line for the third hour.

Then you have to fill out all the paperwork which includes proof of income and then you have to make an appointment and maybe that appointment isn’t for one or two more weeks because of the impact of COVID-19 on staffing in medical clinics locally or because of backup. And then by the time it’s your turn you’re too far along for that clinic to service you and maybe they don’t know where to refer you.

You can quickly see how a week turns into two weeks turns into three weeks etc. And that’s in California in progressive Santa Cruz County. So I can’t imagine what the hurdles will be like for women elsewhere. It’s heartbreaking.

Jody: And in Texas and possibly elsewhere there are laws that ban abortions after six weeks but that also includes measures to allow residents to sue clinics doctors nurses and even people who drive people to get the procedure for up to $10000.

Laetitia: It’s beyond my wildest imagination to criminalize the process of helping someone and to turn doctors into criminals. It’s just … it’s all something I never thought I’d see in my lifetime. I always knew that women — I’m 46 — women of my generation we had maybe an earshot of what it was like pre-Roe. But doctors in my generation have never seen women turning septic from illegal abortions. And now I think that’s a very real possibility.

Jody: And how do you think this is going to affect us here in Santa Cruz where both the city and the county passed resolutions supporting women’s rights to abortion and in California where we have clear abortion-rights protections in place? Are we going to see a large influx of people coming in? Are you expecting to see a lot of people from states where abortions are outlawed?

Laetitia: I assume there will be an influx and we’ll need to step up and be prepared for that. Again I worry the most about women who won’t be able to travel. You can just imagine again the logistics of finding out where to go in another state you’re not familiar with. You can’t just easily access this kind of health care. Again there are no public directories for this kind of care.

So these are women who are in their free time cold-calling and trying to figure out where to go. Many of them have multiple children already. And then they have to figure out the cost of travel and a hotel in a city where they’re not a resident or maybe don’t have family to stay with and no one to watch their kids. Plus even if you have insurance then you’re accessing care that’s both outside your state and that’s not considered emergency care. And so they’re paying out of pocket.

The hurdles are huge. We’re really talking about rich women traveling. So I think there will be an influx yes. But unfortunately I don’t think it will be enough to make a dent in the need for care because poor women are not going to be able to jump many of those hurdles.

It’s beyond my wildest imagination to criminalize the process of helping someone you know and to turn doctors into criminals. It’s just … it’s all something I never thought I’d see in my lifetime.

Jody: And again the consequences will be national in poverty levels education levels domestic violence incarceration rates …

Laetitia: Yeah so much. Including children’s developmental milestones. The ripple effects of this are hard to fathom. It’s… it’s too much to think about. It’s … it’s heartbreaking.

Jody: And what about you as a parent of two kids in elementary school? How do you talk about this with your kids?

Laetitia: Yeah I mean my kids are pretty politically savvy just because their dad’s a social studies teacher and I’m a reproductive justice health care worker. So they hear a lot. My younger child had a really just kind of matter-of-fact response and said “The government shouldn’t be able to control what we do with our bodies.”

She wasn’t spoon-fed that. It was just her natural response. She said it with this dumbfounded look. It’s sad to think about how geographically my kids may be limited and where they choose to live. And yet they’re lucky. They have health care and — I just keep going back to this — my kids themselves will not be impacted. I hope this is fuel for them to be leaders in the charge and the fight for human rights. Because I think you know I’m certainly not an expert in constitutional law by any means but to read Justice [Clarence] Thomas’ concurring opinion overturning Roe they’re coming for birth control and LGBTQ rights next.

Jody: Do you see yourself — or other doctors and health care providers from California and other pro-abortion states — perhaps in the near future traveling to other states or to the outskirts of other states to make health care accessible to women who need it?

Laetitia: I hope so. I hope there will be doctors like me who dig deep to fill that need but there’s security and safety concerns about doing that and potential legal implications and licensing issues.

I know in Poland there was a boat that floated in international waters providing abortion medicine. So yeah I think we’re gonna have to be creative about solutions to keep women safe. What that looks like it’s hard to know yet. I’m certain there’s lots of people much smarter than me who are scrambling to figure out how to keep women safe across the country. And I hope I can get involved in whatever capacity.

Jody: They are already there on social media. There are women using code words to let each other know they are ready to help each other travel for abortions.

Laetitia: Wow. Yeah well we women are going to have to be resourceful again. I say again with sadness I never thought I would see this in my lifetime. This is just to go backwards. Backwards in human rights which is really what this is. It’s a woman’s rights we are talking about.

Jody: Are you concerned about talking publicly about what you do? Do you worry about safety?

Laetitia: Yeah. In fact for many years I didn’t talk about it didn’t out myself if you will just because I was concerned about my own family’s safety and the potential safety repercussions. But I just feel this duty to speak up now. I mean I definitely had conversations with my family about what it could mean for them. And my husband was like of course you have to do it … he’s definitely a feminist. And my kids were like of course you have to do it but I do worry.

Let us not forget that the day before the Dobbs decision (which reversed Roe) the Supreme Court declared that private citizens can legally conceal and carry hand guns in public places pretty much anywhere. I knew George Tiller an abortion provider who was murdered while attending church services [in Wichita Kansas in 2009].

The threat to our safety is real. And we are here just trying to help women.

Jody: What would you say to someone who firmly believes this is a human life? This is our nation’s big debate — the issue that has pulled our country apart for decades. It’s hard to argue against belief but what would you as a doctor say?

Laetitia: This really gets into the ethics of abortion and when does human life begin. What is the value of an unborn human life? I would say it’s a beating of cells to a certain point that it isn’t a heart until it’s fully formed. That is my physio-anatomic response my “doctor sort-of-science response.”

But again we’re comparing the value of unborn unformed life to that of a fully formed full human. It’s the difference between potential life and life. The living woman who has connections and relationships. She has sisters and parents brothers and kids and aunts a partner and friends. She may have other kids. To me the answer is clear. I value the life of the woman.

I would say that at a minimum I hope we can find collective agreement that abortion is harm reduction. Right?

History has proven that women will seek abortion regardless of whether it is legal or not. They will go to great lengths to end pregnancies they are not prepared to continue. And so do we want to keep it safe or not? And I would say we have to we have to keep it safe.

Now documents obtained through an access to information request show that in the 1960s activists in the province in favour of the idea that would become medicare were being surveilled by RCMP amid fears they may be communist sympathizers.

The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act came into force on July 1 1962. Years later it would become the template for the nation's universal health care.

But documents obtained by Dennis Gruending a former CBC journalist and member of Parliament who is now an Ottawa-based author show the RCMP considered the bill's supporters communists.

""The RCMP was very fixated upon what it considered to be a threat from communism"" Gruending told Shauna Powers host of CBC's Saskatchewan Weekend in an interview Saturday.

The surveillance happened during the Cold War when tensions were high he noted — and many people were under suspicion.

""The RCMP throughout that time spied on members of the Communist Party but the police also cast a much wider net to basically spy on pretty well anybody with progressive tendencies.

""So the RCMP chose in 1962 to confuse support for medicare with support for the Communist Party.""

In 1962 the RCMP opened a file into the supporters of the Saskatchewan bill calling it ""Medicare Plan Saskatchewan — Communist Activities Within"" the documents Gruending obtained say.

RCMP kept tabs on local and international doctors according to the files.

LISTEN | Dennis Gruending on his discoveries from an access to information request:

Saskatchewan Weekend 12:35 60 Years of Medicare in Saskatchewan This month marks the 60th anniversary of Medicare in Saskatchewan. But it wasn't smooth sailing in the early days. In fact the RCMP spied on the doctors who were striving to make it work. Dennis Gruending has been exploring this history and he joins host Shauna Powers to share some of what he found.

Gruending said that included physicians who travelled from Britain to fill the gaps left by doctors who walked out in response to the introduction of the bill as well as local people establishing clinics with doctors who were sympathetic.

Sally Mahood's mother — Margaret Mahood — was among those local doctors.

Sally Mahood now a doctor in Saskatchewan herself described her parents as advocates and activists for progressive ideas at that time.

She remembers the time as one marked by an important social struggle in the province with the organized medical profession opposed to medicare and others — like her parents — fighting in support of it.

Her mother was one of the two physicians who didn't go on strike in Saskatoon.

""It was a very tense time in the province"" she said adding she has ""memories of my dad having to ride shotgun with my mother when she would go out on house calls.""

Mahood said while some might find the RCMP's surveillance surprising it doesn't come as a shock to her.

While her parents may not have known about it she doesn't believe they'd be surprised either.

CBC ARCHIVES | Sask. doctors walk off the job to protest the universal health plan:

The 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike Duration 1:53 Saskatchewan's doctors walk off the job to protest the province's universal health-care scheme. Aired July 1 1962 on CBC-TV's Newsmagazine.

Mahood said she hopes that people learn from the recent revelations and think about who police might have under surveillance now and what social values those people may be fighting for like racial issues.

""What distresses me is that there's no accountability for the RCMP to justify why they're following ordinary citizens who are members of legitimate political parties doing legitimate political activism and they never have to answer for this behaviour"" she said.

After sifting through the more than 200 documents Gruending came away thinking ""the RCMP was out of control at the time. It went way too far.""

""There's an irony here as well — the RCMP thought it was protecting democracy but when I look at the documents and compare [them] to what happened I just don't see it that way"" he said.

""The introduction of medicare was actually a textbook case in democracy.""

Tommy Douglas Saskatchewan's premier at the time had been promoting his plan for medicare during the election explained Gruending who wrote a book on the introduction of medicare.

Douglas won that election and the bill was then debated in the legislature before it passed.

""So I don't know how the RCMP could have believed they were protecting democracy by spying on people promoting medicare"" said Gruending.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLW5ld2x5LWRpc2Nsb3NlZC1zdXJ2ZWlsbGFuY2Utb2YtbWVkaWNhcmUtcGlvbmVlcnMtcHV0cy10aGUtcmNtcC1vbi10aGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Newly disclosed surveillance of medicare pioneers puts the RCMP on the wrong side of history,"Dennis Gruending is an Ottawa-based author and a former member of Parliament from Saskatchewan.

Universal health care is seen as a core value of Canadians today but it wasn’t always the case. In fact a secret RCMP file that I obtained through an Access to Information request reveals the force’s deep suspicion of those who championed medicare in the 1960s with police spying on its leading proponents. It’s all laid out in a previously undisclosed file called “Medicare Plan Sask – Communist Activities Within.”

The RCMP and its political masters in Ottawa had an abiding fear of communism that began with the Russian Revolution in 1917. That obsession was magnified during the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919. It continued into the Great Depression during the Second World War and throughout the Cold War. During those years the RCMP infiltrated the Communist Party but also extended its scrutiny to progressives of any description. That explains but does not justify the surveillance placed upon the supporters of medicare in 1962.

It is remarkable that the RCMP perceived medicare as suspicious even communistic. The genesis and introduction of the plan were a testament to the democratic process. In 1944 Tommy Douglas and his Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) party promised that if elected they would introduce a program in which visits to the doctor would be tax-financed rather than having individuals take out their wallets. But the province they inherited was so deeply in debt that it took years to fulfill the pledge. The 1960 provincial election became a plebiscite on the issue and the CCF won handily. In 1961 the government tabled medicare legislation and it was debated in the legislature.

I was 14 years old in 1962 and lived in a Saskatchewan farming village. My parents were poor and my mother was ill but it took a long time for her to be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. That meant many visits to doctors and we could barely pay the bills. I have never forgotten that time and how important the newly implemented medicare program became for my parents.

The organized medical profession of the day was opposed to medicare and threatened to strike. People who supported the plan began to organize citizen-led community clinics and recruit sympathetic doctors to staff them. During a flurry of meetings in late June and early July to set up clinics the RCMP had informants in the room.

The Saskatoon subdivision prepared a 10-page report much of it now blacked out by censors for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. On June 27 1962 the report described “surveillance of a very discreet nature” at an organizing meeting at the Union Centre in Saskatoon. The document listed the names of many who attended including Ed and Margaret Mahood. He was a university professor and she one of two medical doctors who volunteered to staff the Saskatoon clinic in its first days. An RCMP corporal named R. L. Firby added an observation to the secret report. He wrote: “A very close watch is being kept on this group’s activities.” His report was forwarded to the RCMP commissioner in Ottawa.

The Saskatchewan government when confronted with a looming doctors’ strike began to recruit supportive physicians from Britain. The RCMP kept close tabs on them too. The first to arrive was Ida Fisher. The RCMP reported that she was “sent to Saskatchewan to lay the groundwork for socialized medicine in that province.” The commissioner’s office in Ottawa instructed the force’s liaison officer in Britain to gather further information on her.

The strike ended on July 23 after protracted negotiations between doctors and the government. But the RCMP kept community clinic proponents under surveillance for at least another six months. In January 1963 two teams of officers staked out a Regina home during an evening meeting of individuals including Ed Mahood who were organizing a provincial network of clinics. There was also surveillance on clinic organizers in Swift Current Estevan the Battlefords and other centres.

The Mahoods’ daughter Sally Mahood is a family physician in Regina and an associate professor of family medicine at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. She was in her early teens during the medicare dispute in 1962. She remembers it as a tense time.

I asked whether her parents knew they were under surveillance. “I don’t think so” she said. “They were involved in an all-consuming political struggle at the time. But they would not have been surprised. What distresses me is that the RCMP never has to account for why it harasses ordinary citizens engaged in political activity for good ends.”

It is the duty of every government to protect the health and safety of its citizens. At times that involves gathering intelligence on threats to the public. The crucial questions that arise relate to the intent the scope and the nature of those efforts. In their book Secret Service academics Reginald Whitaker Gregory Kealey and Andrew Parnaby described the RCMP security services as “always on the side of the political/economic status quo suspicious of those who would challenge the powerful and the wealthy.”

Often yesterday’s heresy becomes today’s best practice. It is almost impossible today to find anyone who would admit to opposing medicare in 1962. What the RCMP deemed a threat in Saskatchewan soon gained all-party support. John Diefenbaker appointed Emmett Hall to lead a royal commission into health care which in 1964 recommended the Saskatchewan model for Canada. Lester Pearson passed the enabling legislation in 1966 and made deals with the provinces and territories to implement a national plan by 1972. Community clinics in Saskatchewan were at first met with hostility by the medical profession but those clinics that survived have come to fit comfortably into the medical landscape.

Who are the heretics under police surveillance today? Environmentalists trying to awaken us from our sleepwalk to climate disaster. Indigenous defenders protecting their lands against development without consent. Before you dismiss them think of medicare’s pioneers. They were once the objects of suspicion. Today they are revered.

MANILA Philippines — Just a day shy of its 124th founding anniversary the Department of Health (DOH) celebrated yet another milestone as it passed the fourth and final stage of the Performance Governance System (PGS) last June 22.

The DOH was conferred the Institutionalized status and secured the Gold Trailblazer Award the highest PGS recognition from the Institute for Solidarity in Asia (ISA) during their virtual public revalida.

The Online Revalida is a virtual platform under ISA's Public Governance Forum where institutions can showcase their progress and milestones in the PGS pathway offering a closer look at how each public institution demonstrates competency in delivering premium and reliable service to the public.

In his opening message DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III addressed the multi-sector panel led by the panel chair Rex Drilon II and shared how this milestone brought DOH's commitment to making the Filipino people among the healthiest in the region closer to reality.

""We in general and in particular the incoming administration will continue to effectively lead the health sector towards achieving the promises of Universal Health Care for every Juan and Juana to have access to timely and quality health care without suffering from financial hardship"" Duque said.

DOH Undersecretary Mario Villaverde presented DOH's story of transformation since embarking on its PGS journey in 2009 underscoring the health agency's efforts in intensifying health promotion strengthening health emergency responses and streamlining procurement and chain management systems for vaccines among others.

Among the noteworthy improvements in health services include the launch of the ""BIDA Solusyon Plus sa COVID-19"" which aims to mitigate virus transmission in homes communities and institutions; the creation of the One Hospital Command Center to improve patient navigation; and its action in vaccine delivery which has resulted to more than 70 million fully-vaccinated individuals from March 2021 to June 2022.

In his acceptance speech Duque dedicated their success to the frontliners in the pandemic response and the men and women of DOH.

""[We thank] all our health care and entire frontline workers for their fortitude and unwavering service. And we dedicate this we honor [and] give due recognition to all our health care workers who have been at the front and center in all of our pandemic response"" he said. ""This is a tribute that is to be shared to the entire department all of its attached agencies all for the centers of health development and every public health care worker including the local government units.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdGFyLmNvLmtlL25ld3MvMjAyMi0wNy0wMy13aGljaC13YXktZm9yLWVhYy1zZXh1YWwtYW5kLXJlcHJvZHVjdGl2ZS1oZWFsdGgtYmlsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which way for EAC sexual and reproductive health Bill?,"A week ago EALA members embarked on the final leg of their consultations on a draft law meant to protect and facilitate the attainment of sexual and reproductive health and rights of people in the East African Community (EAC).

The East Africa Community Sexual and Reproductive Health Bill 2021 (EAC SRH Bill 2021) according to its proponents seeks to come up with a harmonised way of protecting the right to the sexual and reproductive health of all persons in the region.

It also seeks to push for the related information and services as part of the universal health coverage in all partner states.

The Bill was first introduced to the regional Assembly in February 2017.

It was however withdrawn after gaps were identified.

A revised edition is now back and the sponsor and mover of the Bill EALA MP Kennedy Mukulia in an interview with the Star says all gaps have now been addressed.

Nonetheless misinformation and failure of many stakeholders to understand the object of the Bill still exist – Mukulia says.

“Many people have reduced this Bill to two issues abortion and comprehensive sexuality education. The Bill is complete as it covers many aspects of sexual and reproductive health. So many people think the Bill is western which is a complete distortion. The bill is East African and for East Africans” he said.

Mukulia also serves as the Chairperson of the Legal Rules and Regulations Committee in the regional assembly.

In a wide-ranging interview with Star to unpack the myths here are the key highlights:

What motivated you to move this Bill?

I was motivated to move and sponsor the bill looking at the Addis Ababa Declaration on Population and Development in Africa beyond 2014.

The Declaration captures the commitment of African Ministers to among other things; develop strengthen and implement appropriate legislation national policies and programmes that guarantee and promote human rights dignity and equality for inclusive sustainable economic and social development in all sectors.

The Declaration also commits member states to harmonize national legislation with ratified international instruments and accelerate the implementation of the respective national regional and international commitments on gender equality and women’s empowerment in all sectors and eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls.

The member states are also committed to enacting and enforcing laws and policies within the national political and legal framework to respect and protect the sexual and reproductive health and rights of all individuals.

Finally the member states commit themselves to review revise amend or abolish all laws regulations policies practices and customs that have a discriminatory impact on women youth especially girls without distinction of any kind and ensure that the provisions of multiple legal systems comply with international human rights regulations and laws.

Have the member states started implementing what they committed themselves to?

This declaration has not been implemented by any of our partner states.

As such I felt obliged to sponsor the legislation to meet some of these declarations.

What is the status of sexual and reproductive health in East Africa?

The East Africa region has high maternal mortality and morbidity rates.

HIV infection rates are the worst with 15 per cent of maternal deaths in East Africa attributable to HIV.

Moreover family planning is an elusive goal for many women.

More than two-thirds of women of reproductive age are currently not using modern contraceptives and more than a third of all pregnancies are unwanted.

What do you make of such trends?

These trends are worrying as such there is a need to enact a law that prioritises sexual and reproductive health including maternal health family planning prevention of sexually transmitted infections including HIV young people’s access to sexual reproductive health information and services and ending female genital mutilation.

Through this Bill I want to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.

Is this Bill all about legalizing abortion?

The Bill is a comprehensive proposal that addresses a wide range of sexual and reproductive health and rights issues including ending teenage pregnancies and new HIV infections.

The Bill also seeks to end gender-based violence and female genital mutilation.

It seeks to end discrimination against people with HIV persons with disability and elderly persons as to access to information and services.

It also provides for the sexual and reproductive health and rights of men– which are often left out in the discourse.

On the issue of abortion partner states of EAC differ in the way termination of pregnancy is to be treated under the law.

For example the Constitution of Kenya states that abortion is only permitted if in the opinion of a trained health professional there is a need for emergency treatment or the life or health of the mother is in danger or if acceptable by any other written law.

In Uganda the Constitution only permits abortion if it is authorised by any other law.

Article 22 (2) of the EAC SRH Bill 2021 therefore provides that a person may terminate a pregnancy if in the opinion of a health professional there is a need for emergency treatment the pregnancy endangers the mental or physical health or the life of the woman in the case of sexual assault rape incest or as may be permitted by the law of a partner state.

What challenges are you facing in your quest to have this Bill passed into law?

The challenges that I face which include opposition are driven by misinformation and the failure of many stakeholders to understand the object of the Bill.

Many people have reduced this Bill to two issues such as abortion and comprehensive sexuality education which is an incomplete snapshot of the contents of the Bill – therefore taking away from its essence.

The Bill is all-inclusive draft law with a wide range of issues as pertains to sexual and reproductive health and rights.

Additionally many people think the Bill is western[driven] - which is a complete distortion. The Bill is East African and for East Africans.

What are the prospects of EAC member states passing this Bill?

I am confident that the Bill will pass.

However we are facing complete opposition from one partner state.

Passing the Bill when a partner state will not ascend to it still makes no sense and failure to comply with treaty matters is a serious violation and such countries need to be punished.

It is therefore important that deliberate efforts are made to ensure everyone understands the object of the Bill.

Previously there were identified gaps in the 2017 Bill. Was this addressed?

During public hearing consultations for the Sexual Reproductive Health Rights Bill 2017 by the 3rd Assembly; gaps emerged including the need to have extensive engagements with a wide range of stakeholders to build consensus.

There was a need to ensure that the Bill does not contradict the existing sexual reproductive health rights laws in EAC partner states.

Upon reviewing the Bill alongside stakeholders the Committee on General Purpose at the East Africa Legislative Assembly resolved to cause the 2017 Bill to be redrafted to reflect and incorporate agreed positions fill in identified gaps and align with international practice and developments in sexual and reproductive health.

These comments were all reflected in this current Bill of 2021(under the 4th Assembly) and all the gaps raised were addressed through new clauses for example on menstrual health; sexual reproductive healthcare for men sexual and reproductive health for people with disabilities and elderly persons.

If you look critically at this Bill you will see differences it has from the 2017 Bill which is no longer a property of the House and should not be made reference to.

In its current form every person in EAC is protected and facilitated to attain a life-course sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as progressive realization of integrated sexual and reproductive health information and services."

Aunque los géneros originarios locales pocas veces han sobresalido como es el caso del regional mexicano las duras batallas en los ya popularmente predispuestos no han sido sencillas pero victorias sí se han obtenido.

Algunos cantantes latinos han vendido el doble de lo que otros americanos o ingleses han logrado incluso con las grandes limitantes y desventajas socioculturales. Especialistas en música apuestan que la clave del éxito se debe a la gran mezcla de culturas géneros e incluso realidades cotidianas que presentan países como Colombia o México sin embargo el talento que hay en la región sin duda alguna es el principal motivo para que algunas melodías en español conquistaran -y sigan haciéndolo- el mundo.

Por ello aquí te presentamos una lista con el nombre de cada uno de los intérpretes que han hecho historia en su lugar de origen y el resto del planeta pues sus altos números de ventas -y siendo la mayoría con el formato “orgánico” que comprende a CDs físicos y sus derivados- los han consagrado también como los artistas más populares y reconocidos.

No se podría iniciar este conteo sin el cantante hispanohablante más exitoso de todos los tiempos basándose en su número de ventas el español Julio Iglesias.

Con más de 50 años de trayectoria artística 67 álbumes de estudio y en vivo 200 singles y EPs y 41 recopilaciones Julio Iglesias ha venido un aproximado -última actualización en el año 2017 por la revista musical Billboard- 300 millones de copias en todos sus formatos siendo uno de los fenómenos en la historia general de la música más importantes que incontables artistas de mucho más renombre en medios tradicional o o digitales no poseen.

¿La clave del éxito? El cantante de grandes canciones como Me Olvidé De Vivir De Niña A Mujer y Lo Mejor De Tu Vida ha interpretado en 14 idiomas entre los cuáles resalta el inglés español y portugués. Por lo tanto ha dado shows en 600 ciudades del mundo conquistando los principales recintos de las metrópolis más importantes incluyendo Nueva York Río de Janeiro o La Ciudad de México lo que por obvias razones hace que Julio Iglesias se codeé con los artistas más populares de la orbe.

Julio Iglesias.

Dato curioso: en el 2014 el libro Guinness le entregó en Pekín un certificado por el récord del “artista latino que más discos ha vendido en el mundo”. En la misma ocasión le otorgaron un reconocimiento como “primer y más popular artista internacional” en China.

La colombiana más exitosa en la historia de dicha nación no podía quedar fuera de esta lista pues a pesar de que el número de discos a comparación del artista anterior es considerable su influencia dentro del mundo del espectáculo latino -como representante en el anglosajón- la ha posicionado como una de las más grande de la historia – y su actuación en el Super Bowl del 2020 lo respalda-.

“En el transcurso de su prolífica carrera la cantante y compositora colombiana Shakira ha vendido más de 60 millones de discos a nivel mundial y ganado numerosos premios incluyendo dos GRAMMYs ocho Latin GRAMMY y varios World Music Awards American Music Awards y Premios Billboard por nombrar solo algunos. Es la única artista sudamericana que ha logrado colocar una canción en el #1 en los Estados Unidos y cuatro de sus sencillos se han posicionado entre los 20 éxitos de mayores ventas de la década pasada” se puede leer en su biografía artística dentro del portal de su disquera Sony Music.

Es importante recalcar que para que Shakira lograra dar el “gran salto” tuvo primero que conquistar al Hollywood latinoamericano como lo llaman los grandes críticos de música profesionales de cine y televisión de habla hispana a la Ciudad de México.

La originaria de Cuba que ha conquistado norteamérica que además de cantautora es actriz y empresaria el 22 de junio de 1993 lanzó tercer álbum de estudio en solitario y primero realizado en español titulado Mi Tierra el cual se estima según Billboard vendió más de 16 millones de copias -conteo hasta el 2015- y la posiciona como uno de los más importantes y destacados en la industria.

Existen diversas recomendaciones que se hacen en redes sociales como tener monedas para cambio con las que se busca motivar ventas en el promedio de locales comerciales.

Ofrecer cambio ha sido por años una oportunidad clave en el emprendimiento de un negocio. Un testimonio en redes y proyecciones de Google Trends lo demuestran.

Apostar por recursos prácticos en la economía del día a día de un negocio como tener monedas para cambio motiva las ventas en un local y ayuda a estimular el flujo de caja donde se definen estrategias que los pequeños negocios tienen que desarrollar cada día más para garantizar la permanencia de sus locales en medio de situaciones cada vez más complejas como una economía débil la atención del consumidor distraída por la gran oferta de locales y productos a su mano así como una mejor cultura de administración de negocios pues en la medida en que se fortalece o debilita se generan resultados.

MONEDAS PARA CAMBIO

Las monedas para cambio son tan importantes que incluso en Google Trends protagonizan una importante tendencia de búsqueda y en redes sociales emprendedores que recurren a este medio para motivar negocios reconocen su importancia.





Como editor especializado en la fuente de negocios he tenido oportunidad de ser parte del emprendimiento de pequeños negocios donde he comprobado la importancia de contar con monedas para cambio en el flujo de cambio para dar la bienvenida a todo consumidor que llega a estos locales para hacerse de un producto sin importar la denominación de su efectivo o para hacerse de cambio siempre y cuando realice consumo en el local comercial al que acude.

Para garantizar monedas para cambio en un negocio hay simples tips que se pueden seguir. Uno de los más populares es acudir a puntos de venta donde es habitual el uso de monedas para pago como los adultos mayores que empacan en un supermercado o repartidores o despachadores de gasolina quienes cuentan con un importante volumen de monedas.

Otro tipo muy importante para hacerse de monedas es acudir a temprana hora por monedas para cambio a una sucursal bancaria donde es habitual que cuenten con un volumen importante de monedas con las que pueden abastecer tu caja base de cambio que necesitar para aceptar los pagos del día.

La importancia de las monedas para cambio es tal que incluso hay testimonios en redes donde se advierte que contar con monedas ha ayudado hasta para acabar con los malos clientes tal como lo contó Hola Soy ciri en su cuenta e TikTok donde refiere que una consumidora siempre acudía a primera hora del día a la tienda Oxxo que atendía como cajera para que le cambiaran un billete de 500 pesos por comprar una dona que mordía para evitar regresarla y obligar a los cajeros a cobrarle. Esta situación se mantuvo hasta que logró conseguir 500 pesos en monedas de 50 centavos para darle cambio a su billete lo que finalmente la disuadió de la práctica.

GARANTIZAR VENTAS

El flujo de caja en un local comercial requiere de una serie de prácticas que garanticen su operación y en consecuencia ventas para un negocio de lo contrario no se logra una cultura certera de administración de pequeños negocios y las expectativas de ventas así como de vida de estos negocios se reducen.

El fenómeno no es exclusivo de México también ocurre en grandes mercados como el de Estados Unidos con cifras de la NFIB que lo comprueban y lo más importante que revelan el peso que tiene partir del sentido común en la administración de un negocio de este tipo.

Dentro del estudio que compartió la firma esta encontró que la falta de ventas era uno de los 8 problemas que enfrentaban como pequeños negocios.

Tras el boom experimentado por los NFTs el año pasado cuando el precio medio diario pasó de 128 dólares a casi 4.000 dólares las ventas han caído hasta superar escasamente los 1.000 millones de dólares en junio su nivel más bajo de los últimos 12 meses.

No obstante las ventas de NFT en los seis primeros meses del año ya han superado las registradas en todo 2021 según Chainalysis. En concreto la cifra asciende a más de 42.000 millones de dólares frente a los 40.000 millones del año pasado. Durante los meses de enero -mes en el alcanzaron los 12.600 millones de dólares- y febrero tuvieron lugar más de la mitad de las ventas realizadas en lo que va de 2022.

Asimismo el desplome no ha afectado a todo el mercado de los NFT por igual. Mientras que el token del primer tweet del cofundador de Twitter Jack Dorsey ha pasado de subastarse por 29 millones a que nadie ofrezca más de 14.000 dólares la demanda del NFT más barato de Bored Ape Yacht Club solo ha caído un 1%.

Nuevo mercado

Dado que el interés de los inversores por las colecciones de NFT de primera categoría sobre todo de los tokens de Bored Ape cientos de titulares de estos activos han decidido crear un nuevo mercado de licencias para alquilar la propiedad intelectual de los mismos a marcas.

En Borejobs lanzado por el acelerador blockchain Mouse Belt las marcas podrán encontrar los 10.000 tokens de Bored Ape Yacht Club aunque no estarán disponibles para ser contratados hasta que sus titulares decidan poner su propiedad intelectual en alquiler. Una vez lo hayan hecho podrán recibir ofertas de las compañías para usar sus NFT en alguna campaña.

El mercado de licencias vio la luz el miércoles y en 24 horas recibió más de 200 solicitudes de titulares de Bored Ape Yacht Club interesados en registrarse asegura Patrick McLain cofundador de Mouse Belt a Cointelegraph."

Shopping for a cheap phone — even one of the best cheap phones under $300 — means making compromises and the TCL 30 V 5G exemplifies that trade-off. Buying this $299 phone is an exercise in deciding what is and isn't worth that lower price.

Want a long-lasting phone that keeps you connected to Verizon's fastest 5G network? Then you'll find the TCL 30 V 5G quite a bargain. Looking for a phone with a little processing muscle that's capable of challenging the cameras on other budget phones? You may want to keep shopping for your next phone.

Our TCL 30 V 5G review finds a budget handset that's a very mixed bag. Its appeal will depend on how closely the phone's clear strengths align with your wants and needs.

TCL 30 V 5G review: Price and availability

The TCL 30 V 5G appeared alongside other new TCL phones at CES 2022 arriving in the spring. When it did debut the phone landed as a Verizon exclusive. That's good news if you don't mind getting your wireless service from Verizon (and you shouldn't — it's one of the best phone carriers) since the TCL 30 V includes support for the C-Band 5G network Verizon is rolling out to more cities. Verizon's C-Band 5G will reach 175 million people by the end of the year with faster 5G speeds that have a wider reach than Verizon's initial mmWave-based 5G installations. As of this writing C-Band 5G covers more than 100 million people with Verizon's slower nationwide 5G reaching about 230 million.

Verizon sells the TCL 30 V 5G for $299 though you can pay $8.33 a month for 36 months to buy the 128GB phone in installments. Walmart sells a Verizon-tied version of the phone for $199.

Of course if you don't want to Verizon as your wireless provider the TCL 30 V 5G isn't an option for you. There's no unlocked version and you won't find it at other carriers.

TCL 30 V 5G review: Design

There's nothing about the TCL 30 V's design that will fool you into thinking this is anything other than a budget phone. The back of the device is plastic while also managing to retain fingerprint smudges. The vertical rear camera array is not very obtrusive as a narrow rectangle houses the TCL 30 V's three lenses but the array does jut out from the phone's back.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

A fingerprint reader is just to the lower right of the camera array making it properly placed to unlock the phone from behind. Even better it's a very responsive fingerprint reader quickly unlocking the phone without too many false readings. The Pixel 6 which costs $300 more could learn a lesson from TCL's phone. The TCL 30 V retains a 3.5mm headphone jack which you'll find on the phone's top side — good luck finding such a port on other phones these days.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

That's not to say every design decision for the TCL 30 V 5G pays off. The phone's curved edges make it somewhat hard to pick up when it's lying on a table and I think they might also make the device prone to slipping out of people's hands. The placement of the power button on the left side of the phone feels a little low to me as I often found myself hitting the volume button when I meant to put the TCL 30 V to sleep. Perhaps a little more time with the phone would improve my muscle memory.

TCL 30 V 5G review: Display

By now you should know that a cheaper phone doesn't restrict you to a smaller display. The TCL 30 V 5G uses an expansive 6.67-inch panel providing ample space for playing games watching videos and scrolling through online articles.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

If only the screen could be brighter when you do that though. Using a light meter we measured the peak brightness for the TCL 30 V 5G at 420 nits with adaptive brightness turned off. The OnePlus Nord N20 5G and Moto G Stylus (2022) — two phones in the TCL 30 V's price range — outshone it at 567 and 560 nits respectively. When using the TCL 30 V I found I needed to crank brightness all the way up to make out details on the screen and I wound up disabling adaptive brightness so the phone wouldn't dim when I returned to it later.

The TCL 30 V includes the company's Nxtvision features which can adjust contrast and colors in real time to take full advantage of the phone display's wide color gamut. I've been more impressed with Nxtvsiion on TCL's AMOLED phones as it didn't seem to make much of a noticeable difference on the TCL 30 V's LCD panel. Bright colors like the red panda in Turning Red seemed vivid enough on the TCL 30 V screen but darker scenes like a concert in Girls5Eva looked dim and indistinct even with the singers' bright outfits.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

In Vivid mode the TCL 30 V captured 121.7% of the sRGB color gamut and 86.2% of the more demanding DCI-P3 gamut. The Moto G Stylus which also features an LCD screen tallied results of 127.8% and 90.4% respectively and that's nobody's idea of a colorful display. At least TCL's colors were more accurate with its Dealt-E score of 0.23 beating out the 0.27 rating we recorded for Motorola. (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)

Some recent budget phones tout faster refresh rates — the Moto G Stylus offers a 90Hz display for example. The TCL 30 V features a standard 60Hz rate but a Smart Refresh State mode can downscale the refresh rate automatically to save power. (And save power it does as we'll get to below.)

TCL 30 V 5G review: Cameras

When you shop for phones in the less-than-$300 range you're tacitly accepting the notion that the best camera phones are beyond your budget. But you should at least expect competent photos and on that front the TCL 30 V largely delivers though with some glaring omissions.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The phone's main camera is a 50MP wide-angle shooter with an f/1.9 aperture. Other lenses making up the triple camera array include a 5MP Super Wide shooter with a 115-degree field of view and a 2MP macro camera. If you've read Tom's Guide phone reviews before you'll know we think that dedicated macro cameras don't serve much of a purpose other than to inflate a phone's camera count and the TCL 30 V's version will not be forcing us to rethink our position.

But let's focus on the more useful lenses first comparing the TCL 30 V's efforts to the photos captured by the Samsung Galaxy A42 a Verizon exclusive from a year ago that's still available for just $60 more than TCL's phone. If the TCL 30 V can match the output of this slightly more expensive phone you figure your photo needs will be in good hands.

We start off well with this photo shot indoors at a local taqueria where both phones capture the bright colors of my three-taco combination platter. The white onions topping the tacos look sharp and clean in each shot and the side of pickled carrot is a vibrant shade of orange.

I think the A42 does a better job of making the carnitas on the taco in the background look properly shredded — lost details in the TCL shot render that meat into more of an amorphous pile — but that's nitpicking the differences between the two phones.

The calculations change when sunlight enters the mix. Some unforgiving sun at a nearby fruit stand gives the Cara Cara oranges and Fuji apples too much of a glare in the TCL photo. As a result the image looks a little of focus. The A42 did a better job of balancing the mixture of sunlight and shade and its image looks more clear as a result.

I think the ultrawide lens on the TCL 30 V fares pretty well against the Galaxy A42 when comparing ultrawide lenses even if the Samsung phone captured more of the scene featuring my local movie house just before sunset. Both phones capture the rapidly diminishing blue sky (though there's a more noticeable patch of white on the middle right of the TCL photo) and the lit up theater marquee doesn't throw off either camera. The details on the theater's facade stand out a little more in the A42 shot but what the TCL produces is perfectly acceptable.

Neither phone has a dedicated telephoto lens so you're relying on digital zoom when you try to get closer to your subject. I set both phones at 4x zoom across the street from the theater and I was impressed by what the TCL 30 V produced. The lettering on the marquee remains legible and the lights are properly illuminated. There's a little bit of fuzziness around the sign because of that digital zoom but it's a perfectly acceptable shot.

Things get less acceptable when we test out the TCL 30 V's other features. When shooting a portrait photo of my daughter TCL's phone overly smoothed her face which seems obscured by shadows. It's a much lighter image that the A42 produces and you can make out facial details like the freckles on her nose. The TCL 30 V gets the background blur right but that's easy to overlook when the subject of the picture is so murky.

Selfies shot by the 16MP front camera on the TCL 30 V aren't much more appealing. Everything's more washed out in TCL's self-portrait — the brick background my green-and-gold hat even my skin. The Galaxy A42 goes a little overboard in making my skin so ruddy but at least its other colors are more accurate.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

I should mention that the TCL 30 V's camera does include an AI color mode that retains the color of the subject in your shot while turning everything else into a monochrome. The end result should be that your subject stands out and that's certainly happened thanks to the black-and-white background in this selfie. (Not that the phone had to take out that much color to begin with.) It's a nice-to-have feature as opposed to a must-have but at least it shows some picture-taking flair on the TCL 30 V's part.

I would have appreciated a night mode more but that feature's MIA on the TCL 30 V. There's no point in including a photo comparison as the TCL shot would just be a series of dark indistinguishable shadows compared to a phone that has a dedicated night mode. And these days that includes most budget phones save for maybe the iPhone SE (2022) — and that happens to be the most glaring omission on Apple's latest phone.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

For the sake of completeness here's a macro photo captured by the TCL 30 V. (The Galaxy A42 does not have a comparable lens so no comparison shot.) It's actually not a bad shot of the apples growing in my backyard if you're the sort who regularly snaps up-close pictures of nature. I'm not however and this image doesn't particularly inspire me to become that person.

TCL 30 V 5G review: Performance

A Snapdragon 480 5G chipset augmented by 4GB of RAM runs the show for the TCL 30 V. That's an older piece of silicon as it also powers budget phones that came out a year ago like the OnePlus Nord N200 5G. As a result don't expect earth-shattering performance even by the standards of discounted devices.

Still the TCL 30 V 5G's 1776 multicore result on Geekbench 5 edged out the Nord N200's 1602 result. (The newer Nord N20 5G with its faster Snapdragon 695 chipset outpaces both phones with a 1995 Geekbench 5 result.) In 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited test for graphics performance both phones produced lackluster scores of 5.8 frames per second. That's not exactly a gaming powerhouse though I was able to play PUBG Mobile on the TCL 30 V with only the occasional dropped frame.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Benchmark tests only tell some of the story though. Jumping between open apps on the TCL 30 V was more or less seamless though I've seen other budget phones handle multitasking with greater aplomb.

Video streaming on the phone was another matter with lots of videos suffering from laggy playback. Peacock's app had the most trouble with a lot of dropped frames and fuzzy resolution. Disney Plus at least gave me a clear picture though I could spot dropped frames during Turning Red. I didn't run into any problems at all watching YouTube videos.

Is this an issue with the apps themselves or with the TCL 30 V 5G's under-powered processor? Having not run into a problem with Disney Plus and Peacock on other budget phones I lean toward the latter. The TCL 30 V 5G seems peppier than the MediaTek Helio-powered phones that make up Motorola's recent budget Moto G releases but prepare for some laggy video on this phone.

TCL 30 V 5G review: Battery life and charging

If the performance on the TCL 30 V 5G disappoints the battery life does anything but. TCL equipped its budget device with a 4500 mAh battery and the phone certainly makes the most of that capacity.

On our battery test in which we set a phone's screen to 150 nits and then have it surf the web over 5G until it runs out of power the TCL 30 V 5G turned in a an average time of 11 hours 46 minutes. That places it on our best phone battery life list just ahead of the iPhone 13 Pro. That's a hard list to crack as the Nord N20 5G held out for an impressive 11 hours 20 minutes and just missed making the cut.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Enact that Smart Refresh State mode and the TCL 30 V 5G lasts even longer. When we turned on that mode battery life increased to 12 hours and 13 minutes. Suffice it to say you're going to go a long time between charges with the TCL 30 V.

Don't expect fast charging times when you do need to top off the phone's battery. Using an 18W charger the TCL 30 V took half-an-hour to get to a drained battery to 39%. The OnePlus Nord N20 which supports 33W charging reached 56% after 30 minutes.

TCL 30 V 5G review: Software

The TCL 30 V 5G review unit I tested is running Android 11. That seems odd as Android 12 has been out for around for nearly nine months now and we're drawing ever closer to the Android 13 launch later this year. Not that TCL 30 V owners need worry about Android 13 — they're only getting the Android 12 update and two years of security updates. That's tight even by the standards of budget phones.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Because the TCL 30 V 5G is tied to Verizon expect a lot of Verizon apps to come preloaded on the phone. In addition to the My Verizon app for managing your account there's four separate apps that deal with cloud storage security call filtering and voice mail. The phone also comes with preloaded utilities some of which duplicate the functions of the included Google apps.

TCL 30 V 5G review: Verdict

As you can see from this TCL 30 V 5G review this can be a frustrating phone to evaluate. For every good feature the phone offers — and there are quite a few for a phone at this price — there's a drawback that would give me pause before making a purchase.

Among budget phones under $300 I think I'd turn to the OnePlus Nord N20 5G first especially since that device is now available unlocked. (You will need to use it with a carrier to uses T-Mobile's network for coverage if you want 5G service though.) However Verizon customers might find plenty to like about the TCL 30 V 5G beyond this phone's support for the carrier's growing 5G network. There's also that lengthy battery life to help you feel like you're getting more for your money.

It’s basically a slightly cheaper slightly worse version of the Samsung Galaxy A13 5G that only works on T-Mobile. But it’s $200 and at that price it’s about the best phone you can get.

For a $200 phone the 30 XE 5G’s day-to-day performance is snappier than I expected. That’s also a low price to pay for 5G service on T-Mobile’s very good network. These things make it easier to forgive the 30 XE’s weak points because it does what a good budget phone should: it just works. If you really want 5G are paying full price and need to keep costs down it’s the best you’re going to get on T-Mobile. But if you’re eligible for one of your carrier’s “free” phone offers there’s certainly a better option among them.

5 Verge Score TCL TCL 30 XE 5G $ 198 The Good Snappy performance

Good battery life

Clean UI with few pre-downloaded apps The Bad Dim low-res screen

Mediocre camera

Only two years of software support $198 at T-Mobile$199 at Metro by T-Mobile How we rate and review products

The TCL 30 XE uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor and 4GB of RAM which is on the low side even by budget phone standards. Even so jumping from app to app is quick. It’s not perfect — there are infrequent but noticeable hesitations here and there. As I go about my scrolling and typing I generally just don’t notice the 30 XE getting in my way. The phone’s 64GB of built-in storage is definitely on the low side so budget an extra $15–25 for a microSD card.

Battery life is another bright spot. The 30 XE’s 4500mAh battery isn’t the biggest by any means but overall the device is fairly power-efficient. Light users who spend the majority of their time on Wi-Fi will get very good performance — well into a second day on one charge. It should also stand up to heavier use but I’d only expect to get through a single day.

Unfortunately that healthy battery stamina is likely thanks to the relatively dim low-resolution screen. The 30 XE offers a 6.52-inch LCD screen which would be fine — LCDs have poor contrast compared to their pricier OLED counterparts but you’re not going to find an OLED screen on a $200 phone — but it happens to be a bad LCD. For starters it’s just 720p resolution which is really not enough for a screen this big. Icons and images look a little rough around the edges. It’s also just not very bright. Using it next to a window on a mostly overcast day sent the automatic brightness to 100 percent just to keep the screen comfortably visible.

The TCL 30 XE’s 6.5-inch screen offers a smooth 90Hz refresh rate but it’s dim and only 720p.

That said the screen’s 90Hz refresh rate is noticeably smoother than the standard 60Hz. It contributes to the phone’s overall feeling of responsiveness so it’s nice. But personally I’d rather have a screen with adequate resolution and a standard refresh rate than a smoother-scrolling but low-res panel.

For a carrier-locked device the 30 XE includes mercifully few pre-downloaded T-Mobile apps most of which can be uninstalled (or skipped altogether during setup). That was not the case with Verizon’s TCL 30 V 5G which I reviewed earlier this year. The 30 XE also supports T-Mobile’s very good mid-band Ultra Capacity 5G network which is included on all of T-Mobile’s 5G plans — also not the case at Verizon where you need a pricier unlimited plan to access the best 5G bands.

The 30 XE ships with Android 11 installed which is well behind the times given that Android 13 is just around the corner. TCL spokesperson Isabelle Braun says the phone will get an update to Android 12 but didn’t say when. The company is also promising just two years of security updates for the 30 XE. That’s not long but it’s not totally unexpected for a $200 phone unfortunately.

TCL claims the 30 XE 5G has a “triple rear camera system” but that’s being a little generous. There’s a 13-megapixel main camera 2-megapixel depth camera and a 2-megapixel macro camera. The depth camera’s only purpose is to provide more information for portrait mode (which isn’t very good) and the macro camera’s images are (predictably) low res and mediocre.

TCL claims the 30 XE has a “triple rear camera system” but that’s being a little generous

That leaves the main rear camera and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera both of which do enough to get a passing grade. In bright light they produce very saturated almost fluorescent colors. None of the filters available in the native camera app tone this down very much so that’s something you’ll have to either prefer or make peace with. This contributes to some weird-looking results in mixed lighting too.

Dim indoor lighting and very low light are challenging for the camera. Shots are often blurred due to low shutter speeds autofocus hunting noise reduction or a combination of the above. You can get usable shots of static subjects but forget about pets and kids — moving subjects in low light are a challenge for even the best smartphone cameras. Video recording is available at up to 1080 / 30p and clip quality is unremarkable.

One main camera and two low-res sensors do not a triple-camera system make.

The TCL 30 XE 5G does just what a budget phone should do: for the most part it gets out of your way. For a phone at this price its performance is snappy and that’s a major benefit if you’re looking to just live your life with as little frustration as possible from your mobile device. But if you want a little more from your phone you have some other options to consider.

The Samsung Galaxy A13 5G has very similar specs to the 30 XE 5G: the same processor and RAM same 64 GB storage with a microSD slot and a similarly sized 720p screen. It costs a bit more outright but it offers a bigger battery and a better camera. Samsung’s software is a little further from stock Android than TCL’s which means a little more clutter and pre-downloads. At the time of this writing it’s also another $0 / month option from T-Mobile if you buy it on contract. If my free upgrade were at stake I’d opt for the Samsung.

Speaking of free phones if T-Mobile is offering the OnePlus Nord N20 5G then that’s an even better option. It has a better camera an excellent OLED screen and fast charging. Though at $282 it’s basically in another price bracket if you’re paying for it outright.

Finally if you can take or leave 5G and buying an unlocked phone outright is an option then the unlocked Motorola Moto G Stylus (2022) is worth considering. You’ll get better battery life and an additional year of security updates. It’s still quite a bit pricier with a $299 MSRP but it’s almost always marked down well below that; it’s $250 at the time of this writing.

The TCL 30 XE 5G is a budget phone that will get you through your day with as little hassle as possible given the price. It’s a good fuss-free option if you’re paying full price up front and want to keep costs as low as possible. But if you’re subsidizing your purchase by signing a wireless contract then you can do better.

According to the Head of Payment at MEXC Global Anthony Guo the decision is because they want to simplify and create a “connected user experience”.

“By enabling crypto purchase through Visa and MasterCard directly MEXC Global is delivering a faster simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier for users to convert fiat into crypto assets which opens up the ownership of cryptocurrency to millions of people where bank card is the dominant medium of transaction.”

MEXC Global is actively opening up more channels for fiat holders to acquire their favorite crypto assets using an easy-to-use and familiar payment method they are comfortable with. Despite the explosion of crypto and blockchain-enabled payment and remittance ramps Visa MasterCard and other traditional payment options are used by fiat holders spread across the globe.

These payment processors have refined their operations over the years. Notably they have a more robust global network of partners primarily financial institutions. On the other hand crypto solutions are still being developed and lagging. MEXC Global is filling this gap by linking the crypto and fiat worlds to fast-track the adoption of digital assets. This specifically considers the massive cost benefits associated with digital asset infrastructure.

MEXC Global and its newfound partners MasterCard and Visa realize what’s at stake. They are now committing to driving crypto adoption in a win-win arrangement. While MEXC Global will increase its user base and Visa and MasterCard profit from fees end-users on the other hand can quickly shuttle between the fiat and crypto worlds without necessarily learning or familiarizing themselves with complex systems.

The partnership follows the successful launch of the Global Bank Transfer Program that allows MEXC Global clients in Europe and the U.S. to deposit and withdraw using SWIFT and FedWire networks. Users who purchase crypto through the program also don’t pay trading fees.

MEXC Global has also launched an OTC payment service and activated P2P trading. Moreover clients can use approved third-party portals like Simplex and Banxa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWJvcnRpb24tdHJhdmVsLWNvbXBhbmllcy1wYXlpbmctYmVuZWZpdHMtYW1hem9uLXN0YXJidWNrcy10YXJnZXQv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvYWJvcnRpb24tdHJhdmVsLWNvbXBhbmllcy1wYXlpbmctYmVuZWZpdHMtYW1hem9uLXN0YXJidWNrcy10YXJnZXQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These companies are paying for abortion travel,"These U.S. companies are paying for abortion travel

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade major corporations are adding abortion travel costs to their employee benefits.

The goal is to ensure their employees can seek abortion care if they live in states where the procedure is now or will soon be illegal.

Everything on Stranger Things leads back to One a.k.a. Henry Creel a.k.a. Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower). It was true in the sense that a young Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) first opened a portal to the Upside Down during her showdown with the psychic prodigy at Hawkins Lab years ago but the season 4 finale in the two-part Volume 2 drop on Friday came with a new revelation that connects a major series-long thread.

While doing battle with El in the astral plane of Max's (Sadie Sink) mind Vecna constrains his opponent and gets to monologuing more of his backstory. He explains how he's secretly been the one pulling the strings in Hawkins since at least season 2 but the mystery goes back further to season 1.

Vecna is the Mind Flayer. The Mind Flayer is Vecna.

Stranger Things

Netflix Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) has a connection to the very beginning of 'Stranger Things.'

After his first battle with Eleven One found himself in the Upside Down. He became an ""explorer"" he says — and he discovered ""something that would change everything."" One came across what looked like a living black cloud wizzing about in the air similar to the swirling buzzing mass of Upside Down particles Joyce (Winona Ryder) Hopper (David Harbour) and Murray (Brett Gelman) found contained in the Russian prison's lab.

""I saw a means to realize my potential to transcend my human form to become the predator I was always born to be"" Vecna tells El. We then see One use his powers to mold the cloud into the spindly shape of the Mind Flayer. Vecna did say he had a fondness for spiders particularly Black Widows.

The Mind Flayer is the creature that first took notice of Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) when the kid became trapped in the Upside Down in season 1. It then went on to possess Will in season 2 and Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery) in season 3. It's the entity that could command the demogorgons the tendrils and virtually all the terrors from the Upside Down. It was really One/Henry/Vecna this whole time.

""All I needed was someone to open the door and you did that for me without even realizing it"" he tells El referring to when she opened a portal to the Upside Down back in season 1. But after she fought to close the gate and the ones that would follow One/Henry/Vecna sought to create his own portals.

Stranger Things

netflix The Mind Flayer as seen terrorizing Hawkins in 'Stranger Things' season 2.

We learn from the first episode of Vol. 2 that Vecna just needed to kill four individuals in his Freddy Krueger-like way in order to completely break the barrier between the world of Hawkins and the world of the Upside Down. And he succeeds: the finale sees the Upside Down crashing into the small town in a massive earthquake leaving what hell lies in that parallel dimension free to now roam across America.

Vecna is also still alive by the time the end credits roll. When Will steps foot back in Hawkins those strange feelings start to creep back. He can feel Vecna's presence though the creature was severely hurt when Steve (Joe Keery) and Robin (Maya Hawke) set him on fire and Nancy (Natalia Dyer) popped a few shotgun rounds into him.

At least the real threat in Stranger Things now has a face — even if it's one that needs moisturizer like yesterday.

Stranger Things season 4 is now streaming in its entirety on Netflix.

For his absence at one of the tour cities Kapil had promised to pay up for the losses incurred. However reportedly Kapil never fulfilled his promise. As per Amit the comedian neither performed at the event nor made up for the loss. Speaking to ETimes Amit said ""He did not perform and has not responded although we tried several times to get in touch with him before the court.''

Established ways of doing things from manufacturing and farming to building and planning our cities and towns have given rise to a world that is not fit for future generations. Trust in our governments and financial institutions is at an all-time low and we find ourselves divided geo-politically racially and socially. Our environment is choking on plastic and pollution as we witness the degradation of our forests oceans rivers and soils.

Globalization has failed to deliver on its promises of peace and prosperity for all. While a billion people have been raised out of absolute poverty (moving from under a dollar per day to just over a dollar per day) poverty continues to grip the lives of billions of people around the world in both high and low-income countries and inequality and social injustice are at an all-time high. Right now inflation is further deepening the inequality as assets prices rise while the average working person must choose between heat and food.

Since the Second World War we have arguably done three things wrong that led us to where we find ourselves today: First we allowed our politicians to put corporations and finance at the center of their political attention because their success we were told meant the success of society at large. Second we created a linear economy whereby all the material we produced is dumped or incinerated. Third we exploited the environment with modern farming practices that benefit large-scale investors at the expense of soil health biodiversity and ordinary farmers. Extractive mining practices have polluted towns and rivers and destroyed forests and eco-systems.

By focusing on the success of finance and corporations above all else our politicians have created an extremely uneven playing-field. Ordinary citizens farmers and investors find themselves competing with fund managers in Hong Kong London and New York and the deep pockets of large multinational corporations in all lucrative markets: food & beverages apparel & footwear textiles and other fast-moving consumer goods leaving the crumbs to ordinary business-owners while MBA graduates scramble to grow the next unicorn. Take tomatoes for example: A large investor double-clicking their way into the tomato business will look to buy the largest possible piece of land maximize their yield with toxic chemicals designed to kill everything on the land except tomatoes and sell tomatoes wrapped in plastic to supermarkets all over the world. This makes the tomato business unfeasible for most farmers except the few who are targeting a tiny but growing niche in organic and ecological produce.

A similar story of taking lucrative markets away from ordinary people (micro-small and medium-sized independently owned businesses) can be told for all the products we consume. A fund manager looking to enter the apparel and footwear market (as well as ordinary investors) will most likely manufacture in countries with cheap labor and lax environmental protection leaving tiny niche artisanal markets for small independent manufacturers such as the handful of manufacturers left in the Scottish Highlands and in Nepal.

This does create opportunities for global entrepreneurs but these so-called success stories are few and far between compared to the billions of people unable to produce or grow anything profitably in their regions for their regions.

We are in the midst of a great reset to transform our cities and all sectors of our economy into low-carbon zero-waste and environmentally friendly manufacturing plants and value chains with a focus on NetZero. The danger however is that the response is driven by the same political agenda that created the problem in the first place: export-led development that allows large multinational corporations to dominate all markets leaving few business opportunities for billions of people worldwide and further pushing farmers into debt poverty and bankruptcy eventually pushing them to leave their land and move into cities that lack opportunities and/or public services.

Instead we need to re-think our development model. Luckily an emerging solution goes with the grain of regional development which seems to be popular today: developing inclusive ecological and circular regional economies. International trade and global interconnectedness can emerge from a regional focus rather than the other way round. Let’s take the food and beverage sector as an example.

Small entrepreneurs are developing applications and platforms that connect ordinary independent farmers with urban markets. Luckily (for the planet) the most profitable markets for smallholder farmers are organic and regional. This is because in these small but growing niche markets consumers are choosing organic plastic-free regional produce over globalized agricultural produce. Prices remain high which makes these markets attractive to farmers but prices and costs will fall as the market expands. But this cannot happen without two things: Consumer demand and government support.

Governments have been supporting large-scale monoculture agriculture since the mid 1900s. Today they must shift their attention to regenerative agriculture and the revival of small-scale organic and ecological farmers. The technologies for such a transition are accessible in sharing economies and lead to higher yields if managed well. Transition however is risky and takes time. This is exactly where industrial policy can support farmers in learning what works where and in accessing niche but growing regional organic markets.

While governments in most countries are turning their attention to greening energy and mobility on the road to NetZero Mexico is taking a different approach.

The Mexican government led by its first progressive president Lopez Obrador is transforming farming and markets in the Yucatán peninsula through its Sembrando Vida (Sowing Life) Program and the Tren Maya project the iconic train connecting 19 stops around the peninsula with passenger (tourist and subsidized local prices) and freight trains.

Sembrando Vida invites smallholder farmers (with about six acres of land) to join the program and offers each farmer the equivalent of about US$250 per month basic income capacity building and technical support for transitioning to regenerative organic and ecological agriculture. This program includes one of the world’s largest and most ambitious reforestation programs aiming to plant about 500 million trees with a focus on farmers planting fruit trees for the short and medium term and high-value cedar and mahogany for long-term prosperity.

Sembrando Vida offers ordinary independent farmers and food & beverage manufacturers a shared brand which they can leverage to grow regional ecological and organic markets in the peninsula. Tren Maya will facilitate the distribution of this agricultural produce around the region while allowing migrant workers in tourist hot-spots to more frequently visit family back home elsewhere in the peninsula (a land the size of the UK). Hopefully tourists will choose to buy local organic produce rather than imported food and beverages as they do in Cancún.

The president’s approach to a great reset what he calls the Cuarta Transformación (fourth transformation) is extremely popular amongst voters. On April 10th more than 90% of voters confirmed their approval for Lopez Obrador to complete his presidential term (which ends in 2024) and recently four out of six states voted for Lopez Obrador’s party in regional elections further cementing his popularity.

Ask people who voted for Lopez Obrador why they want him to remain in power and a stream of policies rolls off the tongues of ordinary Mexicans all pointing to policies that increase national self-sufficiency and support ordinary citizens: his public takeover of Mexico City’s new airport and deploying the army to get it built on time and under budget the universal pension scheme the rise in the minimum wage the public sector construction of the Refinería Dos Bocas to cut dependence on imports of refined Mexican oil and of course Sembrando Vida and the iconic Tren Maya in the Yucatán Peninsula; all this without turning to the International Monetary Fund or World Bank for loans.

There are contrasting opinions on the development of the Tren Maya including very legitimate concerns from indigenous peoples. The government however is adamant that the project will bring a different kind of development to the region one that is inclusive socially just and environmentally sustainable respectful of Mayan culture and heritage preserving and regenerating the vast and beautiful natural environment. Some sectors of civil society however are critical of the Tren Maya and some Mayan community leaders are deeply concerned that the train will perpetuate business-as-usual (spreading the Cancún-model of development to the rest of the peninsula.)

The vast majority of ordinary citizens however including indigenous Mayans say they support the project because it will allow migrant workers to visit family elsewhere in the peninsula more often it will increase demand for their small businesses (thanks to a projected increase in tourism) and facilitate moving their produce and products around the peninsula.

Amongst the most vocal critics is a campaign led by environmental activist groups and artists under the banner of #selvamedeltren claiming that the train risks destroying the entire system of cenotes and caves as it crosses the path of underground rivers flowing to the coast in the section between Cancún and Tulum. Yet this apocalyptical perspective is not widely shared by ecological scientists and has been contested by members of Ejidos (community lands) who benefit from tourists visiting the caves (cenotes) on land where the train will pass through.

At the time of writing an Environmental Impact Assessment for this controversial segment of the train Tramo 5 Sur was released by the National Fund for Tourism (FONATUR) which directs the Tren Maya project and has been under public consultation between May 23 and June 17. A public meeting on the EIA where diverse voices were heard was held on June 8.

A more legitimate concern is that the Cancún model of investment and development and associated poorly-managed urban sprawl will spread around the peninsula allowing large multinational corporate and financial interests to extract a disproportionate share of value generated from tourism while causing pollution environmental degradation and social segregation as it has done in Cancún. Tulum is a case in point.

Since 2008 land speculation has been endangering natural and protected areas. Despite large scale urban development programs a great part of tourist-led developments is not in line with municipal planning laws and very few have environmental assessment plans. Even more concerning is that the predatory hotel development in the region brings enormous problems of water scarcity for Tulum residents while overloading urban infrastructure which cannot cope with the amount of solid waste and untreated wastewater produced and polluting the environment.

These issues will only get worse if the Tren Maya attracts more tourists to Tulum without careful planning and socially responsible investing. The risk is that these issues will plague many more towns and villages around the peninsula after the train is built. Municipalities like Tulum must use the opportunity of the train to capitalize on the imminent growth of their local economies in a way that resolves their challenges (such as access to water and basic services) and live up to their potential as beautiful places to live work and visit.

The president and his government promise that the Tren Maya will unleash a new era of inclusive and sustainable development in the peninsula. But if this government wants to deliver on that promise they need to enable municipal governments and local stakeholders to develop their own plans for dealing with the challenges of urban expansion in line with their own values and aspirations consistent with a national shared vision for inclusive and sustainable development.

The good news for residents and their municipal governments is that for the first time in their lives they have a progressive government that intends to radically transform and reshape the future of Mexico through what the president calls the Cuarta Transformación (fourth transformation).

As the world focuses on climate change and the road to NetZero with less attention on developing more resilient and regenerative food systems Mexico seems to have developed its own innovative approach focusing primarily on food security and regenerative agriculture through its Sembrando Vida programme. The programme is ambitious and has a budget to match $1.2 billion per year again without the need to extend the begging bowl to the IMF or the World Bank.

Sembrando Vida is arguably what the whole world needs support for ordinary farmers to transition to regenerative agriculture and import-substitution of food and beverages with locally produced organic produce to create food security in an increasingly fragile global marketplace that benefits the few and forces farmers off their land.

Mexico’s innovative approach is contagious. Mexico has pledged to support and part-fund the expansion of this program to its neighbors such as Guatemala. This is an exciting time for Latin America with Mexico and its presidency playing a leadership role.

To be sure this alternative development model is fraught with challenges. There is a huge risk that local governments will adopt or pursue their short-term business-as-usual approach to international capital allowing investments in large-scale extraction projects such as megahotels in Cancún and the Vulcan Materials Company site (referred to as Calica) near Tulum which continues to devastate the forest for road construction material in Texas.

Mexican federal government and its agencies FONATUR SEMARNAT SEDATU SEDENA (army engineers) and BIENESTAR (ministry of well-being) are determined to make it happen. It is perhaps time for the long-standing opposition to the Mexican state to engage rather than attack the Cuarta Transformación.

More people across organizations around the world are learning to align business models and practices with the needs of people and the environment. What is needed is an enabling regulatory environment and government policies to transition to a distinctly different type of economy that puts people and the environment first. The intention of the Mexican government and its numerous agencies is to do just that.

A new era of governance has emerged in Mexico. The road ahead is fraught with challenges and requires that all segments of Mexican society engage with a well-intentioned government and a very popular president. This is a space to watch for people all over the world who are deeply concerned about the future of our planet; how noteworthy that the transition to inclusive and ecological regional development is being led not by Western developed countries but by a developing country which until recently was considered as a lost cause. All eyes on Mexico leading the way to the great reset!

Sports Hall of Fame Inductee

Category: Junior Sports Honour Roll Sport: Dance Sport

In 2019 the Shepparton Sports Hall of Fame inducted a brother and sister in Jeremy and Amanda Garner into the roll of honour for their success as exponents of Dance Sport. Tonight we will induct a protégé of Jeremy Garners who has Mentored and tutored Sam Brown to become a world class dancer.

Sam grew up in Shepparton and at the age of 7 was taken along to Shepparton Excell dance Centre to watch his older brother Rodney dance. The exercise sparked a yearning in Sam and he decided anything Rodney could do he could do. Sam loved the activity and set himself to excel at the sport. He was soon having his weekends taken up with practice. At the age of 10 Sam received a rural and regional scholarship from Dance Sport Victoria and since that time has progressed incredibly to win championships at a local State and Interstate level and International level when he represented Australia at the world championships.

When he was eleven he connected with Berkley Wood from Bendigo who became his dancing partner and helped him to attain the standard that he has achieved. Berkley is still his dance partner today.

In 2013 he won his first Australian Title in the Juvenile section and also won Victorian and Tasmanian championships.

Sam’s love of the sport continued in 2014 and he won seven titles in Victoria and Tasmania. He moved into the Junior competitions and in 2016 & 2017 won sixteen titles to become Tasmanian East Coast Victorian and Australian Champion in the disciplines including New Vogue Latin and open Ballroom dancing.

2018 was a big year when Sam represented Australia at the Junior World Ballroom Championships.

After moving up to the Under 21 section he has won the Victorian Championship along with 2 East Coast titles and an East Coast title in the open section and represented Australia at the World Championships.

He was also his countries representative at the Under 19 years World Ten Dance championships. .

Sam has achieved the highest standard in all age groups he has danced in and is acknowledged by Dancesport Australia and Dancesport Victoria as one of the shining stars of Dancesport in the country. He has the world at his feet and who knows where in the world he will reach his goal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMi9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9hbGktYXBwb2ludHMtbmV3LXB1YmxpYy1wcm9jdXJlbWVudC1jb21taXNzaW9uLW1lbWJlcnMtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Public Procurement Commission members appointed,"President Irfaan Ali yesterday appointed four of the five members of the Public Procurement Commission (PPC) and emphasised the crucial role of oversight of the public procurement process as Guyana has embarked on a transformation phase.

Financial Analyst Joel Bhagwandin former High Commissioner to Canada Rajnarine Singh and Diana Rajkumar former Personal Assistant to the Minister of Public Security and Berkeley Wickham former Head of the National Procurement and Tender Administration Board were the nominees who were sworn in yesterday at the Office of the President.

The fifth nominee attorney Pauline Chase who was said to be out of the country is expected to be sworn in by next Wednesday.

The appointments come almost three months shy of three years since the term of the previous commission came to an end. In that time the PPP/C government has awarded contracts for mega infrastructural projects across the country.

Ali in a brief address to the new members said the PPC adds another tier of institutional mechanisms to promote transparency and open governance thereby ensuring oversight over public financing and public procurement.

“The job of the Public Procurement Commission is one that adds to that tier of institutional mechanisms that we have established as a country to ensure oversight of public financing in this case oversight of procurement so that whatever we do falls under the umbrella of transparent democratic and open governance” Ali said.

The nominees received the needed two-thirds majority approval from the National Assembly back in April.

The commission will function for three years. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman for the commission will be elected by the commissioners at their first meeting.

During the swearing in Ali told the commissioners that their work requires collective effort and constructive thinking.

The president went on to say that with each commissioner holding unique skills with their combined experience knowledge and diverse expertise he was confident they will add value to their work and bring necessary benefits to government’s systems and the country by extension.

“Your role and responsibility cannot be understated. That is why there are specific skillsets that are required and that the Constitution speaks to in relation to the members of the Public Procurement Commission” he said.

“This Government has embarked on a development path that is transformative. Important to that transformation are issues of public accountability transparency and ensuring that institutional mechanisms and systems that allow the public expenditure to occur are not only strong but that they’re continually renewed in an effort to advance and enhance transparency and accountability” he underscored.

There has been no PPC since October of 2020 and billions of dollars’ in public works contracts have been awarded in the intervening period.

The Constitution provides that “Subject to paragraph (2) members of the Commission shall be appointed for three years and shall be eligible for re-appointment for one other term of office not earlier than three years after the end of their first term. (2) Of those members first appointed two shall hold office for four years.”

The first PPC was established in October 2016 which was more than 13 years after the Constitution was amended to cater for the procurement oversight body.

The life of that Commission ended in October 2019 but then-President David Granger intervened extending the tenures of two commissioners by one year to facilitate the transition period.

The first members were Carol Corbin Sukrishnalall Pasha Emily Dodson Ivor English and former Minister of Labour Nanda Kishore Gopaul. Corbin a former project management professional and accountant with decades of experience working at the CARICOM Secretariat was elected Chairperson of the Commission.

During the absence of the body Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Jermaine Figueira had said many persons have been complaining of ill-treatment in the procurement process.

On one occasion Figueira had pointed out given the importance of the constitutional body it was unfair that its reconstitution had been delayed. He added that as Chairman of the PAC many persons have expressed their dissatisfaction to him that the commission has not been functioning.

The simple swearing ceremony was witnessed by Prime Minister Brigadier (Ret’d) Mark Phillips Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs Anil Nandlall Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Governance Gail Teixeira members of the Public Accounts Committee and relatives of the newly sworn-in Commissioners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpZGVvcGVuc3BhY2VzLmNvbS9tb3N0LXJlYWxpc3RpYy1zd2ltYmFpdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 8 Swimbaits Will Perfectly Mimic Baitfish,"Since the beginning of fishing anglers have been trying to come up with better ways to fool fish. The swimbait is undoubtably one of the best ways to simulate a baitfish. The reason swimbait fishing has become so popular is because almost anyone can fish one of these lures and catch a big fish. It's a friendly style for beginning fisherman and is great for more experienced anglers who just want to keep things simple on the water. Often these lures will produce when the fish just aren't hitting anything else especially when it comes to largemouth bass that live in heavily pressured lakes and rivers.

The main reason they are so effective is because of how truly lifelike they are and the designs just seem to get better with each passing year. Lure manufacturers are constantly researching tinkering and finding new ways to make these baits perfectly resemble minnows shad bluegills and other small forage so fishermen and women can perfectly ""match the hatch"" as some fly anglers might like to say. Today we're looking at the most realistic swimbaits on the market today the ones that are best going to match the forage wherever you are fishing and help you catch the big one.

Products featured on Wide Open Spaces are independently selected by our editors. However when you buy something through our links we may earn a commission.

Storm WildEye Live Sunfish

Storm offers this lure in ¼ and 5/16-ounce sizes and we like this one primarily for big bass. However it's going to be effective for pike muskie bowfin and dozens of other species that often share the same waters. There's a ton of extra detail in the scales fins and the eye which are going to help make the difference when it comes to making wary fish strike. We also just appreciate the fact there's both a single hook from the back and a bottom treble. Sometimes it's hard to hook fish that swipe at swimbaits from below and that bottom treble is going to help increase your hook-up percentage for this one. At $14.99 for a pack of three the price is also extremely reasonable.

13 Fishing BAMF Shad

In many southern states big bass love to feast on shad and shiners. The BAMF shad does a good job of imitating these baitfish which will save you the time of catching some live bait. The company offers three different color schemes gold which will do the job of imitating shiners silver for imitating shad and a purple color for when all else fails. They also offer two sizes 5.25 inches and 8 inches. We like both sizes for largemouths but the bigger one will also catch larger gamefish. The attention to detail on this shad swimbait especially in the eyes is going to help convince fish this fishing lure is the real McCoy. These start at about $12.95 so they are not cheap but you get what you pay for with the quality.

Savage Gear 3D Line Thru Gizzard

Big baits catch big fish and you cannot get much more realistic than a bait built from a 3D scan of a real gizzard shad. This one is a hard bait which makes it a prime option for anglers who are frustrated with soft baits that don't seem to hold their durability. At the same time the triple segmented body gives this bait a great action for a bevy of gamefish species. Savage Gear offers this bait in three different color styles to better match whatever the most common forage is on your lake or river. Another feature that puts this one just a step above other hard body swimbaits is the ability to bury the hook up next to the body or use a swinging treble. It's nice to have options especially for clear water fish that may be skittery about an obvious treble hook. The only big downside is the price at $14.99 to $20.99 each. Tie a good knot because losing one of these could be an expensive mistake.

MegaBass MagDraft

This lure has proven extremely popular for bass fishing in Japan and is starting to gain some traction here in the states too. It's a six-inch 1 ¼-ounce paddle trail swimbait that gives off great vibration that will stimulate the lateral line of lurking fish. The company makes this lure in about a dozen different color schemes to match what fish are feeding on. We recommend the nude rainbow for big bass reservoirs in southern California and the perch for more northerly fisheries in places like Minnesota. This one has a rather interesting design in that the side fins are there to make the treble hook more weedless than a standard swimbait. We especially like the eyes of this one. There's just something about them that screams lifelike wounded baitfish. At about $16 each they are not cheap but they are the perfect option for when the fishing is slow and nothing else is working.

Berkley Gilly

Berkley gave us a sneak peek at this bait before it debuted in 2021 and it later deservingly won best in show at ICAST. This one you need to see in action to appreciate as it has some of the most realistic movement we've ever seen in a soft plastic swimbait. Not only does it have Berkley Powerbait baked in but there's a bevy of ways to rig it for fishing multiple situations. You can rig it on a jighead and fish it vertically rig it weightless and pitch it in the slop you can even fish these Texas-style or drop shot them. It's the most versatile swimbait on the market today. We also love the printed patterns on the sides which are often HD images of real fish for a little This one is for the anglers who want different options to fish the bait but also for those who want more for their money. Because you get four to a pack which isn't a bad deal for $7-$17 depending on the size you choose. Berkley also offers a bevy of colors to match the baitfish most common in your area.

Savage Gear 4D Line Thru Trout

Southern California's reservoirs are a very likely place for the next world record largemouth bass to be caught. The bass grow to huge sizes there because wildlife authorities often stock trout every year which the bass feed on extensively. This swimbait from Savage Gear will help you mimic those young trout thanks to the design which uses a 3-D scan for accurate detailing. They make a few different sizes of this fishing lure to fit all situations. At $15 to $20 depending on the retailer the price is about what we'd expect for a bait of this type. This is the lure to consider if you are targeting a bass that weighs in the double digits.

Berkely PowerBait Grass Pig

Another soft plastic swimbait option from Berkley but this one is a paddle tail swimbait that creates a lot of extra vibration in the water. Just like the Gilly this is a highly versatile swimbait that can be fished via jig or weighted with an EWG hook for a slow sinking presentation for suspended fish. This is one of those lures to keep in your tackle box for when you're exploring new waters and you're not quite sure what may be hiding beneath the surface. The HD color patterns for perch shad and rainbow trout are all solid options and help these lures pop for fish under the surface. Again we like this one from an affordability standpoint too. They are just $4.99 allowing you to stock up on multiple colors so you can keep switching until you find the pattern that works each day.

Jackall Gantarel Jr. Hard Body

There's a slightly larger version of this bait but we like the ""Jr."" five-inch 1 ½-ounce version a little better since it can be fished in more parts of the country for more species. This hard bait features extra buoyancy and it gives this double-jointed bait some great action. In fact it can make incredibly sharp 180-degree turns like a real baitfish. We like this one in the matte bluegill color for most waters within the continental United States. This scheme will work for a plethora of game fish species. We also like the fact this lure comes with an option trailer hook that can be attached to the tail. It's perfect for those situations where fish are only taking swipes at your bait. This is the most expensive lure on this list at $25 - $30 depending on the retailer but it's a lure that can catch just about anything.

Streaming platform Roku (ROKU -0.32%) and retail giant Walmart (WMT 1.25%) recently announced a partnership to bring interactive ads to Roku users. This partnership is touted as the first of its kind enabling viewers to shop from their televisions.

Wall Street isn't giving Roku much fanfare; the stock has fallen 13% over the past month. But this partnership could mean big things for Roku over the long term -- here's why.

Bringing e-commerce to television

Shopping from your television isn't a new concept. QVC the television channel that sells to viewers around the clock was founded in the 1980s. But shopping from TV is messy.

Do you want that new air fryer you see on the TV program? Call a number wait on hold and verbally review your payment information. It's a pain in the neck.

But Roku's advertising technology or adtech platform is poised to change that. It will target you with ads for products you're likely to want based on the first-party data Roku collects from you. You'll be able to press OK on the ad using your remote and it will take you to a checkout page with your payment and shipping information preloaded from Roku Pay its integrated payments platform. One more button press places the order.

Walmart will operate behind the scenes fulfilling the orders on the back end. In other words Roku is essentially a digital storefront for Walmart's e-commerce business. This brings commerce to television in a way that's never been so simple for consumers. Of course time will tell how much it sticks with viewers; old habits can die hard.

What's in it for Roku

Roku technically wouldn't be selling the products themselves; it's leaving that to Walmart. However that's a good thing for the streaming platform.

The announcement didn't disclose the exact terms between the two companies but you can be confident Roku will receive a fee or share revenue on every sale it makes through its ads.

Those fees should be very profitable dollars contributing to Roku's average revenue per user (ARPU). Growing revenue per user will help increase Roku's top line and could also help increase the appeal of Roku's ad platform to brands.

The company's ability to target users with these interactive smart ads can help it demonstrate to brands its ability to convert viewers into customers. It could be a compelling offering to bring in more ad revenue.

Future platform possibilities

The partnership also gives investors a peek at what the future could hold where TV becomes a multi-tool of digital entertainment. TVs have slowly been able to do more and internet speeds are unlocking new technologies.

For example gaming can now happen through the cloud removing the need for a physical gaming console or PC. Imagine being able to turn on your TV open your cloud gaming app on the Roku home screen and jump right into your favorite game.

As much as smartphones do they can't replace the large beautiful displays of TVS which could remain the center of home entertainment by bringing e-commerce media and gaming all into one place.

Roku has 50% of the connected TV market in North America a sign that TVs doing more for viewers will be great for business. Time will tell how it all plays out but the partnership between Roku and Walmart is a clear signal of what's to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50cnlsaXZpbmcuY29tL3Nob3BwaW5nL2EyNzczNTI2MS93YWxtYXJ0LTR0aC1vZi1qdWx5LWhvdXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Walmart Open July 4th 2022 — Walmart 4th of July Hours,"We’re firm believers that aside from perhaps Christmas 4th of July reigns supreme as one the best holiday on the calendar. You'll hopefully be spending the time off with your family eating some delicious 4th of July recipes and watching the fireworks display. But be sure not to forget about the heart of it all—the chance to celebrate our great country’s independence with the best patriotic gear and decorations. (Need a refresher on American flag etiquette? We've got you covered.)

On the big day if you suddenly discover you've run out of something you need whether it's hot dog buns bug spray festive t-shirts or even sparklers you may be considering a trip to Walmart to pick everything up. But wait: is Walmart even open on July 4th?

4th of July Decorations for Your Patriotic Party Open Gallery

To help you steer clear of any and all patriotic pitfalls this year Walmart stores across the country will luckily be open during regular hours on the 4th of July. According to a spokesperson for the superstore chain special holiday hours are only applied on Thanksgiving and Christmas meaning you'll be good to go on Independence day. Specific store schedules vary by location so you'll still need to if you're itching to go first thing in the morning.

If we’re being honest Kyle Busch would make an excellent movie character with his quippy and snarky nature. Recently at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway he crashed out in practice and was forced to use a spare car. Ahead of the race he was asked whether his backup car was as quick as his regular machine.

The #18 Joe Gibbs Racing driver sarcastically answered “It’s fine. They’re all the same. They’re bought at Walmart“. However he was surprisingly civil for the rest of the day until he stepped in the car to race. Admittedly he had a bit of a mountain to climb as he was starting dead last. Nevertheless he had the last laugh as he proved that his spare tub was just as quick on the track.

How did Kyle Busch perform at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway?

To say that he did a great job would be an understatement. The two-time Cup Series champion clawed his way up to finish 4th in the race as the best of the Toyotas. This obviously answered the question about his backup being as good as the primary machine. Considering that he was on home soil as well the result was extremely encouraging.

Championship-wise the #18 driver finds himself in 5th place. He is just behind Kyle Larson Martin Truex Jr Joey Logano and Austin Cindric. Of course he has not won a race yet but the season has only had three races done and dusted so far. So there is plenty of time for him to notch up a win and establish himself as a title threat.

Obviously that win will not come by so easily. All that he needs to do is qualify well and place himself in the right place at the right time. So far Ford has one win with Chevrolet racking up two and Busch would love to set the ball rolling for Toyota.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC8yMDIyLzA3LzAyL3dhbG1hcnQtdGVsbHMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWl0cy1zdHVkeWluZy1iZXN0LXBhdGgtZm9yd2FyZC1vbi1hYm9ydGlvbi_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvcmV0YWlsLzIwMjIvMDcvMDIvd2FsbWFydC10ZWxscy1lbXBsb3llZXMtaXRzLXN0dWR5aW5nLWJlc3QtcGF0aC1mb3J3YXJkLW9uLWFib3J0aW9uLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart tells employees it's studying ‘best path forward’ on abortion,"Walmart told its 1.6 million U.S. employees that it’s weighing potential actions in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling overturning the constitutional right to abortion.

The largest private employer in the U.S. has been “listening to associates across our company representing many different viewpoints” chief executive officer Doug McMillon said Friday in an internal memo.

He promised more details as soon as possible noting that “time is of the essence” following the court’s decision a week ago.

”Understanding how you are feeling and how you’d like the company to respond is critical to informing our next steps” McMillon told employees. “We are working thoughtfully and diligently to figure out the best path forward guided by our desire to support our associates all of our associates.”

Walmart’s response to the ruling is lagging that of other retailers such as Dallas-based Neiman Marcus Kroger Target and Dick’s Sporting Goods which have all said they will provide employees financial support for out-of-state travel to access abortions.

Neiman Marcus said Monday that it is adding a new travel benefit for its employees who are unable to access certain health care services where they live including abortion. Walmart already has some health care travel benefits. Since 2017 Walmart has expanded a surgery program that sends employees to top hospitals it calls “centers for excellence” that specialize in treating certain illnesses such as cancer transplants heart disease and various surgeries.

Walmart’s home state of Arkansas and Texas its largest state by number of employees both have “trigger laws” outlawing abortions that took effect after the Supreme Court’s ruling. Walmart employs about 180000 people in its 593 Texas stores 26 distribution and fulfillment centers and other operations.

A total of 26 states either will or are likely to ban almost all abortions according to the Guttmacher Institute a research organization that backs abortion rights.

”We know our associates and customers hold a variety of views on the issue and this is a sensitive topic about which many of us feel strongly” McMillon said.

Dallas-based Match Group through a partnership with Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles set up a fund in October for Texas employees who need help seeking a safe abortion. Other major employers in Texas such as JPMorgan Chase and Salesforce have offered alternatives to workers living in the state.

Mickey Mouse will enter the public domain in the year 2024 almost 95 years after his creation on 1 October 1928 – the length of time after which the copyright on an anonymous or pseudo-anonymous body of artistic work expires.

Daniel Mayeda is the ​​associate director of the Documentary Film Legal Clinic at UCLA School of Law as well as a longtime media and entertainment lawyer. He said the copyright expiration does not come without limitations.

“You can use the Mickey Mouse character as it was originally created to create your own Mickey Mouse stories or stories with this character. But if you do so in a way that people will think of Disney – which is kind of likely because they have been investing in this character for so long – then in theory Disney could say you violated my trademark.”

Mickey Mouse first appeared in the black and white cartoon Steamboat Willie. The cartoon was a pioneer in animation for its use of synchronized sound – where movements on screen correspond to the music and sound effects launching one of the most recognizable images in film and television.

According to the National Museum of American History: “Over the years Mickey Mouse has gone through several transformations to his physical appearance and personality. In his early years the impish and mischievous Mickey looked more rat-like with a long pointy nose black eyes a smallish body with spindly legs and a long tail.”

While this first rat-like iteration of Mickey will be stripped of its copyright Mayeda said Disney retains its copyright on any subsequent variations in other films or artwork until they reach the 95-year mark.

Other characters have already moved into the public domain: with unpredictable and somewhat shocking results.

Honey-loving bear Winnie the Pooh from the Hundred-acre Woods and most of his animal friends entered public domain in January this year and some have wasted no time in capitalizing on the beloved characters.

Actor Ryan Reynolds made a playful nod to the now free-to-use Winnie the Pooh in a Mint Mobile commercial. In the advertisement Reynolds reads a children’s book about ‘Winnie the Screwed’ a bear with a costly phone bill.

More disturbingly Pooh and his close pal Piglet are now the stars of Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey a soon-to-be released horror film written and directed by Rhys Waterfield that sees the two go on a bloody rampage of killing after being abandoned by their old friend Christopher Robin.

Mayeda said it’s important for artists like Waterfield not to cross the line when it comes to creating new works based on the old characters. Certain aspects of a character that the general public recognizes as part of the Disney brand are off-limits for artists who wish to make use of the copyright expirations. If a particular work confuses the public into thinking it is actually affiliated with Disney there could be major legal consequences.

Successfully they have had their term for Mickey and so forth extended but I doubt that they’re going to be able to get additional extensions. I think this is going to be the end of the line Daniel Mayeda

“Copyrights are time-limited” Mayeda said. “Trademarks are not. So Disney could have a trademark essentially in perpetuity as long as they keep using various things as they’re trademarked whether they’re words phrases characters or whatever.”

Disney may still maintain trademarks on certain catchphrases or signature outfits worn by the characters such as Pooh’s red shirt which Waterfield intentionally avoided using in his movie.

In an interview with Variety Waterfield said: “We’ve tried to be extremely careful. We knew there was this line between that and we knew what their copyright was and what they’ve done. So we did as much as we could to make sure [the film] was only based on the 1926 version of it. No one is going to mistake this [for Disney]. When you see the cover for this and you see the trailers and the stills and all that there’s no way anyone is going to think this is a child’s version of it.”

Disney still retains exclusive rights to the bouncing tiger Tigger for one more year since his first appearance wasn’t until 1929 in The House at Pooh Corner the series of stories written by Winnie the Pooh creator AA Milne.

Politicizing Pooh

The Walt Disney Company has a long history with US copyright law. Suzanne Wilson once deputy general counsel for the Walt Disney Company for nearly a decade now heads the US Copyright Office underscoring the company’s relationship with the government.

In May 2022 Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri made headlines for threatening the corporate giant’s expansive list of copyrights after Disney publicly opposed Florida’s parental rights in education bill commonly referred to as the “don’t say gay” bill.

Hawley said: “The age of Republican handouts to big business is over. Thanks to special copyright protections from Congress woke corporations like Disney have earned billions while increasingly pandering to woke activists. It’s time to take away Disney’s special privileges and open up a new era of creativity and innovation.”

Mayeda called Hawley’s reaction “purely political”.

“It has no chance of passing” Mayeda said in reference to Hawley’s copyright clause restoration bill that seeks “to limit new copyright protections to 56 years and make the change retroactive for massive corporations like Disney that have been granted unnecessarily long copyright monopolies”.

“Disney has been very active in trying to extend copyright terms” Mayeda said. “Successfully they have had their term for Mickey and so forth extended but I doubt that they’re going to be able to get additional extensions. I think this is going to be the end of the line.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZGNsZmFuLmNvbS9kaXNuZXktY3J1aXNlLXNoaXBzL3JvdGF0aW9uYWwtZGluaW5nLW9uLXRoZS1kaXNuZXktd2lzaC0xOTIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rotational Dining On the Disney Wish: 1923,"Yesterday we explored the space and menu at Arendelle: A Frozen Dining Adventure one of the main family dining rooms aboard the Disney Wish. Today we’re going to take a close look at 1923 which is another one of the main dining rooms that is included in your cruise fare as part of the rotational dining that is offered by Disney Cruise Line. You can find details and information for Worlds of Marvel here.

Before we get started with the food let’s talk a bit about the atmosphere of this restaurant. To be sure I have not stepped foot into this space just yet but the photos take my breath away. I can’t help but wonder if these images – like many – don’t do the restaurant justice but at the same time I am blown away by just how gorgeous it looks. From the props of some of my very favorite films to the drawings that are also weaved into the displays I feel like I might be leaving my table often to have a look around once I’m inside. I also might be stopping by during the day to take a peek – more than once.

As we’ve learned 1923 is named after the year The Walt Disney Company was founded and is an elegant celebration of the company’s legacy paying homage to the golden age of animation and offering a tasteful tribute to its Californian heritage. Seeing these photos makes me feel like the space foots the bill.

Let’s take a tour of the menu at this establishment now that we’ve had the chance to let the atmosphere soak in just a bit.

All of the main dining rooms have a bread service that comes with a house-made dip. At 1923 it’s a Honey Butter Dip. It’s important to note that your server will gladly bring you butter if you’d prefer that so please don’t be afraid to ask.







Out of the four available appetizers the Burrata with Prosciutto has got my attention. I’m really not much for tuna and duck hasn’t been a favorite of mine when I’ve tried it in the past. Depending on my hunger level at the time I could be convinced to give the Tortelloni a try.

I’ve always had soup or salad as an appetizer but on Disney Cruise Line you can choose an appetizer in addition to both soup AND salad. Pack your appetite.

I think I’d go for the romaine salad and the corn chowder but if I’m being completely honest all of these items sound delicious.

There are five entreés on the regular menu and they all sound delicious. I love that there is a pasta dish and I’ve tried Verlasso salmon at The Turf Club at Walt Disney World and loved it so I’m hoping it’s as good here. The chicken lamb and filet dishes also look incredible so I’m thinking that I should probably get started on booking a second cruise on the Wish.

Neither of the vegetarian dishes are sounding appealing to me but I would definitely try the lobster salad as it looks and sounds incredible.







And finally the pièce de ré·sis·tance in my world – the dessert menu.

You guys there are churros on the dessert menu! CHURROS! And they’re served with dulce de leche to dunk them in – YUM-O! I have to say though the Fuji Apple Cheesecake sounds amazing as does the signature dessert. There is something about the freshness of lemon with blueberry that really floats my boat and if I have anything it’s a big sweet tooth.

Also Sweetly Ever After might be my most favorite name of a dessert menu EVER. I’m also in love with the little Hidden Mickey between the 2 and 3 in the name of this restaurant and I love that it’s made an appearance on the cover. The details in this restaurant seem to go on forever and I’m just so excited to step into it.

I’d love to know which items on this lovely menu have caught your attention so please stop by the comments and share! Be on the lookout soon for our next in-depth look at the main dining rooms on the Disney Wish – Worlds of Marvel.

The company has recently widely come under fire over its lack of response to Florida’s so-called Don’t Say Gay bill.

Disney has created three new dining experiences for its dinner rotation on the Disney Wish. We in the Niles family experienced all three on the media preview Christening Cruise and will share our thoughts in three posts here on Theme Park Insider starting today with the restaurant ""1923.""

If you have not sailed with the Disney Cruise Line before Disney employs a rotational dining system rather than sending everyone to a Main Dining Room each night for dinner. Your party will be assigned a time and a table at one of the three restaurants each evening. Your wait staff also will rotate with you each night as will the parties seated at adjacent tables. The rotational dinners are included with your cruise fare so you can order as much or as little as you would like but alcoholic beverages are not included so you will be paying for those by the glass.

Named for the year that Walt and Roy Disney founded their company 1923 is the ""upscale quiet night"" dining experience of the Disney Wish's three rotational restaurants. There's no show here as there are at the Arendelle and Worlds of Marvel dinners. The focus instead remains on the food as well as the time you get to spend with your dining companions.

As for that food the theme in 1923 is California cuisine though a basic structure persists across all three rotational dining menus. The meal starts with a bread service followed by your choice from from among four appetizers two salads two soups five entrees two vegetarian selections and four ""Lighter Note"" options including a salmon filet roasted chicken breast grilled sirloin steak and a fourth selection that varies by restaurant.

At 1923 that selection is a Los Feliz Lobster Salad with Baby Bibb lettuce Endive Avocado Jicama Purple Potato Tostones Black Beans Grape Tomatoes Cilantro and Lime.

A few thoughts - first none of us ordered this. Second the 1923 menu includes several references to California cities and communities that reminded me of location names in the original California Adventure theme park. Few made will make sense to anyone familiar with the Golden State. My son lives in Los Feliz an inland Los Angeles neighborhood near Griffith Park which has zilch to do with lobsters or growing vegetables. It just starts with an 'L' like Lobster.

The third thought is that Disney Wish's menus list tend to list everything in a dish without communicating their proportions especially with entrees where many listed vegetables turned out to be little more than garnishes rather than the side dishes we initially assumed them to be.

We ate at 1923 on our second night and after our experience at Arendelle on the first night we chose to order one of each appetizer for the table.

Alameda Porcini Spiced Ahi Tuna with Pickled Lotus Root Oyster Mushroom Black Sesame Brittle and Wasabi & Yuzu Mayonnaise

Hyperion Four-Cheese Tri-Color Tortelloni with Meyer Lemon Artichoke Sun-dried Tomato and Baby Spinach

Burrata Mozzarella Cheese & Prosciutto di Parma with Crisp Cranberry and Sunflower Seed Phyllo and Charred Blood Orange

Kingswell Duck Confit Pastilla with Dates Apricot Ginger Red Pepper Saffron and Black Raspberry Jam

The accompaniments brought some brightness to the tortelloni but its flavor could not hold up against the competition from the other appetizers. The shredded duck confit in the pastilla (named for the street where Walt and Roy had their first business office) felt more like an entree than an appetizer - nice but a bit too heavy for the light appetite-stimulating bite we were looking for in this course.

Our winners were the perfect Burrata well accompanied by the Prosciutto and the Ahi dish. The tuna especially provided lively flavors to wake up your tongue making it my favorite appetizer of the entire cruise. This is the dish I will be dreaming about for days to come.

We also selected the Roasted Roma Tomato Soup with Sourdough Purple Basil Crostini

and the Fennel Bartlett Pear and Tatsoi Salad with Manchego Cheese Walnuts and Sherry Dressing

The tomato soup tasted more like a hearty roasted tomato puree than a thinner soup. Nice flavor but a bit heavy for a second course. Cruise eating is a marathon not a sprint. Ya gotta pace yourself to make it to the finish each night.

The salad brought back the menu's proportion problem which I described above. This was basically a bowl of shaved fennel. Perhaps that's a dream for black licorice fans but after I ate the few balanced bites I could put together with the limited amount of other ingredients in the salad I was done here and ready to move on.

So let's get to the entrees:

Tortiglioni Pasta with Prosecco Cream Pancetta Shallots Cremini Mushrooms and Lemon Thyme

Seared Verlasso Salmon Filet with Californian Wild Honey Parsnip Purée Orange Fennel Essence and Sautéed Black Garlic Rapini

Italian Flat Parsley and Rosemary-crusted Rack of Lamb with Dauphinoise Potato Roasted Petite Turnip Carrot and Zucchini and Zinfandel Rosemary Sauce

1923 Peppered Filet Mignon with Buttered Long Green Beans Smoked Bacon Crushed Fingerling Potato Hash and Pink Pepper Café Au Lait

The menu also included a Riverside Roasted Green Circle Chicken with Leek Rondels Brussels Sprouts Yukon Potato Fondant Honeycrisp Apple Chutney and Cabernet Sauvignon Reduction which none of us ordered.

The mushrooms dominated the pancetta in the tortiglioni though the Prosecco cream offered a nice flavor to the pasta. But that dish soon was forgotten as we turned quickly to the perfectly cooked salmon which tasted wonderful on its own but even better when dragged through the parsnip purée.

The filet delighted cooked precisely to order but after a hot day on Castaway Cay the serving proved too much to finish - a rare occurrence on the Wish which typically served reasonably modest portions for its entrees. The pepper sauce (not pictured as it was served on the side and I just forgot to get it in the photo) tasted a tad too sweet to all of us which became a common criticism of sauces aboard the Wish.

The lamb was my favorite entree of the cruise however. Again the chefs here nailed the preparation delivering perfectly cooked lamb under a flavorful crust accompanied by a robust sauce that had just the right level of sweetness for the meat rather than going too far in that direction as the filet's did. The veggies here were just the right size for a side too with the Dauphinoise Potato adding a welcomed indulgent touch to the plate with that Gruyère and cream adding some life to the thinly sliced and stacked potato.

At 1923 passengers dine in one of two long dining areas each named for one of the Disney brothers either Walt or Roy. Each area is divided into multiple rooms decorated with concept art sketches and other memorabilia from various Disney films and projects. With the name ""1923"" I expected the focus to fall upon projects from the early days of the Disney brothers' studio but our room was all ""Frozen"" which we thought a bit much since we had the Arendelle dining experience the night before.

The servers throughout our three-night stay provided attentive care and thoughtful recommendations. They knew us by name immediately and seemed well experienced in knowing when to engage and when to let guests have their space when dining. Disney Cruise Line staff excel at making guests feel like welcomed regulars wherever they are on the ship most especially in the dining rooms.

In addition to the food we ordered Buena Vista Old Fashioned which - like all alcohol - was an upcharge. (And whose exact amount no one seems to remember. Whoops.)

Pretty standard for an Old Fashioned (""why do we order these?"" someone said) but the big milk chocolate coaster atop it was pretty cool.

On that sweet note dessert. We ordered:

Churros Calientes: Sugar Spice Churros Dulce de Leche

Atwater Fuji Apple Cheesecake: Sweet Dough Shell Caramelized Apples Cinnamon Cheesecake and Rolled Oat Crumble

The Signature Dessert was Burbank Blueberry-Lemon Bavarian Cream with Ecuador Vanilla Bean Lemon Rocks and Dried Raspberry Meringue

And the Ice Cream Sundae selection was the Hollywood Hills Hot Chocolate Fudge Sundae with Vanilla Ice Cream Fudge Brownie Bites fresh Whipped Cream and Glazed Cherry

The names again. Slow your roll Disney. We did not order the gluten-free Orange Almond Cake or the no-sugar-added Coconut Tapioca Pudding.

We tasted nothing ""caliente"" about the churros which tasted of pure Disneyland bliss served with a delightful (and thick) dulce de leche sauce. The other desserts were pretty much as advertised: a nice apple-cinnamon cheesecake patisserie a dab of blueberry inside the Bavarian cream and a refreshing hot fudge sundae though I gotta throw in that brownie bites just become teeth-shattering obstacles when buried inside an ice cream anything for more than a moment. Gimme a scoop of cold ice cream atop a big warm brownie if we are to combine these favorites instead.

The Disney Wish's 1923 might not have brought us back to 1923 and didn't seem any more authentically Californian than a California Pizza Kitchen. But it delivered what really matters - a delicious meal in a charming environment with comfortable service that kept our entire family chatting happily throughout our time there.

And if I could get that Ahi appetizer delivered to my home please sign me up for two.

Sun Valley Retreat Amid Streaming Rethink Economic Woes,"The mountains are as gorgeous as ever the deal climate not so much as boutique investment bank Allen & Co. prepares to host its annual Sun Valley retreat. After guests arrive on Tuesday official activities get under way Wednesday.

The annual ritual of media-mogul whitewater rafting and shop talk is a 40-year post-July 4 tradition. It was suspended in 2020 during the worst of Covid but returned last year in a pared-down masked-and-vaxxed version soon after two major deals were announced — the Warner Media/Discovery merger and Amazon’s planned takeover of MGM. Discovery’s then CEO David Zaslav’s first comment to the Sun Valley press cadre a year ago: “We’re not done yet.”

Now he’s chief executive of the new Warner Bros. Discovery and will likely be more circumspect as the high-debt company tries to deliver on a promised $3 billion in cost savings and with its peers weather a brutal stock market a Wall Street about-face on streaming soaring inflation surging interest rates and maybe a looming recession. Zaslav’s attendance is confirmed along with that of WBD chief revenue and strategy officer Bruce Campbell we hear.

Those two deals shook up media in a scramble of who lost out and what might be next. Paramount (known a year ago as ViacomCBS) wanted a big deal so did NBC Universal parent Comcast. Both had eyed Warner Media. Paramount’s non-executive chair and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone will be back. CEO Bob Bakish was invited but can’t make it.

Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch and COO John Nallen are confirmed. So is Sony Group Corp. CEO Ken Yoshida and Jim Ryan head of PlayStation. Casey Wasserman and Mike Fries too.

Not all invitees necessarily attend. But Rupert Murdoch is a regular and Bob Chapek — a new three-year contract now in hand — was there last year. Invitees also include tech CEOs among them Elon Musk Apple’s Tim Cook Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Amazon’s Andy Jassy and Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai. The list features an array of top-of-the-top of media chiefdom – companies that could or do bank with Allen & Co. — and executives from companies that are clients.

By putting execs in close proximity and in khakis the Sun Valley conference is credited with planting the seeds of mergers – from Disney’s buying CapitalCities/ABC back 1995 to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ acquisition of The Washington Post in 2013.

For invitees Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos Netflix co-CEOs the year since Allen & Co. 2021 has made a massive difference. It stock plunged 70% from the start of the year after shedding subscribers last quarter for the first time announcing it would lose more in the just-ended June quarter and suddenly unveiling plans to launch an ad-supported service even as it lays off staff. As a result Netflix is increasingly seen as a takeover target — an unusual shift.

An independent Netflix “is gone” predicted one financier. It’s a very valuable platform but “not a growth story anymore.” Hastings and Sarandos “didn’t manage Street expectations” and in one fell swoop lost a couple hundred million dollars” of market cap he said referring to its latest post-earnings video call when the co-chiefs discussed the subscriber shortfall.

Over the next 18 months “the environment will be clearer” he said.

That’s also about when buyers could consider swooping in to acquire WBD. The structure of that deal would entail a hefty tax penalty for any acquirer within two years of close.

What happens between now and then is anyone’s guess. The Netflix effect has spilled to shares of other streamers as investors question the economics of the high cost still slim profit business. Meanwhile pent up demand the Russia-Ukraine war and lingering Covid-related supply chain issues have triggered sky-high inflation. Corresponding interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve risk recession a fear that has hit advertising and may bleed into other areas of entertainment.

As a result the Allen & Co. crowd is assembling just after the S&P 500 closed out its worst first half of the year since 1970 declining by more than 20%. The Nasdaq was worse down by nearly 30% and the Dow fell 15%. Tech stocks have been hardest hit but media underperformed broader markets as the second quarter ended yesterday.

Deals are still in the news. The long gestating CAA-ICM merger just closed (Allen & Co. advised CAA. Both Bryan Lourd and Chris Silbermann will be at the conference). Elon Musk’s Twitter deal (Allen is an advisor to Twitter) and Microsoft’s purchase of Activison Blizzard (with Allen advising Activision) are pending.

But an M&A outlook from PwC recently predicted a slowdown in the biggest of big media M&A – which last year was seemed to be just revving up — amid low share prices and high interest rates. Paying with stock is limited now and accessing the debt market it is more expensive. Companies don’t like to sell at a low point.

Endeavor just slashed a pending $1.2 billion cash and stock purchase for sports betting platform OpenBet by $400 million yesterday to $800 million.

And he’s not always right but he’s not alone: Zuckerberg reportedly told Meta staffers today that “If I had to bet I’d say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL3NoZXJsb2NrLWhvbG1lcy0zLXRoaW5ncy13ZS13YW50LXRvLXNlZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Things We Want to See in Sherlock Holmes 3,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL3NoZXJsb2NrLWhvbG1lcy0zLXRoaW5ncy13ZS13YW50LXRvLXNlZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdHYtcmFkaW8vMTI5MTYwNjM0L2hlYXJ0YnJlYWstaXNsYW5kLXJldHVybnMtZm9yLXRoaXJkLXNlYXNvbi13aXRoLWEtbmV3LWhvc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heartbreak Island returns for third season with a new host,,,,

Santa Barbara County is expanding its organics collection program to include all residents and businesses of the unincorporated Santa Maria and Lompoc Valleys.

Customers must place all of their food scraps food-soiled paper along with yard waste in their green container.

Organics such as these release methane as they decompose in landfills.

Methane is a major contributor to climate change.

Everything in the green container is now processed at a local facility and then used as compost in local agriculture.

If you do not have a green container you can contact Waste Management at (805) 922-2121 to subscribe to organic waste service.

The county is providing free 28-quart kitchen pails to all residents for indoor organics collection.

Commercial customers can arrange for delivery of the collection container by calling (805) 882-3613.

“We are a boating family. We love to fish and kayak and our lives are very much based around water” said Bundy 43 who owns a dog walking and pet sitting business. “So when we came across this waterfront home it was perfect for us.”

It wasn’t until her son Atlas suffered a serious ear infection last September that she realized that the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant owned and operated by Baltimore City was dumping large quantities of untreated sewage and pollutants into the river a tributary to the Chesapeake Bay.

Bundy now finds herself embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed against Baltimore City in December by Blue Water Baltimore an environmental nonprofit asking the court to order city managers to fix both Back River and Baltimore’s other failing wastewater treatment plant Patapsco.

The mismanagement and disrepair at Back River became so bad that state environmental officials took over operation of the plant in March and reported last month that “catastrophic failures” had resulted in sewage discharges above and beyond its permitted limits. The city responded last week that it was working with state regulators to remedy the situation at Patapsco and Back River the largest wastewater treatment facility in Maryland.

The Back River plant a mile south of Bundy’s riverfront home has become notorious for numerous permit violations and frequent sewage discharges leaking from its aging and faulty pipes and treatment tanks pouring excess nutrients and contaminants into the Back River one of the most polluted rivers in Maryland.

Excess nitrogen and phosphorus can cause toxic algae blooms that often lead to respiratory and eye irritation in humans and kill fish marine mammals and other wildlife and emanate from agriculture and fossil fuel combustion as well as human sewage.

Bundy describing her son’s ear infection said that the family wasn’t “aware at the time that there was something going on with the wastewater treatment plant.”

“My son 11 at the time went swimming in the river the way he had done many times before” Bundy said. “He got the infection almost immediately after the swim and it was so bad that he would lay in my lap at night and cry because he was in so much pain.” It took four weeks and three visits to a specialist she added to get the infection under control.

Bundy said a neighbor messaged her after she posted about her son’s ordeal on Facebook. “She told me none of the neighbors swim in the water. I was outraged” she said. “How could they do that and not notify the public about the risks it could pose to our health and hygiene?”

The incident led Bundy and her husband to join the Back River Restoration Committee a local nonprofit dedicated to cleaning up trash around Back River monitoring bacteria in the waters and sharing the information with the community as a precaution.

In December last year Bundy was one of the three residents who submitted a sworn affidavit in support of a federal lawsuit filed by Blue Water Baltimore citing both of Baltimore City’s wastewater treatment plants for failing to contain excessive pollution and committing ongoing violations of the federal Clean Water Act.

“I wanted the city to understand the effect their poor management has had on the community” said Bundy. “It’s not just gross that they’re dumping sewage but it actually affects human health and the environment.”

The litigation was temporarily paused last winter to allow the state and city to negotiate a settlement aimed at fixing myriad problems at both plants. But after four months of unsuccessful negotiations the nonprofit group asked the court in April to proceed with the case.

“We can’t wait any longer” said Alice Volpitta Baltimore Harbor Waterkeeper at Blue Water Baltimore. “The latest reports show that the pollution is getting worse and after four months of negotiation we still don’t have the information necessary to develop a settlement agreement. We’re moving forward with our case because the city must be held accountable to the public for a transparent solution.”

The directive issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) taking over operation of Back River came after Baltimore City failed to act on a previous MDE order to immediately end illegal discharges of water pollution at the plant the agency said in a statement. The MDE concluded that the plant was in such disrepair that it risked “catastrophic failures that may result in environmental harm as well as adverse public health and comfort effects.” ​

The takeover came despite significant investments by the state in both plants the MDE said last fall in a letter to Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott. Back River received $437.5 million and Patapsco received $215.2 million in state taxpayer funds for “enhanced nutrient removal” in addition to $203 million from a state revolving fund and $127 million from Baltimore taxpayers for investments totaling $982.8 million.

Still the department said in the letter “MDE is extremely concerned that effluent violations for nutrients and solids continue to directly and negatively impact the health of Patapsco River and Chesapeake Bay.” The department also noted that nitrogen pollution from both plants had increased 68 percent in fiscal 2021.

The MDE added that the city is estimated to receive more than $641 million in funds under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and concluded its letter to Mayor Scott by saying: “The citizens of Maryland need to be reassured that Baltimore City is committed to cleaning up the Bay.”

On June 6 the Maryland Environmental Service which runs all state-owned wastewater treatment facilities and was put in charge of running Back River produced a blistering 72-page report listing a host of management and systemwide “catastrophic failures” that were causing the facility to malfunction and discharge unpermitted sewage.

The evaluation found that the facility’s equipment for filtering and treating sewage with bacteria and chlorine was either faulty or simply out of commission. “Pumps are plugged with trash drains are clogged and floors are covered with water or sludge” the assessment found. It added that the lack of maintenance or funding for repairs caused the staff to find unnecessary workarounds to keep the plant operating.

“The state of disrepair is the result of years of neglect that will take time and dedication to correct” the evaluation said. MES evaluators reported “a lack of accountability organization planning communication and teamwork” with little or no staff training to improve skill sets which led to serious concerns for workers’ safety.

The staff across various departments were openly unwilling to cooperate evaluators wrote and hostility existed between the maintenance and operation groups. “Visible animosity between area managers and supervisors has been witnessed and the lack of teamwork and communication between the various area supervisors has resulted in process upsets and disruption to planned activities” the report said.

The assessment listed unprofessional behaviors including sleeping on the job as well as verbal and physical altercations between staff at all levels. “MES has witnessed city staff washing personal vehicles during the workday and they have admitted to receiving payment or free lunch for services provided” the agency reported.

High turnover rate and the inability to retain mid-level managers resulted in staff shortages and low team morale leading to bad management control and poor execution of tasks. “The violations occurring at the Back River WWTP have evolved into a situation where this is now equivalent to an extreme event” MES noted and recommended that these issues need to be addressed on an emergency basis.

As a result of these systemic failures the plant was consistently discharging excessive pollutants in Bay River including phosphorus and nitrogen causing pollution levels to spike.

Last month the Chesapeake Bay Program reported that Maryland’s wastewater treatment facilities contributed significantly more nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in the bay last year that could jeopardize the efforts to reduce sediments and nutrient levels to meet goals set for the Chesapeake Bay by 2025.

“It’s clear the lack of enforcement of the Clean Water Act is threatening our goals for a clean and healthy bay. There was an increase of about 2.8 million pounds of nitrogen pollution into the Bay from sewage plants” said Angela Haren a senior attorney with the Chesapeake Legal Alliance which filed the lawsuit against Baltimore for conditions at both its wastewater treatment plants on behalf of Blue Water Baltimore.

Following MES’s report the Chesapeake Legal Alliance asked the federal court last month to issue a special order directing city authorities to immediately fix the health and safety issues at its two wastewater treatment plants and to post health advisory signs at water recreation areas impacted by the plants.

“The amount of pollution coming from these two wastewater treatment plants is enough to jeopardize the whole state’s goals under the Chesapeake Bay agreement for the reduction of nitrogen for example” said Haren.

The Patapsco treatment plant already exceeded its pollution limit for nitrogen by over a million pounds she said adding that as of today the facility is already beyond its limit for 2022. “It means that for every single day for the rest of the year it’s going to be in violation over its permitted limit just to put it in scale.”

Situated on the Patapsco River south of downtown Baltimore the facility serves Baltimore City as well as Baltimore Howard and Anne Arundel counties.

Haren said that the court’s immediate intervention was necessary because the city is yet to demonstrate a sense of urgency in ending its pollution problems. “We’re seeing the city’s utter lack of action. And the discharge monitoring reports speak for themselves particularly at Patapsco plant where concentration of nitrogen is higher now than when we brought this lawsuit” she added.

But the city authorities are adamant the situation does not warrant the court’s intervention. In a 36-page response filed with the court on June 26 Baltimore City maintained that the city agencies are already working with state regulators.

MDE and the city recently reached an agreement that requires the city to cooperate with MES to control water pollution and to ensure that the Back River facility is operated in a manner that will protect public health. MDE is pursuing a similar agreement over the Patapsco treatment plant which is in similarly bad shape to take corrective actions and bring the facility into compliance.

“There is absolutely no need or justification for the Court to inject itself and [Blue Water Baltimore] into the State and City’s process for restoring these plants to full compliance in the very near future (Back River) and over the next couple of months (Patapsco)” the city maintained. Asserting that “there have been no harmful algal blooms no fish kills and no swimmer illness” the city said that no such harms can be attributed to the city’s treatment plants.

“I’m not surprised at all” said Bundy responding to the city’s assertions. “If you look at the state of the city right now it is completely imploding on itself because the leadership is so corrupt and they refuse to admit that there’s a problem because they don’t want to fix it.”

Bundy said that both the Back River Restoration Committee and the state of Maryland have water samples that show the presence of bacteria in Back River that only comes from the human intestine. “They can deny all they want but the facts are facts” she said. “And they’re also looking at a federal lawsuit. So they can answer to the judge on that.”

Unsafe water kills more people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined. Meanwhile less than 1% of the Earth’s freshwater is actually accessible to us and it’s in our best interest to protect what we have especially considering that by 2050 global demand for freshwater is expected to be one-third greater than it is now. Here are six causes of water pollution as well as what we can do to reduce it.

—

Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution because it’s able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on Earth. Toxic substances from farms towns and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it which causes water pollution as a result.

6 Most Common Causes of Water Pollution

1. Sewage and Wastewater

According to the UN more than 80% of the world’s wastewater flows back into the environment without being treated or reused; in some least-developed countries this figure tops 95%. Harmful chemicals and bacteria can be found in sewage and wastewater even after it’s been treated. Households release sewage and wastewater which makes its way to the ocean mixing with freshwater and affecting the water quality and marine life. Also the bacteria and pathogens found in wastewater breed disease and cause health-related issues in humans and animals.

2. Oil Spills

Large oil spills and leaks are some of most significant causes of water pollution. These are often caused by oil drilling operations in the ocean but nearly half of the estimated 1 million tons of oil that makes its way into marine environments each year come not from oil tankers but from land-based sources like factories farms and cities. In England and Wales there are about 3000 pollution incidents involving oil and fuel each year. Oil makes drinking water unsafe and a substantial amount of oil released into oceans or become river water pollution will destroy marine life and the ecosystems that support them. What’s more oil reduces the oxygen supply within the water environment. Oil is also naturally released from under the ocean floor through fractures known as seeps.

3. Industrial Waste

Industrial waste is one of the biggest sources of water contamination. Many industrial sites produce waste in the form of toxic chemicals and pollutants and some don’t have proper waste management systems in place. Sometimes industrial waste is dumped into nearby freshwater systems. The toxic chemicals leached from this waste can make the water unsafe for human consumption and they can also cause the temperature in freshwater systems to change making them dangerous for marine life. Finally industrial waste can cause “dead zones” which are areas of water that contain so little oxygen that marine life cannot survive in them.

4. Agricultural Runoff

To protect crops from pests farmers use pesticides however when these substances seep into the groundwater they can harm animals plants and humans. Additionally when it rains the chemicals mix with rainwater which flows into waterways and creates further pollution. Other agricultural processes such as uncontrolled spreading of slurries and manures tillage and ploughing the land can also cause water pollution.

5. Marine Dumping and Plastic Pollution in the Sea

Most items collected and dumped into oceans by many countries can take anywhere from two to 200 years to decompose completely! Other sources of waste at sea include plastic and other materials blown or washed from land. Currently about 11 million metric tons of plastic make their way into the oceans each year. Research has found that should this rate of pollution continues the amount of ocean plastics will grow to 29 million metric tons per year by 2040. The damage to wildlife habitats and to life on land is incalculable.

6. Radioactive Waste

Radioactive waste can persist in the environment for thousands of years making disposal a major challenge and one of the most harmful water contaminants. Radioactive waste released from facilities that create nuclear energy can be extremely harmful to the environment and must be disposed of properly; uranium the element used in the creation of nuclear energy is a highly toxic chemical. Accidents occur at these facilities from time to time and toxic waste is released into the environment.

In April 2021 Japan discharged contaminated water containing radioactive materials from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea. Though the Japanese government claims potential health risks and damage to marine life to be minimal as the waste water have been treated close monitoring is required to ensue there are no environment effects from the water pollution.

How Can You Reduce Water Pollution?

Reduce your plastic consumption and reuse or recycle plastic when you can.

Properly dispose of chemical cleaners oils and non-biodegradable items.

Use phosphate-free detergents – phosphates lead to algae blooms and kill fish and other aquatic animals by reducing the oxygen in the water.

Dispose of medical waste properly.

Eat more organic food which is produced without the use of pesticides.

Cut down on your meat consumption – raising animals for meat takes lots of water for the grains and other feed they need. Furthermore the antibiotics and solid waste are both likely to end up in groundwater and rivers.

Leonard David Bernstein 90 was charged with a felony of shooting with intent to kill according to Oklahoma Detention Center records. The victim was identified as 61-year-old Christopher Bayouth who was taken to the hospital and is expected to survive according to Oklahoma’s KFOR.

Bernstein was released on $50000 bail booking reports show.

A Morgan Stanley employee told police that the motive may have been connected to a work-related dispute as the two had been working together for nine months since Bayouth had taken over some of Bernstein’s accounts due to his declining health according to Oklahoma’s News on 6.

A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley which has around 16000 brokers said the firm is working with investigators.



“We are cooperating with the authorities and our thoughts are with our employee” the spokesperson said in a statement.

Bernstein could not be reached at two publicly listed phone numbers.

The employee in Oklahoma City reported hearing multiple shots until the gun’s slide locked back indicating that the ammunition clip had been emptied according to News on 6. Bernstein drove away and was caught at a traffic stop by police the local news outlet reported. Bayouth had been shot as many as five times with wounds to his torso back leg and foot according to a police report obtained by AdvisorHub.

Bernstein a 27-year industry veteran has no disciplinary actions discharges or investor complaints on his BrokerCheck record. He had rejoined Morgan Stanley in August last year after nine years at Wells Fargo Advisors according to the database.

Bernstein started his brokerage career at Morgan Stanley in 1994. He moved in 2012 to Wells Fargo Advisors along with three other brokers who had been managing $168 million in assets combined according to a Reuters report at the time.

Bayouth had been based at the same branch and has 33 years of industry experience all without any record of customer claims or other disclosure events according to the database. He started his career at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in 1988 and had been with Morgan Stanley since 1997 according to BrokerCheck.

The Western Nevada College Tech Express Mobile Training Lab provides industry-specific training for Northern Nevada manufacturers and businesses bringing state-of-the-art training and equipment to students and employers in rural areas.

That’s been the case in the latter half of spring semester with WNC providing its custom course Special Topics in Electrical Fundamentals to Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada employees.

Teaching materials were customized in partnership with operational leaders at Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada providing their workers with a solid foundation on electrical circuits and systems.

""This program is one way we are working closely with WNC to develop our employees and keep them up to speed on current technologies. Improving their skills through training is important for our employees as they solidify and grow their careers at Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada” said John Sanchez global supply chain executive.

A third WNC community partner Carson Valley Inn made it easier for the students to access their training by permitting WNC to park its grant-funded Tech Express mobile lab in its parking lot in Minden.

“When WNC asked if we could stage the lab at Carson Valley Inn and explained this incredible resource and how it contributes to workforce development we were pleased to host the lab here” said Maggi Vandenburg sales director for Carson Valley Inn.

WNC's Tech Express Mobile Manufacturing Training Laboratory was created so the college could share its programs with students in rural areas as well as provide important resources that develop a skilled workforce for employers. The project was funded through grants from the Governor’s Office of Economic Development as part of the Workforce Innovations for a New Nevada program the William N. Pennington Foundation Tesla and Wells Fargo.

Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada has hired WNC students previously who have trained in the college’s Automation and Industrial Technology program establishing a pipeline for specific needs they have on their teams.

“This Douglas County employer has been a long-term partner of our programs at the Automation and Industrial Technology Center and we have several previous students working on their teams so when we talk about the details of technical training needed it is easy to find alignment with our classes and available content” said Emily Howarth WNC’s professor of Electronics and Industrial Technology Automation and Industrial Technology Center.

The current students all work in the fields of manufacturing and electrical assembly so the focus was on ensuring a solid foundation of both theory and practice.

“The students have all performed with great professionalism as we have worked together to share space and timing in the mobile lab” Howarth said.

The Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada employees and WNC's Tech Express training lab were relocated to Carson Valley Inn for training because the Baker Hughes/Bently Nevada parking lot was being repaved.

As an added bonus because WNC has spearheaded the Smart Automation Certification Alliance partnership in Nevada Howarth was able to provide these students access to prepare for and earn a leading-edge industry certification — the SACA Electrical Specialist. This is a technical knowledge and skills test to gain silver and gold level certification with a nationally recognized credential.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wMi90cnVtcC1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtZmlybS10aGF0LXJ1bnMtdHJ1dGgtc29jaWFsLXN1YnBvZW5hZWQtYnktZmVkcy1zdG9jay1yZWd1bGF0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump media firm that runs Truth Social subpoenaed by feds stock regulators,"Donald Trump’s social media company and some of its employees received subpoenas from both a federal grand jury and securities regulators according to a public disclosure Friday possibly delaying or even killing a deal promising a cash infusion needed to take on Twitter.

Trump Media & Technology Group received subpoenas from a grand jury in New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission according to a securities document filed by Digital World Acquisition Corp. on Friday. Digital World has plans to buy Trump Media releasing $1.3 billion for its fledging business but the deal is unlikely to be done during two legal probes.

Trump who is Trump Media’s chairman was not among the employees who received subpoenas according to a Trump Media statement.

On Monday Digital World announced it had received subpoenas from the same grand jury convened by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office. Digital World has been under investigation by the SEC for possible violations for months a development that has weighed on the stock.

Digital World stock closed Friday at $5.78 down 25% in a week. It had been at over $100 last year after the company announced it had a deal to buy the former president’s social media firm.

The SEC has been looking into whether Digital World broke rules by having substantial talks about buying Trump’s company starting early last year before Digital World sold stock to the public for the first time in September. Just weeks later it announced it would be buying Trump’s company.

Digital World is one of a once-popular group of “blank-check” companies that go public as empty corporate entities with no operations only offering investors the promise they will buy a business in the future. As such they are allowed to sell stock to the public quickly without the usual regulatory disclosures and delays but only if they haven’t already lined up possible acquisition targets.

Trump’s social media offering called Truth Social launched in February. It said it is fighting Big Tech limits on speech. Trump was banned from Twitter Facebook and YouTube last year after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

Trump Media last year lined up dozens of investors to pump $1 billion into the company but can’t get the cash until the Digital World acquisition is completed. An additional $300 million would come from Digital World itself."

A pair of big-tree hunters say they have located one of the largest trees in Canada in a remote corner of Lynn Valley in North Vancouver.

Colin Spratt and Ian Thomas say they have found an ancient Western red cedar measuring somewhere between 4.8 to 5.8 meters (15.7 to 19 feet) in diameter deep in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park making it the fourth-widest known tree in Canada reports Richmond News.

They have dubbed the tree “The North Shore Giant” and estimate that it is likely more than 2000 years old.

CBC News Canada is reporting that if the 5.8-meter diameter is accurate the behemoth found in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park would barely fit inside the cabin of a Boeing 747.

The tree’s diameter at breast height (DBH) still needs to be officially verified and could end up being up to a meter less than his 5.8-meter calculation Thomas said depending on how it’s measured on a rugged steep slope.

“It came at the end of about a 10-hour bushwhack” Thomas told Gloria Macarenko host of CBC’s On The Coast on Monday. “I spend a lot of my time studying satellite maps and government data sets — and just slogging through these incredible threatened ancient forests that we’re so lucky to have some of them here in B.C.”

Colin Spratt a self-described ‘Tree hunter” posted photos of the find on social media. “This cedar has been growing for easily 2000+ years” he wrote in a post.

“My goal has been to show people that in Vancouver it’s still possible to find Canada’s largest trees still alive and growing” he told the Daily Hive. “I’m glad to keep the dream very much alive that much bigger trees still hiding out there (waiting) to be found.”

According to University of B.C. forestry professor Robert Guy large western red cedars host “ecosystems in most of their branches.”

“A tree of this size has to be very old” he said. “They can get to 1000 or 2000 years old. We have trees on the North Shore that approach 2000 years of age.” And because red cedars become hollow as they age it’s often impossible to count their inner rings like other trees.

Spratt and Thomas are not releasing the precise location of the tree to the public and they strongly discourage people from trying to track it down on their own. For those interested in seeing something similar the Kennedy Creek cedar is located beside the Kennedy Falls Trail an intermediate five-hour backcountry hike along the east side of Mount Fromme.

The largest recorded tree in Canada the Cheewat Giant is also a lot more accessible than the North Shore Giant. The Cheewat giant is more than six meters (19.7 feet) in diameter and stands more than 56 meters (184 feet) tall.

Thuja plicata is an evergreen coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae and is not a true cedar of the genus Cedrus. It is native to western North America. It is commonly called the western redcedar western red cedar or the Pacific redcedar.

Thuja plicata is a large to very large tree ranging up to 45 to 70 meters (150 to 230 ft) tall and 2.4 to 7 m (8 to 23 ft) in trunk diameter. The tree is long-lived: some trees can live well over a thousand years with the oldest verified aged 1460."

Hundreds if not thousands of owners of boats pontoons canoes and kayaks will float on the many lakes in Minnesota for recreational fun in the sun.

The money those water-fun enthusiasts spend on their watercraft annually ranks among the most in the nation making marine vehicle manufacturing and sales a key component to the state's economy. For manufacturers and dealers knowing Minnesotans have access to thousands of lakes and the Mississippi River the St. Croix River and the Minnesota River make the state prime territory for sales.

""Minnesota has such a deep history around recreational activities on the water"" said Grant Wildgrube global product strategy manager at St. Peter-based Alumacraft a maker of aluminum boats. ""Fishing hunting water sports as well as the calm that being on the lake can bring has been a part of so many Minnesota residents' lives. There is an ingrained affinity for our water resources and the great diversity across the state that exists in many families.""

In 2020 Minnesota ranked fifth in the country in total marine expenditures said Jennifer Thompson senior vice president of boat and sport shows at the National Marine Manufacturers Association. That year consumers in Minnesota spent $1.1 billion on power boats and trailers to engines and marine accessories an 14% uptick in spending when compared to 2019 said Thompson also a Minnesota resident.

""It's really a significant economic boon for the state"" Thompson said. ""It's really not the case for other states. It's big business here.""

Outdoor lifestyle supported marine industries

Lake life in most corners of the state historically has contributed to the Minnesota economy according to county historical societies and the Land-O-Lakes Classic Boat Club. In 1889 Royal Moore started Moore Boatworks later Minnetonka Boatworks in Wayzata. The company's mahogany-hulled boats could be seen for years on Lake Minnetonka.

And while Minnesota can't take credit for inventing fishing boats or engines the state's companies for years have invented improvements or new types including the pontoon. That was the brainchild of Ambrose Weeres of Richmond who was named ""Mr. Pontoon"" by the state Legislature in 1991.

Ralph Samuelson 100 years ago last month invented water skiing on Lake Pepin. It led to several water ski manufacturing operations as the sport took off including Nor-Craft Marine Division of Northwest Plastic in St. Paul and White Bear Water Ski Company.

Dave Saucier a world-class water skier manufactured the first fiberglass water ski. The company he started became one of the biggest players in the industry in the early 1970s before the oil crisis and thus sky-high resin costs led to bankruptcy.

And then there was Larson Boat Works and later Crestliner which began in the 1920s in Little Falls and later became part of the late Irwin Jacobs' consolidation of the industry into Genmar Holdings. That consolidation in turn was sold off to others.

The recreational boating industry's economic impact in Minnesota — between manufacturing and services — is still significant. In 2018 it was $3.1 billion supporting 10936 jobs and 690 marine businesses per the marine association. In Minneapolis specifically the industry's economic impact was $1.8 billion sustaining 308 businesses and supporting 5911 jobs.

""That's one of the things that makes Minnesota unique"" Thompson said. ""We're home to several U.S. boat manufacturers with headquarters here and that's supporting thousands of jobs in our state.""

Boat businesses continue to thrive

Home-grown brands continue to grow including Wenonah Canoe in Winona; Alumacraft which is owned by Canadian company BRP; and pontoon maker Premier Marine in Wyoming Minn. which last year was acquired by Elk River-based Envision Co.

Wenonah Canoe has roughly 70 people on payroll Alumacraft employs about 230 workers at its St. Peter site and is actively recruiting to fill 45 more positions and at the time of the deal Premier Marine had more than 200 employees.

The U.S. boating industry experienced significant growth during the pandemic with people seeing the benefits of socially distancing on the water Thompson said. And with normal travel plans disrupted people used stimulus checks or extra spending cash to splurge on watercraft said Bill Kueper vice president of Wenonah.

""The pandemic introduced a lot of people to paddling"" he said.

Demand for their products forced state manufacturers to boost production forcing some to the brink of their capacities.

For Wenonah Canoe the largest domestic manufacturer of composite canoes and kayaks demand was so high in 2020 and 2021 the company emptied its inventory and had to put research and development plans on hold while placing all of its resources on production which included transferring desk workers into roles at the factories said Kueper who was among the office workers pitching in for production needs.

Alumacraft is expanding its manufacturing capabilities to meet consumer demand Wildgrube said and Premier Marine is investing in a 150000-square-foot factory in Big Lake that will open by the end of the summer said Matt Homan the company's chief executive.

Larger vehicle makers based in Minnesota that have added marine segments over the years are also experiencing a rise in sales.

Minnesota companies new industry consolidators

Medina-based Polaris Inc. reported revenue of $211.5 million for its marine segment for the first quarter of 2022 a 6% increase compared to 2021. Polaris acquired Elkhart Ind.-based Boat Holdings in 2018 for $805 million acquiring with it watercraft brands Bennington Godfrey and Hurricane.

Eden Prairie-based Winnebago meanwhile produced $126.5 million in revenue during its recent quarter a 637% increase compared to the same quarter in 2021 boosted by the company's $255 million acquisition of Bristol Ind.-based Barletta pontoon boat last July. The company sold 1655 boats for the recent quarter. For the same three-month period in 2021 Winnebago's marine segment did $17.1 million on 83 boat sales.

Sales are starting to cool down amid inflation following extraordinary growth over the past two years but are still above pre-pandemic levels Thompson said. In addition to keeping up with demand though boat and watercraft builders are also challenged by setbacks in their supply chains.

Cold weather events in 2021 knocked out dozens of refineries in Texas affecting liquid and solid resin material needs for Wenonah Canoe which has over 100 unique supply chains Kueper said.

""We had to pivot and qualify alternative suppliers and ration ourselves"" he said.

Winnebago reported backlog for its marine segment was $245.4 million and remains at elevated levels ""as low dealer inventories persist.""

It's a common trend among manufacturers across the nation Thompson said but companies are starting to see improvements in their supply chains which has helped fulfill orders that are still in high demand.

""While there are certainly some real economic challenges we are all facing across many industries from rising interest rates to high inflation we are really excited about the future for Premier Marine"" Homan said.

New interest offers potential opportunity

Interest in boating nationwide is higher than before COVID but far below a high in 2020 and 2021 the NMMA says. In 2021 the number of first-time boat buyers exceeded 415000 a 15-year high not seen since before the Great Recession Thompson said.

That trend is evident in Minnesota which ranked second in the U.S. in boat registrations in 2020 with 819377 up 7% over 2019 Thompson said.

""During the pandemic we have only seen this love for the outdoors grow"" Homan said. ""Consumers simply are not willing to sacrifice important time with family and boating is one of the best ways to be together.""

Many people in Minnesota own more than one boat or watercraft. According to a the state's Department of Natural Resources in 2020 there were 591546 adults in Minnesota with some type of registered water vehicle either motorized or nonmotorized.

""Minnesotans enjoy getting out on the water"" Thompson said. ""It's something we do and it's become a full-scale industry here because of that.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA3LzAzL2ludGVsLW9oaW8tYXJpem9uYS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWZhY3Rvcmllcy1yZXZlYWxzLXBsYW5zLzc2NjI0ODYwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel in Ohio: Arizona site reveals what we may see here,"No commitment required.

WYNN,Wynn Resorts,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV2YWRhaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaW5keS1xYS13eW5uLWNlby1iaWxsaW5ncy10b3V0cy0yLWJpbGxpb24tcHJvamVjdC1pbi11YWUtc3BvcnRzLWJldHRpbmctb3Bwb3J0dW5pdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indy Q&A: Wynn CEO Billings touts $2 billion project in UAE sports betting opportunities,"The process for naming Craig Billings chief executive at Wynn Resorts didn’t take long especially after he explained to the company’s board why he was the best person to be just the third CEO in the casino operator’s history.

After former Wynn CEO Matt Maddox told the board last fall that he was stepping down on Jan. 31 Wynn Chairman Phil Satre said the directors had to make one of two choices: promote Billings the company’s chief financial officer or conduct a national search typically the choice favored by corporate governance experts.

“We debated that decision very heavily” Satre said. “We ultimately decided after a lot of discussions and as an organization that we wanted to take the second route. But we also wanted Craig to come into the boardroom before we voted and tell us why he wanted the job and why he thought he was qualified.”

Billings’ presentation changed the board’s direction.

“I think one of the things that Matt did really well was to give Craig increased responsibility” Satre said. “That demonstrated to the board that Craig had not only the financial chops that were required to be an effective CFO but he also had the leadership and the operational chops to be a CEO. He gave us a very good inside candidate.”

Satre first became acquainted with Billings at International Game Technology. Satre was chairman of the company and Billings held a financial executive role in the corporate office in Las Vegas.

Maddox was with Wynn Resorts for two decades which included time as the top financial executive in Macau when the company’s first resort was under construction in the mid-2000s. He became CEO in February 2018 after the sudden resignation of Steve Wynn as CEO and chairman less than a week after a Wall Street Journal article uncovered years of sexual misconduct and harassment allegations against Wynn many brought forward by employees.

Maddox agreed to remain in the CEO position for four years.

Billings who also worked with Australian slot machine developer Aristocrat Technologies as the chief digital officer and with sports betting platform provider NYX Gaming Group said there are many similarities between the gaming equipment sector and the casino operations side of the industry.

He also grew up in Las Vegas.

“I've been involved in the nuts and bolts of how the gaming floor works for some time and learned what you have to do in order to foster creative (slot machine designs)” Billings said. “It is no different for the people who design the architecture for these amazing buildings. It's that same sense of artistry and creativity of swinging for the fences.”

In addition to senior executive positions with companies in Australia and the United Kingdom Billings held corporate and banking and accounting roles working with gaming equipment providers.

As Wynn’s CEO Billings said his “partners” are Wynn Resorts’ property presidents.

“There is nobody better in the business so it's really a general management role from that perspective and continuing to make sure that we are the standard-bearer for the casino industry” he said.

Wynn has two casinos in Las Vegas Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts and two properties in Macau (Wynn Macau and Encore are considered one property).

He joined the company in 2017 as chief financial officer and took on the title of president when Maddox became CEO.

Last year Billings was named CEO of Wynn Interactive the company’s sports betting and digital gaming division. At the time Wynn Interactive was spinning off into a separate public company. But the transaction with a special purpose acquisition company was canceled the same day Billings was named incoming CEO.

He said the events weren’t related.

“There was a healthy skepticism around the sports betting industry right around that time on how much was being spent to acquire customers” Billings said. “It was a coincidence in the way the markets were evolving at the time.”

Billings is now six months into the CEO position. Recently Julie Cameron-Doe took over as CFO. She had served in the same position with Aristocrat since 2018.

During an interview in the corporate office at Wynn Las Vegas last week Billings discussed the company’s efforts in interactive and digital gaming future plans in Las Vegas an expansion project at Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts recovery in Macau and the company’s $2 billion integrated resort project on the man-made Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

You had a wide-ranging career in the gaming manufacturing sector. What attracted you to casino operations?

When I left Aristocrat in late 2016 Matt called me and said “Hey we're thinking about doing something in digital. We'd love to pick your brain and see if there's a consulting relationship.” There was no other company I would have gone to and I wasn't really looking for a job per se. I spent my entire career in this industry and I've been a student of the industry for a long time. I understand the DNA of the industry that makes the industry tick.

I came in and Steve Wynn was still here and I worked very closely with Matt. So I was able to quickly develop that insider’s view. We're blessed in this company with many things but one of them is a relatively small portfolio of assets. You can see what's happening in the business every single day. The level of ownership and accountability amongst our people is incredibly high.

My love for this company is intense and it was forged not only from my history in gaming but from the events that have happened while I've been here. I feel pretty privileged to be in this position and I feel a pretty strong sense of responsibility.

You were part of the team that navigated Wynn Resorts through the departure of Steve Wynn and the pandemic. What were the challenges?

There were some harrowing moments but I personally thrive on challenges. Both the team and I personally did not shy away from any of those events. It forged the team closer together and I say that all the way down to the line-level staff. I'm incredibly proud not of how we as an executive team reacted per se but also of how the entire team reacted.

The reopening period (following the pandemic-influenced 78-day gaming industry closure in 2020) for our folks in the property was difficult. I'm incredibly proud of how they performed and I personally derived a tremendous amount of pride and satisfaction from that.

If you look back to the beginning of the pandemic we maintained employment throughout the closure. We maintained people's salaries wages tips and benefits and we kept the team together. You cannot replicate this culture in a short period of time and so we kept the team together and we reopened firing on all cylinders.

Were you surprised when Matt Maddox announced his departure as CEO?

Matt was here for a long time and did a tremendous job as a CEO. He made a decision to do something else and I respected that. Professionally we were very close. He was a very good mentor to me.

Much has been written about the post-pandemic rebound in Las Vegas (a record $7 billion in gaming revenue in 2021). Can this trend continue and does Wynn Resorts have plans for the empty land the company owns across the Strip?

We weren't surprised by the resurgence in Vegas. I think others were surprised. All of the levers that you need to pull to be successful in Vegas have generally come back.

I think there is certainly room for growth and there is room for growth in what we do which is the premium end of the market. It's really a question of timing. There are a whole bunch of factors that play into the cost to build and what the demand picture looks like. We do have land across the street but we have other plans for the company.

In January Wynn announced a $2 billion integrated resort in the United Arab Emirates. What is the thought process behind this project?

Matt and I were working on it together and it accelerated pretty meaningfully after I went over there in November. It’s an amazing opportunity and the opening (planned for 2026) puts 95 percent of the world's population within an eight-hour flight of the Wynn brand.

There has been tremendous modernization and progression in the UAE. The Dubai airport sees more than 80 million passengers a year. There's an amazing amount of inbound visitation from Europe the Middle East India and other surrounding countries. We believe there will be a robust cash-based business like we have here. We see it as a real extension of our brand.

Will Wynn have the only gaming license in the Emirates?

It's a limited supply market. For the foreseeable future we will be the only gaming in that area. The leadership is very forward-thinking and Ras Al Khaimah is a very progressive and thoughtful place where they do things with intention. We’re building on a portion of a man-made island and the rest of it is greenfield. There is plenty of opportunities to develop beyond that.

The UAE especially Dubai (45 minutes to the south) is known for its modern architecture. How are you working through the project’s design efforts?

The architectural design standards are extremely high in that part of the world. We don't take that lightly. A substantial portion of my time is spent with our design and development team right now on the programming as opposed to the exterior architecture. We want to make sure that we get the offering correct. You have customers at adjacent hotels and you have customers from Dubai. We will have customers from all over the world.

You were CEO of Wynn Interactive when you were named CEO of Wynn Resorts. Wynn Interactive’s online sports betting business is in nine states – New Jersey New York Colorado Michigan Virginia Indiana Tennessee Louisiana and Arizona. How challenging is the digital gaming space?

Given my background in digital I was the natural member of the executive team to spearhead that effort and my job was really to bootstrap that business and get it to become a real business. The real opportunity for us right now is Massachusetts (sports betting legislation is in its final stages). It’s an important one because that's essentially a new market where we'll be running on day one. We obviously have the land-based asset to bolster the business.

Still there is opportunity in other states. California (where Wynn is one of seven operators backing a mobile sports betting ballot question) is an important one and it’s an important one as it relates to Wynn Las Vegas.

The WynnBet mobile app is not available in Nevada. Why?

It’s complicated because the state still forces in-person registration and in-person deposits. You can see how that would be a disadvantage to a company like ours. In-person registration certainly hinders the ability to scale the business. Massachusetts will take priority.

Is Wynn Resorts interested in casino opportunities in New York City and other emerging states?

We’ve told the world that we're interested in New York. It's a market with amazing demographics and inbound visitation. So I think we wouldn't be doing our shareholders their due if we didn’t consider New York. There are conversations going on in Texas and in Georgia. But those are multi-year events. You have to deploy your capital carefully.

Wynn recently announced a land acquisition near Encore Boston Harbor. What are the plans?

The company has always done a really good job of acquiring land adjacent to its existing properties. We acquired (11 acres) and we've announced the intention to build a parking garage and a theater along with potentially some food and beverage and other elements. The important thing is that at peak we don't have enough parking. So this gives us the opportunity to supplement that location.

Macau has been in decline since January 2020. What are the prospects for its recovery?

Macau is an important part of where this company goes over the course of the next 10 years. I can't prognosticate when the market will fully reopen. What I can tell you is that the nature of visitation and the nature of the consumer will inherently shift through changes that have been made in the structure of the market. Some of the changes that have occurred during the pandemic have led to an amazing amount of visitation that is more leisure and retail-focused. The latent demand for Macau is undeniable. I remain excited about the long-term prospects for Macau.

Their leaders are happy with their decisions but they don’t expect any other properties to join them.

Two downtown Las Vegas resort properties forbid people under 21 from entering.

But don’t expect the policies imposed by Circa and the El Cortez to gain any traction in other Las Vegas properties.

Derek Stevens Circa’s owner in June 2020 tweeted about his place’s under-21 ban effective on opening day in October 2020. El Cortez this year made its switch to an adults-only property with a two-phase change that began April 1 and is ongoing through the end of the year.

The property tells potential guests when they seek to book hotel reservations that those under 21 aren’t welcome. By the fourth quarter of this year El Cortez will hire more security officers to keep those under 21 from entering the building. Some entrances to the property will be closed or converted to exit-only doors.

‘Works great for us’

Both Stevens and El Cortez General Manager Adam Wiesberg are happy with their decisions but neither thinks other casinos are going to do anything similar.

“It works great for us” Stevens said in a recent interview. “That was one thing we wanted to bring into Circa from the beginning. It’s one of the things I may have underestimated but it’s been a huge huge success at Circa.”

For El Cortez it was more about formalizing a policy that already made perfect sense for the historic downtown property Wiesberg said.

“The decision to go 21 and older is an easy one with very few if any negatives and a whole lot of positives” Wiesberg said. “We’re all family people here we have kids and we love kids but when they come into the casino there’s no pool there’s no arcade there’s no food court per se there’s no shows or any entertainment for anyone under 21 and there’s no real space that isn’t serviced by a bar or gaming in very close proximity. So when kids enter the property it’s all challenge and no benefit to us.”

Wiesberg’s remark about the absence of an arcade at El Cortez was actually used as a joke by Stevens when he elaborated on his policy.

“Circa was expensive to build and we couldn’t afford the arcade LOL” Stevens messaged to me.

Both Stevens and Wiesberg — as well as a couple of local gaming industry analysts — are convinced that there won’t be a rush of other properties banning people under 21.

There was some momentum to do so in 1998 when Steve Wynn then the owner of Bellagio famously vowed to keep children out of the property first by trying to ban strollers from the premises.

The policy was relaxed as guests wanted their children to be able to see the floral displays at the property’s Conservatory.

When Bellagio was turned over to MGM Resorts International in the company’s acquisition of Mirage Resorts in 2000 the policy gradually disappeared.

Some resorts have kid-friendly amenities

Brendan Bussmann founder of Las Vegas-based B Global and Josh Swissman founding partner of the Las Vegas-based Strategy Organization say they don’t see other casinos moving to go adults-only.

One reason: Many nongaming amenities have been added to resorts over the years at great expense — bowling alleys theaters waterpark-style pools roller coasters and other family-friendly attractions.

From 1992 to 2003 MGM Grand had MGM Grand Adventures a theme park with various amusement rides on its property. It was an era in which Las Vegas touted itself as a family destination and Time magazine chronicled it with a cover story about the changing appeal of the city.

But as with many aspects of Las Vegas attitudes and philosophies have changed and the city continues to reinvent itself on many levels including ideas about whether it should be an adult destination. Stevens and Wiesberg have made their decisions.

‘Focused on gaming and bars’

Stevens said the number of rooms a property has becomes part of the equation on the decision.

“What I mean by that is we don’t have that many hotel rooms so when I say we’re giving up all of our business for a hotel for people with minors remember I’ve got one-tenth the number of rooms MGM Grand has or one-fifth of what the Golden Nugget has. So I figure it really depends on the property. It’s something that differentiates Circa which I like but I would certainly say this is not a policy that’s for everyone.”

For Wiesberg the policy enables his staff to focus most of its energy on superior customer service.

“We’re laser-focused on the slot floor and providing good odds and a good gamble and then in the table games with our liberal games and to support those gamblers our bars have been expanded over the years to provide the best drink service while you’re playing” he said. “Everything is focused on gaming and bars here.”

Krzyzewski retired from coaching after the 2021-22 season that saw his Blue Devils make it to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament. Duke fell to rival North Carolina in the game marking the end of Krzyzewski’s 42-year career in Durham.

Krzyzewski’s final team had plenty of NBA Draft talent as well led by Paolo Banchero — the No. 1 overall selection by the Orlando Magic. All told five Blue Devils heard their names called on June 23 including four players in the first round.

Center Mark Williams was the second Duke player off the board going to the Charlotte Hornets as the No. 15 overall pick. Forward AJ Griffin went right after him to the Atlanta Hawks at No. 16 and forward Wendell Moore headed to the Dallas Mavericks as the No. 26 overall selection.

In the second round Trevor Keels went to the New York Knicks with the No. 42 overall pick ending a successful draft for Duke.

With Krzyzewski out Jon Scheyer is now in as Blue Devils coach and got to work on the recruiting trail. Duke has the No. 1 recruiting class from the class of 2022 according to the On3 Consensus Team Recruiting Ranking and has some huge names as part of the group. The class is headlined by Dariq Whitehead and Dereck Lively II — the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the country respectively according to the On3 Consensus a complete and equally weighted industry-generated average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies."

The liquor store in the farming town of Morris Minn. cools its beer with solar power. Voters in Athens Ohio imposed a carbon fee on themselves. Citizens in Fairfax County Va. teamed up for a year and a half to produce a 214-page climate action plan.

Across the country communities and states are accelerating their efforts to fight climate change as action stalls on the national level. This week the Supreme Court curtailed the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants one of the biggest sources of planet-warming pollution — the latest example of how the Biden administration’s climate tools are getting chipped away.

During the Trump administration which aggressively weakened environmental and climate protections local efforts gained importance. Now experts say local action is even more critical for the United States — which is second only to China in emissions — to have a chance at helping the world avert the worst effects of global warming.

This patchwork approach is no substitute for a coordinated national strategy. Local governments have limited reach authority and funding.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyYW5kZm9ya3NoZXJhbGQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy91bmQtaG9ja2V5L2Jyb2NrLWJvZXNlci1zaWducy10aHJlZS15ZWFyLWRlYWwtd29ydGgtbmVhcmx5LTIwLW1pbGxpb24td2l0aC12YW5jb3V2ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brock Boeser signs three-year deal worth nearly $20 million with Vancouver,"VANCOUVER — Brock Boeser will be staying with the Vancouver Canucks.

The former UND star has signed a three-year contract worth $19.95 million. The contract will take him through the 2024-25 season.

Boeser 25 was set to become a restricted free agent this summer.

Boeser will instead stay with the franchise that drafted him No. 23 overall in 2015. According to CapFriendly  Boeser will be able to submit a 10-team no-trade list on July 1 2024.

""We're very happy to have worked out a new deal for Brock"" Canucks general manager Patrik Allvin said. ""He is a very talented player and has been an effective goal scorer throughout his entire career. We look forward to seeing his game progress in the years to come. Now that his contract is in place for three seasons Brock can shift his entire focus to his on-ice performance.""

Boeser played two seasons at UND helping the Fighting Hawks to the 2016 NCAA national title as a freshman. Boeser had four points in the championship game a 5-1 victory over Quinnipiac in Tampa.

He signed with the Canucks at the end of his sophomore season and debuted in March 2017. He has gone on to play five full seasons with Vancouver after that.

Boeser has played 324 regular-season NHL games scoring 121 goals and 256 points. He has twice led the Canucks in scoring.

Last season the Burnsville Minn. product had 23 goals and 46 points in 71 games.

She said many people are finding a huge gap between what their insurance company will pay and the actual cost to rebuild. The rising cost of construction materials and labor has pushed the shortfall to as much as $100 to $200 per square foot.

The monumental task ahead of hundreds of families to rebuild after the Marshall Fire is enough to overwhelm anyone but government agencies and private companies are asking families to move forward and rebuild better.

“It actually saves people money in the long run. So you can electrify your house you can have clean indoor air you can have all renewable energy powering your home. And right now even if you were to do it without incentives and rebates you would be better off” Stolzmann explained.

She and others are talking about rebuilding to high-efficiency or Passive House standards which are defined by air-tight fully-electric highly energy efficient buildings. As Stolzmann mentioned there are some pretty hefty incentives available for Marshall Fire victims.

Louisville Mayor Ashley Stolzmann talks about the many financial health and environmental benefits of rebuilding to Passive House standards.

Xcel Energy is offering one-time incentives to those families who put the time and money into building more efficient homes. There is a range of standards and rebates being offered starting at building an ENERGY STAR® Home v3.2 and receiving $10000 as well as building a home to Passive House standards and receiving $37500.

“The rebate will cover the entire certification costs and typically any added design and energy modeling expenses for an average budgeted home. The extra costs in upgrading the actual building is very much in the hands of the team that designs and builds it” said Andrew Michler a Passive House designer who is working with a number of Marshall Fire victims to rebuild to Passive House standards.

Michler helped build and design Colorado’s first certified Passive House in 2016. He is the first to tell anyone that upfront costs are comparable to building a “typical” home but people will save immediately when they move in.

[Related: Meet the man behind Colorado's first Passive House]

“So if a mortgage is a little bit more but the energy costs are a little bit less you end up paying the same amount for a better more durable product at the end of the day” said Michler.

On top of that Colorado lawmakers passed Senate Bill 22-206 which was directly inspired by the Marshall Fire to establish a disaster resilience rebuilding program the sustainable rebuilding program and the office of climate preparedness. In essence the bill provides loans and grants to homeowners landlords businesses local governments and other organizations working to rebuild after a natural disaster.

Christine Berg Senior Policy Advisor for Local Government at the Colorado Energy Office talks about the many incentives and benefits of rebuilding to Passive House standards after the Marshall Fire.

“When you have something so catastrophic as the loss of over 1000 homes in one event there has to be a really coordinated response. I do think that this might be one of the first bills that not only addresses something like the Marshall Fire but really is funding for future disasters” said Christine Berg the senior policy advisor for local government for the state energy office.

Berg is also the former mayor of Lafayette and still lives there and this disaster like so many hit close to home. All these months later she said it still breaks her heart driving through the neighborhoods where homes were wiped out in a matter of hours. And that reality is why she wants people to really think about what they are building.

“Every county in the state of Colorado has had some sort of state-declared natural disaster. No one is untouched by a change in climate” said Berg. “So it matters … how we rebuild these neighborhoods.”

Both Berg and Stolzmann told Rocky Mountain PBS there is a lot of fear and misinformation unfortunately hitting these homeowners looking to rebuild. With new building codes passed last fall in Louisville  many are worried and upset the upfront cost is too substantial.

“People are stoking those fears and inflaming them to their own end. So when I see you know developers or oil and gas companies or energy companies trying to leverage those fears for their financial outcome it is disheartening” said Stolzmann.

Berg agrees with Stolzmann and said most of the misinformation is coming from builders and architects who don’t know how to build a house to Passive House standards. That is where the trick truly comes in. Starting from the design stage to picking the right materials to putting it together in an air-tight fashion the knowledge of building to Passive House standards isn’t that common.

However there are more of those materials and designers out there now than 10 years ago Michler said. He said over his career as a builder technology and materials have advanced immensely. This is why Stolzmann wants Boulder County residents to truly understand the details of rebuilding a home.

“We really need to get information out to community members so they not only know the real costs of rebuilding in a clean and green way but they understand the technologies available readily available and that there are many builders and installers in our area that are doing this already” said Stolzmann.

On top of saving on energy costs and being more environmentally friendly homes built to Passive House standards are also much more fire resistant. The simplistic shape of the building the triple-pane windows the air-tightness of the building and the materials used all add to a more fire resistant home. And if a whole neighborhood could build these types of homes a disaster like the Marshall Fire would be less likely to take out so many buildings.

“One of the major components of why neighborhoods burn is that one house that burns leads to the next house that burns and leads to the next house that burns. So it's a domino effect” said Michler. “So the more protected each house is from fire the more the entire neighborhood protects itself from fire.”

So as people come together to rebuild the message is to take time to do the research and think about the future and prevent the next Marshall Fire.

“Our community is an example for everyone to look at to see the effects of climate disasters and what climate change can do” said Stolzmann. “We can choose to keep doing things like we've done things that put us into this mess in the first place or we can do better and we can make life better for future generations and even for ourselves.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3NtYXJ0LWd1eS1tYWxpbnNraS1yZWFkeS10by10YWtlLW92ZXItYXMtY2FwdGFpbi1vZi1hdXN0aW4tYnJ1aW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smart guy: Malinski ready to take over as captain of Austin Bruins,"AUSTIN — Steve Howard asked all of his players a question during their exit interviews at the end of last season: Who should our captain be in 2022-23?

“Every one of the veterans who moved on every single one of them said the same thing: ‘Jack’s your captain’” said Howard who is entering his sixth season as head coach of the Austin Bruins of the North American Hockey League. “He will be our captain this season and it wasn’t like 90 percent of them saying it. It was 100 percent of the guys who moved on and the guys who are returning. They all said ‘Jack’s the captain.’”

That Malinski a 2021 Lakeville South High School graduate will wear the “C” for the Bruins this coming season speaks volumes about the impact he had on the team in his first season.

The 5-foot-10 175-pound defenseman played in 58 of Austin’s 63 games in 2021-22 helping the Bruins get back to the NAHL playoffs for the first time since 2019. Malinski recorded six goals and 24 total points and anchored the team’s second power-play unit by season’s end.

Jack Malinski

But his value goes far beyond the box score as he showed with his leadership throughout this week as the Bruins held their main tryout camp at Riverside Arena. After Friday night’s camp All-Star Game cuts were made players were offered spots on the team and the framework of the 2022-23 Bruins roster is in place.

Malinski is a key piece to Austin’s puzzle.

“He’s a smart defenseman” Howard said. “He sees the ice well he understands the game he’s willing to block a shot bring some offensive flair. He can defend too. He’s not the biggest guy but he can defend so well against big guys which is a tough thing.

“I was always trying to figure out how to defend a 6-foot-5 guy and Jack does that better than I ever did. That’s what he hangs his hat on being a good all-around defenseman and his smarts are what separate him from the next guy.”

Malinski got his first taste of the NAHL in the spring of 2021 just days after his Lakeville South team suffered a heart-breaking 2-1 double-overtime loss to Eden Prairie in the Class AA state championship game at the Xcel Energy Center. He had 30 points in 23 games as a senior then played in five games (recording one assist) with the Bruins at the end of their regular season.

“The biggest (adjustment) I remember is time and space” said Malinski who turned 20 on June 23. “In high school you have a lot more time and space than you think. It doesn’t feel like a whole lot though. Then you get to the NAHL and you’re like … there’s always guys around me always a hard forecheck coming at you.

“It’s kind of ridiculous how fast the pace is. Finishing my senior year here really helped. I got that little bit of experience then did what I had to do over the summer.”

Malinski excelled at the Bruins’ summer camp a year ago not only making the camp All-Star Game but showing with his vision skill poise and hockey IQ that he was one of the best defensemen on the ice.

This year’s camp was a bit easier a bit more comfortable for the veteran blue-liner who could start the season as the only returning defenseman on the Bruins roster. Four of the defensmen who were on the Bruins’ roster for their loss to Aberdeen in a first-round playoff series back in April had their junior hockey eligibility expire. Another Braidan Simmons-Fischer is moving on to play Division I college hockey at St. Thomas.

And though Austin has brought in a handful of talented veteran defensemen from other leagues — including Mankato native Nate Looft a hard-hitting 20-year-old who spent last season in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League — Malinski will be looked at early and often to keep the defensive corps and all of his teammates focused.

“It’ll be a lot of mental check-ins a lot of on-ice stuff speed-wise moving the puck up the ice quickly and learning the systems” Malinski said. “There’s going to be a lot of teaching moments but I’m excited to do that because that’s what the older guys did for me last year.”

The Bruins will report for training camp in early September with the 2022-23 season set to begin Sept. 14-17 at the NAHL Showcase in Blaine."

She is paid $12 an hour and says she is doing the work of two to three people because the restaurant is chronically understaffed. Now she like many Americans is facing another crisis: runaway inflation. And while she has noticed the food prices at her store have increased pay has not.

“The wages are incredibly low and not sufficient for the work we do” said Rodriguez who joined the Fight for $15 and a union movement to push for higher wages and better working conditions. “They don’t want to lose that extra money. If they can have their present workers do double the job and not have to pay another worker it’s a benefit for them but what happens with us? With food costs rising and gas prices rising how are we supposed to live?”

Inflation is hitting Americans hard. US consumer prices increased 8.6% from May 2021 to May 2022 the highest increase since 1981 outpacing overall annual wage growth at 5.2% in May 2022. Food prices have increased more than 10% over the year. A gallon of gas is over 50% more expensive than a year ago. The median monthly rent in the US hit an all-time high of $2002 a month in May 2022.

Among those bearing the heaviest brunt of the rising costs of basic necessities are fast-food workers the majority of whom are paid less than $15 an hour with few or no benefits. Many of these workers are not seeing any pay increases to correlate with the rising prices they are facing for food shelter clothing and transportation.

And while workers in the fast-food industry are struggling with low pay and understaffing corporate fast-food chains have reported immense profits.

McDonald’s reported record sales growth in 2021 at 13.8% and a profit of $7.5bn and the company’s CEO Chris Kempczinski was paid more than $20m in 2021 more than 2250 times the median worker pay.

Yum! Brands which owns the fast-food chains Taco Bell KFC and Pizza Hut reported a $399m profit in the first quarter of 2022 a 22% increase from the first quarter of 2021. David Gibbs the CEO of Yum! Brands received a salary more than 2100 times that of the median worker pay at $27.5m in 2021.

Chelsie Church a shift lead manager at a Taco Bell in the Denver Colorado area for about one year started a petition on Coworker recently pushing for the company to raise wages as the low pay has left workers struggling to make ends meet. Church says shifts are grossly understaffed and that low pay undermines hiring and retention as competitors nearby pay better.

“No one can live off $13 an hour” said Church. “We have to deal with angry customers all the time about our prices going up but our pay isn’t.”

Church said her biweekly paycheck doesn’t cover basic bills and expenses such as food gas and other necessities. As a shift lead manager she received a pay increase to $16 an hour but she argued the extra workload and responsibilities are not worth it and other employers start entry-level workers at that pay.

No one gets a break. I don’t get a break Chelsie Church

“They’ve had quite a few people turn down the job because it’s not going to be enough to pay rent or help you buy kids’ clothes and food” she said. “Everyone is just busting their butt with extra work they’re not getting paid for. No one gets a break. I don’t get a break.”

In Kansas City Missouri where Fran Marion has worked as a shift lead at Taco Bell for about one year she has experienced similar problems of low pay understaffing and overwork – all while inflation drives up her cost of living.

“I make $16 an hour and I’m literally still living paycheck to paycheck and the pay definitely doesn’t match the work they expect from me at all” said Marion. “I’m so drained from having to fill in those extra positions plus do what upper management wants me to do within the time frame that they need me to do it in.”

She gets no paid time off and can’t afford the health insurance coverage offered to employees by the company.

“Everything is going up but pay” added Marion. “We’re human like everybody else. We may not be doctors or lawyers but we’re still workers and we’re people who struggle to provide for our families.”

At Burger King in Independence Missouri Bill Thompson makes only $11.15 an hour after 10 years with the company. With inflation it has become even more difficult for Thompson to make ends meet. He hasn’t received any recent pay increase while working understaffed.

“I’m doing the work of three people” said Thompson. “Food prices have tripled on meat and dairy. We already go to food pantries and we get food nobody else likes like peanut butter powdered milk and mystery meat. Where’s the dignity in that?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

According to scientists it presents with significant economic implications such as drop in production compromised milk quality and extra costs on veterinary services.

Dr Brian Arinaitwe a livestock expert with Zoetis an animal health company that develops and manufactures veterinary vaccines and medicines diagnostic products genetic tests and bio devices among others says an average clinical case of mastitis costs the farmer approximately Shs700000 in management. Costs associated with a case of mastitis are most often related to milk loss drug treatments additional labour and withdrawal time for milk residue clearance.

A big challenge

Mastitis is an infectious disease resulting in an inflammatory reaction in the mammary gland of the cow. It is mostly characterised by various degrees of severity - ranging from mild conditions with no gross changes in the milk to a moderate level with an increase in inflammatory cells and gross changes in the milk. It may be accompanied by such signs as swelling redness and painfulness of the mammary glands. Mastitis can be severe with all of the above changes in the milk and signs including fever depression even death in the most severe cases. Mastitis reduces milk production and milk quality. Almost everything that is done at milking time can contribute in some way to the risk of a cow developing mastitis.

In Uganda hand milking is mostly practiced with minimal hand washing during milking. To make matters worse milk is mainly delivered to mobile milk-collecting centres located under tree shades.

The use of antibiotics for common cattle diseases such as mastitis in cows and diarrhoea in calves is widespread both in smallholder and large-scale dairy farming. This causes raw milk to be contaminated with antibiotic drug-resistant bacterial pathogens which is a public health concern.

Ensuring good udder health for first-lactation animals should begin well before they enter the lactating herd. According to Dr Arinaitwe this is the main reason farmers must pay attention to cow udder health.

Managing mastitis

Control of mastitis is based on prevention of infections. According to Dr Arinaitwe a sound mastitis control programme should be implemented.

He recommends such practices as proper use of milking machines pre- and post-milking teat disinfection dry cow therapy at the end of lactation use of teat sealants culling of cows with chronic mastitis and vaccination.

For mild to moderate cases of mastitis the preferred form of treatment is with an intra-mammary mastitis tube.

Dr Arinaitwe believes it is essential that the drying off procedure is done meticulously.

He says that the start and end of the dry period pose particular risk for cows picking up new mastitis infections so it is crucial to pay attention during these critical times.

“Mastitis is a human made disease – it is not herd dependent but human dependent. You need to manage the environment at drying off have a good procedure use the right product and ensure milk production is reduced” he adds.

Dr Arinaitwe explains that to minimise the risk of infection being introduced at the start of the dry period the first priority should be to ensure drying off is carried out as a specific event and not at the same time as milking.

He advises using fresh cotton wool soaked in warm water and a disinfectant that will clean and soften the teats. He cautions against washing the whole udder so as to avoid drawing contamination down to the teat ends.

“Teats should then be dried thoroughly with a fresh paper towel. Teat wipes or fresh cotton wool should then be used to apply surgical spirit to the teat ends” he says.

Diagnostics

He explains the prevention of intramammary infections further reduces clinical cases.

This can be used by applying an effective pre-dip to achieve the goal of having teats with very few bacteria on them.

Pre-dip does not work very well in the presence of organic matter such as manure and bedding on the teats.

Dr Arinaitwe recommends regular submission of milk samples from clinical cases to laboratories for analysis as an essential tool to help guide farmers’ control plans and treatment decisions.

He adds that focus should also be placed on the use of diagnostics to help tailor mastitis control on the farm.

Diagnosis should be made on clinical signs of abnormal milk swelling of the udder and general signs of illness such as fever depression loss of appetite and in many cases a reduction in milk production.

For subclinical mastitis the diagnosis will be made on the basis of an increase in somatic cells in the milk. Bacteriology provides useful information about the likely source of the bacteria and aids in developing a mastitis control plan.

Other measures

James Mugerwa a mixed farmer in Mukono says one of the most important tools for farmers is to keep farm records and only buy cattle with traceable disease and treatment history and movement.

“The animal you get to the farm should be vaccinated have a clear record from the diseases it was treated for and it should be the right breed” he says.

Recommended practices

• Proper use of a functional milking machine with appropriate milking machine maintenance.

• Teat dipping pre- and post-milking with an effective approved teat dip.

• Early treatment of clinical cases.

• Dry cow therapy at the end of lactation with one of a dry cow mastitis products.

• Use of an internal teat sealant.

• Culling of cows with chronic mastitis.",,,,,,,,,,,,
