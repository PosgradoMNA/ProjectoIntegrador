Christianna Hang submitted her letter of resignation days after the state auditor's office determined that Hmong College Prep Academy (HCPA) failed to follow state law and its own policies when it invested $5 million in the hedge fund. The office sent its findings to the Ramsey County Attorney's Office for possible action.

The school's authorizer Bethel University also recommended earlier that the board fire Hang.

The board plans to meet Monday to vote on Hang's resignation and decide on an interim leadership plan.

""We have promised since school began that we would be open and transparent about the ongoing issues we are actively managing and resolving with school regulatory officials"" the board said in its message to families. ""Our school operations and HCPA's high-quality instruction will continue as normal.""

HCPA opened in 2004 with 200 ninth- and 10th-graders according to its website and since has undergone several expansions on what now is a sprawling grades K-12 campus in the Como Park neighborhood.

The Hmong charter school is the top destination for families who decide against sending their children to St. Paul Public Schools. According to a recent report to that district's school board 1642 of the city's school-aged children went to HCPA during the 2019-20 school year.

HCPA had been eyeing financing options for a new middle school when it made the hedge fund investment in 2019 according to federal court documents filed by HCPA and the hedge fund Woodstock Capital LLC.

The school sued the hedge fund alleging fraud and negligence. Woodstock Capital attributed the losses to the pandemic.

Last week State Auditor Julie Blaha said her office was not assigning blame to anyone for the school's losses.

Hang also served as the school's chief financial officer.

Bethel recently directed the school board to separate the superintendent and finance positions and to implement a two-person authorization system for electronic fund transfers.

The board said in its message that it has worked with families to create a special school community and is ""deeply committed to ensuring the success of the school today and for decades to come.""

In a statement Sunday an HCPA spokesperson said the school is ""managing and resolving … administrative and governance issues with our authorizer Bethel University.""

""We are also managing the leadership of the school community"" the statement said. ""The board has received a resignation letter from HCPA Superintendent Dr. Hang. The board will meet Monday to discuss the topic and next steps forward.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90d2luY2l0aWVzL25hbWUva2VpdGgtcnV0a293c2tpLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxMTI2MDg00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keith RUTKOWSKI Obituary (2021) - St. Paul MN - Pioneer Press,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/twincities/name/keith-rutkowski-obituary?id=31126084 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90d2luY2l0aWVzL25hbWUva2VpdGgtcnV0a293c2tpLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxMTI2MDg00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vbWVsbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2VuLXVzL3N0b3J5L2hvcm1lbC1taWNyb3dhdmUtYmFjb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Microwavable Bacon a Crime Against Humanity — Or Just Pork?,"Your suspicions over whether or not microwavable bacon is fishier than it is porky are justifiable. Given the number of ways in which questionable food offerings have been seemingly engineered out of thin air for the sake of catering to market segments we never knew existed I can understand why you’d think there’s something mysterious about the microwavable meat that might be covertly masquerading as bacon.

Yeah! What’s the deal with microwavable bacon? Where does it even come from?

In 1985 Geo. A. Hormel & Co. and 3M set out to conquer the science behind preparing bacon in a microwave. In the summer of 1988 the product of this collaboration finally hit the market as Hormel’s Microwave-Ready Bacon. The value proposition of this new bacon offering stated that it “eliminates the need for special microwave cooking utensils and paper towels while ensuring crisp bacon.”

Cooking utensils and paper towels?

Yes there have been plenty of specialty racks invented over the years to assist home chefs with the art of preparing bacon for the kitchen table by way of the microwave. As far as the paper towels are concerned they have an established history as the disposable go-to tool for combating the greasy splatters associated with bacon preparation which also includes the cooking of bacon in a microwave.

So how does microwavable bacon make things easier?

Essentially 3M developed a new material that pulled the grease away from the bacon as it was being nuked (broiled actually) in the microwave while still preserving its moisture. Each box contained four miniature microwave-safe packages that each held four strips of bacon.

Okay but there’s something funny going on with the bacon that makes it microwaveable right? It has to be some sort of Franken-bacon or Bacon-stein.

Actually the first bacon used in the microwaveable containers was Hormel’s original Black Label brand bacon. It’s really just run-of-the-mill bacon straight from the hog’s belly to your mouth with a little bit of stabbing processing and microwaving thrown in during the intervening production stages.

Wow I thought there was some sort of crime against nature being committed here.

The only crime going on here was a crime against our wallets. In a summer 1988 edition of The Wilmington News in Delaware it was explained how Hormel’s three-year investment into microwavable bacon science was based on a gamble that consumers would be willing to spend 17 cents per slice for bacon that would ordinarily cost them 10 cents per slice. In other words the company was betting that consumers were so fed up with having to place their own bacon between paper towels and shove it through the door of a microwave that they’d be willing to pay a 70 percent premium just to have their bacon preselected prearranged and laid out on fancy 3M cooking material.

Now if you want to talk about crimes against nature involving a microwave as the weapon of choice let’s round up the monsters who microwave perfectly good steaks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3My5uaGsub3IuanAvbmhrd29ybGQvZW4vbmV3cy9hdGFnbGFuY2UvMTc2OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Civilian footage shines light on brutality in Myanmar | NHK WORLD-JAPAN News,"Civilian footage shines light on brutality in Myanmar

“Antisemitism and hate crimes of any kind are abhorrent and Texas will not stand for it. That’s why Governor Abbott signed a law this year that created the Texas Holocaust Genocide and Antisemitism Advisory Commission and bolstered our efforts to eradicate antisemitism in the Lone Star State. We continue working with the Legislature to stop any hate and violence in Texas.”



UPDATE - October 26th 2021:

An Anti-Semitic banner was put up once more on a bridge over Mopac Tuesday evening.

This comes after a banner was seen hanging on the Far West overpass of MoPac this past Saturday reading ""Vax the Jews.""

The banner was seen again on Tuesday on a bridge over the Northbound lanes of MoPac.

Another anti-Semitic incident happened at Anderson High School last Friday morning where parking spots were vandalized with offensive racist words and symbols painted on them.

Shalom Austin sent a letter to the community stating the Austin Police Department was aware of the incidents that took place last Friday and Saturday and they are monitoring and observing the situation.



Some Austin City Council members like Mackenzie Kelly and Allison Alter along with Austin Mayor Steve Adler made statements about the situation on Twitter:





Shalom Austin gave an update to the community Friday night:



Dear Community

The anti-Semitic hate group we wrote you about Saturday evening continues to maintain their presence in Central Texas and conducted protests today in San Antonio and Austin. This afternoon in Austin the group rehung their original banner and added a second anti-Semitic one on the Far West Blvd. overpass over Mopac.

We were immediately in touch with APD including Chief Chacon to ensure the department was aware of this activity and had conversations with Mayor Adler and Council Member Alter. The protesters concluded their activities as a contingent of Austin Police officers arrived on scene. The goal of this group is to cause trouble be as confrontational as possible and attract attention.

There remains a chance the group will continue to hold anti-Semitic protests in our area over the next few days. Chief Chacon has advised us that appropriate enforcement action will be taken to ensure that the activity ceases. We advise that you do not attempt to engage this group.

is more information on the group if you are interested.

ORIGINAL STORY:

Community members feel 'unsafe and unsettled' after back-to-back anti-Semitic incidents

Austin Police and Jewish organizations are monitoring two anti-Semitic incidents that happened over the weekend.

with racist words and symbols. The day after over a Mopac bridge.

These two latest anti-Semitic incidents have left a community feeling unsafe.

“It was just really scary to see that going into school” Anderson High School Senior Aiden Horwitz said.

Austin ISD Police are investigating after offensive racist words and symbols were found painted across several student parking spots early Friday morning. This is hitting home for Horwitz as she is a member of the Jewish community.

“It’s just surprising that this is still happening in 2021 and that this hate is still so prevalent in the world” Horwitz said.

RELATED:

The graffiti was quickly removed and the school administrators continue to look for the person who did it.

“It seems like some of the writing could have been targeted towards a certain person.”

Horwitz says Friday morning a police officer told her that this is the fourth year that an incident like this has happened. She wants to see Austin ISD beef up the security at the school and install video cameras around the parking lot. Parents feel this is putting higher levels of anxiety on students.

""My hope is that AISD will implement programs at the youngest level up to help combat hate promote tolerance and inclusivity"" Aiden's mom Treva Horwitz said. ""

Shalom Austin along with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is responding to a second incident that happened Saturday where a banner was displayed hanging on the Far West overpass of MoPac. It read ""Vax the Jews.""

“They are provocateurs they are looking for attention they’re looking for social media spikes” ADL Austin Regional Director Renee Lafair said.

Lafair said this is an outside group looking to stoke fear in the Jewish community and there were warnings they were coming.

“Our concern is if overtime this becomes mainstream and accepted then things get more and more serious so our job is to try and keep things as far to the fringe as possible” Lafair said.

Austin police officers responded to the scene which led to pictures being spread on social media that showed an officer fist bumping one of the individuals. Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the pictures were taken out of context.

“The police supervisor arrives on the scene and he doesn’t support or condone the action; he stops the illegal action. He gets them to roll it up and move it away” Adler said.

Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon released a statement Sunday denouncing the actions of the individuals saying “hate and bigotry have absolutely no place in our community and certainly are not welcome in our police department.”

Chief Chacon said at the end of the conversation the responding supervisor declined a request for a handshake and instead opted for a fist-bump citing COVID-19 safety protocols.

“We want our police officers to make sure they’re enforcing the law and they did that by moving those people along and getting that banner gone” Adler said.

Members of the Jewish community told CBS Austin when they see symbols of hate it triggers things that have happened in the past like the holocaust.

Sometimes a single lens that covers every focal length you could conceivably need is the better way to go. For Sony and Fujifilm APS-C shooters there is the Tamron 18-300mm f/3.5-6.3 Di III-A VC VXD and this great video review takes a look the kind of performance and image quality you can expect from it in practice.

Coming to you from Dustin Abbott this excellent video review takes a look at the Tamron 18-300mm f/3.5-6.3 Di III-A VC VXD lens. A superzoom with a remarkable zoom range of 16.6x and equivalent focal length range of 27-450mm this lens can cover just about any focal length most photographers would need aside from very wide angles. Like any superzoom however you should not expect top-level image quality though it is quite impressive to see what Tamron has managed to do with this option particularly at its price level. And of course such a lens is not about top-shelf image quality but rather the convenience of having such a huge range available. In addition to that Tamron has included Vibration Compensation and weather-sealed construction in the lens making it all the more versatile.

ABBV’s flagship product Humira generated sales of $19.8 billion or 45 per cent of revenues in CY20. The blockbuster revenues are expected to diminish in the next 3 years as Humira has lost exclusivity outside its home turf from 2018 and from 2023 in the US. Meanwhile Rinvoq and Skyrizi in the immunological franchise are geared to plug the Humira-gap along with other large products in oncology.

Given this backdrop investors with moderate risk appetite may find this a good time to enter the stock that is trading at 7.8 times CY22 earnings and an EPS CAGR of 14 per cent between CY20 and CY22 (Bloomberg). The stock price bears the overhang of Humira loss and execution risk of Rinvoq and Skyrizi while ignoring the growth potential of newly-launched products and pipeline potential. ABBV’s acquisition of Allergan in 2020 meanwhile can help sustain strong cash flows and an attractive dividend yield of 4 per cent.

Immunology options

Humira’s (TNF based Biologic) major therapies include rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis under rheumatology; atopic dermatitis and psoriasis in dermatology; and Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis in gastro.

Humira’s wide scope of therapies is being slowly addressed by Rinvoq and Skyrizi. Rinvoq (a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor) has been approved for rheumatoid arthritis in the US in 2019 and additionally for atopic dermatitis in Europe and is in advanced stages for filing in atopic dermatitis (US) psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Similarly Skyrizi (IL-23 inhibitor) has been approved for psoriasis and is filing in gastro indications. Rinvoq and Skyrizi launched in 2019 generated combined sales of $2.3 billion in CY20 and ABBV expects to generate around $15 billion by CY25 (peak sales expected around CY30). Rinvoq and Skyrizi have so far generated strong Phase 3 data for most indications under regulatory review including better safety profile. But a recent post-marketing safety study on a competing JAK (tofacitnib) has revealed elevated cardiac and cancer risk which may apply on Rinvoq as well. A clarity on label with upcoming atopic dermatitis review should address safety concerns. But even otherwise Rinvoq application in second line of treatment (30 per cent share) should imply a patient population with higher risk tolerance.

ABBV has a strong hematologic oncology portfolio with Imbruvica ($5.3 billion in CY20) and Venetoclax ($1.3 billion) - which is expected to add a few more line extensions as it ramps towards peak sales estimate of $3 billion.

Line extensions of the two immunological assets can fill the gap of Humira while the other 50 mid/late-stage pipeline assets can drive growth for ABBV. Through acquisition of Allergan ABBV added a migraine portfolio which can generate around $2 billion in peak sales consisting of recently approved Qulipta (episodic migraines) and Ubrelvy (acute migraines). Allergan’s Vraylar approved for three anti-psychotic diseases is expected to generate peak sales of $4 billion by the next few years from $1 billion in CY20. ABBV also has an Alzheimer’s portfolio in mid-stage development and it expects improved cognitive function compared to adacanumab from Biogen. In immunology the most noteworthy pipeline asset is a TNF/steroid conjugate ABBV-3373 with positive results from studies in Phase-2a for rheumatoid arthritis. Antibody drug conjugates combine the specificity of earlier generation with the toxicity/effectiveness of conjugates.

Allergan was an once an acquisition target for Pfizer in a proposed $160 billion deal in 2015-16 which however did not go through. It subsequently sold to Abbvie for a third of the consideration. Its well-established aesthetics business (Botox fillers) complemented by neuroscience portfolio have been the main draws from a product perspective and favourable taxation domicile in Ireland also has a positive pull. But replacing Humira cash flow could have been the main draw behind the acquisition. Allergan reported high operating cash flow to revenue ratio of 37.5 per cent at the time of the deal. The company was acquired for purchase consideration of $63 billion (cash component of $39 billion and stock component of $29 billion ) in a deal announced in mid-2019 and concluded in mid-2020.. Generic threat to Botox has been perennial but the complex nature and established brand presence can protect the franchise. ABBV intends to leverage its large international presence and therapeutic sales ability to Allergan’s products.

Financials

ABBV reported sales of $45.8 billion in CY20 including consolidation of Allergan acquisition mid-year. Adjusted for a comparable base revenue would have been $50.5 billion and $49 billion in CY20 and CY19 respectively. ABBV’s EBITDA margins have been volatile at 25-46 per cent as R&D costs have ranged between 14 and 31 per cent in the last three years. Sales and other expenses were impacted by weak new patient starts the previous year which impacted Allergan operations as well. Its performance in the current year (1H CY21) has recovered to report 12 per cent comparable growth in revenues. . The two immunology assets are expected to deliver $5 billion revenues in CY21 and ABBV had guided to an EPS of $12.57 at the mid-point for CY21.

ABBV’s net debt to EBITDA is higher at 4.34 times as half of the Allergan acquisition was financed by debt. ABBV intends to paydown the debt in the next 5 years. With $18 billion in annual operating cash flows ABBV should address its $80-billion debt .

In this video clip from ""Beat & Raise"" recorded on Sept. 24 Fool.com contributors Brian Withers and Neil Patel highlight the strengths of each company.

10 stocks we like better than Accenture

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Accenture wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20 2021

Brian Withers: Yeah there was a question here from Fool Fan on ""Which is the better buy Accenture or CTSH?"" which is Cognizant. Fool Fan notes that Tom Gardner has CTSH in his personal portfolio. I know at one point Cognizant was a pick for the Everlasting Portfolio and I think they sold out of it. Let me double-check. Stock Advisor. Yeah. The Everlasting Portfolio sold but it's possible. Tom likes to keep one share of stocks [laughs] that he sold just to remind him that he was in that business and he has since moved on and that helps him keep track of it. Do you have an opinion Neil between these Cognizant and Accenture are very much going after the same digital transformation customers and focused on bringing customers to the cloud. Is there one that you see as a better buy right now?

Neil Patel: Not at for any particular reason off the top of my head. I think this is one of those situations where a rising tide lifts all boats thing and there's just such a multi-generational secular shift toward the internet that's just getting bigger every year. Obviously cyber security is a huge threat companies don't know how to deal with it they don't know how to prepare for it and it's something that I think every company in this space is going to benefit from. I see that Cognizant is selling for a much lower or PE if that's something that's a big deal for you.

The recent senior leadership merry-go-round among Australia’s largest professional services firms continues with Accenture pinching Wendy Saint Ruth and Shona Brady from PwC.

Accenture has picked up another pair of Big Four leaders in PwC partner Wendy Saint Ruth and PwC senior director Shona Brady who join the firm as managing directors in Sydney and Melbourne. Both bring financial services sector expertise with together more than 35 years of consulting experience. Meanwhile Louisa Francis has returned to EY as a data & analytics partner.

Wendy Saint Ruth

Formerly a partner in PwC’s consulting practice Saint Ruth specialises in business transformation and tech integration for clients in the financial services sector including the retail banking general insurance and wealth & asset management segments. Prior to her four years with PwC Saint Ruth spent over two and a half years as a director in Ernst & Young’s financial services practice in Sydney.

Shona Brady

Brady has been with PwC for close to the past eighteen years most recently as a senior director advising financial institutions on regulatory and risk. A graduate in commerce and information systems from Melbourne University Brady after a decade with PwC in Melbourne later transferred to the firm’s office in New York where she served as a director for two years until returning in 2016.

Ruth and Brady are just the latest in a string of Big Four senior leaders crossing to Accenture including recent high-profile signing James Nunn-Price as part of a targeted recruitment strategy instituted by former CEO Tara Brady who has now departed due to issues around travel restrictions.

Use the Polygon Tool to create a polygon with specific fills outlines and effects.

Set the number of sides of your polygon by double-clicking the Polygon tool in the toolbar to bring up the Polygon settings dialog where you can change the number of sides of any selected polygon or set the number of sides for polygons. The Polygon settings box includes an entry field for Number of Sides and a field for Star Inset which is used when you are drawing stars.

Check the fly-out menu for the Rectangle tool to locate the Polygon tool if it's not already in your toolbar.

Holding the shift key while drawing polygon forces all sides to be the same length. For an irregular polygon shape adjust the polygon after you draw it using the Direct Selection tool.

The answer is because freight forwarders and logistics providers cannot track those packages during delivery either. In fact 62% of logistics providers define the visibility of their supply chains as “limited.”

Even when we see a truck moving on the map we have no clue why it stops for several hours after reaching the city. That’s due to a lack of context across supply chains. For example the truck could be standing a few hours just waiting for a warehouse to open. How is that possible? Inconsistency and poor integration between transportation management systems (TMS) and warehouse management systems (WMS) is a likely answer.

What types of interfaces exist and why are they so different?

Supply chain interfaces include various apps and platforms that track automate and organize logistics services for all stakeholders and customers. Freight forwarders typically rely on separate interfaces with their own standards and data formats to achieve supply chain visibility process data generated throughout their organizations and collect insights about the market and customers. No wonder 60% of logistics companies describe visibility as their top priority for the next 12-36 months.

By accessing different interfaces freight forwarders and transportation companies can complete tasks such as exchange orders sync prices with a market send invoices and check inventory. To accomplish these tasks they can use integrated platforms custom applications APIs of third-party technology providers and commonly used enterprise resource planning (ERP) TMS and WMS solutions. But at the end of the day these apps must all interact with each other.

Integrated supply chain interfaces -- problems to solve benefits to receive

The most annoying problem caused by poor integration between supply chain interfaces is slow data exchange and the necessity to do a lot of manual work. A WMS can orchestrate inventory within a large warehouse but if it doesn’t know when a truck with new inventory will arrive the efficiency of the supply chain is drastically reduced.

In addition customers demand to know exact product origins and want to verify those origins at each step of the delivery process. To provide definitive proof of origins logistics providers have to implement QR codes on packaging RFID chips NFC markings and distributed ledger technology. Integrating these technologies can bring benefits that are much bigger than the challenges on the way to integrated supply chains.

Organization of scattered data. Integrating supply chain interfaces can eliminate data fragmentation and help establish self-sufficient data pipelines that saturate your organization with valuable insights and contribute to overall supply chain visibility.

Optimization and transparency. When supply chain interfaces communicate with each other warehouse workers can prepare items for delivery right on time bring everything to the correct dock and ensure other trucks can use other docks while this is happening.

Customer satisfaction and supply chain efficiency. Integrated supply chains help to avoid surprises and keep everyone calm. With an integrated supply chain mistakes become exceptions while customer feedback is visible to all supply chain participants.

Logistics companies and freight forwarders can unite their WMS and TMS in two ways -- by integrating an existing WMS with an existing TMS or by adopting a new unified WMS/TMS solution. Integrating separate systems leads to additional challenges as one system could be older less sophisticated and offer limited scalability. Such integration often leads to complete refactoring of existing systems.

On the other hand adopting a new system can be difficult and time-consuming without any guarantees that will perfectly suit your needs. There’s always a third way however to develop your own integrated interface to cover your exact needs.

Where to start the integration of supply chain interfaces

Integrating supply chain interfaces require some preparation. A logistics company should first assess the current state of their supply chain and recognize the exact problems they want to solve. The first step is to evaluate data that’s already in place and systems that already satisfy needs. Then it’s time to look for ways to strengthen weak links which often means automating manual processes and excluding superfluous operations.

Only after knowing what doesn’t work today can you get a clear view of how it should work tomorrow. Building a strategy for integrating services ensures you move further without a bump. If you have strategy in place integration itself will become much easier and will be a natural process for all stakeholders. Whatever path to integration you take integrating supply chain interfaces will boost your business’s performance and increase customer satisfaction.

Who wants their trucks honking around closed docks at 4 a.m.? Better to align operations with integrated interfaces and sleep tight while software works for you not against.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1bHRvZm1hYy5jb20vNzU2Njg2L3ZlY3Rvcml6ZS10dXJucy1oYW5kLWRyYXdpbmdzLWludG8tdmVjdG9yLWdyYXBoaWNzLWlsbHVzdHJhdG9yLWZvci1pcGFkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get ready to turn hand drawings into vector graphics with Illustrator for iPad,"Adobe shared a sneak peek of the new Vectorize feature coming to Illustrator on the iPad.

Turn hand-drawn sketches into vectors with Illustrator on the iPad

The video shows an artist making a pencil drawing than capturing an image of it with an iPad and Illustrator. The user then employs the Vectorize feature to change the image into a vector graphic that they can edit.

“This feature is especially powerful for creatives who save time with the ability to go from paper sketches to designing on the iPad quicker and gain the freedom to create anywhere with the mobility of the iPad and Apple Pencil” noted Adobe.

The developer did not say when Vectorize will debut in Illustrator on the iPad. But the Adobe Max conference kicks off Tuesday October 26 so that’s a possibility.

Vectorize is built on Adobe Sensei machine learning technology and it’ll debut as a technology preview. “Its performance will improve with time” says the developer so iPad artists might want to rein in their expectations for the earliest versions.

A big improvement to Illustrator isn‘t the only thing creatives have to look forward to at Adobe Max — Photoshop on the iPad could gain the ability to work with images in a variety of raw formats at the conference too."

Even so more facilities can be nothing but an asset and it looks like Italy is primed to attract one of the world’s top microprocessor manufacturers.

A four-and-a-bit hour drive away from the home of most Italian automakers In Modena the Italian capital of Rome is in negotiation with the American microchip maker Intel to construct a new microchip fabrication facility. Preliminary estimates peg the potential deal as being worth upwards of €4 billion ($4.7 billion).Traditionally Intel’s made its name as one of the worlds leading microchip fabricators in x86 archetecture based consumer electronics alongside their hometown rivals at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Both conveniently headquartered in the same neighborhood of Santa Clara California.As far as most people know Intel’s chips usually end up in high-end computers and tablets. What’s less known is they’ve also supplied microchip components to customers in the auto industry.Intel is intent on focusing on continental Europe as the location for the sight of their next production facility with Germany and France having also expressed similar ambitions for hosting one of the largest tech firms in the world.A large portion of the multibillion-euro project is expected to be supplied by public money.The Italian government has gestured to Intel that it is ready and willing to provide more than ideal energy and labor costs to make a deal more attainable.Intel’s profits lie for the most part in consumer electronics like desktops laptops and tablets. But the implications of another mega factory supplying much-needed microchips to industries of all sorts is a welcome sign even if it won’t solve the problem outright.

NBC

But the absolute crown jewel of throwbacks came near the end of the show with the revival of ""What Up With That"" the musical talk show sketch starring Kenan Thompson as Diondre Cole.

NBC

It originally aired in 2009 and was a recurring sketch until 2012. Since then it has been brought back one other time during SNL's remote shows in 2020.

As always Jason played Vance the tracksuit-wearing backup dancer and Fred Armisen (!!) played Giuseppe the saxophone player.

NBC

They were joined by special guests Oscar Isaac and Emily Ratajkowski  both in costume because it was the Halloween episode.

NBC

However — unlike every single other time we've seen this sketch — Lindsey Buckingham (played by Bill Hader) wasn't there! But we did get Nicholas Braun  even though Diondre was convinced that it was actually Lindsey in a Cousin Greg costume.

The actual Lindsey was on the show a couple of weeks ago playing with Halsey. Irony! NBC

Diondre started interviewing Oscar about his new projects but quickly interrupted him to sing the show's theme song again...

NBC

...which he continued doing introducing more nonsensical musical guests each time with the scene eventually descending into chaos.

NBC

This time the guests were Steve Bartman (if you are young and don't know who that is here ya go) and the Bee Gees. Look I'd never argue that ""What Up With That"" has ever made any kind of sense but how can you mind when it's so goofy and joyful?

Before long they were out of time with Diondre having once again ignored his guests.

If there's one thing Diondre Cole is gonna do it's disregard actual celebrities in order to sing the same song seven times with his friends then pretend that he feels bad about it. NBC

Diondre signed off by telling Vance to take care of his knees and encouraging the audience to watch Ted Lasso

Disappointing quarterly reports from Snap and Intel put pressure on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday but both indexes continue to trade in a bull market.

The U.S. economy remains stable and according to research company Refinitiv third-quarter S&P 500 earnings should show a 34.8% rise from a year ago up from an expected 31.9% rise at the beginning of the week.

Results from many big companies provided a strong start to third-quarter earnings and investors’ focus will remain on the third-quarter earnings season because many companies have yet to publish their reports.

Next week General Electric Advanced Micro Devices Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Microsoft Twitter Visa Coca – Cola Boeing Facebook McDonald’s Ford and Amazon are among the companies scheduled to report quarterly results.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday that the U.S. central bank is “on track” to begin reducing its purchases of assets and though monetary tightening is usually seen as a drag on stocks some investors view the Fed’s stance as a vote of confidence for the U.S. economy.

Tom Mantione managing director of UBS Private Wealth Management said:

Stocks are climbing to new highs and anytime the market is trading at or near its all-time high it is not unusual to see a little bit of more intraday volatility…and it should not concern investors.

Several FED officials also expressed concerns about high inflation which could force the U.S. central bank to raise rates sooner than anticipated. It is also important to say that the Initial Jobless Claims for the week ended October 15 fell to 290K which is the lowest number since the pandemic began.

On the other side supply chain issues represent a serious problem for the economy but the pace of recovery is likely sufficient for Fed officials to follow through on plans to announce tapering at the November FOMC meeting.

The upcoming week will be a busy one; the U.S. will publish the preliminary estimate of Q3 Gross Domestic Product while the quarterly results of many big companies will take center stage.

""I am not going to be able to comment about the facts or the process of what we're going through right now but I appreciate that everyone has been very sympathetic"" Matthew added. ""I think that we will need a little bit of time before we can really encapsulate her life in a way that is easy to communicate.""

After PEOPLE confirmed that one crew member died and another was critically injured Thursday on the set of the upcoming Western film the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department said in a statement that Halyna and writer/director Joel Souza were ""shot when a prop firearm was discharged by Alec Baldwin producer and actor.""

Authorities responded to a 911 call from the Rust set at Bonanza Creek Ranch at around 1:50 p.m. local time on Thursday. Halyna was airlifted to University of New Mexico Hospital where she died of her injuries. Souza 48 was released Friday from Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center where he underwent treatment for his injuries.

""There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins a wife mother and deeply admired colleague of ours"" Baldwin wrote in a statement on Twitter on Friday.

""I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred and I am in touch with her husband offering my support to him and his family"" he continued. ""My heart is broken for her husband their son and all who knew and loved Halyna.""

A source also told PEOPLE that Baldwin was ""hysterical and absolutely inconsolable for hours"" and he's looking ""to take some time to himself and re-center himself"" as he cancels his other projects.

""This was pretty devastating. This is how he handles difficult times. Whenever something bad happens in the short term he removes himself from [the] public eye"" the insider said adding: ""Everyone knows this was an accident but he's absolutely devastated."""

At a glance Companies: Umicore and Anglo American Challenge: Reducing the pressure and temperature needed for dehydrogenation of a liquid organic hydrogen carrier Response: New catalysts Status: Early stages of development

Hydrogen is one of the fuels of the future. Hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles emit no carbon dioxide only a thin trail of water. Unlike electric cars they can be refueled in minutes. And while H 2 is created mostly from methane today proponents see a future when green hydrogen is generated cheaply by water electrolysis that uses energy from the wind and the sun.

But hydrogen is also an extremely light molecule that must be compressed for shipping and storage. The infrastructure to get it into fuel-cell vehicles or power plants exists in just a few places.

Umicore and Anglo American two big players in precious metals have formed an R&D venture to advance a novel solution to the compression problem: the liquid organic hydrogen carrier or LOHC.

The idea behind the LOHC is to chemically bind hydrogen to a stable liquid carrier. This bound hydrogen can be loaded into a standard fuel tank just like a conventional liquid fuel eliminating the need for compression both in the fuel-loading lines and the vehicle itself.

For a hypothetical future vehicle to make use of the hydrogen the hydrogen-loaded LOHC would pass through a reactor containing a dehydrogenation catalyst. Hydrogen would then be released and supplied to the fuel-cell stack of the vehicle be it a car truck or train. The spent LOHC would be removed during the next fueling so it could be reloaded with more H 2 .

Umicore and Anglo American formed their partnership in April building on Anglo American’s earlier investment in Hydrogenious LOHC Technologies a German LOHC start-up cofounded by Peter Wasserscheid a chemist at Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg. The partners’ focus is the dehydrogenation catalyst.

LOHC is still in an early stage of development. An Steegen former chief technology officer Umicore

Some investors have warmed to the LOHC concept. In September Hydrogenious LOHC raised close to $60 million from investors including Chevron to further develop LOHCs. The firm is building a test facility in Dormagen Germany where it will store hydrogen in an LOHC and test shipping it to customers.

Hydrogenious LOHC and Umicore agree that the best current LOHC candidate is benzyltoluene owing to its combination of high heat capacity and storage density and low viscosity and surface tension. The molecule has long been an important heat-transfer fluid. In July Hydrogenious LOHC signed an agreement to purchase benzyltoluene from Eastman Chemical which makes it in Marl Germany.

But Umicore and Anglo American say more work needs to be done on the catalyst that dehydrogenates the LOHC. In an April 26 online presentation to stock analysts to explain the research effort An Steegen Umicore’s chief technology officer at the time said dehydrogenation with the current catalyst system requires pressures and temperatures too high to be practical for vehicle use.

Umicore’s role in the partnership is to develop a new heterogeneous catalyst—specifically a precious metal fixed on an inorganic support material—that permits dehydrogenation at lower pressures and temperatures. The company cautions that the project is still at the early stages of development and that it will take 5–10 years before an efficient LOHC could be commercialized.

In the April 26 presentation some analysts questioned the need for an alternative to compressed hydrogen for H 2 fuel systems. Alex Stewart of Barclays Investment Bank pointed out that “99% of the rest of the market is investing in the—sort of—old technology which is getting pure hydrogen to the hydrogen fuel cells.”

And while the hydrogen vehicle market is nascent it does exist in places such as California which has 47 hydrogen fueling stations. Eric McFarland chief technology officer of the carbon-free hydrogen start-up C-Zero says he was once skeptical about filling a vehicle with compressed H 2 . But McFarland has been driving the hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai in California and says he’s become comfortable with the fueling process which isn’t much different from a traditional gasoline fill-up.

Responding to Stewart Steegen acknowledged that compressed hydrogen is the incumbent fuel-cell vehicle fuel. But she noted that the safeguards needed to make hydrogen-powered vehicles safe—sensors alarms special seals in the event of leakage and a high-tech pressurized tank—add significantly to the vehicles’ cost.

Moreover California’s experiment aside converting the world’s existing fossil fuel transportation and storage infrastructure to hydrogen has yet to happen and would be a costly undertaking. Transitioning to a hydrogen-loaded LOHC would allow the existing infrastructure to stay mostly in place Steegen said.

“That said” she added “LOHC is still in an early stage of development. We still need to work on the catalyst for dehydrogenation to make it compatible with onboard dehydrogenation. Also the efficiency needs to improve. But nevertheless it has the potential to basically be a very efficient hydrogen carrier towards the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYWNsdWIub3JnL3NpZXJyYS9vdXRkb29yLWdlYXItbGwta2VlcC15b3Utc251Zy1hbmQtZHJ5LXNhbnMtZm9yZXZlci1jaGVtaWNhbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Outdoor Gear That'll Keep You Snug and Dry Sans “Forever Chemicals”,"In general I shy away from buying new gear. Perpetually chasing the latest and lightest outdoor gear is a wasteful—and expensive—endeavor. But sometimes the new thing really is an upgrade or it just comes time to replace that pack or tent you’ve used into the ground for the past two decades.

When it comes to rainproof gear—shoes tents backpacks—buyers should keep an eye out for companies that forgo the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their synonymous PFCs. These so-called forever chemicals do not break down in the environment instead building up to toxic levels that can have wide-ranging and deleterious health effects.

On Monday the Biden administration launched a broad strategy to limit exposure to PFAS—the EPA will designate them as hazardous substances under the Superfund law move to set drinking water limits for PFAS and require manufacturers to report on how toxic their products are.

Already a burgeoning sector of the outdoor gear industry had been innovating ways to ditch these chemicals in the construction of waterproof and water-resistant gear. Several rain-gear makers are doing the same.

Here are a few outdoor-gear brands leading the way when it comes to backpacks tents and shoes.

Deuter

Backpack company Deuter celebrated a milestone last summer when it officially became a fully PFC-free company. The company’s water-resistant products are treated with a PFC-free durable water-repellent finish (DWR) that Deuter claims is completely harmless to users’ health and to the environment. Deuter’s backpacks are water-resistant and many like the Furtura Air Trek ($250) come with waterproof rain covers. The company uses a biodegradable DWR that is bluesign-approved and made with 60 percent renewable raw materials.

The Tent Lab

Often buying a lightweight backpacking tent means sacrificing on interior space and features. But Mike Cecot-Scherer has designed his company the Tent Lab around making ultra-light tents that don’t scrimp on roominess and usability and also perform exceptionally well. They’re becoming known across the industry as being durable easy to set up and all-around reliable. Plus Cecot-Scherer’s products are entirely PFC-free and have been since the company’s inception in 2003. “It’s not that hard” he says. “You just order the fabric with silicone DWR and that should do it.” The Tent Lab’s MoonLight Tent ($450 to $825) comes in two- three- and four-person models.

Ortovox

Mountaineering and alpine climbing gear-maker Ortovox set a goal to become fully PFC-free by 2024. For now the company’s Swisswool products—mittens gloves jackets pants and vests—are all waterproof or water-resistant and PFC-free. Ditto its backpacks including the Traverse 30 Dry ($240). Like other packs in the series it’s made with welded waterproof seams and water-resistant zippers. The company mixes and matches various fabrics and coatings in its products most of which are PFC-free. Ortovox aims to become completely PFC-free by 2024; it’s currently phasing out PFC use in its hard and softshell products over the next two years.

Marmot

Outdoor-gear maker Marmot is working to be completely PFC-free an effort that extends to its lineup of tents. So far 89 percent of units sold right now are free of forever chemicals including the Limelight Tungsten Catalyst Fortress Torreya Halo and Limestone tents. Instead of using PFCs these tents rely on a polyurethane-based coating to keep the rain out. But Marmot says it doesn’t feel completely satisfied with that waterproofing technology—it’s working with its raw materials providers to find a higher-performance version of a PFC-free DWR to apply to its ultra-lightweight tents.

Keen

When this shoe company examined its products it found a serious overuse of PFCs. The chemicals were everywhere even where it was redundant or unnecessary like in shoelaces or in styles that weren’t designed to be waterproof like sandals. The company started phasing out forever chemicals in 2014 and has been entirely PFC-free since 2020. Now Keen uses a PFC-free DWR where necessary—and leaves waterproofing out of the equation entirely where it doesn’t make sense.

Waterproofing products

PFC-free waterproofing tends to wear out more quickly. Luckily several companies make PFC-free sprays and wash-in products that repel water without relying on fluorinated chemicals. These include all of Nikwax’s waterproofing products Granger’s waterproof spray and all products from Green Oil DetraPel and Hawk Tools.",,,,,,,,,

Just remember to pack bug spray!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1YW1wZG4uY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ndWFtLXN0YXljYXRpb25zLW1lcml6by1zZWFzaWRlLWItYi9hcnRpY2xlXzc0NGViYTllLTMxMjQtMTFlYy05Y2EyLTViNzQyNThiMDcyNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guam Staycations: Merizo Seaside B&B | Lifestyle | guampdn.com,"In this installment of Guam Staycations we’re digging deeper into the magic of southern Guam with a look at the Merizo Seaside B&B.

This utterly serene collection of three villas is located just north of Merizo pier and is nestled at the base of rolling hills and surrounded by lush jungle growth.

Property Manager Therese Araneta says that serenity supported by their No Party policy is what sets it apart for guests.

“They cherish the fact that it’s remote. And they like the ambience the green. And you know people are very friendly out here. There are scenic sights around this area the ocean views are spectacular … It’s peaceful. You’re on your own nobody to bother you. It’s very relaxing and they have this great view” she said.

Merizo Seaside B&B has been welcoming people through its doors for nearly a decade and claims to be the first bed and breakfast on Guam.

Its owners Eric and Manuela Rachmany have roots on Guam but primarily live in California — music lovers may recognize Eric Rachmany from his work with the reggae rock band Rebelution.

Each of the three villas is unique in size and decor but all feature a sweeping view of the water.

The Surfer Suite and the Coral Suite are both one bedrooms with foldaway beds that allow them to sleep three and four respectively.

The Ocean Villa has three bedrooms and daybeds allowing for eight people total. Guests can also rent out all of the villas through the Owner’s Residence deal allowing for maximum privacy.

The three villas converge on a grassy courtyard facing the sea. A hammock and lounge chairs await those looking to relax there’s plenty of space for kids to play on the lawn and an on-site boat ramp makes it easy to take out their small catamaran kayaks or stand-up paddleboards for fun in the sun.

Araneta says there is no shortage of outdoor activities for adults and kids alike.

“They can go snorkeling swimming we have kayaks for them and just spend time out there. They can feed the fish if they want to. And the eels there are lots of eels there are colorful fish” she said.

“They can go boating there’s a charter boat that can take you to what’s called Bikini Island. It’s a sandbar it’s beautiful. The water is so nice and the sand is so white and they can do dolphin watching.”

Guests aren’t limited to water adventures — Malesso’ hikes are a popular activity for guests as well.

“We have several hikes one very popular place is called the Priest’s Pool and that’s an easy hike. Just a small waterfall and wade in the pool area. And then hiking up the mountains to see the view of Merizo it’s spectacular” Araneta said.

The villas all have fully functioning kitchens and there is a grill in the courtyard. Merizo Seaside Bed and Breakfast provides cereal coffee and milk for guests but the rest of their dining is up to them. They recommend guests do some grocery shopping before arrival as the grocery options in Malesso’ are limited.

If cooking on vacation isn’t your cup of tea Araneta shared some driveable dining options.

“If you want just a hot dog snack you can go to the pier Merizo Pier. They have a hotdog stand there. Further walking distance there’s C&J Burgers. They serve a list of burgers hotdogs rice that sort of thing” she said.

“And if you want a bigger kind of meal you can go to McKraut’s which is very popular … Or you can go to Hågat which has Agat Marina for breakfast. You can have Lee’s Garden or Lemongrass for Thai food.”

The Merizo Seaside Bed and Breakfast has been popular with tourists over the years hosting visitors from all over the world. Lately many of their customers have been folks visiting Guam to get the COVID-19 vaccine and a handful of locals looking for a getaway.

For locals this is a unique chance to immerse yourself in nature and to seriously slow down — two elements that for all their glamour are difficult to find in the resorts of the Tumon tourist district. Araneta believes locals stand to gain a great deal of perspective from a stay down south.

“They can see the beauty of Guam how it can be if they want it to. They can also improve on what they have … and they should be proud of what Guam has to offer” she said.",,,

What You Need To Know Harry Miller is donating all of his NIL money to those in Nicaragua that need it most



Miller started going on service trips to Nicaragua in seventh grade



Miller says the trips have changed his way of thinking and shown him what is most important in life



Miller was also selected to be on Allstate's AFCA Good Works Team getting a $10000 donation

​​​Harry Miller has been to Nicaragua just about every year since he was in seventh-grade. To those kids he’s more than a dance partner he’s a lifeline.

But here in Columbus you may never know that watching him on the field each Saturday.

Miller said he was hopeful that one day he’d be able to contribute to the country that he’s traveled to so much. He just wasn’t sure if it would ever be possible in college.

“We were just hoping that something would break and being able to do something with the ministry and with just helping people"" Miller said. ""I have it hung up in my room and I think about it a lot.”

That Nicaraguan flag is a daily reminder of the kids that he wants to help.

“This is a flag I have that I got actually before I came to Ohio State. It’s got the names of the kids so this was 2018"" Miller said.

Miller’s many trips to the country he’s come to love is why he’s donating all of his NIL money back to it.

“You don’t need much to have much"" he said. ""That’s probably the biggest lesson I’ve learned from Nicaragua.”

The football player wants to be remembered as more than that which is why Allstate chose him to be on this year’s Allstate AFCA Good Works Team donating $10000 to Harry’s efforts in Nicaragua.

“It’s a great gift"" he said.

Miller said his visits to Nicaragua may turn into something else.

“I’ll probably end up living in Nicaragua and become an old man"" thanks to all the beautiful life lessons it has taught him he said.

“All that matters are the people around you and that’s what I’ve learned in Nicaragua"" Miller said.

He hopes to always give back

“Giving and being compassionate being self-controlled what a fulfilling life that is and that’s sort of all I want to do"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oZXJhbGQvbmFtZS9qb3NlcGgtY29ud2F5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxMTA3MjQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joseph Conway Obituary (1959 - 2021) - Miami Beach FL - the Miami Herald,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/herald/name/joseph-conway-obituary?id=31107240 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oZXJhbGQvbmFtZS9qb3NlcGgtY29ud2F5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxMTA3MjQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2ZXJldHRwb3N0LmNvbS9wcmVwLXNwb3J0cy13ZWVrbHkvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZm9vdGJhbGwtbWFyaW5lci1hdC1hcmxpbmd0b24tMTAtMjItMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High School Football: Mariner at Arlington 10/22/21,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.everettpost.com/prep-sports-weekly/high-school-football-mariner-at-arlington-10-22-21 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2ZXJldHRwb3N0LmNvbS9wcmVwLXNwb3J0cy13ZWVrbHkvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZm9vdGJhbGwtbWFyaW5lci1hdC1hcmxpbmd0b24tMTAtMjItMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9mcmVzbm9iZWUvbmFtZS9tYXJ5LXJvbWFnbm9saS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMTEwNzE5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary Romagnoli Obituary (1921 - 2021) - Fresno CA - Fresno Bee,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/fresnobee/name/mary-romagnoli-obituary?id=31107191 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9mcmVzbm9iZWUvbmFtZS9tYXJ5LXJvbWFnbm9saS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMTEwNzE5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

asked all of its associates to return to the office in a memo released Friday. The retailer did not disclose if this change is mandatory.

Walmart asked its corporate associates to return to the office next month saying in a note to employees ""there is no substitution for being in the offices together.""

The note posted on the company's website stated that associates who work in the company's campus offices will return on November 8 as part of a ""new more flexible way of working"" after operating remotely for most of the coronavirus pandemic . The company's Global Tech team will continue to work remotely the note said.

Walmart's return to in-person working will vary by area a company spokesperson told Insider in an email. Walmart's Global Tech team will continue working remotely while expectations for other associates will vary.

""Given all campus associates will be fully vaccinated or have an approved accommodation in November we will transition to working together in our campus offices on a more regular basis starting the week of Nov. 8"" Donna Morris Chief People Officer said in the note. ""There is no substitution for being in the offices together"" she added.

The move comes as many companies grapple with whether to make a return to the office mandatory for employees who transitioned to remote work about 18 months ago in the early days of pandemic lockdowns. Many workers have said they would refuse to come back to offices full time. Sundar Pichai CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc. said this week the company would enact a hybrid model. Amazon this month said it would let corporate employees work from home indefinitely.

In July Walmart mandated corporate employees receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Employees had until October 4 to get vaccinated Insider reported. Walmart was the first major retailer to require certain corporate employees get vaccinated.

""We continue to prioritize the health and safety of Walmart associates during the ongoing pandemic and know vaccinations are key to fighting the virus"" the Walmart spokesperson told Insider. ""We will focus our energy going forward on serving our customers and members and supporting our associates - not on where the work is getting done.""",,,,,,

""Given all campus associates will be fully vaccinated or have an approved accommodation in November we will transition to working together in our campus offices on a more regular basis starting the week of Nov. 8"" Donna Morris Chief People Officer said in the note. ""There is no substitution for being in the offices together"" she added.

The move comes as many companies grapple with whether to make a return to the office mandatory for employees who transitioned to remote work about 18 months ago in the early days of pandemic lockdowns. Many workers have said they would refuse to come back to offices full time. Sundar Pichai CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc. said this week the company would enact a hybrid model. Amazon this month said it would let corporate employees work from home indefinitely.

In July Walmart mandated corporate employees receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Employees had until October 4 to get vaccinated Insider reported. Walmart was the first major retailer to require certain corporate employees get vaccinated.

""We continue to prioritize the health and safety of Walmart associates during the ongoing pandemic and know vaccinations are key to fighting the virus"" the Walmart spokesperson told Insider. ""We will focus our energy going forward on serving our customers and members and supporting our associates - not on where the work is getting done.""",,,,,,

Release Date,"Based on the fantasy novel of the same name The Fruit of Evolution anime is slowly becoming a popular show. The last three episodes of the series have garnered much love and appreciation from fans all over the world. So far in the plot Seiichi and Saria have reached the Royal City and joined a guild to become pro warriors. After completing the first task of their exam they must face dragons in the second round. Here is all you need to know about The Fruit Of Evolution Episode 4.

In the forthcoming episode fans can expect to see the two players in major trouble. The first round of the guild exam was simply a combat training round. However the second exam is no less than a coffin’s play. The two of them have to take down the Demon King’s dragon and also prevent any collateral damage. But can the two manage to do it?

The Fruit Of Evolution Episode 4: Plot Details

The forthcoming episode of The Fruit of Evolution is titled “Black Dragon God’s Dungeon.” The next episode will begin with Seiichi waking next to Altria in the inn. As the legend has always gone Seiichi is likely to start his day with a bad omen. Nothing will work in his favor from the doorknob to the shower. Later in the training ground Saria and Seiichi will receive their first task from the guild.

In the main city they will find a dragon that the demon king has sent to vandalize the city. Saria and Seiichi learn that defeating the dragon was another part of their exam. Thus fans can expect to see an epic brawl in the main city. The two recruits will have to save the civilians and also take down the dragon. It will be interesting to see how the two of them pass this special exam in the end.

Previous Episode Recap!

In the third episode of Fruit of Evolution Seiichi and Saria enter the Royal City in order to move forward with their quest. There they meet some of the members of a professional guild. Seiichi was quite uncomfortable with the new team as most of the members there were desperately perverted. The two also met with a lady instructor in the guild. The lady explained that all her friends and peers were hounded by bad luck after she befriended them.

As a result she was given the name of “Altria The Calamity.” Later she announced that all the new recruits of the guild were supposed to clear a training exam. During the training Seiichi struggled to move into the sand. When the training ended they all went back to the inn. Seiichi learns that he has to live in the same room as Altria. Thus he was worried about the bad omen that would follow him so forth.

The Fruit Of Evolution Episode 4: Release Date

The fourth episode of the new anime series is all set to hit the screens very soon. The Royal City of Talbert is clearly not suiting the two warriors. So what will they do now?

Amazon’s cashierless technology made its debut this week inside the new Climate Pledge Arena.

We had a chance to test out the tech Saturday during the inaugural Seattle Kraken home game and it worked seamlessly. Other fans found it similarly easy and convenient.

“It’s fantastic there’s no line” one fan said. “I got a beer in eight seconds.”

Four food and beverage stores inside the arena are equipped with the “Just Walk Out” tech that uses cameras and sensors to track customers and removes the need for human cashiers. It’s the same experience found in Amazon Go convenience shops — there are now 20 across four U.S. cities — and the company’s newer Fresh grocery stores. Amazon is also bringing Just Walk Out to two Whole Foods stores starting next year.

The arena stores also feature Amazon One palm-scanning tech which lets customers enter and pay with the wave of a hand. Fans can sign up for Amazon One — we did and the process took less than a minute — or just use their credit card to get in.

Two of the stores sell alcohol; an attendant checks IDs at the entrance. The stores include 14 Hands from Chateau Saint Michelle; Seattle’s Lil Woody’s Burgers; Big Chicken a franchise from NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal; and a Starbucks grab-and-go spot. Lil Woody’s and Big Chicken make food on-site for grab-and-go pickup.

The Starbucks location is particularly interesting given recent reports noting that Starbucks and Amazon have discussed creating a new style of coffee shop featuring the Just Walk Out tech. The co-branded stores would reportedly let people buy beverages baked goods and hot foods without going through a traditional checkout.

Amazon last year began selling the Just Walk Out tech to third-party retailers which caused the United Food and Commercial Workers Union to raise concerns about threatening retail worker jobs and discriminating against underbanked households.

The Starbucks store at Climate Pledge did not feature any Starbucks food but rather traditional stadium food and drinks including beer soda candy chips and more. Starbucks-branded cold drinks were also available.

The use of tech to speed shopping and avoid long lines is a key part of the tech-enhanced experience that Kraken and Climate Pledge Arena representatives have been promising for years at the redeveloped KeyArena site.

Tim Leiweke CEO of Oak View Group which led the arena redevelopment project told GeekWire back in 2017 that he wanted to integrate Amazon Go tech into the fan experience.

That vision has come to fruition. But Lewicke also said at the time that drones could help people get to the game as a transportation solution.

We ran into Leiweke on the concourse before Saturday’s game and asked about the drones. “It’s coming” he said. “It’s coming.”

That remains to be seen. For now Climate Pledge Arena along with the TD Garden in Boston is pushing boundaries of the fan experience with cashierless tech.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIwNzgzMjgvYW1hem9uLW5vdy1kZWxpdmVycy1tb3JlLXVzLXBhY2thZ2VzLXRoYW4tZmVkZXjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon now delivers more US packages than FedEx,"In 2014 Amazon delivered approximately 0.2% of all US packages. Today Amazon controls one-fifth of the delivery market and is on track to overtake UPS and even the US Postal Service (USPS) according to data from the logistics firm Pitney Bowes.

Data released in Sept. shows the e-commerce giant has now unseated FedEx as the third-largest US package courier—and it’s trailing just behind UPS the only private business that still delivers more parcels than Amazon.

Amazon used to rely heavily on FedEx and UPS to deliver packages to its customers. But the company shifted its strategy after a disastrous 2013 holiday shopping season in which the delivery services failed to keep up with the torrent of gifts US shoppers ordered from Amazon leading to widespread delays. The next year Amazon accelerated the construction of its own distribution centers and began amassing fleets of semi-trucks cargo planes and delivery vans. Ever since Amazon has been steadily shifting more of its deliveries away from FedEx and UPS and toward its in-house logistics operation.

So far the e-commerce giant has focused on delivering its own packages. But the explosive growth suggests Amazon may soon enter the delivery market. Analysts believe Amazon is primed to launch a standalone delivery service in the US within months. The new unit would compete with UPS and FedEx delivering packages for outside businesses applying further pressure to make two-day or same-day delivery routine.

Amazon Logistics poised for explosive growth

Amazon Logistics the e-commerce company’s delivery division has already grown large enough to meet most of the company’s internal needs; it now handles two-thirds of Amazon package deliveries. But even so Amazon has dramatically increased its spending on logistics infrastructure. It’s buying dozens of cargo planes opening multibillion-dollar freight handling facilities and hiring 125000 new delivery drivers and warehouse workers in the US.

In the eyes of Morgan Stanley analysts that’s strong evidence Amazon’s delivery business will launch within 18 months. Indeed Amazon is already quietly handling some packages for the US Postal Service its largest competitor in the US delivery market.

If Amazon opens its delivery services to more outside businesses the company can leverage billions of dollars in in-house logistics investments—just as it did when it spun off Amazon Web Services into a wildly profitable subsidiary.

So far Amazon Logistics has failed to catch up to its US package delivery rivals in terms of revenue. But that may only be because it offers below-market rates to its primary customer its parent company Amazon. Amazon Logistics collects about $4.28 in revenue for every package it delivers compared to $12.19 for UPS and $17.95 for FedEx according to Quartz’s analysis of Pitney Bowes data.

Since its marketplace business subsidizes its delivery infrastructure it can afford to keep prices low while raking in profits. Assuming Amazon raises shipping prices for outside customers the e-commerce behemoth may itself in the market leader in yet another industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1hem9uLXdhcmVob3VzZS10aWp1YW5hLW1leGljby1uZWFyLXJ1bmRvd24taG9tZXMtcGhvdG9zLTIwMjEtMTDSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FtYXpvbi13YXJlaG91c2UtdGlqdWFuYS1tZXhpY28tbmVhci1ydW5kb3duLWhvbWVzLXBob3Rvcy0yMDIxLTEwP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We visited the impoverished homes outside Amazon's Tijuana Mexico warehouse,"For Hernandez an Amazon job would be the perfect combination of convenience and prestige giving him a well-paying job without having to travel too far from home he said.

“I’m telling people that the first thing they need to pack is their patience” said Ramsey president of All Aboard Travel. “If you are a type-A personality that needs everything to go perfectly you will run into trouble.”

Even after a summer of packed airplanes flight cancellations and face mask battles airlines are preparing their biggest flight schedules in nearly two years while also scrambling to replenish staffing levels and amid employee pushback over government-required vaccine mandates.

And gone are the perks of flying during a pandemic. Prices will be higher and planes will be more packed than they were a year ago.

It’s a backdrop that’s giving travelers pause especially with the chaos of Columbus Day weekend fresh in their memories. That’s when Dallas-based Southwest Airlines canceled thousands of flights citing weather and staffing issues while stranding travelers at airports around the country. It cost the airline $75 million in lost revenue.

The holiday travel season is typically more stressful with planes loaded with leisure travelers eager to arrive at destinations on time and winter storms looming as a constant threat.

“You do have to wonder if these airlines are prepared for the holidays when there could be significant problems with weather and pressure is high over a short period of time” said Henry Harteveldt a travel analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.

Are airlines prepared?

The airline and travel industry is anticipating a 2021 holiday season that will be much bigger than last year’s but still down slightly from the 2019 holidays.

Southwest’s flight schedule is about 12% smaller than it was in 2019.

Fort Worth-based American Airlines is planning to put more than 6400 flights in the air during its busiest day this season Nov. 28 the Sunday following Thanksgiving according to Diio by Cirium. That’s only about 5% fewer flights than it had in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet airline executives spent the last two weeks trying to convince travelers and investors that flight delays and cancellations plaguing the summer and fall months won’t be a repeat occurrence during the holidays.

Southwest Airlines said Thursday that it will further reduce its upcoming travel schedule — fallout from being forced to cancel more than 2000 flights earlier this month because of weather and air traffic control backups during a single afternoon in Florida. Southwest said it had relied on staffing models that it used before the pandemic.

“We had 15000 people that were out on leave so an assumption I made was that we were going to call them and say ‘OK it’s time to come back’ and they are going to show up and everything was going to be just like it was” Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said. “And it’s just not.”

Aggressive flight schedules to capitalize on consumer demand can push airlines to a breaking point when all doesn’t go to plan. Southwest Airlines’ Columbus Day weekend schedule was its busiest since the pandemic began and the Florida-centered problems resulted in pilots and flight crews being out of sync with subsequent flights.

That meltdown was followed by rumors that pilots had walked off the job to protest a White House mandate to require COVID-19 vaccinations for federal contractors such as Southwest Airlines. Both the airline and the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association denied any attempt by pilots to disrupt flights. However the union has sued the airline in federal court to stop the mandate.

The CEOs at Southwest and American spent last week trying to assure employees that they wouldn’t be fired if they weren’t vaccinated at least as long as they sought an exemption for religious or medical purposes.

“We are not going to let this disrupt any of our customers’ travel especially during the busy holiday season” Kelly said.

American Airlines President Robert Isom said demand is strong from passengers.

“We’re getting ready for the holiday season and we expect a lot of passengers and tremendous pent-up demand especially as vaccinations take hold [and] infection rates decline” Isom said. “We’re going to be ready. We’re doing our best to make sure that we have the right people in the right places at the right time.”

Airfares and labor shortages

Travelers could be looking at a far different experience than last year.

Some Christmastime airfares are approaching what they were in 2019 said Adit Damodaran an economist with travel website Hopper.

This year the average roundtrip ticket for flying within the U.S. is selling for about $300 for Thanksgiving and $390 for Christmas according to Hopper. That’s compared to 2020 when tickets were $245 at Thanksgiving and $250 at Christmas. Roundtrip tickets in 2019 were about $335 at Thanksgiving and $390 at Christmas.

That means this year’s fares are about 55% higher than last year when prices hit the lowest point in decades due to weak customer demand.

“Things have really taken off in the last few weeks with the decrease in cases from the delta variant” Damodaran said. “The best time to buy is usually before Halloween before November starts.”

After vaccination rates took off in spring more people grew comfortable with traveling over the summer months said Erin Francis-Cummings president of consumer research firm Destinations Analysts.

Now they’re ready to get back on planes again she said.

“Connecting with family and friends is still the driver for the holidays” she said. “It’s heart-warming to see that people still need one another and those connections are so powerful that they overcome some of the other worries.”

Holiday travel will be focused on domestic destinations mostly people visiting friends and family. Once travelers arrive at their destinations they’re likely to encounter other pandemic-related problems.

Hotels and restaurants are understaffed said Ramsey the Dallas travel agent. “You just can’t expect the kind of service you had before.”

Ramsey estimates that 50% or more of travelers are delaying trips particularly major vacations.

“Before the delta variant spike people were planning trips for Christmas but then they started canceling in September” she said. “It’s going to take time maybe years because this is the new normal. This isn’t going away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9pYmVyaWEtYmV0cy1iaWctdXNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iberia Goes Big On US Flights,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9pYmVyaWEtYmV0cy1iaWctdXNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL21qczA1MjIyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John A.

Longer more frequent outages afflict the U.S. power grid as states fail to prepare for climate change

WILMINGTON N.C. — Every time a storm lashes the Carolina coast the power lines on Tonye Gray’s street go down cutting her lights and air conditioning. After Hurricane Florence in 2018 Gray went three days with no way to refrigerate medicine for her multiple sclerosis or pump the floodwater out of her basement.

“Florence was hell” said Gray 61 a marketing account manager and Wilmington native who finds herself increasingly frustrated by the city’s vulnerability.

“We’ve had storms long enough in Wilmington and this particular area that all power lines should have been underground by now. We know we’re going to get hit.”

Across the nation severe weather fueled by climate change is pushing aging electrical systems past their limits often with deadly results. Last year the average American home endured more than eight hours without power according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration — more than double the outage time five years ago.

This year alone a wave of abnormally severe winter storms caused a disastrous power failure in Texas leaving millions of homes in the dark sometimes for days and at least 200 dead. Power outages caused by Hurricane Ida contributed to at least 14 deaths in Louisiana as some of the poorest parts of the state suffered through weeks of 90-degree heat without air conditioning.

As storms grow fiercer and more frequent environmental groups are pushing states to completely reimagine the electrical grid incorporating more batteries renewable energy sources and localized systems known as “microgrids” which they say could reduce the incidence of wide-scale outages. Utility companies have proposed their own storm-proofing measures including burying power lines underground.

But state regulators largely have rejected these ideas citing pressure to keep energy rates affordable. Of $15.7 billion in grid improvements under consideration last year regulators approved only $3.4 billion according to a national survey by the NC Clean Energy Technology Center — about one-fifth.

After a weather disaster “everybody’s standing around saying ‘Why didn’t you spend more to keep the lights on?’ ” Ted Thomas chairman of the Arkansas Public Service Commission said in an interview with The Washington Post. “But when you try to spend more when the system is working it’s a tough sell.”

A major impediment is the failure by state regulators and the utility industry to consider the consequences of a more volatile climate — and to come up with better tools to prepare for it. For example a Berkeley Lab study last year of outages caused by major weather events in six states found that neither state officials nor utility executives attempted to calculate the social and economic costs of longer and more frequent outages such as food spoilage business closures supply chain disruptions and medical problems.

“There is no question that climatic changes are happening that directly affect the operation of the power grid” said Justin Gundlach a senior attorney at the Institute for Policy Integrity a think tank at New York University Law School. “What you still haven’t seen … is a [state] commission saying: 'Isn’t climate the through line in all of this? Let’s examine it in an open-ended way. Let’s figure out where the information takes us and make some decisions.’ ”

In interviews several state commissioners acknowledged that failure.

“Our electric grid was not built to handle the storms that are coming this next century” said Tremaine L. Phillips a commissioner on the Michigan Public Service Commission which in August held an emergency meeting to discuss the problem of power outages. “We need to come up with a broader set of metrics in order to better understand the success of future improvements.”

Five disasters in four years

The need is especially urgent in North Carolina a state that has declared a federal disaster from a hurricane or tropical storm five times in the past four years. Among them was Hurricane Florence which brought torrential rain catastrophic flooding and the state’s worst outage in over a decade in September 2018.

More than 1 million residents were left disconnected from refrigerators air conditioners ventilators and other essential machines some for up to two weeks. Elderly residents dependent on oxygen were evacuated from nursing homes. Relief teams flew medical supplies to hospitals cut off by flooded roads. Desperate people facing closed stores and rotting food looted a Wilmington Family Dollar.

“I have PTSD from Hurricane Florence not because of the actual storm but the aftermath” said Evelyn Bryant a community organizer who took part in the Wilmington response.

The storm reignited debate over a $13 billion proposal by Duke Energy one of the largest power companies in the nation to reinforce the state’s power grid. A few months earlier the state had rejected Duke’s request for full repayment of those costs determining that protecting the grid against weather is a normal part of doing business and not eligible for the type of reimbursement the company had sought.

After Florence Duke offered a smaller $2.5 billion plan along with the argument that severe weather events are one of seven “megatrends” (including cyberthreats and population growth) that require greater investment according to a PowerPoint presentation included in testimony to the state. The company owns the two largest utilities in North Carolina Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.

Vote Solar a nonprofit climate advocacy group objected to Duke’s plan saying the utility had failed to study the risks of climate impacts. Duke’s flood maps for example had not been updated to reflect the latest projections for sea level rise they said. In testimony Vote Solar claimed Duke was using environmental trends to justify investments “it had already decided to pursue.”

The United States is one of the few countries where regulated utilities are usually guaranteed a rate of return on capital investments. That business model incentivizes spending regardless of how well it solves problems for customers and inspires skepticism. Ric O’Connell executive director of GridLab a nonprofit group that assists state and regional policymakers on electrical grid issues said utilities in many states “are waving their hands and saying hurricanes” to justify spending that would do little to improve climate resilience.

Duke Energy spokesman Jeff Brooks acknowledged that the company had not conducted a climate risk study but pointed out that this type of analysis is still relatively new for the industry. He said Duke’s grid improvement plan “inherently was designed to think about future needs” including reinforced substations with walls that rise several feet above the previous high watermark for flooding and partly relied on federal flood maps to determine which stations are at most risk.

Brooks said Duke is not using weather events to justify routine projects noting that the company had spent more than a year meeting with community stakeholders and using their feedback to make significant changes to its grid improvement plan.

This year the North Carolina Utilities Commission finally approved a set of grid improvements that will cost customers $1.2 billion. But the commission reserved the right to deny Duke reimbursement of those costs if it cannot prove they are prudent and reasonable. The commission’s general counsel Sam Watson declined to discuss the decision saying the commission can comment on specific cases only in public orders.

The utility is now burying power lines in “several neighborhoods across the state” that are most vulnerable to wide-scale outages Brooks said. It is also fitting aboveground power lines with “self-healing” technology a network of sensors that diverts electricity away from equipment failures to minimize the number of customers affected by an outage.

As part of a settlement with Vote Solar Duke Energy last year agreed to work with state officials and local leaders to further evaluate the potential impacts of climate change a process that Brooks said is expected to take two to three years.

High costs create hurdles

The debate in North Carolina is being echoed in states across the nation where burying power lines has emerged as one of the most common proposals for insulating the grid from high winds fires and flooding. But opponents have balked at the cost which can run in the millions of dollars per mile.

In California for example Pacific Gas & Electric wants to bury 10000 miles of power lines both to make the grid more resilient and to reduce the risk of sparking wildfires. Its power equipment has contributed to multiple deadly wildfires in the past decade including the 2018 Camp Fire that killed at least 85 people.

PG&E’s proposal has drawn scorn from critics including San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo who say it would be too slow and expensive. But Patricia Poppe the company’s CEO told reporters that doing nothing would cost California even more in lost lives and property. The plan has yet to be submitted to the state but Terrie Prosper a spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission said the commission has supported underground lines as a wildfire mitigation strategy.

Another oft-floated solution is microgrids small electrical systems that provide power to a single neighborhood university or medical center. Most of the time they are connected to a larger utility system. But in the event of an outage microgrids can operate on their own with the aid of solar energy stored in batteries.

In Florida regulators recently approved a four-year microgrid pilot project but the technology remains expensive and unproven. In Maryland regulators in 2016 rejected a plan to spend about $16 million for two microgrids in Baltimore in part because the local utility made no attempt to quantify “the tangible benefits to its customer base.”

In Texas where officials have largely abandoned state regulation in favor of the free market the results have been no more encouraging. Without requirements as exist elsewhere for building extra capacity for times of high demand or stress the state was ill-equipped to handle an abnormal deep freeze in February that knocked out power to 4 million customers for days.

Since then Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Starwood Energy Group each proposed spending $8 billion to build new power plants to provide backup capacity with guaranteed returns on the investment of 9 percent but the Texas legislature has not acted on either plan.

New York is one of the few states where regulators have assessed the risks of climate change and pushed utilities to invest in solutions. After 800000 New Yorkers lost power for 10 days in 2012 in the wake of Hurricane Sandy state regulators ordered utility giant Con Edison to evaluate the state’s vulnerability to weather events.

The resulting report which estimated climate risks could cost the company as much as $5.2 billion by 2050 gave ConEd data to inform its investments in storm hardening measures including new storm walls and submersible equipment in areas at risk of flooding.

Meanwhile the New York Public Service Commission has aggressively enforced requirements that utility companies keep the lights on during big storms fining utility providers nearly $190 million for violations including inadequate staffing during Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020.

“At the end of the day we do not want New Yorkers to be at the mercy of outdated infrastructure” said Rory M. Christian who last month was appointed chair of the New York commission.

The price of inaction

In North Carolina as Duke Energy slowly works to harden the grid some are pursuing other means of fostering climate-resilient communities.

Beth Schrader the recovery and resilience director for New Hanover County which includes Wilmington said some of the people who went the longest without power after Florence had no vehicles no access to nearby grocery stores and no means of getting to relief centers set up around the city.

For example Quanesha Mullins a 37-year-old mother of three went eight days without power in her housing project on Wilmington’s east side. Her family got by on food from the Red Cross and walked a mile to charge their phones at McDonald’s. With no air conditioning they slept with the windows open in a neighborhood with a history of violent crime.

Schrader is working with researchers at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte to estimate the cost of helping people like Mullins. The researchers estimate that it would have cost about $572000 to provide shelter meals and emergency food stamp benefits to 100 families for two weeks said Robert Cox an engineering professor who researches power systems at UNC-Charlotte.

Such calculations could help spur local governments to do more to help vulnerable communities for example by providing “resilience outposts” with backup power generators heating or cooling rooms Internet access and other resources Schrader said. But they also are intended to show the costs of failing to shore up the grid.

“The regulators need to be moved along” Cox said.

In the meantime Tonye Gray finds herself worrying about what happens when the next storm hits. While Duke Energy says it is burying power lines in the most outage-prone areas she has yet to see its yellow-vested crews turn up in her neighborhood.

“We feel” she said “that we’re at the end of the line.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5zL2d1ZXN0LzIwMjEvMTAvMjQvdGhvbWFzLXN1ZGRlcy1vaGlvLWxhd21ha2Vycy1mYWlsdXJlLWxpc3QtaW5jbHVkZXMtYnVyZWF1Y3JhY3ktaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtbGF3cy11dGlsaXR5LXNoZW5hbmlnYW5zLzg1MzAzNDEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawmakers' failure list: bureaucracy health care utility shenanigans,"Thomas Suddes

Commentary

The General Assembly doesn’t seem to understand that its job isn’t to limit women’s options for pregnancies nor to require everyone in Ohio to pack heat.

Instead Ohio’s state senators and representatives are supposed to be Brush Hogs hacking and thinning Ohio’s bureaucratic thicket. Too bad they aren’t.

A good place to start would be Ohio’s bloated K-12 bureaucracies. Ohio ranks No. 34 among the 50 states in geographic size. Ohio has 609 school districts not counting vocational districts. Texas ranks No. 2 (after Alaska) among the 50 states in geographic area. Texas has 1029 school districts according to the Texas Association of School Boards.

Thomas Suddes:Ohio Legislature's sleight of hand reaches everything from sports betting to environment

There’s a lot not to like about Texas whose Legislature makes Ohio’s General Assembly look like a chapter of Mensa. But does anyone honestly think Ohio whose population isn’t really growing needs 609 school boards?

Likewise if COVID-19 has taught Ohio anything (besides the fact vaccines don’t magnetize the human body) it’s that Ohio’s public health laws need a rewrite. Their basic framework was hammered together in 1919 by a General Assembly that rural Ohio then dominated. Health boards and their staffs should be regionalized at least which is about the best you can expect of a Legislature that thinks Ohio’s Health Department is a dictatorship in waiting.

Thomas Suddes:'Forgetful' lawmakers focus on 'magnetic vaccines' and keep quiet as Ohioans continue to pay coal plant bailouts

Then there is the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio which depending on the day of the week either plays helpless bystander when electric and gas companies raise rates or cheers them on.

Opinion:Costly debacle shows why PUCO should be reformed to protect Ohioans from corrupt utilities

The panel created just before World War I is even older than Ohio’s health boards. Its real purpose is to insulate governors and the Legislature from the consequences of pro-utility favors legislators pass and governors sign. In that respect the PUCO deserves a smidgen of sympathy for taking punches that should land elsewhere.

After all it is the Legislature not the PUCO that is sitting on major pro-consumer legislation such as Senate Bill 117 which would abolish one huge vestige of House Bill 6 the scandal-pocked nuclear power plant bailout law.

Legislators repealed some parts of HB 6 but not all. They left this part of the bill in place: Ohio electricity consumers are paying extra every month to subsidize three Ohio electric utilities that are among owners of two coal-fueled power plants one in Indiana.

House Bill 6:Lobbying push by lawyers others on FirstEnergy Solution's team detailed in filing

According to the Office of Consumers’ Counsel Ohio electricity consumers have paid American Electric Power AES/DP&L and Duke Energy more than $153 million so far in coal plant subsidies. SB 117 to repeal them is languishing in a Senate committee. The subsidy repeal’s sponsors are Sens. Mark Romanchuk an Ontario Republican and Hearcel Craig a Columbus Democrat.

Meanwhile the Legislature also is dawdling over a bill to abolish Ohio’s no-refund legal policy in instances when Ohio’s Supreme Court overturns a PUCO-approved rate boost That bill’s sponsors are Reps. Laura Lanese a Grove City Republican and Dan Troy a Willowick Democrat.

The legal rigmarole behind that rule which dates to a Cincinnati Bell rate case in the 1950s is kind of like what the British diplomat Palmerston said about a complicated German-Danish dispute: Only three people understood it he said: One died one went mad and the third Palmerston himself had “forgotten all about it.” But utilities’ lawyers haven’t forgotten the Keco case as it’s known which is why utility refunds are comparatively rare.

Any legislator who says he wants Ohio’s utility consumers to get a fair break – but won’t support the Romanchuk-Craig and Lanese-Troy bills – is being … economical … not with ratepayers’ money but with the truth.

Correction

Rep. Haraz Ghanbari a Perrysburg Republican voted “no” on House Bill 175 now in the Senate which would end Ohio’s regulation of ephemeral streams “surface water … that flows or pools only in response to precipitation such as rain or snow” the Legislative Service Commission reports.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency which answers to Gov. Mike DeWine opposes the bill as does a raft of environmental groups. My Oct. 10 column incorrectly said Grove City’s Lanese was the only House Republican to vote “no.”

The U.S. needs to invest more in nuclear-powered spacecraft to be competitive with nations like China experts say.

During a government hearing on Wednesday (Oct. 20) experts from NASA and the aerospace industry discussed how the U.S. stacks up against other nations when it comes to developing new nuclear propulsion technology. And according to them the U.S. needs to move quickly if it wants to keep up. The congressional committee hearing called ""Accelerating deep space travel with space nuclear propulsion"" took place before the U.S. House of Representatives' Science Space and Technology Committee.

""Strategic competitors including China are aggressively investing in a wide range of space technologies including nuclear power and propulsion"" Bhavya Lal NASA's senior advisor for budget and finance said in the hearing. ""The United States needs to move at a fast pace to stay competitive and to remain a leader in the global space community.""

NASA has previously discussed how nuclear propulsion technology could allow the agency to send humans to Mars more quickly than by using traditional chemical rockets.

""Nuclear electric propulsion systems use propellants much more efficiently than chemical rockets but provide a low amount of thrust"" NASA has said . ""Nuclear electric propulsion systems accelerate spacecraft for extended periods and can propel a Mars mission for a fraction of the propellant of high-thrust systems.""

There are multiple types of nuclear propulsion that could be used in space technology. With nuclear electric propulsion thermal energy from a nuclear reactor is turned into electric energy that powers whatever type of electrical thruster or propulsion tech that a spacecraft uses. With nuclear thermal propulsion reactors heat up propellants like hydrogen and then the gas from that reaction is ejected creating thrust. This can create a lot more thrust than electric propulsion systems.

According to the experts at Wednesday's hearing if NASA wants to get to Mars soon time is of the essence. ""If the United States is serious about leading in a human mission to Mars we have no time to lose"" U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) who chairs the committee said. Beyer added that over the past several years Congress has continued to fund nuclear space technology development at NASA ""with the goal of conducting a future in-space flight test.""

Now while nuclear electric propulsion has many benefits especially when trying to get to Mars quickly there are also risks involved with developing and using the technology.

""The risks associated with [nuclear propulsion] are a fundamental materials challenge that we think is quite likely solvable"" Roger M. Myers the co-chair of the Committee on Space Nuclear Propulsion Technologies said during the hearing. That materials challenge includes developing or finding materials that can handle exposure to heat and other extreme elements associated with space Myers added.

This hearing took place following a report and claims alleging that China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic weapon in August. China has denied these claims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzI0L2ZlYnJ1YXJ5LWZyZWV6ZS1sZWQtaHVuZHJlZHMtcmVxdWVzdHMtd2hvbGUtaG9tZS1nZW5lcmF0b3JzLzU4MTQwNDIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,February freeze led to hundreds of requests for whole-home generators,"Joe Rizzo president of Austin-based generator company Capital Power Systems said things haven't been the same since the weeklong freeze in February.

Previously the company — which helps business and residential customers — would install one generator a day and now that number has increased to as many as five or six. And quite a few of those are for homeowners which is also a change he said.

“We are backlogged 200 installations” Rizzo said. “And the factories have not been able to keep up with the increase in demand across Texas and in the U.S. There has been a shortage in materials and so everything has delays and it has slowed production down.”

As families struggled to stay warm in the record-breaking February freeze that left thousands across the state without power or water many turned to using portable gas generators gas grills or their vehicles to generate heat leading to carbon monoxide poisonings and other hazardous situations.

In the months that have followed residents across Austin have been preparing for similar situations in the future with whole-home generators.

Austin Energy has received hundreds of requests for information about or help installing whole-home generators in the months since the February freeze.

In a typical year the city utility receives two to three requests about generators which act as a backup power source. This year it has received more than 350.

“The uptick started shortly after the storm” said Joan Wilhite Austin Energy’s electric system field operations manager. “It just steadily built over the last few months.”

Austin Energy does not provide generators but rather helps install them Wilhite explained. Homeowners typically use a contractor who helps them buy a generator before it goes through a permitting process with the city.

Austin Energy’s role is to schedule a power shutdown so an electrical contractor can install the generator without the electrical system that feeds the house being live.

The company does not charge customers when they go out and disconnect power Wilhite said.

After the freeze the company received about 25 requests for generator help in February Wilhite said.

“Right after the storm people were up in arms. It was a catastrophic event” she said. “There was an uptick right after and then it kind of died off. Now as we get closer to winter months we’re seeing the uptick again.”

When power is shut off on Texas’ power grid a generator can be switched on and will run on gas. The amount of time the generator can last depends on how big the house is and how long an outage is.

“A whole-house generator could feasibly provide energy for the whole house depending on the size of the generator” Wilhite said.

Generators can cost thousands of dollars.

Rizzo said the price ranges from $8000 to $25000 depending on the size of the generator and the size of the home. He said the average home in Austin would probably need a generator costing between $11000 and $14000.

Rizzo said the automatic generator system the most popular choice for customers kicks on in 10 seconds and keeps the power running until regular power is restored. The system is connected to the natural gas line but customers can also choose a propane gas option.

A battery system is also available but Rizzo said it won't last as long.

Austin Energy has also received more requests for solar batteries this year than in the past five years combined officials said.

“The cool thing about solar is let’s say it’s an outage and I have power stored up in the battery; I can power my house with the battery and if it’s sunny I can be charging my battery during the outage” said Elizabeth Letton a former Austin Energy official.

Austin Energy received 85 applications for solar panels with batteries between March and August. In 2020 and 2019 the company received 12 and eight applications during the same period.

Incentives and a $2500 rebate are available for Austin Energy customers who install solar panels. Information can be found online at austinenergy.com/ae/green-power.

Austin Energy does not offer rebates for generators or generator installation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dmdhemV0dGVtYWlsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VuZXJneV9hbmRfZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvd2h5LXdlc3QtdmlyZ2luaWEtaXMtbGVmdC1lc3BlY2lhbGx5LXZ1bG5lcmFibGUtYnktbWFuY2hpbi1ibG9ja2luZy1rZXktY2xpbWF0ZS1wb2xpY3kvYXJ0aWNsZV84MjQ0Y2E4MC05ZWNlLTU0ZTUtODNmMC0zZDZjMjIzZGU3NDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why West Virginia is left especially vulnerable by Manchin blocking key climate policy,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The company said the increase in the rate by 2.3 percentage points – from 22.2% to 24.5% – was because of the rising costs of providing loyalty programmes rewards and benefits to its customers.

Commentators said other providers could follow suit particularly if the Bank of England announces an increase in interest rates next month.

American Express cardholders will be written to over the next two months to give them notice of the change. In a statement the company said: “American Express regularly reviews its cards to ensure that we continue to offer our cardmembers competitive credit cards that represent good value and provide a range of benefits.

“Following a recent review we are making changes to the interest rates on our personal credit cards to reflect the cost of providing rewards product benefits and loyalty programmes which have increased in recent years.”

The changes just apply to personal cards and business cards will be unaffected. In August American Express cut the amount of cashback that Platinum Everyday and Platinum Cashback cardholders could earn.

Under the new plans the interest rate for purchases on cards will increase from 22.2% to 24.5%. The rate for withdrawing money on a card will rise from 27.2% to 31.5%.

Rachel Springall from the financial information site Moneyfacts said card providers who offer benefits usually increase the rate they charge on a card to sustain the offers. “This move by American Express does appear to be for this very reason” she said.

“Typically the attitude to risk among credit card providers and sustainability of perks has much more influence on pricing that a base rate change. Indeed back in 2018 when base rate rose by 0.25% there was no sudden mass of credit card rates rising in the aftermath.”

She said cardholders who are unhappy with the increase should consider switching if they can find a better deal. “However whether switching is the right choice depends on any perks a customer may get from using the card and whether they are able to pay off their balance in full each month.”

Expectations in the city that the Bank of England will raise rates next month jumped this week after the governor said it would have to act to curb rising inflation and the chief economist Huw Pill said the question of whether to raise interest rates was a “live” one.

Andrew Hagger of the consultancy Moneycomms said American Express could be the first of many providers to increase their rates in the coming months.

Sure expectations change. And to look back at preseason projections and consider anything better than a fourth-place finish a success would’ve overlooked how well they played for three months early in the season.

And after they blew a lead in the A.L. East and had to scratch their way into a Wild Card Game it felt like they needed to at least get through the Yankees and Rays in the postseason to make up for blowing the division.

Check and check.

The Houston Astros were a stronger opponent that matched up better. And while the Sox’ exciting season came crashing down in a 5-0 loss in Game 6 as they were eliminated from the A.L. Championship Series the feeling outside the Red Sox clubhouse was largely positive.

“I mean it’s really tough obviously” said Kiké Hernandez who signed a two-year $14-million deal to play for Alex Cora. “Going home is never easy. I felt like once we got to this point the goal was to win the World Series. We thought we were going to be able to do it. Obviously we came up short.

“But this was a hell of a ride for us this year. First day of spring training you come into this new team. The expectations from everybody outside our clubhouse was just second-to-last place in our division. We didn’t agree with anybody who was saying that. We believed in ourselves. We got to this point man we were two wins away from going to the World Series. We didn’t accomplish what we wanted to but we did some special things. And the Red Sox are going to be a problem for a long time.”

Kyle Schwarber had a different perspective coming over from the Washington Nationals via trade on July 29.

“Obviously it’s disappointing” he said. “At the end of the day we’re all competitors and we all want to make it to the end goal. The end goal is the World Series and winning it.”

Schwarber watched the Sox lose their division lead in late July and the Rays effectively won the division in August.

“I got to watch for pretty much two weeks” he said. “It was like we went on that road trip 10-gamer and went 2-8. And I was just like ‘you know what this team is grinding. They’re not quitting in any of these games. This is what it takes to win in the postseason.’

“We fought scratched clawed to get our way into the playoffs and then we went in the Wild Card. We played unbelievable going into the Division Series. Played unbelievable too. I thought we grinded our butts off through this series. It just didn’t work out but I think that the group should be very proud of themselves.”

Before answering questions from reporters after the Sox’ loss Cora took a moment to give credit to the Astros who he called a great organization who deserved to be going to the World Series.

As for his own team Cora said he spoke to them after the game.

“I told them how proud I am” he said. “It’s an amazing group. It’s a group that we will always remember. In the offseason trying to recruit players and trying to buy into the concept that we were going to be good it was hard. But at the end of the day we did an amazing job to have that meeting. Not too many teams can say that they’re in the League Championship Series and I know it doesn’t sound great to have that meeting it means something right?

“And we did an amazing job throughout the season. We just got beat at the end but when we look back and everything that we went through the thoughts of this team early in the season it’s just amazing. It was a great year.”

It’s a rare thing in Boston to have a Red Sox team lose in the postseason but still feel good about themselves.

But after firing Dave Dombrowski and replacing him with Chaim Bloom in 2019 trading Mookie Betts and watching Chris Sale undergo Tommy John surgery in 2020 and firing and rehiring Cora to take charge in 2021 bouncing back from a last-place finish in 2020 to come within two games of the World Series feels like a success.

“I think we’re definitely disappointed right now” said Nathan Eovaldi the most valuable pitcher in the A.L. this year according to Fan Graphs. “We obviously wanted to win this game and win the series and go to the World Series. No one expected us to be here. We proved a lot of people wrong.

“We believed in ourselves as a team. We were able to overcome a lot of obstacles together and get to this point.”"

Ride to the Olympics CEO on increase in Black polo players: 'We break barriers'

Historically very few African Americans have played polo but that's changing in Atlanta.

""I've never ridden a horse outside of me starting this let alone actually play polo so I had to get over my fear of like thinking I would get kicked or that I will fall"" Gia Tejeda a junior economics major at Spelman College told ABC News. ""I just feel as though if you can learn how to navigate a horse and really master a sport that you can also in the same sense conquer the world because it takes a lot to ride a horse.""

Tejeda's three-woman team includes another Spelman student and one from Savanah College of Arts and Design. They're sponsored by Ride to the Olympics a foundation that exposes urban students to equestrian sports.

""We break barriers"" Kim Watson CEO of Ride to the Olympics told ABC News. ""It was almost like tear-jerking it to see what it does to their confidence level.""

The group was founded in 2017 by men's formal wear designer Miguel Wilson who said he hoped one day of having its members qualify for the Olympics.

""The change of scenery seeing the concrete turn into grass ... for a lot kids in the inner cities going out to the country and just being able to spend a few hours with horses is life-changing"" Wilson told ABC News.

Polo is very expensive to play and requires wide-open spaces that are hard to find in most cities.

""There are barriers that exist -- so it's about bridging that gap"" Wilson said.

Even though comparatively fewer African Americans ride horses professionally now Black jockeys played an important role in American history. Among the first 28 Kentucky Derby winners 15 jockeys were Black. But zero Black riders participated from 1921 to 2000. And even fewer played polo.

In 2019 with the help of Wilson and Ride to the Olympics Morehouse became the first historically Black college to create a polo club and be declared a member of the United States Polo Association.

""A lot of kids in these inner cities"" Wilson said ""they know about football they know about basketball but who knows how many professional polo players we have walking around in northwest Washington D.C. or in southwest Atlanta?""

Tejeda said she's ""honestly still in awe"" to have the opportunity to play the sport.

""When you think of polo you don't think about Black kids playing the sport"" she added. ""So to be the pioneer in starting this is really amazing.""

Added Wilson: ""I mean the Morehouse team was phenomenal. But to see these young ladies is extraordinary.""

Female players composed about 40% of the U.S. Polo Association's membership in 2020 and the number of women's tournaments has grown steadily over five years but no Black women currently are playing professionally. Uneku Atawodi a Nigerian is credited with being the first Black woman to reach such heights.

""I wasn't exposed to it so that's generally the main reason"" more Black Americans don't play polo said AnaSimone Guimone a junior who plays for Spelman College.

Ride to the Olympics recently teamed up with the Boys and Girls Foundation to create eight polo teams in urban areas for kids 8 to 18 and it hosts the Polo Classic in Atlanta where student members and other Black players can play together.

""I wanted to create an environment where African Americans can go to a polo event that celebrates our culture"" Wilson said. ""Most polo events aren't about us.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL3VzYS8yMDIxLTEwLTI0L3RoZS1uZXctYW50aS1hYm9ydGlvbi10YWN0aWNzLW9mLXRoZS1mYXItcmlnaHQtaW4tdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The new anti-abortion tactics of the far right in the Americas,"An EL PAÍS investigation in five Latin American countries has found that a network of centers affiliated with the far-right US organization Heartbeat International (HI) promote themselves online as feminist support groups and use misleading language in favor of abortion but in reality they work to manipulate and institutionalize women to get them to carry their pregnancy to term. Five female reporters and one male reporter went undercover to centers in Argentina Colombia Costa Rica El Salvador and Mexico between 2019 and 2021 as a follow-up to an OpenDemocracy investigation into HI’s operations in the region.

During those visits they found that these centers operate in very similar ways: they offer false information about abortion propose adoption as an alternative and in some cases they temporarily offer accommodation and food. Their promises to help find a home for their child are often against the law in the countries where they operate. Their strategy is part of the new onslaught of the ultraconservative movement that works in the region to stop the advancement of women’s reproductive rights.

In three of the five countries included in this report the portals use misleading advertising or identify themselves as feminist activists. In Mexico Colombia and Costa Rica reporters – who presented themselves as pregnant women in vulnerable conditions – were offered an adoption process outside of legal institutions.

Experts agree that the adoption offers they make are not real but rather a way of convincing the mother to carry the pregnancy to term. “This is a super underground issue” says Susana Chávez executive director of the Latin American Consortium Against Unsafe Abortion (Clacai) which has followed the offensive of ultra-conservative political groups in the region for decades. Adoption as an alternative to the termination of pregnancy “is a lie” she argues: “In reality what they seek is to discourage the girl the teenager the woman from having an abortion with a false promise that they will never fulfill.”

Heartbeat International did not respond to two requests for comment on the findings of this investigation sent to its communications team.

Digital marketing and misinformation

Heartbeat International is a Catholic organization that was founded in 1971 in the midst of the legal battle over “Roe vs. Wade “– which led to the legalization of abortion throughout the United States – to “help women escape the temptation and pressure to abort their precious babies.” Over the years it became an umbrella organization for all types of groups that work against reproductive rights with presence in more than 60 countries and direct links with politicians from the Republican Party but also beyond the borders of the United States.

In El Salvador for example one of the countries with the toughest laws in the world against abortion Heartbeat has an explicit influence. A representative of the organization Ron Archer has visited the country at least three times to give lectures and address Congress directly. In 2017 according to Clacai Archer brought together pastors of churches in that country with the aim of reducing the rate of abortions and pledged to create 16 shelters there.

According to their webpage they operate through 2850 affiliated centers around the world. Within Latin America they have Centers to Help Women (Known as CAM their acronym in Spanish) which are dedicated to attracting women with unwanted pregnancies offering them false information about abortion and in some cases the opportunity to live there until their pregnancy ends. Mexico is one of the countries with the highest number of CAMs: it has 70 followed by Argentina with 32. El PAÍS contacted and visited some of these centers in Argentina Colombia Costa Rica El Salvador and Mexico. In the US they are called “crisis pregnancy centers” (CPCs) and they work in very similar ways.

Centers afilliated with Heartbeat International in Latin America

Most of these centers have misleading advertising online and on social media. In Mexico they pose as abortion clinics. In Argentina they identify themselves as “feminist activists” and in Costa Rica they use colors and slogans of the pro-abortion movement and the movement against gender violence. But when people get in touch with the centers they summon women to meet in person where they ask for sensitive personal information such as the name and contact details of their partner.

In 2019 the British non-governmental organization Privacy International reported that through its thousands of international affiliates Heartbeat has been collecting data from women seeking information about abortion enabling them to contact the women and convince them not to interrupt their pregnancy through intrusive data-collection programs and digital marketing systems.

EL PAÍS reporters who went to the centers in Mexico El Salvador Argentina and Costa Rica were shown videos and pamphlets with false information about abortion claiming for example that they could suffer from “post-abortion syndrome” an alleged psychological condition whose existence is not proven. They said that the use of the misoprostol pill can lead to an “incomplete” abortion that can cause an infection; that abortion can cause breast cancer uncontrolled bleeding death and even the possibility of a leg amputation. In all cases they were told that they were not alone that the organization could accompany them throughout the pregnancy and help them in the process of putting the baby up for adoption.

In Costa Rica the center is presented in networks as an abortion clinic through the portal quieroabortarcr.com (iwanttohaveanabortioncr.com) which has a logo in purple and green as well as the motto “Vivas nos queremos” – the slogan of the feminist movement against gender violence in Latin America which can roughly be translated as “we want to stay alive.” The portal speaks of “intervention” of pregnancy through abortion pills. And despite the fact that they present themselves online as “Woman in power” the center actually operates under the name Women’s Institute of Comprehensive Health (referred to by its acronym in Spanish IFEMSI).

The webpage for ""Mujer al poder"" an organization in Costa Rica that positions itself online as an abortion clinic.

In 2019 as part of a first investigation carried out by OpenDemocracy a person who received the reporter at the center in San José told her that they were offering an adoption process in which they “skip” the PANI referring to the governmental board that carries out all legal adoptions. She even offered an arrangement in which she could “continue to have a relationship with the adoptive parents.” Intervention or mediation between biological mothers and people interested in adopting is forbidden by Costa Rican law.

In response to this investigation PANI filed a complaint for human trafficking against IFEMSI with the Special Prosecutor’s Office against Organized Crime according to an email from PANI spokeswoman Fanny Cordero. When visiting the center this year a woman told a reporter from EL PAÍS that they previously worked with PANI in the adoption processes but not anymore. PANI denied having any relationship or knowledge of the organization.

In El Salvador the reporter was offered a process called “surrender of care rights” once the baby was born and they assured her that the center has “people waiting for a call” to adopt a child with them. By law no civil organization can promote adoption in the country and the transfer of guardianship in articles 206 and 207 of the country’s Family Code is not a mechanism that can be applied in case of adoption.

In Mexico the websites aborto-mexico.com (abortion-mexico.com) and interrumpir-embarazo.com (interrupt-pregnancy.com) offer at first glance guidance to interrupt a pregnancy which in four states is legal before week 12 (and since September no woman can be prosecuted for abortion in the country). The websites offer WhatsApp numbers of HI-affiliated institutes that in the country are called Vida y Familia A.C. (Vifac). In two Vifac centers one in Mexico City and the other in Monterrey the reporter expressed her wish that there would be no trace of her alleged pregnancy. Vifac offered her the option of “canceling” the baby’s birth certificate to wipe out her name a process that does not exist.

In 2019 Mexico passed a reform to the General Law of the Rights of Girls Boys and Adolescents which bans any non-governmental organization from processing adoptions. This means that state or municipal governments cannot allow civil organizations to carry out adoption processes. In an article published a few years ago Mexican journalist Thelma Gómez Durán reported that Vifac received funds from private institutions and families with a lot of influence in the country.

Shelters and adoption promises

In June of this year EL PAÍS visited the Vifac’s “Blue House” in Satélite a neighborhood in northern Mexico City. Every month as was reported informally by employees during the visit they receive a dozen women who knock on their doors – some seeking an abortion others referred by other institutions – and host between eight and 10 babies. Once a woman decides to stay in Vifac they get shelter food and medical attention and the “cherry on top of the cake” as the coordinators called it are workshops that allegedly help them in the future get out of their precarious economic situation. The reporters saw several women weaving rosaries with colored beads by hand.

Some of these women in the center expressed gratitude to have a place to live and carry out their pregnancy; others for being able to get out of a situation of domestic violence. During the visit a woman came out with a baby in her arms and one of those in charge of the center said that she was a volunteer lawyer who was going to court because the adoption was already authorized; she said the process was very fast thanks to the good relations they had “with the judge.”

According to Susana Vallina in charge of Vifac’s communications department between 90% and 92% of women end up not giving their baby up for adoption keeping it instead. However she acknowledged that there is no follow-up for these women once their pregnancy is over since their mission is only to support pregnant women. The organization boasts strong collaborative ties with the Prosecutor’s Office and the Attorney General’s Office in the State of Mexico as well as with those who are on the list of pre-approved parents looking to adopt.

When asked about these findings the federal government said that adoption processes done by any institution other than the Government “are irregular” including “the promise of adoption during gestation.” The National System for the Integral Development of the Family (known as DIF) also said that since August they detected a failure by Vifac to show the Authorization Certificate necessary to operate as a Social Assistance Center.

In its response the DIF also revealed that based on questions asked by EL PAÍS the Prosecutor’s Office and the Attorney General’s Office of the State of Mexico undertook various actions on October 20 to obtain information on whether there is any type of institutional relationship with Vifac “due to the possible realization of illicit practices in the matter of adoptions” and to “inquire if adoptions have been processed in coordination with said private institution.”

Two years before this visit in a center in southern Mexico City that was then listed as a Heartbeat affiliate a woman offered one of the undercover reporters to “channel” her to another independent organization with the promise that they would offer an alternative adoption different from that of the National System for the Integral Development of the Family (DIF) the only institution authorized to carry out adoptions by law. In the waiting room of the center the reporter could see many young women with children in their arms waiting to receive a bag of non-perishables.

Asked about the way these centers operate Miguel Ángel Salazar who says he is a medical advisor to the network of CAMs in Latin America argued that “these institutions work in favor of children and in favor of women” and that the doubts about the manipulation to which they subject pregnant women “are lies” and have “an ideological bias.” He also said that he had a “way of substantiating” that these were lies but when asked for more details in this regard he cut off communication abruptly.

“Institutionalization is increasingly discouraged” explains Susana Chávez the director of the Latin American Consortium Against Unsafe Abortion (Clacai) “because what is becoming increasingly clear in adoption policies is that children and girls must be inserted into homes into families and that is the trend around the world.” In the last decade scientific studies and organizations including Unicef have brought to the table evidence that institutionalization has a considerable negative impact on the cognitive and emotional development of children. For these reasons explains Chávez organizations such as HI and its affiliates do not openly promote shelters where they institutionalize mothers and seek other ways to attract them.

Promises to facilitate adoption whether false or illegal have been repeated in a similar way in other countries. In a Bogotá center where the reporter posed as a pregnant woman in need of help they suggested that she turn to a place called Fundación Hogar Margarita where they assured her they had waiting lists of parents in case she wanted to give her baby up for adoption. They also gave her mixed messages claiming that the organization would oversee the process outside the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare the body in charge of adoptions in the country.

There as in Mexico Costa Rica and El Salvador similar propositions of alleged partial adoption in which mothers could remain in contact with the baby cancellations of birth certificates or transfer of parental rights were offered. In Argentina the person in charge of the center assured the reporter – also posing as a young pregnant woman – that she had never met a woman who ended up giving her baby up for adoption after carrying the pregnancy to term.

That is as reporters were able to determine the real purpose of the adoption offers that circumvent the law is for the women to give birth and keep their babies. It is under that logic that the centers in Mexico El Salvador and Colombia offer shelter for the mother and the baby until one or two years after the birth.

“The idea of sheltering and then letting mothers continue parenting that is not a practice that I have seen in any sort of historical model” says Gretchen Sisson a sociologist at the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California in San Francisco. Data shows that 90% of women who are seeking abortion care in the US but are too far along in their pregnancy to access it end up parenting said the academic. “I’m not sure that there are many women who are interested in abortion and then turn to adoption unless they’re given a large amount of misinformation about the accessibility or safety of abortion itself” adds Sisson.

Though Guthrie is president of a foundation which aims to grow rugby in historically Black colleges and universities around DC she will not be at the game. Thanks to her work for the state department she is currently based in Sri Lanka.

But a delegation from Howard University the historic Washington HBCU which is alma mater to Vice-President Kamala Harris will be in the stands at the NFL stadium representing a fledgling men’s and women’s rugby programme backed by the nonprofit Guthrie helped launch.

“It was in the pandemic” Guthrie says. “Somebody somewhere started a Bipoc [Black Indigenous People of Color] rugby Facebook group. It was just a bunch of players of color and we’re just riffing off of each other because nobody’s playing rugby at the time. And somebody posted that you know ‘Why don’t more HBCUs have teams?’

“And I really wasn’t doing anything at the time. And because of the blossom in video technology that the pandemic created I was like ‘Well it doesn’t really matter that I’m in Sri Lanka I could get this going from abroad.’ So I started talking to a few people.

“One guy in particular Tosan Tutse-Tonwe he and I … developed a focus group from that Bipoc Facebook group and we just bounced ideas off each other and we picked the name.”

It is a name with great resonance among history-minded fans of rugby league as well as union: the James G Robertson & Clive Sullivan Rugby Foundation RSRF for short.

Robertson played union in Scotland in the late 19th century and is thought to be the first Black man to play rugby. Sullivan who died in 1985 was a giant of league the 13-man game a star for Hull and Hull Kingston Rovers and the first Black captain of any British national team.

“We wanted to pick influential Black players in rugby history” Guthrie says. “The original name somebody threw out was Robertson and we did some research on him. Just the fact that he was playing in the 1800s was like ‘Wow’ you know? And somebody said ‘What about Sullivan? He was influential as well.’

“Hopefully as we go further down the line we can offer a Robertson scholarship and a Sullivan scholarship for team leadership and individual achievements so we can honor them even more.”

RSRF has a three-year plan under which it intends to establish and help fund men’s and women’s rugby union teams at Howard Morgan State Bowie State and the University of the District of Columbia. Funding is donor-driven but corporate involvement is sought.

Success would mean a new generation of Americans finding rugby by a more direct route than most. In a huge country where rugby is everywhere but a first-choice sport almost nowhere Guthrie’s own experience in finding the game in the early 2000s sounds familiar.

“I grew up in Chicago and rugby wasn’t a thing there” she says. “I was a track star in high school. But when I went to Tufts University that’s when I switched from track and field to rugby.

“I was double majoring in chemical engineering and French which was horrible. It wasn’t going well. In the cafeteria there were flyers for rugby and I didn’t really know what it was. And of course the internet was not really what it is today. But I decided ‘Well let me just show up and see what they’re all about.’ And the rugby team was a lifeline in my final semester at the school because I was kind of just spiraling and they were a little bit of sunshine.”

Guthrie transferred to Howard. There wasn’t any rugby there so she joined the Maryland Stingers a club that cemented her love for the game.

Rugby’s unique bond she says is founded on controlled aggression and co-operative effort and as such “is universal. Every time I move to a new city and I’ve moved to three or four in the US I find the local rugby team and that is immediately my new family. I don’t have to join a book club. I know if I join the local rugby team I will have a new group of friends who are like-minded that I can hang with.”

The Bipoc rugby community is not confined to Facebook. This year saw the playing return of the HBCU Classic an annual tournament after a year off to wait out Covid. Guthrie hopes RSRF can help the event thrive diversify and perhaps even relocate.

“Up until last year” she says “the women’s teams didn’t exist. The last Classic was in May of this year and Prairie View A&M showed up and had a women’s team so they played against Roots which is a Bipoc social team.

“So unfortunately Howard can’t say that they’re the first official HBCU women’s team but we are the first to play a collegiate game” – a win over Johns Hopkins this month – “[and] the the goal of the HBCU Classic is to get everybody together.”",,,,,,
AMT,American Tower,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvb2N0LzI0L25ldy1yZXNlYXJjaC1sYWItdG93ZXJzLWFib3ZlLW1vc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New research lab towers above most | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"ATLANTA -- One of the world's largest elevator towers will soon be opened to test elevators of the future as well as current ones high above the Atlanta suburbs.

TK Elevator's 420-foot tower is set to become fully operational early next year company executives said last week on a tour of the new research lab and elevator testing facility.

""This is going to transform our industry"" said Kevin Lavallee CEO of the company's North American operations.

It's the largest elevator test tower in the Western Hemisphere according to the company and general contractor Brasfield & Gorrie which built it.

The tower with its multiple elevator testing shafts looks down into the nearby Atlanta Braves stadium and offers stunning views of the Atlanta skyline. It's next door to the company's new North American headquarters in Cobb County just northwest of the city.

Construction on the tower began in 2019 with 3000 tons of steel and the structure is now in place with interior work still ongoing as TKE prepares to fully open it in February.

Among concepts being tested in the high-rise: twin elevators which use the same elevator shaft but operate independently with one car above the other Lavallee said. Twin elevators save space and are able to carry passengers more efficiently he said.

An environmental chamber will be able to test how elevators operate in extreme environments such as the arctic cold in Canada and the searing heat of other parts of the world said Steve Allen vice president of engineering.

TK Elevator once part of the German firm ThyssenKrupp was sold last year and became a separate company. It chose Atlanta for its North American headquarters partly because of the engineering talent in the metro area and engineering schools such as the Georgia Institute of Technology Lavallee said.

The company invested more than $200 million in its headquarters complex which will be home to more than 900 workers.

As the company plans for a grand opening of the tower in February it's aiming to open up much of the space to the public including students for tours of the facility Lavallee said. One reason for that is to generate interest in engineering and the elevator industry among students who might one day enter the field he said.

""I think we have a real opportunity with the students"" Lavallee said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIxL29jdC8yNC93aHktZ2VybWFueS1pcy1idWlsZGluZy1yaXNrLWludG8taXRzLXBsYXlncm91bmRz0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjEvb2N0LzI0L3doeS1nZXJtYW55LWlzLWJ1aWxkaW5nLXJpc2staW50by1pdHMtcGxheWdyb3VuZHM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Learning the ropes: why Germany is building risk into its playgrounds,"Towering over a woodland playground on the northernmost outskirts of Berlin the Triitopia climbing frame is the kind to cause worry in any anxious parent.

Children aged six and upwards wind their way through four stacked steel-wire buckyballs and scramble up dangling rope ladders until they reach a platform about 10 metres above the forest floor. Parents can try to keep up with their young mountaineers as they ascend through the rope spiderweb but they might get left behind in the tightly woven mesh.

If scaling the Triitopia looks risky that is the point: built in 2018 the climbing tower in Berlin-Frohnau’s Ludwig Lesser Park is emblematic of a trend that has accelerated in Germany over the last five years. Playgrounds a growing number of educators manufacturers and town planners argue must stop striving for absolute safety and instead create challenging microcosms that teach children to navigate difficult situations even if the consequence is the odd broken bone.

“Playgrounds are islands of free movement in a dangerous motorised environment” says Prof Rolf Schwarz of Karlsruhe University of Education who advises councils and playground designers. “If we want children to be prepared for risk we need to allow them to come into contact with risk.”

Even insurance companies agree. One influential 2004 study found that children who had improved their motor skills in playgrounds at an early age were less likely to suffer accidents as they got older. With young people spending an increasing amount of time in their own home the umbrella association of statutory accident insurers in Germany last year called for more playgrounds that teach children to develop “risk competence”.

The trade fair for leisure and sports facilities taking place this week in Cologne will give an impression of what such playgrounds could look like. The maker of the Triitopia climbing tower Berliner Seilfabrik will showcase its new seven-metre-high “DNA tower” and the 10-metre “Tower4” with a swirling metal slide to reward enthusiastic climbers.

“Our designs have significantly increased in height in recent years” says the co-director David Köhler whose company has been making rope-based playground structures since the 1970s.

“Children may feel insecure when they first climb in our nets but this is actually what makes the structures even safer. Because when you are feeling insecure you are also extra careful.”

An intellectual tradition of thinking seriously about play and versatile gaps in urban landscapes after the second world war mean Germany has a history of experimental play areas: many cities have “junk playgrounds” such as Berlin’s Kolle 37 where children can build their own structures and parents are allowed to enter only one day a week. However the dividing line between Abenteuerspielplätze (“adventure playgrounds”) and traditional play zones is increasingly disappearing.

“The holy trinity of playgrounds – swing seesaw and slide – is in decline” says Steffen Strasser of Playparc one of about 60 German manufacturers who do not only supply the country’s estimated 120000 playgrounds but export around the world.

In Cologne Playparc will showcase its Etolis range of platforms with suspension bridges that are deliberately wobbly equipped with minimal guard railing and no safety net. Strasser bristled at the mention of the low platforms surrounded by rubber matting that are still ubiquitous in British and American playgrounds.

“Modern playgrounds explore the limits of what is permissible within the regulations” says Strasser. “When we design new playground structures we try to build in challenges: an obstacle for example that a child may fail to overcome the first nine times but then manages at the tenth attempt.”

“The aim is to allow the greatest amount of freedom while guaranteeing the greatest amount of safety. We are not trying to avoid every broken leg possible.”

Germany is often perceived to be a politically and economically risk-averse nation where everyday life is regulated by a strict regime of rules and regulations. Yet when it comes to playgrounds the stereotype is misleading: here it’s the strict policing of standards that enables a risk-accepting culture in the first place.

Playground equipment in Germany is certified by the TÜV the same association that provides German drivers with the equivalent of an MOT or certificate of roadworthiness for vehicles. Accordingly the Triitopia tower in Berlin-Frohnau is encased with boards and netting to ensure no child can take a tumble from a height above three metres. In the spiderweb inside the structure the maximum fall height is 1.8 metres. A sign urges parents to take off their children’s cycle helmets in order to eliminate a strangulation risk.

Once a climbing frame has got past the TÜV however manufacturers can use the certificate to defend themselves in court against lawsuits relating to accidents. In the US where certification in most states is carried out by those who bring a playground structure to the market manufacturers are more vulnerable to legal action and often more risk-averse.

The TÜV also trains its own playground inspectors who are taught to not always apply regulations literally but to carry out flexible risk assessments. The UK’s national standards body the British Standards Institute by contrast does not inspect playgrounds but outsources the job to private companies which can lead to a culture of box-ticking.

Even so Germany’s dizzying climbing towers could soon become blueprints for playgrounds in Britain and the US. The International Organisation for Standardisation is reviewing its standards for sports and recreational equipment and could in the future encourage playground designers to consider not just the risks but the benefits of wobbly bridges lopsided steps and tree-tall climbing frames.

“We are seeing a slow shift in attitudes” says David Ball a professor of risk management at Middlesex University. “There’s a realisation [in the UK] that playgrounds have become too sanitised: if you look at them only as a series of potential hazards you are missing something important.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMzQ1MTU4L3VzLW1vcm9jY28taW5hdWd1cmF0aW9uLW9mLWFuLWFic2VpbGluZy10b3dlci1mb3Itcm95YWwtbmF2eS1zLXNwZWNpYWwtZm9yY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US - Morocco: Inauguration of an Abseiling Tower for Royal Navy's Special Forces,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.,,,,,,

Kyrsten Sinema's campaign has received $500000+ in campaign donations from the pharma industry.

The $3.5 trillion spending bill would save the US ""hundreds of billions"" on health care spending.

The biotechnology company Amgen gave Sinema $25500 and is one of her largest financial backers.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona is said to be opposed to the current prescription drug pricing proposals in bills put forth by both the House and Senate as well as an alternative from House centrists that would limit the drugs subject to Medicare negotiation according to unnamed sources cited by Politico.

Sinema's stance has stalled the passage of the $3.5 trillion spending bill crafted by the Biden administration and fellow Democrats even though it could jeopardize her own bipartisan infrastructure bill. Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington has previously said the majority of the Congressional Progressive Caucus which she chairs would not vote for Sinema's infrastructure bill without first passing the spending package.

If passed the $3.5 trillion spending bill would lower the cost of certain prescription drugs by instituting reforms and allowing Medicare to negotiate prices which would save the federal government ""hundreds of billions"" on health care spending according to a memo for Democratic senators.

Sinema is a ""pharma favorite in Congress""

Since launching her political career Sinema's campaign committee has received more than $500000 in donations from the pharmaceutical and health product industries according to OpenSecrets.

Kaiser Health News dubbed Sinema a ""pharma favorite in Congress"" after her campaign received $98500 from PACs run by employees of drug companies and their trade groups during the 2019-20 election cycle.

One of her largest financial backers has been Amgen a biotechnology company that manufactures prescription drugs for individuals with illnesses that have limited treatment options such as cancer patients and chronically ill individuals.

Insider reached out to Sinema and her team but has not received a response.

Many prescription drugs made by Amgen have hefty price tags. Overall the company made $24.24 billion in global product sales in 2020.

Amgen did not respond to inquiries about whether it lobbied Sinema on prescription drug pricing reforms or how the bill's passage would impact the company's bottom line. In 2021 Amgen has spent $4.72 million on lobbying Congressional representatives over 17 bills the majority of which address issues related to prescription drug pricing according to OpenSecrets.

A super PAC with pharmaceutical industry ties funded a recent Sinema ad

According to Google's Transparency Report a September 9 political ad for Sinema was paid for by Center Forward a super PAC dedicated to supporting the election of centrist Democrats according to The Washington Post.

In its registration with the Washington DC Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Center Forward lists Libby Greer and Cindy Brown from the lobbying firm Forbes Tate Partners as governors on its board. Greer and Brown are lobbyists for several pharmaceutical companies including Bayer Gilead Sciences Eli Lilly Novartis Amgen and Merck & Co according to documents obtained by the Daily Poster and reviewed by Insider.

Greer and Brown did not respond to inquiries about the scope of their involvement in the Sinema political ads. Center Forward Executive Director Cori Kramer Smith said that day-to-day activities programming and messaging do not fall under the board's responsibilities.







Merck was the second-highest pharmaceutical industry contributor to Sinema's campaign donating $20500 to her campaign committee and leadership PAC between 2015 and 2020 according to Kaiser Health News' ""Pharma Cash to Congress"" tracker.

Eli Joseph the husband of Sinema's chief of staff Meg Joseph worked as the executive director of federal policy and government relations for Merck & Co. from 2012-2015 according to his LinkedIn. Meg Joseph's LinkedIn also shows that she worked as a lobbyist from 2007-2008 at Clark & Weinstock which lobbied on behalf of several pharmaceutical companies and major industry trade groups during her tenure Salon reported.

Neither of the Josephs responded to inquiries about their previous work as lobbyists or connections to the pharmaceutical industry. Merck spokesperson John Cummins said Eli Joseph handled Senate affairs and was not involved in decisions surrounding House contributions.

In addition to Sinema four House Democrats are also opposed to direct government negotiation of drug prices. Reps. Scott Peters Kurt Schrader Stephanie Murphy and Kathleen Rice voted against advancing a drug-pricing provision on September 15 although it would be approved later in the day by the Ways and Means Committee the Los Angeles Times reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Employees last month launched #AppleToo a campaign to gather and share current and past employees’ experiences of inequity intimidation and abuse in the company. The two ex-employees have gone a step further by taking legal action.

Former high-level engineer Catherine Vartuli alleges that Apple discriminated and retaliated against her after she discovered and informed her manager that she was being paid less than half what her male peers earned Business Insider reported.

Finance director Bernadette Alexander in February sued Apple alleging ageism and retaliation. Alexander claimed a number of incidents over the past few years such as instructions in 2017 from a new manager who told her ""I hire nothing but young people. They are hungry and fast and cheaper.""

Then in 2019 she said her manager told her that her 10-year work anniversary meant it was time for her to be moved out of her position with three candidates already under consideration and all at least 10 years younger than she was.

Vartuli meanwhile alleged that she was in a severe minority of women in her department: At meetings there would be ""2 to 5 women out of 30 to 40 people.""

John Winer a lawyer for both women said he feels ""strongly"" that both cases will succeed due to the ""blatant"" discrimination against his clients.

Apple did not respond to a FOX Business request for comment regarding the lawsuits nor has it formally responded to either lawsuit but the rise of the #AppleToo may force the company to take action.

""For too long Apple has evaded public scrutiny"" the workers who launched #AppleToo said in a statement. ""When we press for accountability and redress to the persistent injustices we witness or experience in our workplace we are faced with a pattern of isolation degradation and gaslighting.""

The iPod launched 20 years ago this week was also how Apple’s Steve Jobs was able to prey on a failing business in order to avenge his own past failures – exiled between 1985 and 1997 from the company he co-founded – by turning Apple into the most profitable company in history.

Before the iPod lifeline arrived in October 2001 record labels were in full panic mode. In its annual report for 2001 record company trade body IFPI called it “a turbulent” year blaming filesharing and CD burning for a revenue slump. Jay Berman was chief exective of IFPI at the time and calls the scale of filesharing then “a crisis of momentous proportions” for record labels. “It really was” he says “a foreign invasion.”

The industry responded by attempting to sue filesharing service Napster and the copycat services that came in its wake: litigation rather than innovation.

“[Litigation] was a bellwether for idiocy” claims Jim Griffin an industry consultant who cut his digital teeth at Geffen in the 1990s putting out the first full-length song legally online in June 1994 (Head First by Aerosmith). “Whatever the music industry thought that’s what you shouldn’t do.” So the iPod benefited not just from the design deficiencies of the MP3 players before it but also from an early mover taking all the legal heat from a record business spooked into fight mode.

The first digital music players emerged in late 1998 and early 1999 notably the Personal Jukebox (developed by Compaq Research) which held the equivalent of a CD’s worth of music and was prone to skipping if bumped. It was Diamond Multimedia and its Rio range of MP3 players that first caught the public’s imagination and the music business’s ire. Record labels felt it should be subject to a blank media levy and pay royalties to copyright owners on every device sold.

The record labels “wanted the player off the market” says Hilary Rosen who was CEO of the trade organisation Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) between 1998 and 2003. In October 1999 however a US district court judge denied the RIAA’s demand for an injunction against the Rio and more than 200000 players were sold soon after. Jobs viewed this as an unmissable opportunity damning the Rio and its competitors as “brain-dead” due to clunky software and design. He was convinced only Apple could successfully streamline digital music.

iTunes launched in January 2001 enabled the ripping and management of CDs on a user’s computer. The next step was to develop a music player that shunted its rivals into the ditch and from there followed a move into music retail with the iTunes Store.

It was an enormous gamble but Jobs’s timing was not for the first or last time impeccable. After the failed Rio litigation there had been a change in temperature among labels slowly accepting it was better to work with rather than against such devices. “Once the iPod came along they were more open to a middle ground” says Rosen. She adds that record labels saw it as one thing “to sue that little company Diamond” but something else to “try and take on a behemoth” such as Apple.

The design and functionality of the iPod was something Jobs obsessed over during its gestation period. The issue of limited storage was cracked by Toshiba developing a cheap 5GB disc drive that could hold about 1000 songs. Apple swooped and signed them as exclusive manufacturers slamming the door on Creative Labs which was simultaneously working on their Zen MP3 player.

I approached Apple to talk about the legacy of the iPod. The company usually reticent to speak in pieces that include non-Apple voices initially said it could put forward Eddy Cue who oversaw the creation of iTunes and now heads up everything from Apple Music to Apple TV+. The company soon reneged however and said it would not have any company executives speak about the iPod.

This secrecy defined the original development of the device with only a few Apple executives allowed to see the iPod codenamed P-68 (and colloquially Dulcimer). The eureka moment was the click wheel conceived by Phil Schiller Apple’s marketing chief that enabled nimble search and control without a keyboard. Jobs wanted it as small as possible with an apocryphal tale circulating that he tossed one prototype in a fish tank pointed at the bubbles coming out and said they indicated dead space that should be removed.

It was unveiled at an Apple event on 23 October 2001 with Jobs talking through the device specs and then like a digital conjuror pulling it out of his pocket. “There it is right there” he said holding it up as the room erupted in applause.

Record labels initially insisted that it be a Mac-only device with Apple then only accounting for 5% of global computer sales. It was seen as a small and safe testing ground. Its success eventually strengthened Apple’s hand to persuade labels to allow it to be compatible with Windows giving the company a huge market to target.

Apple bolstered this with marketing and advertising spend – notably with its powerful “silhouette” ads – in the tens of millions of dollars something far beyond what labels had ever attempted. “That was an unheard of amount of money at the time for an advertising budget” says Rosen.

The launch of the iTunes Store (in 2003 in the US and 2004 in Europe) was the next key step in Apple’s domination of digital music. The record labels had tried to launch their own legal download services but Pressplay and MusicNet were hampered in part by incomplete catalogues (as labels were initially barred from cross-licensing their music for monopoly reasons) but mainly because they were clunky and costly. “You really needed an outside player to come in and go copyright holder to copyright holder to get the agreements” says Rosen.

Jac Holzman founder of Elektra Records had a roving brief as Warner Music’s chief technologist at the time and admits that creating a good music service was beyond the ken of record labels. “It was better that it came from the outside” he says “because the outside – and Apple specifically – would just build it better. We knew [Apple’s] history was excellent. So why not give it a shot?”

Record companies though were deeply unwilling to torpedo the lucrative CD business just because digital had come along. “These were the guys who had been in the industry for a long time and you would not have called them computer savvy” says Berman of the IFPI. “Probably a great many of them had their personal contracts tied to the sales of CD. The initial response was very much: protect what we have.”

Rosen concurs saying labels regarded “moving into something completely different” as anathema to how they worked. “Like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid where you have to jump into the river below because they are coming for you and praying that you’ll live” she says by way of analogy. “They just resisted doing that.”

Holzman puts it even more bluntly. “The record executives back in that time” he says “were not used to change.”

Against such entrenched protectionism Jobs’s defining – and controversial – idea was bound to clash violently. He wanted to charge a flat price of $0.99 for tracks – new or old – on the iTunes Store and crucially let consumers buy individual tracks without having to buy a full album. Even though iTunes at its peak around 2007 controlled more than 70% of the legal download market downloads were a negligible margin business for Apple despite taking a reported 30% cut of all sales. It was there as a driver for the iPod – where the real money was.

Teeth were gnashed at the time but labels had to accept that Apple steered them into a future they could not have reached under their own steam. “In effect [Apple’s dominance of legal downloads] was the price you paid for entry into the creation of a legitimate marketplace” shrugs Berman. “The creation of iTunes was the whipped cream on top. It really did create a sense once things got off the ground that this had rescued the recording industry.”

Rosen says she was sold early on the iTunes Store joining Jobs on “a little bit of a road show” around labels and management companies to get them on side. Apple was she says an outlier in Silicon Valley as a company that believed that all content – and especially music – should be paid for.

“Not only did he become an advocate for the music industry where we had none the music industry was really ridiculed by the tech industry” she says. “They didn’t see what we created as valuable.” Jobs couriered her an iPod on the day it launched. “He sent it to me with a big circle around the ‘don’t steal music’ [warning on the box]. Those three words were a comfort blanket to the industry before the iTunes Store launched.”

Apple also blossomed because no other technology company could develop a convincing iPod challenger. “Microsoft tried to get in there and had a few devices – but it never clicked as they were more cumbersome” says Rosen. “Apple had the field to themselves for a long time.”

She is more forgiving about the flaws of rival devices than Jobs ever was. Jim Goldman a reporter at CNBC interviewed Jobs in January 2008 and recounted how Robbie Bach the executive in charge of the Zune told him that Microsoft’s player was a “worthy alternative to Apple’s iPod”. Jobs did not miss the opportunity to kick a galumphing rival. “Was he inebriated?” he asked. “Do you even know anyone who owns a Zune?”

Apple also had the magnetic power to bring in celebrity endorsement. Engaging in shuttle diplomacy between California and Dublin Jobs and Apple’s lead designer Jony Ive enlisted the help of Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records to persuade one of his label’s marquee acts to break their blanket ban on advertising. A black and red iPod was created for U2 to coincide with the November 2004 release of their How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb album. The band paid a royalty rate on each device sold also agreed to appear in commercials for the device in exchange for phenomenal levels of marketing spend by Apple.

It was the iPod Mini also launched in 2004 that proved the tipping-point device that according to Walter Isaacson in his 2011 biography of Jobs “truly launched the iPod to market dominance by eliminating the competition from smaller flash-drive players”. Before the Mini launched Apple controlled 31% of the portable player market; within 18 months Apple held 74%. At the start of 2007 the iPod alone made up half of Apple’s business.

Sales of iPods passed 100m in April 2007 and its peak individual year was 2008 when it saw sales of 54.8m. But Apple already had its succession plan in place launching the iPhone in 2007 and slowly “retiring” its lines of iPods with only the iPod Touch surviving today. Now iPhones along with MacBooks AirPods iPads and Watches are Apple’s new centre of gravity.

“I don’t know how you describe something as the perfect product” says Berman looking back at the iPod’s impact “but it pretty much filled that description at that time.”

It also showed how digital technology seen in 2001 as the nemesis of the record business could actually save it. But this rescue plan came with hard conditions benefiting Apple considerably more than it benefited the record business. At its first day of trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on 21 September 2021 Universal Music Group comfortably the biggest label and publisher in the world hit a peak valuation of $54.3bn. In March 2021 Apple reported a market capitalisation of $2 trillion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vcmVhc29ucy13aHktcGVvcGxlLWxvdmUtdG8taGF0ZS1hcHBsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why People Love to Hate Apple: 6 Reasons,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vcmVhc29ucy13aHktcGVvcGxlLWxvdmUtdG8taGF0ZS1hcHBsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXBwbGUtc3VlZC1yZWZ1c2luZy1maXgtaXBob25lLXVuZGVyLXdhcnJhbnR5LXNhbi1mcmFuY2lzY28tc21hcnRwaG9uZS0yMDIxLTEw0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcHBsZS1zdWVkLXJlZnVzaW5nLWZpeC1pcGhvbmUtdW5kZXItd2FycmFudHktc2FuLWZyYW5jaXNjby1zbWFydHBob25lLTIwMjEtMTA_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple sued for $1383.13 for refusing to fix iPhone under warranty,"San Francisco's Apple Store.

An Apple iPhone owner sued the tech giant for $1383.13 the exact cost of his phone.

Theodore A. Kim filed the lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court last week.

Kim said the company refused to repair his iPhone despite it being under warranty.

An iPhone user in San Francisco has sued Apple for the exact cost of his iPhone saying the company refused to repair the device despite it being under warranty.

Theodore A. Kim filed a lawsuit in San Francisco seeking $1383.13 the original cost of his phone. The claim was filed in small claims court.

""It levels the playing field so that just a simple consumer like me can sue a big company without having to worry about getting lawyers and all that other stuff"" Kim told Insider in a phone interview last week. ""I feel like at least I want my day in court.""

The court clerk set a trial for 1.30 p.m. on November 23 2021 according to documents. Apple didn't respond to Insider's requests for comment.

The phone Kim's suing over was originally purchased from an authorized Apple seller in Vietnam in October 2020 he said. The iPhone 12 was under Apple's warranty until October 2022 he said.

When Kim returned to the US during the pandemic he was having trouble getting the phone to read a US sim card. So he called Apple and they told him to bring it into a local Apple Store.

""And so I brought it into the store and they sent it to the repair depot – then they came back and said 'Yeah we're not going to fix this because it's been tampered with'"" Kim said. ""And I said: 'Tampered with in what way?'""

He didn't get an answer he said. Instead they returned the phone. But now it had a broken SIM tray Kim said.

A few weeks later Kim filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Apple responded to that complaint saying the iPhone would have been repaired if it had been broken while the company had it.

""Apple considers this matter closed"" the company said according to the BBB website.

Since Apple wouldn't fix the phone under the warranty – which Kim said was voided by the company – he offered to pay for the repair. But the company again refused he said.

As a final gambit he sent an email to Apple CEO Tim Cook's email address in late June. He didn't hear back. So he turned to Google for ways to solve the problem.







""And I found a blog post of someone in Seattle successfully suing Apple in small claims court"" Kim said.

In that 2012 case a blogger brought Apple to small claims court in Washington after his 2008 MacBook Pro's graphics card died. That blogger's experience was similar enough to his that Kim thought he might have a chance in court.

""So I said 'Well OK why don't I try the same avenue'"" he said. ""I kind of jokingly said 'Well this is like a David and Goliath kind of situation.' We'll see what happens."""

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a shape-shifting material that can take and hold any possible shape paving the way for a new type of multifunctional material that could be used in a range of applications from robotics and biotechnology to architecture.

The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“Today’s shape-shifting materials and structures can only transition between a few stable configurations but we have shown how to create structural materials that have an arbitrary range of shape-morphing capabilities” said L Mahadevan the Lola England de Valpine Professor of Applied Mathematics of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and of Physics and senior author of the paper. “These structures allow for independent control of the geometry and mechanics laying the foundation for engineering functional shapes using a new type of morphable unit cell.”



SEAS researchers dubbed this material “totimorphic” because of its ability to morph into any stable shape. The researchers connected individual unit cells with naturally stable joints building 2D and 3D structures from individual totimorphic cells.

One of the biggest challenges in designing shape-morphing materials is balancing the seemingly contradictory needs of conformability and rigidity. Conformability enables transformation to new shapes but if it’s too conformal it can’t stably maintain the shapes. Rigidity helps lock the material into place but if it’s too rigid it can’t take on new shapes.

The team started with a neutrally stable unit cell with two rigid elements a strut and a lever and two stretchable elastic springs. If you’ve ever seen the beginning of a Pixar movie you’ve seen a neutrally stable material. The Pixar lamp head is stable in any position because the force of gravity is always counteracted by springs that stretch and compress in a coordinated way regardless of the lamp configuration. In general neutrally stable systems a combination of rigid and elastic elements balances the energy of the cells making each neutrally stable meaning that they can transition between an infinite number of positions or orientations and be stable in any of them.



In this neutrally stable cell a combination of rigid and elastic elements balances the energy of the cell allowing it to transition between an infinite number of positions or orientations and be stable in any of them.

“By having a neutrally stable unit cell we can separate the geometry of the material from its mechanical response at both the individual and collective level” said Gaurav Chaudhary a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and co-first author of the paper. “The geometry of the unit cell can be varied by changing both its overall size as well as the length of the single movable strut while its elastic response can be changed by varying either the stiffness of the springs within the structure or the length of the struts and links.”

The researchers dubbed the assembly as “totimorphic materials” because of their ability to morph into any stable shape. The researchers connected individual unit cells with naturally stable joints building 2D and 3D structures from individual totimorphic cells.

The researchers used both mathematical modeling and real-world demonstrations to show the material’s shape-shifting ability. The team demonstrated that one single sheet of totimorphic cells can curve up twist into a helix morph into the shape of two distinct faces and even bear weight.

“We show that we can assemble these elements into structures that can take on any shape with heterogeneous mechanical responses” said S. Ganga Prasath a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and co-first author of the paper. “Since these materials are grounded in geometry they could be scaled down to be used as sensors in robotics or biotechnology or could be scaled up to be used at the architectural scale.

“All together these totimorphs pave the way for a new class of materials whose deformation response can be controlled at multiple scales” said Mahadevan.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Gallagher (AJG) Ahead of Earnings?,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. AJG may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Arthur J. Gallagher is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AJG in this report.

In fact the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.40 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AJG giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.14% heading into earnings season.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Price and EPS Surprise

Why is this Important?

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that AJG has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Arthur J. Gallagher and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

Jeudi Alec Baldwin a actionné une arme à feu qui servait d'accessoire sur le tournage du film Rust tuant la directrice de la photographie du film et blessant grièvement le réalisateur. Interrogé par la police il n'a pas été arrêté et les investigations se poursuivent. Mais si les circonstances précises du drame restent à établir de premiers éléments de l'enquête ont été dévoilés.

Un assistant réalisateur a ainsi déclaré sous serment avoir saisi l'une des trois armes disposées sur un chariot par l'armurier du film avant de la tendre à Alec Baldwin en précisant que cette arme n'était pas chargée. Dans ce même témoignage l'assistant assure qu'il ne savait pas que des balles réelles se trouvaient à l'intérieur.

Des conditions de travail difficiles sur le tournage

Pour le moment on ne connaît pas la nature du projectile qui a tué Halyna Hutchins. Touchée à la poitrine elle était assise juste devant le réalisateur Joel Souza blessé lui à l'épaule. L'arme en cause et les douilles ont été récupérées par les enquêteurs de même que les vêtements d'Alec Baldwin visiblement tachés de sang ce qui souligne sa proximité avec les victimes au moment du drame. Ordinateurs téléphones portables images déjà tournées… Les enquêteurs ont saisi tout le matériel présent sur la scène pour tenter de comprendre comment une arme chargée a pu se retrouver sur le plateau.

Par ailleurs l'ambiance n'était pas au beau fixe sur le tournage. Plusieurs personnes l'avaient ainsi quitté en début de semaine se plaignant de conditions de travail difficiles pour ce western dont Alec Baldwin est également le producteur.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdWRvdWVzdC5mci9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2V0YXRzLXVuaXMvcmFkaWNhbGlzYXRpb24tZXQtZmFrZS1uZXdzLXBlbmRhbnQtbGEtcHJlc2lkZW50aWVsbGUtYW1lcmljYWluZS1kZS0yMDIwLWZhY2Vib29rLXNhdmFpdC1tYWlzLW4tYS1yaWVuLWZhaXQtNjY4MzEyNC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Radicalisation et fake news : pendant la présidentielle américaine de 2020 Facebook savait mais n'a rien fait,"Début novembre 2020 quelques jours après le scrutin un analyste de Facebook faisait savoir à ses collègues que 10 % des contenus politiques visionnés par les utilisateurs américains de la plateforme étaient des messages assurant que le vote avait été truqué d’après le New York Times.

Cette rumeur sans fondement martelée par l’ex-président Donald Trump a alimenté la colère de nombreux conservateurs et conspirationnistes qui a culminé avec les émeutes du Capitole le 6 janvier. Des partisans du milliardaire républicain avaient ce jour-là envahi le Congrès pendant la certification de la victoire du démocrate Joe Biden. Cinq personnes ont trouvé la mort pendant ou peu après l’attaque. Dans la foulée Facebook comme Twitter et les autres grandes plateformes ont banni Donald Trump et les mouvements extrémistes impliqués dans les émeutes.

D’après les nouvelles révélations publiées vendredi des employés du groupe californien estiment qu’il aurait pu mieux anticiper le problème.

Vendredi des articles du New York Times du Washington Post ou encore de la chaîne NBC portaient sur le rôle de Facebook dans la polarisation intense de la vie politique aux États-Unis. Ces révélations sont les dernières en date d’une longue série depuis une première vague d’enquêtes publiées par le Wall Street Journal en septembre grâce à des rapports internes transmis par cette ex-employée du groupe californien.

Sur le même sujet Facebook : Frances Hauges dénonce la « spirale » du réseau social quelles sont ses révélations ? « Un catalyseur » voilà comme un élu a décrit la lanceuse d’alerte Frances Haugen dont l’exposé a écorné mardi l’image de Facebook au point de pousser le Congrès à promettre de mieux réguler le géant californien.

Suite des révélations

Ces informations ont été extraites de milliers de documents internes remis à la SEC l’autorité boursière par Frances Haugen. Début octobre elle a répété devant des sénateurs américains que les dirigeants de la firme Mark Zuckerberg en tête « financent leurs profits avec notre sûreté ».

Elle avait auparavant fait fuiter des études montrant que Facebook a conscience des problèmes psychologiques des adolescentes surexposées aux vies et corps apparemment « parfaits » des influenceuses sur Instagram. C’est le fil rouge de ces révélations : le géant des réseaux sociaux connaissait les problèmes mais a choisi en bonne partie de les ignorer selon la lanceuse d’alerte et d’autres sources anonymes.

Un faux compte payé par Facebook

Les articles de vendredi évoquent ainsi un rapport intitulé « Le voyage de Carol vers QAnon ». Carol Smith une « mère conservatrice de Caroline du Nord » était un faux compte créé par un chercheur payé par Facebook pour étudier le rôle de la plateforme dans la polarisation des utilisateurs.

D’après ce chercheur dès l’été 2019 Carol Smith était exposée par l’algorithme du réseau social à un « torrent de contenus extrêmes conspirationnistes et choquants » dont des groupes de la mouvance QAnon.

Face à cette nouvelle vague de critiques Facebook a publié un communiqué rappelant ses investissements conséquents pour assainir ses plateformes et soutenir le processus démocratique. « Mais la responsabilité de l’insurrection revient à ceux qui ont enfreint la loi et à ceux qui les y ont incités » y déclare Guy Rosen un vice-président du groupe chargé de l’intégrité civique. Cette défense a peu de chances de satisfaire des élus remontés à bloc contre le réseau social.

Un nouveau lanceur d’alerte

D’autant que le flot de révélations ne tarit pas : un consortium d’une dizaine d’organisations de presse de CNN au Monde s’apprête à publier des articles basés sur ces documents d’après le site spécialisé The Information.

Et un nouveau lanceur d’alerte s’est manifesté selon un article du Washington Post paru vendredi.

Ex-membre de l’équipe d’intégrité civique il a fait une déposition auprès de la SEC le 13 octobre où il accuse Facebook de faire passer les profits avant les enjeux humains. Dans ce document l’ancien employé relate notamment des propos tenus en 2017 quand l’entreprise décidait de la meilleure façon de gérer la polémique liée à l’interférence de la Russie dans la présidentielle américaine de 2016 via sa plateforme.

« Ce sera un feu de paille. Des élus vont râler. Et d’ici quelques semaines ils seront passés à autre chose. En attendant on imprime de l’argent au sous-sol et tout va bien » aurait alors déclaré Tucker Bounds un membre de l’équipe de communication de Facebook.

Objectif à l'issue du mandat : créer 1 million d'emplois. «Ces mesures offriront des opportunités à tous en particulier aux jeunes» a déclaré le chef du gouvernement Aziz Akhannouch devant les deux chambres du Parlement. D'après lui le plan de relance économique du gouvernement comprend des programmes innovants pour l'emploi et prévoit un appui aux initiatives privées outre le financement et l'accompagnement des entreprises nationales.

A partir de 2022 et pour une durée de deux ans il est question d’un programme de petits et grands ateliers publics dans le cadre de contrats d'intérim au niveau des collectivités territoriales et en partenariat avec les associations de la société civile et les coopératives locales sans exiger de qualification. Ce programme permettra la création d'au moins 250.000 emplois directs d'ici deux ans. Toutefois plusieurs députés de l’opposition ont jugé que les chiffres présentés pour l’emploi ne sont pas «réalistes» voire sont «exagérés».

En arguant que l’impact du taux de croissance sur la création d’emplois au Maroc a nettement baissé au cours des dernières années. Le nouvel exécutif fait-il montre d’un optimisme excessif sur le volet de l’emploi ? En réponse aux remarques des parlementaires Akhannouch explique que «tout dépend de la nature de l'investissement. Par exemple l’investissement dans le béton ne sera pas rentable en matière d’emploi».

Selon lui le lien entre le taux de croissance et la création d’emploi n’est pas totalement établi «estimant que les engagements gouvernementaux en matière d’emploi sont réalistes et réalisables». Pour ce qui est du secteur agricole le gouvernement prévoit à travers la stratégie Generation Green de créer 350.000 nouveaux emplois directs dans le milieu rural tout en assurant des conditions d'emploi et de protection sociale qui garantissent la dignité des jeunes et limitent les migrations et le vieillissement de la population du monde rural. Le chef de l’exécutif explique que ces emplois seront générés notamment via la distribution d’un million d’hectares.

Favoriser le Made in Morocco pour booster l’emploi

Le gouvernement veillera aussi au renforcement de la position du Maroc en tant que pôle international des chaînes marines et ce à travers la préservation de la richesse halieutique pour les générations futures. A cet effet les mesures prévues permettront la création de plus de 100.000 emplois directs et indirects dans les secteurs de la pêche et de la pisciculture.

Et si le développement de l'industrie marocaine s'est principalement centré sur les industries lourdes qui nécessitent un investissement important en main-d'œuvre le gouvernement entend au cours des cinq prochaines années changer de paradigme pour favoriser l'intégration locale des industries en s'appuyant sur un investissement important en capital.

Le plan de relance proposé prévoit la création de plus de 400.000 emplois au cours de la période comprise entre 2022 et 2026 grâce à l'émergence de métiers industriels fondés sur l'investissement en capital qui nécessitent plus de compétences techniques et en même temps ouvrent indirectement de nouvelles opportunités pour les industries lourdes basées sur l'investissement dans la main-d'œuvre.

«Une grande partie de ces postes sera créée par des industries telles que les industries pharmaceutiques le secteur de l'automobile et les secteurs connexes notamment les métaux l'électronique et les plastiques» a assuré Akhannouch. De surcroît l'investissement de l'État dans les secteurs de la santé et de l'éducation aura un impact significatif sur l'emploi et la croissance. Mesures prévues : renforcement du budget de la santé développement et vulgarisation des crèches (préscolaire) ainsi que la mise à niveau de la profession enseignante pour créer au moins 50.000 emplois par an. Au final la team Akhannouch réussira-t-elle le grand pari de l'emploi ?

Les dirigeants peuvent se mettre en quête de financement d'un projet de rénovation qui devra être approuvé par référendum.

Les Catalans n'ont pas peur des référendums! A la demande du peuple ""blaugrana"" Joan Laporta le président du FC Barcelone a validé la demande des socios d'organiser un référendum pour valider définitivement le nouveau projet de rénovation du Camp Nou.

Ce samedi 445 socios réunis en assemblée générale extraordinaire ont validé le plan de financement du futur stade qui devrait coûter 15 milliard d'euros. Un pas en avant important pour le club qui peut d'ores et déjà se mettre en quête d'investisseurs dont Joan Laporta a assuré qu'ils ne toucheront pas à l'indépendance du Barça. Les travaux et le montage financier précis seront alors votés par un référendum qui rassemblera tous les socios du club.

La semaine passée Joan Laporta avait présenté les adaptations nécessaires en termes de coûts notamment du projet de rénovation du Camp Nou nommé Espai Barça. Projet lancé en 2014 mais qui n'a guère avancé. Seul le mini-estadi situé en face du Camp Nou a été détruit et son équivalent a été reconstruit à la cité sportive de Sant Joan Despi.

Mais surtout le projet initial était sous-dimensionné financièrement avec 600 millions. Bien loin des montants avancés par les autres mastodontes européens pour leurs stades.

Le nouveau projet prévoit de porter la capacité du Camp Nou à 110 000 spectateurs. Les travaux débuteraient en 2022 avec un achèvement programmé en 2025. ""Le financement se fera sur 35 ans"" avait annoncé Laporta la semaine passée assurant que l'investissement n'impacterait en rien les financements consacrés à l'équipe phare du club."

As the cream of female film talent including Hollywood’s Meryl Streep and Britain’s Andrea Arnold prepare to receive significant career awards a dark cloud is threatening. It is expected that new allegations of the abuse of women in the European entertainment industry will be made public which may overshadow the sparkle of a feminist Croisette.

Streep’s screen achievements will be celebrated with an honorary Palme d’Or at the opening ceremony while a day later Arnold the acclaimed British film director will receive the prestigious Carosse d’Or from the French director’s guild. And on Sunday another influential British film personality will be saluted when diversity champion Dame Donna Langley the chairman and chief content officer at NBCUniversal is to be honoured with the Women in Motion Award at a lavish dinner. All this comes in a year that also sees the American director Greta Gerwig best known for last summer’s Barbie presiding over a jury that features the campaigning stars Eva Green and Lily Gladstone. But the story of the 77th festival will not be all positive for women.

In the run-up to the annual gathering on the Côte d’Azur rumours have been widespread in France of the existence of a secret list of 10 men in the industry including leading actors and directors who have been abusive to women. The names described as “explosive” are believed to have been sent anonymously to the National Centre for Cinema in Paris along with other leading film finance companies in France.

According to reports in Le Figaro and the satirical magazine Le Canard enchaîné festival organisers have set up a crisis management team to respond to the accusations. Films might have to be dropped from the screening timetable if they involve implicated names.

The impending revelations may prove an apt curtain-raiser for the Wednesday premiere of a short French film Moi Aussi about abuse in the industry. The film which was added to the festival’s Un Certain Regard programme at the last minute is predicted to prove just as incendiary as the list owing to its emotive content.

Made by actor Judith Godrèche dubbed the “ambassador of #MeToo” in France it draws on the words of many female contributors and takes the form of a choral piece uniting different personal accounts. “Suddenly before me was a crowd of victims a reality that also represented France so many stories from all social backgrounds and generations” Godrèche has explained. “Then the question was what I was going to do with them? What do you do when you’re overwhelmed by what you hear by the sheer volume of testimonies?”

The 52-year-old actor first shook up French cinema in February when she accused the directors Jacques Doillon and Benoît Jacquot of having raped her in the 1980s when she was a teenager. Jacquot 77 Godrèche said had a relationship with her when she was under the age of consent. He denies committing any offences and has said that he was “under her spell”. She claims Doillon 80 forced her to take part in a gratuitous sex scene on his 1989 film La Fille de 15 ans (The 15-year-old Girl). He says she agreed to take part in the scene in which he also acted and he denies rape or assault. Godrèche followed up her accusations a month later with a speech at France’s high-profile Cesar awards in which she claimed the film industry had been a cover for exploiting underaged actors.

The effect of new abuse allegations and all the honours being heaped on influential women will certainly mean the opening of the 2024 festival is in strong contrast to last year. Last May demonstrators on the Croisette opposed Johnny Depp’s appearance in the opening film Jeanne du Barry. They were angry about recent abuse allegations against him involving his ex-wife Amber Heard that led to his defeat in a British libel trial although a month later he won a similar libel trial in an American court.

A more progressive tone should be set by Streep’s opening honour made in recognition of “countless masterpieces” over 50 years of cinema. “To stand in the shadow of those who have previously been honoured is humbling and thrilling in equal part” said Streep on hearing of the award.

London-born Langley a “trailblazing” studio chief is also being rewarded next weekend for fostering “a more inclusive industry” over two decades with films that “provide a platform for women”. Away from film sets Langley has also campaigned as a board member of Vital Voices and is a founder of the Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Film mentorship programme. Previous winners of the Women In Motion award include Jane Fonda Salma Hayek Viola Davis and last year Michelle Yeoh.

Arnold whose new film Bird is showing in the main competition this year will receive her award after a Wednesday screening of her 2006 film Red Road. Set in Glasgow it tells of a false accusation of rape made vengefully by a female CCTV operator.

Jury-member Green is one of the more prominent actors to have accused Harvey Weinstein of making inappropriate advances. In 2017 the actor said she had to push away the disgraced producer during a business meeting in Paris. “I got away without it going further but the experience left me shocked and disgusted” she said.

The reaction to the #MeToo movement in France has been slower and more nuanced than in America. The legendary actor Catherine Deneuve was among those to initially play down the importance of prosecuting the bad behaviour of men defending their so-called “right to pester”. But last week French legislators agreed to a government inquiry into sexual and gender-based violence across the country’s performing arts and fashion sectors. And in the autumn French actor Gérard Depardieu stands trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on the set of The Green Shutters. He faces rape charges in another case and is under investigation over allegations of assault. He denies all charges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvYXJ0cy9qZWFubmllLWVwcGVyLWRlYWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeannie Epper Groundbreaking Stunt Double on ‘Wonder Woman’ Dies at 83,"Jeannie Epper had at least 100 screen roles maybe even 150 — no one is quite sure. But because she was a stunt double galloping on horseback crashing cars and kicking down doors for the stars of films and television shows hers was not a household name.

In her heyday however Ms. Epper was ubiquitous. She hurtled through the air most weeks as Lynda Carter’s stunt double on the hit television series “Wonder Woman” and mimed Ms. Carter’s leggy lope. She tumbled through a scrum of mud and rocks as Kathleen Turner’s double in the 1984 comedy-adventure film “Romancing the Stone” which also starred Michael Douglas. She threw punches for Linda Evans in one of her many ballyhooed cat fights with Joan Collins on the frothy long-running 1980s nighttime soap opera “Dynasty.”

And in what she often said was her favorite stunt — or gag to use the industry term — Ms. Epper skidded a Corvette into a 180-degree turn as Shirley MacLaine’s character in “Terms of Endearment” (1983) neatly hurling Jack Nicholson’s double into the Gulf of Mexico.

Ms. Epper whose bruising career spanned 70 years died on Sunday at her home in Simi Valley Calif. She was 83.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9tZWdoYW4tbWFya2xlLXByaW5jZS1oYXJyeS1yZWNlcHRpb24tbmlnZXJpYS04NjQ2ODc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meghan Markle Has Glam Moment at Reception in Nigeria,"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry coordinated their looks for a special reception on their second day in Nigeria.

Following their first stop at Nigeria: Unconquered a national charity working in tandem with Prince Harry's Invictus Games on Saturday May 11 the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attended a reception for military families and the widow association at the Defense Headquarters Officers Mess in Abuja. The outing also came with a special update: the unveiling of a rehabilitation center.

For the event the couple matched in linen ensembles. Meghan went glam in a St. Agni white strapless column linen dress while Harry wore a cream linen suit.

Hosted by the Chief of Defense Staff General Christopher Musa it was a chance for the couple to speak to families of servicemen and women.

Shortly after being seated the couple rose along with everyone else to listen to the national anthems. The ceremony began with ""God Save The King"" during which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stood at attention. Harry stood with his eyes forward and his arms by his side as the anthem played. The British anthem was followed by the Nigerian anthem.

They were then treated to a dance performance by a group of energetic dancers and drummers and heard testimonies from wounded warriors. Lance Corporal Peacemaker Azuegbulam despite having a prosthetic leg after being shot shared his plans to participate in alpine skiing and skeleton sliding at the Vancouver Invictus Games. The 27-year-old thanked Prince Harry for bringing the games to fruition later telling PEOPLE: “It has given me a reason to live. There is ability on my disability.""

Meghan and Harry were also shown a computer-generated tour of a new planned Invictus Centre that will be a haven of physical and mental rehabilitation for wounded service personnel.

During the series of speeches Abike Dabiri Erewa chairman of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission elicited wide smiles and applause from Meghan and applause from around the room when she exclaimed: “Princess Meghan is a Nigerian!""

She said she wasn’t surprised when Meghan said on her podcast that she had Nigerian heritage. “I was excited but not surprised. Because she is beautiful intelligent diligent and hardworking and she stands firm in the midst of challenges"" she said adding ""Prince Harry you married the best — our daughter our friend Princess Meghan. I hope you come back again again and again.”

And she didn’t leave out Harry saying: “Princess Meghan you married the best man.""

After handing them gifts of his and hers traditional Aso-Oke outfits she told PEOPLE: “They are an amazing couple. They’re humble down-to-earth and they look so good together. The love is there; you feel it.”



As a former captain in the British Armed Forces and founding patron of the Invictus Games an international adaptive sports tournament for wounded injured and sick service personnel advocating for veterans and their families has long been close to Harry's heart.

In a speech Harry shared his “heartfelt gratitude” to the Chief of Defense Staff and the Defense Minister. “Your reception and energy have been nothing but remarkable” he said.

He also acknowledged the ""tragic loss of the brave souls” who’ve lost their lives in recent conflicts in the country.

“It reminds us of the true of service and the profound impact of conflict of children families and nations. My deepest condolences to all of the families"" he said.

He also shared a poignant moment from his visit with wounded soldiers on Friday.

“I’ll tell you a story from yesterday when I visited Kanuda Hospital"" Harry said as he referenced meeting 50 wounded and injured personnel on May 10. ""I’m sure they won’t mind me saying but morale was low. I could see it in their faces I could see it in their eyes. Their injuries were defining their life. There were two of the 50 that were...a little different. They had smiles on their faces. One of them was doing push-ups on his bed.

“What this proved to me what this reminds me of is the power of seeing what is possible post-injury. They would not be defined by the injuries of the past. That is what this is all about.”

He continued “And that is what the new center you’re building is all about. Seeing the plans for the new Invictus Centre gives me goosebumps. As we look forward let’s keep in mind that by uniting efforts we could make remarkable progress in acknowledging the sacrifice of many of our military personnel and as important their families. Offering support for their rehabilitation and recovery.""

As they left the stage the couple were invited to dance by a group of enthusiastic women. Harry was reluctant but Meghan joined in.

Speaking to PEOPLE about Prince Harry’s vision for Invictus and what fuels his fire his friend fellow veteran and Invictus Games alumni David Wiseman said ""The identity of being a soldier doesn’t go away or change because you’re a prince or a duke. He feels that. He feels part of this community and we feel him as part of our community. That’s the passion and drives him in wishing to serve this community.""

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are in Nigeria this weekend at the invitation of the Chief of Defense staff Staff General Christopher Gwabin Musa the country's highest-ranking military official and the itinerary highlights the Invictus mission.

Prince Harry's empathy shone on the first day of the tour at the Nigerian Army Reference Hospital Kaduna where he took one young man's hand in a move that channeled his late mother Princess Diana.

""Are they helping you? Are you feeling better?"" Prince Harry asked at the bedside of Private Habu Sadiq in video captured by PEOPLE's chief foreign correspondent Simon Perry who is exclusively covering the Duke and Duchess's outings in Nigeria.

""Get better be strong"" Harry told the soldier who had suffered from impaired eyesight due to a blast.

The hospital stop was the Duke's last outing on May 10 which also included visits to the Lightway Academy school (coordinating with the GEANCO Foundation’s inaugural mental health summit) and the Chief of Defense staff headquarters with Meghan 42. Harry then continued solo to meet the governor (who surprised him with paintings of him with both Princess Diana and his wife Meghan!) and headed to the hospital.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex began their second day abroad at a training session for Nigeria: Unconquered a national charity working in collaboration with the Invictus Games Foundation. Prince Harry and Meghan’s visit to Nigeria: Unconquered was all about sports recovery where they saw a training session/basketball match with athletes.

Nigeria participated in the Invictus Games for the first time in September 2023 at the latest cycle of the competition in Düsseldorf Germany where Prince Harry 39 and Meghan 42 spent time with athletes from the team and fans in the stands. Meghan previously revealed on her Archetypes podcast in 2022 that she learned she has Nigerian heritage through a genealogy test and Harry joked in his opening remarks at the 2023 Invictus Games that his wife was rooting for the Nigerian team.

In keeping with tradition the night concluded with the reveal of the night’s highest honor the Most Honored Citizens of Aksarben for 2021.

Both native Nebraskans and University of Nebraska alumni Tonn Ostergard was born on a farm just outside of Gothenburg; Holly was born in Lincoln. Each were taught core values — dependability authenticity commitment compassion and generosity. The couple married in 1984 at First Plymouth Congregational Church where they still attend.

A descendant of Danish immigrant pioneers Tonn is chair and chief executive officer of Crete Carrier a family business and privately owned transportation and logistics corporation in Lincoln. Additionally Tonn serves on the board of directors of Union Bank and Trust Company Ameritas Mutual Holding Company NEBCO Inc. and the American Trucking Association. He was inducted into the Halls of Fame of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry the Nebraska Business and the University School of Accountancy. In addition he has been recognized by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with the Alumni Leadership Award.

Holly Ostergard serves as president of the Acklie Charitable Foundation and is vice-chair of Crete Carrier Corporation. She is a graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Education and Human Sciences. In 2018 she received the Perry W.

Holly has also been recognized with the Inspire Excellence in Philanthropy Award and the First Plymouth Woman of Distinction Award. She serves on the boards of the University of Nebraska Foundation Lighthouse Lincoln Children’s Zoo and Southeast Community College Foundation. Holly has been a member of Women Investing in Nebraska since 2013.

Their families have deep Aksarben roots. Tonn’s grandmother received Aksarben’s Good Neighbor of the year Award in 1975. Holly’s father was inducted into the Aksarben Court of Honor in 1996. Holly was an Aksarben Countess in 1981 and served as President of Aksarben Friends in 2011. Their two children who each play integral roles in their day-to-day business operations of Crete Carrier have also been part of Aksarben. Winston Ostergard was an Aksarben Escort in 2009 and Halley Ostergard was a Page in 1995 a Countess in 2007 and named Queen of Aksarben that same year. Holly and Tonn’s granddaughter Avery served as a Page in Saturday night’s production and had the additional responsibility of being the ""clock-bearer"" at the beginning of the program.

The Ostergard family was also a recipient of the Aksarben Pioneer Farm Family Award in 1999 bestowed to families who have held at least 40 acres of farmland in Nebraska for 100 years consecutively.

While there was much celebration and joy with the return of the Aksarben Ball Saturday night the Foundation also paid tribute to the late philanthropist and Aksarben Governor Walter Scott Jr. through a personal video and a collective ""toast to Walter"" just prior to dinner being served. Walter Scott Jr. had been an Aksarben Governor for over twenty years and was the visionary behind the Aksarben Horatio Alger Scholarship the program for which the Aksarben Ball raises funds each year.

The sharks who have included Daymond John Kevin O’Leary Robert Herjavec Barbara Corcoran Mark Cuban Lori Greiner and others offer millions of their own investor dollars to fund ideas they think can really fly. For every success there are just as many failures some more spectacular than others. Here are five of the biggest ""Shark Tank"" fails.

The Body Jac

It may seem impossible for new exercise equipment to excite big donors but in season one Jack Barringer infomercial star and entrepreneur was able to convince investors Barbara Corcoran and Kevin Harrington to invest $180000 in his business. His device “The Body Jac” was supposed to make pushups easier as well as improve other muscles. According to Shark Tank Tales Jack was instructed to lose 30 pounds by his doctor but found certain exercises hard on his joints. Thus his invention was born.

It’s unclear why the company did not succeed according to Showbiz Cheat Sheet but Corcoran told Forbes “My worst [Shark Tank deal] was investing in a fast-talking cowboy selling exercise equipment who needed to lose 50 pounds.”

Breathometer

The Breathometer sounded too good to be true and maybe it was. Breathometer was a portable breathalyzer device that measured blood alcohol levels via a smartphone app according to Failory. Its founder Charles Michael Yim raised $1 million in 2013 from Kevin O'Leary Mark Cuban Daymond John Lori Greiner and Robert Herjavec who got 30% equity. The fact that all five sharks were willing to go in on it seemed to bode well for the product. But the reality was not so smooth. The company could not fulfill all the orders placed and the device did not deliver accurate results. The Federal Trade Commission ordered the company to refund all customers and remove the product from sale.

Story continues

Mark Cuban referred to it as the “worst execution in the history of Shark Tank” and placed the blame back on founder Yim’s shoulders claiming mismanagement of funds.

The company is still going though it is advertising a new product that can measure biomarkers of bad breath and gum disease partnering with the oral hygiene department at Philips.

Sweet Ballz

Sweet Ballz

Everyone loves cake even investors. Founders of Sweet Ballz a cake ball company James McDonald and Cole Egger must have done something right as they got $250000 from Mark Cuban and Barbara Corcoran in exchange for 25% of their sweets company. At one point the cake company had earned $700000 in cake ball sales from 7-11 Franchises alone according to Shark Tank Success.

That sweet success didn’t last however. McDonald wound up suing Egger for breach of contract after he started a competing company called CakeBallz. At one point McDonald even asked for a restraining order. The company still exists but the founders’ partnership does not.

Show No Towels

In 2012 Shelly Ehler appeared on the show with her product for small children who might need to change in public places such as at a swimming pool according to The Inquisitr. She called her towel/poncho crossover “Show No Towels."" Ehler won over several sharks but chose to partner with Lori Greiner who gave her $50000 on the spot the first time in the show’s history at that point a contestant had received money on demand.

They worked together for a year before the company went bust. According to Inc.com “things just didn't go the way she expected them to or the way they were presented on TV.”

Toygaroo

What seemed like an excellent idea Toygaroo a company that dubbed itself the “Netflix of toys” as it allowed people to rent toys every month was so compelling it got Mark Cuban and Kevin O’Leary to invest $200000 for 35% control of the company in 2011.

Whether due to inexperience mismanagement growing too fast or a combination of all three Toygaroo filed for Chapter 7 in April 2012 just one year after getting the investment. The company closed for good in 2016.

By Nicole Ndumele

The U.S. Postal Service recently launched a postal banking pilot program that allows customers to cash payroll and business checks up to $500 in four cities: Washington Baltimore the Bronx and Falls Church Virginia. This modest pilot is the foundation for more expansive contemplated postal banking services that could include bill-paying services ATM access and money order and wire transfer capabilities all of which would provide critical financial services for millions of people shut out of the banking services that foster economic security and wellbeing for many Americans.

Local bank branches are shuttering in communities all across our country and mainstream banks are failing to offer financial services that meet the needs of many communities particularly low-income rural and Black and Latino communities."

The quaint village of Saltford nestled between the bustling cities of Bristol and Bath is more than just a passing point along the A4 Bath Road. Despite its location on a key route it boasts a tight-knit community where ""everyone knows each other and feels like they belong"".

Once perceived as lacking identity Saltford has transformed into a thriving hub for families couples and young people. Over the past decade the village has embraced numerous changes evident in the 'sold' signs dotting almost every street corner. Its prime position along a busy A-road and the scenic Bristol Bath railway path make it an attractive place to settle down.

Saltford offers a diverse range of homes from luxury properties with expansive driveways and mechanical gates to charming cottages adorned with plants and flowers. It also houses hidden architectural gems like the grade II listed Saltford House believed to have been built in the 1700s by architect Thomas Bennett for his personal use.

Like any desirable location house prices in Saltford reflect its growing popularity. However data from Rightmove indicates that the overall average price of homes there was £492222 over the last year marking a 10 per cent decrease from the previous year reports Bristol Live.

According to Rightmove's records ""The majority of sales in Saltford during the last year were semi-detached properties selling for an average price of £487400. Detached properties sold for an average of £571500 with terraced properties fetching £425000.""

Saltford offers easy access to Keynsham's town centre with a mere stroll and city centres and rural pubs are just a short drive away. The public transport system is quite capable with two primary services between Bristol and Bath the X39 and 39 still running every half hour into the pre-dawn hours despite the 2023 bus cuts that affected other areas. Additionally there's the A4 an hourly airport service.

Saltford also boasts places like The Riverside Inn on the banks of the River Avon and Thai Cafe on Bath Road offering delectable meal options. Though Thai Cafe primarily serves scrumptious Thai food in the evenings it has become such an integral part of the community that it invites people in for a daytime cuppa.

During a 2022 visit Nikki the proprietor of Thai Cafe shared: ""Saltford has become the place to be. Everyone knows each other and helps each other out.""

""I have been here for about 20 years. It used to be mostly retired people who lived here but we are getting more families and young people now.""

Nikki pointing to the restaurant's interior expressed her gratitude for local support: ""People around the village have helped to make the restaurant what it is today. If something is broken someone will help and fix it.""

She continued to praise the community spirit saying ""People in the community helped me to get the restaurant up and running when we had to shut for eight months. Everyone is so nice and so helpful. That's what makes the village so great the people in it. I feel like I belong.""

Highlighting the perks of village life Nikki added ""In Saltford you have things like parking space. You don't get that in most cities. I also know that if I walk home at 10pm from work I will be safe. You don't get antisocial behaviour around here.""

Overlooking the bustling Bath Road Thai Cafe benefits from the traffic calming measures. ""Luckily traffic is slowed down because of the traffic lights"" Nikki remarked.

""We do get a lot of cars go by but people have to get to work and we understand that. Those people the people that drive through the village aren't the people that live here.""

As the warmer months roll in Saltford becomes a haven for wild swimmers kayakers and paddleboarders boasting a picturesque marina and the Bristol Avon Sailing Club making it a perfect destination for water enthusiasts.

Salford Parish Council is at the helm of addressing local concerns in the village. A spokesperson for the Parish Council shared with BristolLive their pride in the community stating: ""Many people who live and work in the village make Saltford a great place to be through their voluntary contributions which are celebrated annually through the Saltford Parish Council Community Awards. Much of the community activity is centred around Saltford Hall run by the Saltford Community Association.""

""Saltford is fortunate to have a community run Post Office and library on the A4 Bath Road as well as many active commercial businesses based around the village. Saltford is surrounded by green belt land which preserves its rural setting; care of the local environment is a matter close to many villagers' hearts as shown by the many members of the Saltford Environment Group and Saltford Wombles.""

""The village is served by the Bristol to Bath Railway Path which is popular with walkers and cyclists alike. As a rural community Saltford Parish Council welcomes considerate visitors who follow the countryside code who leave no trace of their visit by taking their litter home or use one of the many bins around the village. Saltford's residents appreciate considerate parking by visitors and use of public transport is strongly encouraged due to limited parking in the village.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An $800 Rental Bath Makeover Goes from “Drab” to Fab,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/drab-rental-bathroom-makeover-37397824 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2JlZC1iYXRoLXN0cmlrZXMtZnJvbS10aGUtYmV5b25k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bed Bath Strikes From the Beyond,"Why did this happen?

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

The syndicate comprising 47 people work at the Baxter Healthcare Plant in Castlebar.

Celebrations so far have been mostly centred on the village of Turlough four miles from Castlebar where the winning Quick Pick was purchased in the local XL Store.

The big win has been confirmed by locals and celebrations got underway in the Turlough Inn pub at around 10.30pm on Saturday night when news broke of the bonanza. An 80th birthday celebration was underway for a local man at the time.

“News of the big win certainly added spice to the night” said a man who attended the party.

“The whole village is buzzing everybody is absolutely delighted.”

Syndicate members will collect over €12000 each not a life-changing amount but still significant.

“It will make life a little easier for those involved” said Michael Barrett who runs the Turlough XL Store with his wife Attracta.

Quick Pick selection

A Quick Pick selection in the Turlough shop purchase netted the Match 5 Plus Bonus prize in Saturday night’s draw.

A second Quick Pick bought elsewhere in the country landed a similar amount.

This is the first big Lotto win for the Turlough XL Store although it has landed a number of smaller lottery prizes over the years.

“It’s absolutely brilliant news. We are delighted"" said Ms Barrett.

Syndicate members say they are looking forward to travelling to National Lottery Headquarters later in the week to cash in on their good fortune.

There was no winner of Saturday night's record €19.6m jackpot.

The top prize if won would have been the highest jackpot in the history of the game in Ireland by some margin.

The jackpot has been rolling since Wednesday June 9 with the last eight National Lottery games failing to produce an outright winner.

The amount is so high that it has now been capped meaning no additional money can be added to the pot until it has been won.

The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will instead be distributed to the next prize tier in which there is a winner.

Next Wednesday will see the same record-breaking amount up for grabs in the main draw.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcnJhbGdsb2JlLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMTk2NjYyMzYud2lycmFscy1maXJzdC1hY2FpLWJhci1iaWctaGl0LWtpZHMtaGVzd2FsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wirral's first Acai bar is big hit in Heswall but what is it all about?,"Crush on Village Road opened at the end of August and also specialises in smoothies and homemade desserts.

Acai - pronounced ‘Ah-sigh-ee’ is a berry native to Central and South America which is touted as a superfood with anti-ageing and weight loss properties.

Speaking to the Globe Sophie White who co-owns the Crush business with partner Natasha Baxter said: “Because lockdown hit us hard we thought what’s something new and different around here that we would be able to continue if lockdown happened again?

The Acai bar has helped breath new life into the small village

“We were looking at cafes in Bali and Thailand and they all do the Acai berries so we thought we’ll do it here because no one else does it at all.”

Crush sell the unusual fruit in ‘Acai bowls’ with other healthy ingredients with the aim of helping customers to feel energised and full.

But more traditional offerings such as milkshakes cookie dough waffles and brownies have gone down a storm with local school kids.

The business also offers coffees and special ‘bubble tea’ with berries that shot up a large straw and pop in the mouth.

Natasha believes the Lower Heswall area has already seen the benefit of the shop opening.

She said: “It’s such a nice place here but there were loads of shops that were derelict and had been empty. It’s in such a good location near the schools.

“Now we’ve started this someone has taken over the fruit and veg shop that had been empty for 10 years. It’s brought a bit of life back down here. That’s what everyone says to us. It’s been missing something.

“Everything around here is kind of aimed at the older generation. This is something for the kids to do.

“It’s become a thing on a Friday. They all come down here for a treat at the end of the week.”

Warren Buffett warned against overpaying even the most brilliant CEO shared his process for learning from bad acquisitions and weighed in on why executives cheat and lie in an interview for ""Talent Strategy Risk"" a recent book by corporate-governance experts Ram Charan Bill McNabb and Dennis Carey.

The famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway chairman also outlined why he's not the easiest person to have on a board detailed how he keeps audit firms honest and urged CEOs to be open with their shareholders.

Here are Buffett's 10 best quotes from the book lightly edited and condensed for clarity:

1. ""Picking the right CEO is 10 times more important than the compensation. But somebody has to be there to represent the shareholders in terms of overreaching by even competent executives.""

2. ""I was at a company that made about eight acquisitions none of which worked out and they could hardly wait to do the ninth. So I suggested that we have a postmortem just like a hospital on every acquisition two or three years later and objectively decide — not with recriminations or anything — just what actually did happen.""

3. ""It isn't fundamental dishonesty that causes people to go in a different direction. It's human nature. There are plenty of people who are really decent people intelligent people. I'd be happy if they married my daughter or if they moved in next door to me. But they just don't come to grips with reality. And boards usually don't push them to.""

4. ""I realized that the only way to really get one of the super big-name auditors to behave was to have them more afraid of me than they were afraid of the management."" — recalling how he reined in a company ""playing games"" with its quarterly financials.

5. ""The company lawyers tell you to list every possible thing you can dream of in the 10-K just as a protection. They kill you with quantity. The risk committees almost don't have a chance."" — bemoaning how companies draft a laundry list of risks to obscure the key ones.

6. ""Women have gotten a raw deal for so long that I'd absolutely prefer to give the job to a female. But I've never recommended a woman who I didn't think had the qualities that I've set forth in the 10-year report.""

Advertisement

7. ""I've probably been a little more of a skunk at the garden party than most directors when I'm on a board.""

8. ""A CEO that wants a puppet board can still get one I'll put it that way."" — noting that executives can prevent their directors from questioning them by wasting their time.

9. ""The person who's going to be responsible for the assets and how they're managed over time is the CEO and you really want to hear from that person.""

10. ""The CEO absolutely owes that to the owners. I have a strong feeling that everybody's entitled to the same information."" — emphasizing that he aims to tell his shareholders everything he would tell his two sisters if the three of them were running the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL3RoZS1uZXRoZXJsYW5kcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1tYXJrZXQtc3R1ZHktaW50by1wbGF0Zm9ybS10by1idXNpbmVzcy1yZWd1bGF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Netherlands Launches Market Study Into Platform-To-Business Regulation,"The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) will launch a study into how online platform companies deal with the rules laid down in the Platform-to-Business Regulation (P2B Regulation) and into the problems that businesses that are active in this market encounter.

The P2B Regulation contains transparency obligations for online platform companies as well as rules for effective settlement of disputes. At the moment platform companies must already comply with the rules laid down in the regulation but efforts are currently underway to strengthen the enforcement thereof. The Dutch State Secretary for Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has drafted a bill which proposes to charge the ACM with enforcement of compliance with the rules laid down in this regulation.

The ACM will thus launch a market study in order to prepare itself for that future duty. The ACM expects to complete the first part of that study in the spring of 2022. The ACM will then decide whether or not it should provide more clarity regarding the rules laid down in the regulation.

“Online platforms play a key role in the economy where the process of digitalization is increasingly picking up steam” said Manon Leijten Member of the Board of the ACM. “Such platforms offer benefits for example because they allow businesses to serve their customers in an easy and efficient manner. As a result successful platform companies can also become very powerful. As regulator of the digital economy we remain vigilant that small businesses are protected against unfair commercial practices while also keeping in mind that innovation is sufficiently stimulated.”

JP Morgan’s record-sized silver bullion holding portends much higher prices ahead.

Also see 2017 hedge fund letters

This silver trade has taken about a half century to fully formulate. It started in earnest with US silver demonetization (1965) and the inception of the full fiat currency era (August 1971).

Since then there have been two $50 oz USD silver spikes (Jan 1980 & April 2011) various lawsuits and a few record size silver holders along the way.

Below are three of the largest silver bullion buying entities over the last 50 years.

The Hunt Brothers

1973 to 1980: 100 million ounces of Silver

Driven by price inflationary fears the Hunt Brothers amassed 100 million oz of physical silver bullion holdings. They combined their relatively safe bullion bet with outsized riskier trades using leveraged derivative betting on the COMEX silver futures contract exchange.

Source

By early 1980 the COMEX commodity futures exchange abruptly and temporarily changed silver futures contract trading rules (e.g. liquidation trading orders only). The Hunt Brothers and other long COMEX silver futures contract traders lost billions in the subsequent price collapse.

The Federal Reserve and a consortium of banks were forced to bailout the Hunt Brothers to a tune of $1 billion USD coupled with record high early 1980s interest rates. The Hunts were later tried and fined hundreds of millions of dollars in court as well as being openly scapegoated by the court of public opinion still to this very day.

Without price inflationary coincidence other commodities and precious metals like gold platinum and palladium also hit record high prices in early 1980 without market ‘cornering’ traders attached.

Warren Buffett Charlie Munger Berkshire Hathaway

1998 to 2006: 129.7 million ounces of Silver

Source

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) under the directive of Charlie Munger & Warren Buffett bought their then record sized 129.7 million ounce silver stack in 1998 only to sell later in 2006 allegedly to begin the underlying silver position of the still most popular silver ETF traded today (SLV).

JP Morgan (JPM) has been both an active SLV Authorized Participant (only one of a few financial institutions able to withdraw physical silver bullion bars for equity shares) as well they are the sole SLV Custodian since the exchange traded fund began in 2006.

JP Morgan

2011 / 2018: +132.1 million oz of Silver

This newest record silver bullion acquisition saga stretches its alleged start back to the Global Financial Crisis. In March 2008 Bear Stearns (a then large trader in silver futures derivatives) collapsed and was taken over by JP Morgan. A few years later JP Morgan began adding silver bullion to its COMEX coffers coincidentally following the near $50 oz price high of silver in April 2011.

This same firm whose namesake once testified before the US Congress over a century ago stating “Money is gold and nothing else” now has a record high 132.1 million ounces of physical silver in its COMEX warehouse inventory. Why?

Source

The start of JP Morgan’s COMEX silver bullion stacking began only a few months removed from outspoken financial commentator Max Keiser's November 2010 public plea to 'Buy Silver Crash JP Morgan’. This was broadcasted across the world on Russia Today (RT is funded in whole or in part by the Russian government).

As a quick aside the Russian Federation has been actively acquiring bullion heavily over this same timeframe. Here are their pictures to prove it.

Perhaps an early 2009 silver price of $9 oz to a 2011 spring $50 oz high gave JP Morgan a long silver trade idea which it has since acted upon?

Source

The COMEX is the most important price discovery mechanism for world silver prices. Even its parent company’s CEO is on record stating current bullion prices are too low.

Why does JP Morgan now hold over 50% of the total COMEX physical silver bullion holdings?

Maybe by acquiring large bullion positions JP Morgan is hedging higher ‘capital buffer requirements’ mandated by the BIS’ Financial Stability Board who explicitly cites JP Morgan as the most risk-laden global systemically important bank today (G-SIB). Perhaps it’s simpler than that mere future profits.

For years now hosts of silver market analysts have explicitly defamed JP Morgan’s activities in the world silver markets. They publically allege continued fraud and market manipulation by JP Morgan in silver without any defamation or libel lawsuits as repercussion (perhaps JP Morgan has discovery process fears). Regardless assertions remain that JP Morgan actively engages in a concentrated silver price suppression scheme (on the COMEX) whilst simultaneously acquiring physical silver bullion ounces on the cheap.

And not merely the current record 132.1 million ounces of silver that is transparently published in JP Morgan’s COMEX silver warehouse data (which could of course have their client interests attached) but also alleged are additional 100s of millions of more silver bullion ounces that have been withdrawn from SLV and potentially purchased through other sovereign silver bullion coin mint programs (specific estimates are as high as +675 million ounces in total).

Why allegedly acquire about 75% of a commodity’s annual global mine supply over a seven year timeframe if not for speculating on substantially higher prices in the medium to long term?

Source

Answers to these speculative questions will likely take years to play out. Yet the fact remains that JP Morgan now has a bigger silver bullion position than any long silver bullion buyer that has existed in the modern age.

With assistance from record size derivative trading this 21st Century secular bullion bull market is running about 2.5Xs the length of the last 1970s and 1980 version.

Source

We expect a 2020s mania phase likely peaking silver prices and bullion item values in terms of their real world goods and service buying powers.

Bullion’s current cyclical price downside appears to be rather limited at today’s paltry price points (i.e. low bullion values compared to today’s ‘everything bubble’ historic valuations).

This current JP Morgan silver stash saga is just one of the most intriguing bullish silver setups ongoing. But there’s trillions of other reasons to be long physical silver and other precious metal bullion products currently.

Total global debt levels have now risen +56% above their 2007 starting points (IIF & BIS data). Maybe a future combination of write off bankruptcies and currency debasement to service them.

The former head of BIS research is again ringing alarm bells calling for governments to step in to resolve the next financial crisis. Most will not hear or simply ignore him akin to his last warnings ahead of the 2008 Financial Crisis.

There is now over 1500 crypto currencies in existence. Which among these precious metal currency derivatives will endure throughout and beyond our lifetimes?

Even a bond portfolio manager at PIMCO recently called for a sudden $5000 oz USD gold price revaluation by the Federal Reserve to induce currency inflation to help ease debt and unfunded liability burdens.

Perhaps if we wait to see the answers it will be too late to act when they finally unfold.

Just like JP Morgan is actively doing. We suggest you do as they do. Buy silver bullion now.

The Sordid Story Behind the Schweppe Mansion in Illinois

Upon starting my Google search about the Schweppe Mansion located at 405 N Mayflower Rd. in Lake Forest Illinois I came across an article from onlyinyourstate.com titled ""13 Spine-Tingling Haunting Said To Be True In Illinois"". Here's what they had to say about the Schweppe Mansion;

This 24500-square foot mansion named Mayflower Place was an extravagant wedding present for Laura Shedd and her new husband Charles Schweppe. Tragic struck this couple not long after when Laura Schweppe died from a heart attack in 1937. In 1941 Charles was found dead in his bedroom from a gunshot wound to the head. His suicide note read “I’ve been awake all night. It’s terrible.

Ok so that's freaky right? Just wait there's more...

Get our free mobile app

An article on Patch.com says that after Laura Shedd and Charles Schweppe passed away this beautiful mansion sat vacant for nearly 50 years because rumors say Charles Schweppe demanded it to be so in his will. Schweppe's son-in-law finally sold the home to a couple in 1987 who did a massive restoration of the place but then got divorced 2 years later. (Did Laura Shedd and Charles Schweppe's ghosts make that happen?!?)

Schweppe Mansion was listed again in 2007 for $18 million dollars and sat on the market until it finally sold in 2020 for $8.5 million. I get that the mansion is beautiful but would you want to live here?

My uncle was visiting from Pakistan last week and he really wanted to try it. He enjoyed playing Beat Saber one of the top titles on our best VR games list but after he left back in the case it went.

But I recently downloaded Resident Evil 4 VR a virtual reality port of the 2005 classic. I grew up playing Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube as a kid and had fond memories of taking on the role of Leon Kennedy on a bizarre hunt for the president's daughter through a zombie infested village. Back then it was seen as a major hallmark for video game story telling. Now it's a bit cheesy. Either way the gameplay mechanics and world were deeply realized for the time and it's still considered by many including us as the best Resident Evil game.

And Currently there's a good deal on for Cyber Monday for the Oculus Quest 2 and that makes it now a great time to hunt down the VR headset.

Courtesy of Capcom I was provided a code of the game. Immediately Resident Evil VR felt familiar yet fresh. It was the same world I remembered with all the secret items and gold-dropping crows. But I felt immersed in it in a way that was beyond that of the squat CRT television in my parent's bedroom.

Simple actions of grabbing my gun from the side holster and sliding in a new clip of ammunition were weirdly satisfying. Grabbing the knife from the sheath strapped around my left pectoral and being able to toss that knife between each hand felt like more than a gimmick; it felt empowering — especially in a game where ammunition is limited and the enemies can be relentless. I'm sure from the outside I looked properly silly but in VR I was an action-movie hero.

Because VR needs to take very specific design considerations for game developers I'm in awe of how well Austin-based developer Armature Studio has brought the game over into a simulated 3D environment. Not only have many of the textures and graphics been revamped there are objects you can poke and prod and they'll react as they would in the real world.

For example when walking around villages there will be these crosses with skulls hanging off each arm. With my hand I can tap a skull and see it swing back and forth. It's a small detail like this — which Armature could have left alone — that gives the game that added layer of immersion.

In my playthrough I learned that there's skill involved in VR. When watching IGN's live gameplay video I was taken aback by all the unique moves the player was making while peeking around corners or running through hordes of enemies. It really showed the varying levels of freedom a player can take in Resident Evil 4 VR based solely on how much they themselves want to immerse themselves in it. A player can simply choose to point and shoot like using a television remote. Or the player can hold the handle of the gun with both hands for added stability making it feel more high stakes.

(Image credit: Capcom)

And I think that's part of the power Resident Evil 4 is bringing to the VR space. I'm sure that there are far more immersive VR titles one that were made from the ground-up with physical movements and motion controls in mind. But new franchises can be intimidating to new players. And Resident Evil 4 VR gives longtime gamers a comparative perspective.

Going through the comments in the IGN video linked above many were not only surprised at the way in which Resident Evil 4 VR was being played but how the experience was so unique from the GameCube original. The game from 2005 can give players a base context while the VR remake can put that context in a virtual reality framework. That contrast I feel can help lifelong gamers see the value in VR. I mean it certainly did for me.

I still plan on going through and finishing Resident Evil 4 VR even if I can only play for thirty minutes at a time before needing to take a break. But with rumors of a PS5 and Xbox Series X Resident Evil 4 remake percolating I can at least say for myself personally it won't have to live up to the original but rather this VR remake instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvaG9tZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2xlZC1sY2QtdnMtb2xlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LCD vs. OLED: TV display technologies compared,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cnet.com', port=443): Read timed out.

1. Metroid Dread

Unsurprisingly one of the best games for the Nintendo Switch OLED also happens to be one of the newest. Metroid Dread sees the return of Samus a character many may only know because of Smash Bros. It’s been a long time since we’ve had the pleasure of exploring alien worlds and vessels as her and the latest entry in the series is absolutely stunning. It’s also rather difficult but at least it’ll look pretty as you’re dying.

2. Ori and the Will of the Wisps

On the subject of dying a lot and also being pretty Ori and the Will of the Wisps is absolutely essential. This is the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest and it improves the gameplay across the board. It was already an astoundingly pretty game anyway which is something we could say about any of the games on this list. Ori is an adorable little forest creature who has to fight off less adorable forest creatures in order to save things. The story’s a lot better than our reductive explanation would suggest so just go and play it.

Breath of the Wild is the latest in a long line of Zelda games but it takes place in a massive open world that basically just drops you in it and then lets you figure it out from there. It’s also astoundingly beautiful in a way that’s hard to even comprehend.

7. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

It’s absurd to think that Mario Kart 8 was originally released back in 2014 on the Wii U and yet we’re still recommending it seven years later on an upgraded version of the new Nintendo console but here we are. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is another game that’s far better looking than really makes sense. It also happens to be some of the most fun you can have in multiplayer and the colors on tracks like Rainbow Road will have you enraptured.

A reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an inciting event responsible for neuropathology in many diseases including AMI [7]. Decreased brain oxygen and glucose supply as a result of inadequate CBF causes secondary brain injury including neuroinflammation oxidative stress and cell death [19 20]. Consistent with previous studies we found that cardiac I/R injury led to brain mitochondrial dysfunction BBB breakdown amyloid beta aggregation tau hyperphosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine loss [3 4 8 9]. In addition this is the first study to demonstrate that only apoptosis but not necroptosis or ferroptosis occurred in the hippocampus in rats with cardiac I/R injury.

Three different doses of apoptosis necroptosis and ferroptosis inhibitors were administered to the rats prior to cardiac ischemia. A pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD was selected as an apoptosis inhibitor. Although low-dose Z-VAD (1.65 mg/kg) reduced the myocardial infarct size it was inadequate to exert neuroprotection in our study. On the contrary medium- and high-dose Z-VAD attenuated dendritic spine loss possibly via reducing tau hyperphosphorylation. Although high-dose Z-VAD effectively reduced BACE1 it failed to reduce Aβ aggregation possibly resulted from Z-VAD cytotoxicity. This finding might explain a lower efficacy in attenuating dendritic spine loss by high-dose Z-VAD when compared with medium-dose Z-VAD as several studies showed that the fluoromenthylketone compound of Z-VAD is cytotoxic when converted to fluoroacetate [21 22]. Collectively we have shown that an optimal dose of Z-VAD-FMK is required to exhibit the neuroprotection against cardiac I/R injury-induced brain damage. Our data suggested that medium-dose Z-VAD provided the best efficacy in reducing brain damage.

The medium-dose Z-VAD not only suppressed apoptosis but also reduced brain mitochondrial ROS levels and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Aβ plaque which is a product of BACE1-mediated APP cleavage and tau tangle are hallmarks of AD pathology [23]. Our data found that medium-dose Z-VAD also reduced tau hyperphosphorylation BACE1 levels and Aβ aggregation resulting in a higher efficacy in attenuating dendritic spine loss. Additionally medium-dose Z-VAD reduced lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis as shown by decreased ACSL4 levels. Our results showed that zVAD.fmk effectively blocked caspase-3 cleavage when we administered at the dose of 3.3 mg/kg. However lower dose (1.65 mg/kg) and higher dose (6.6 mg/kg) of zVAD.fmk did not block caspase-3 cleavage. We speculate that 1.65 mg/kg of zVAD.fmk was insufficient to inhibit caspase activity. For a high dose of zVAD.fmk our data were consistent with a previous study; they demonstrated that zVAD.fmk treatment at 10 and 20 mg/kg did not reduce caspase-3 activity in pneumovirus-infected mice [24]. Therefore we implied that the effective dose of zVAD.fmk is ranging between 2 and 6 mg/kg when it was given peripherally. This speculation was supported by the data from previous studies which suggested that treatment with zVAD.fmk at 2 and 5.6 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection decreased caspase-3 activity resulting in reduced brain edema and improved neurological function in rats with focal cerebral I/R injury and rats with subarachnoid hemorrhage [25 26]. Apoptosis has been shown to occur following the Bax-mediated mitochondrial membrane permeabilization subsequent cytochrome-c (cyt-c) release and caspase-3 activation [27]. zVAD is a pan-caspase inhibitor which irreversibly binds to the catalytic site of caspases leading to the suppression of caspase activity [22]. In addition several studies demonstrated that zVAD could directly act upon Bax by inhibiting its activity or expression [28 29]. Moreover pretreatment with zVAD was shown to reduce the Bax expression in Chikungunya-infected HeLa cells [29]. These data supported our findings that zVAD could effectively reduce Bax as well as caspase-3 expression leading to an attenuation of brain apoptosis in rats with cardiac I/R injury.

Nec-1 is a potent allosteric inhibitor of RIPK1 kinase activity [13]. It also inhibits indoleamine-23-dioxygenase (IDO) which is an enzyme involved in immunomodulatory function [10 30]. Previous studies revealed that IDO is associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration through a modulation of kynurenine metabolism quinolinic acid contributing to cognitive impairment [31 32]. In our study all doses of Nec-1 failed to reduce myocardial infarction size. Moreover it had no effect on RIPK1 RIPK3 or MLKL signaling in the brain despite its neuroprotective benefits following cardiac I/R injury. Thus we speculated that the favorable effects of Nec-1 in our study are mediated through RIPK1-independent pathway.

Among three different doses of Nec-1 low-dose Nec-1 could provide neuroprotection. Low-dose Nec-1 effectively reduced apoptosis tau hyperphosphorylation BACE1 levels and Aβ aggregation and preserved BBB tight junction protein leading to attenuated dendritic spine loss. Although medium-to-high-dose Nec-1 showed similar effects to low dose they could not suppress tau hyperphosphorylation. The association between Nec-1 and apoptosis is controversial [13]. Our findings are consistent with the previous study showing that Nec-1 increased hippocampal Bcl-2 and decreased hippocampal cleaved caspase-3 in mice with traumatic brain injury [15]. We also found that Nec-1 did not suppress p-RIPK1 p-RIPK3 and p-MLKL in rat’s brain with cardiac I/R injury since these three proteins were not upregulated in the brain following cardiac I/R injury and Nec-1 did not disturb the physiological function of these proteins [17 33]. Therefore the protein expression of p-RIPK1/RIPK1 p-RIPK3/RIPK3 and p-MLKL/MLKL were not modified by Nec-1 treatment in our study. We speculated that the anti-apoptotic effects of Nec-1 are attributable to its neuroprotection in rats with cardiac I/R injury; however the exact mechanism remains to be clarified.

Fer-1 attenuated the dendritic spine loss through a different mechanism from Z-VAD and Nec-1. Medium-to-high-dose Fer-1 inhibited ACSL4 protein levels without affecting apoptotic protein levels. ACSL4 a contributing enzyme of ferroptosis esterifies free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into PUFA-CoA a key substrate for lipid peroxidation [34]. ACSL4 is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus compared to other areas of the brain [35 36]. Previous study reported that ACSL4 plays an important role in dendritic spine architecture [37]. It affects axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and inhibits synaptic growth by altered lipids [383940]. Redox-responsive transcription factor sp1 which is dysregulated in AD and cerebral ischemia reportedly upregulates the expression of ACSL4 by directly binding to the ACSL4 regulatory region [41424344]. In our study low-dose Fer-1 did not reduce dendritic spine loss although it suppressed AD-related proteins and tau hyperphosphorylation. On the contrary dendritic spine was preserved by medium-to-high-dose Fer-1 in addition to decreased ACSL4 protein levels. This implicated that Fer-1 prevented brain damage through a suppression of ACSL4 and ferroptosis.

In addition Bax and Bcl-2 are potentially central regulators of apoptosis necroptosis and ferroptosis as they serve as crosstalk between these cell death pathways [45464748]. Our data showed that Bax/Bcl-2 was remarkably decreased by all cell death inhibitors and might involve in neuroprotection following cardiac I/R injury.

The penetrability of each cell death inhibitor across the BBB should also be considered for their neuroprotection. Z-VAD and Fer-1 poorly cross the BBB in animal studies [49 50]. In our study although low-dose Fer-1 reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ aggregation it could not reduce dendritic spine loss and low-dose Z-VAD did not exert neuroprotection. On the other hand Nec-1 was able to penetrate through BBB [51 52] thus Nec-1 could reduce brain damage independent of cardiac effect.

In this study the following antibodies that we used in the western blot analysis are polyclonal antibodies: APP claudin5 TNF-α occludin p-RIPK1 MLKL p-MLKL Bcl-2 BACE1; monoclonal antibody should be considered to use in the future study to warrant our findings.

In conclusion cell death inhibitors attenuated hippocampal dendritic spine loss caused by cardiac I/R injury through different mechanisms. Z-VAD promoted neuroprotection via ameliorating apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nec-1 preserved BBB proteins and also reduced apoptosis an effect that is beyond its RIPK1 inhibition while Fer-1 suppressed ACSL4. All treatment effectively reduced AD-related proteins and tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain following cardiac I/R injury. Considering clinical significance in acute MI treatment cell death inhibitor administration during ischemia or at the onset of reperfusion is more clinically relevant. Therefore the effects of cell death inhibitors given during ischemia or at the onset of reperfusion should be further investigated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDE5LTAyMS0wNDI3OS0y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Triple-negative breast cancer cells rely on kinase-independent functions of CDK8 to evade NK-cell-mediated tumor ...,"CDK8 promotes regrowth of tumors and distant metastasis formation

To study the role of CDK8 in TNBC we used shRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK8 in murine TNBC E0771 cells [21]. Immunoblotting confirmed the decreased CDK8 levels with two different hairpins to a varying extent (shCdk8–1 and shCdk8–2) (Fig. 1A). We did not detect any changes in proliferation (Fig. 1B) cell cycle distribution (Supplementary Fig. S1A) or survival upon CDK8 knockdown in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

Fig. 1: CDK8 supports the regrowth of tumors and distant metastasis formation. A TNBC E0771 cells were stably infected with a CMV-Firefly Luciferase construct and subsequently with two different CDK8-targeting shRNAs (shCdk8–1 and −2) or a control shRNA (cntrl) and the expression of CDK8 and GAPDH was analyzed by western blot. B Proliferation of E0771 cell lines infected with shCdk8–1 shCdk8–2 and the control cell line was assessed on day 3 5 and 7 by flow cytometry. Symbols and error bars represent cell numbers in mean ± SEM of n = 3 technical replicates. C Experimental setup of experiments from (D–G) is shown. Rag2−/−γc−/− mice were orthotopically transplanted with E0771 control shCdk8–1 or shCdk8–2 cells (in independent experiments) and monitored for primary tumor growth. Tumors were surgically removed and regrowth and distant metastasis of tumor cells was monitored with in vivo imaging. D Primary tumor growth of control vs. shCdk8-1 or shCdk8-2 implanted mice and E tumor weight of mice at operation. Symbols and error bars represent tumor area (mm2) in mean ± SEM.

Full size image

To study primary tumor growth and metastasis formation in vivo we used a well-established orthotopic breast cancer model [22] and transplanted Luciferase-expressing E0771 cells into the mammary fat pad of immunocompromised recombination activating gene 2 and interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain double knockout (Rag2−/−yc−/−) mice. When the primary tumor reached an area of 75 mm2 it was surgically removed and we followed disease progression by live imaging (Fig. 1C). In accordance with the unaltered cell proliferation in vitro we did not observe any significant difference in primary tumor growth and weight irrespective of the expression of CDK8 (Fig. 1D E). Persistent knockdown of CDK8 was confirmed in lysates from primary tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2A). CDK8-expressing cells gave rise to increasing Luciferase signals from day 9 to 15 post surgery at the site of injection indicative of the regrowth of the tumor. In contrast no Luciferase signals were detectable in mice that had received shCdk8–1 or shCdk8–2 knockdown cells (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S2B). At day 15 post surgery the animals were sacrificed and analyzed for lung metastasis. Substantial metastatic spreading to the lungs had occurred upon injection with wild-type E0771 cells while lung metastasis was significantly reduced in the absence of CDK8 (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig. S2C D). This led us to conclude that tumor-intrinsic CDK8 promotes regrowth of tumors and distant metastasis formation in the orthotopic TNBC mouse model.

Metastasis-related genes are deregulated upon CDK8 knockdown

To gain insights into how CDK8 promotes the metastatic potential of murine TNBC we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and compared gene expression of E0771 control (cntrl) shCdk8–1 and shCdk8–2 cells. We included cntrl cells treated with the CDK8/CDK19 inhibitor Senexin B (SnxB) in the experimental setting. The efficiency of the SnxB treatment was confirmed by analyzing the CDK8 kinase substrate pSTAT1-S727 [9] by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S3A). We identified 887 genes that were deregulated upon CDK8 knockdown by both shRNAs whereas CDK8/CDK19 kinase inhibition by SnxB treatment resulted in only 25 deregulated genes (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3B C). Only nine genes were commonly deregulated by both CDK8 knockdowns and SnxB (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Differentially regulated genes between cntrl and shCdk8 cells included metastasis-related genes. We validated the downregulation of snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (Snai2) matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp9) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (Ccl2) in shCdk8 compared to cntrl cells while expression of these genes was unaltered upon SnxB treatment (Fig. 2B). Besides qPCR in cell lines we validated the altered expression of Snai2 and Mmp9 in cells derived from primary tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Thus we conclude that CDK8 is a crucial driver of metastasis in TNBC.

CDK8 knockdown enhances NK-cell-mediated killing of TNBC cells in vitro

We used KEGG to identify pathways deregulated by CDK8 knockdown which revealed “Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity” among the top hits (Fig. 2C). This included 19 deregulated genes (7 genes upregulated 12 genes downregulated) upon CDK8 knockdown which was not mimicked by CDK8/CDK19 kinase inhibition upon SnxB treatment (Fig. 3A). NK cells are innate lymphoid cells that have been implicated in preventing metastatic outgrowth [11 232425]. NK-cell activity is regulated by activating and inhibitory ligands on the surface of target cells [26 27]. Self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules represent the most important inhibitory ligands that allow the discrimination of “self” and “missing self” [28]. CDK8 loss was associated with reduced expression of the MHC I genes H2-K1 and H2-D1 (Fig. 3A) which was validated by flow cytometry (Fig. 3B). We also confirmed the reduced protein levels of the activating natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligand ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) and upregulation of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in CDK8-deficient cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 3C D). No changes in MHC I and RAE1 expression were detected upon SnxB treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Our transcriptome analysis of CDK8-deficient E0771 cells also revealed diminished expression of Cd274 encoding for PD-L1—a ligand of PD-1 and an important immune checkpoint protein. We confirmed the reduced expression of PD-L1 on protein level upon loss of CDK8 in E0771 cells (Fig. 3E).

Fig. 3: Loss of CDK8 enhances TNBC’s visibility to NK cells. A Heatmap of differentially expressed genes between untreated or Senexin B-treated E0771 control cells and shCdk8-1 or shCdk8-2 cell lines in the KEGG pathway “Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity” (RNA sequencing data; n = 3 replicates). B–E Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and representative histograms of (B) MHC I (H-2K + H-2D) (C) RAE1 (pan) (D) ICAM-1 and (E) CD274 (PD-L1) expression of E0771 control shCdk8-1 and shCdk8-2 cells; expression levels of NK ligands were analyzed by flow cytometry. Bar graphs represent technical triplicates (mean ± SEM). F IL-2-expanded C57BL/6 NK cells were incubated for 4 h with CFSE-labeled E0771 control or shCdk8-1/shCdk8-2 tumor cells in effector:target (E:T) ratio of 10:1 5:1 and 1:1. The specific killing was assessed by flow cytometry. One representative experiment out of two to three independent experiments is shown. Symbols and error bars represent mean ± SEM of technical duplicates. Full size image

These data point to CDK8 as a regulator of NK-cell-mediated recognition of TNBC cells. We thus performed in vitro cytotoxicity assays with IL-2-expanded splenic NK cells. E0771 cell lines were more susceptible to NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity upon CDK8 knockdown (Fig. 3F) whereas no changes in NK-cell-mediated killing of E0771 cells were detected upon CDK8/CDK19 kinase inhibition as observed by treating E0771 cell lines with SnxB for 48 h (Supplementary Fig. S4C). This led us to conclude that CDK8 in TNBC cells blocks NK-cell-mediated tumor recognition in a kinase-independent manner.

Loss of CDK8 in TNBC increases NK-cell-mediated tumor surveillance in vivo

To address the relevance of CDK8 in NK-cell-mediated recognition in an in vivo setting we orthotopically injected CDK8-deficient and wild-type tumor cells into recombination activating gene 2 knockout (Rag2−/−) mice that rely on NK cells for tumor surveillance but lack T and B cells (Fig. 4A). Primary tumor growth was significantly delayed in mice transplanted with CDK8-knockdown cells (Fig. 4B) indicating an enhanced NK-cell-mediated tumor surveillance of the primary tumor. Surgical removal of the primary tumor was consistently performed at a tumor size of 75 mm2 (Fig. 4A) and the persistent knockdown of CDK8 was confirmed (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Tumor weight (Supplementary Fig. S5B) and the numbers of tumor-infiltrating NK cells (Fig. 4C) were comparable at the day of operation. In contrast to Rag2−/−yc−/− mice no re-growing of the tumors post-surgery at the site of injection was observed in Rag2−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. S5C).

Fig. 4: Loss of CDK8 in TNBC enhances NK-cell-mediated tumor surveillance. A Experimental setup of data shown in (B–E). Rag2−/− mice were orthotopically transplanted with E0771 control shCdk8-1 or shCdk8-2 cells (in independent experiments) and monitored for primary tumor growth. Tumors were surgically removed and regrowth and distant metastasis formation of tumor cells was monitored with in vivo imaging. B In vivo primary tumor growth for control vs. shCdk8-1 or shCdk8-2 E0771 cells in the left and right panel respectively. C Total infiltrating NK-cell numbers (CD45+NK1.1+NKp46+) of digested primary tumors at day of surgery. D Radiance signals of lungs ex vivo measured by an in vivo-imaging system and representative pictures of lungs (lower panel) at the end of the experiment (day 23 post surgery). E Total numbers of infiltrating NK cells (CD45+NK1.1+NKp46+) of lung lysates were assessed. Symbols and error bars represent mean ± SEM (n = 4–9 mice per group). Full size image

At day 23 post surgery all mice were imaged sacrificed and analyzed for lung metastasis (Fig. 4A). In line with a role of NK cells in recognizing TNBC cells radiance signals as a readout for lung metastasis were generally lower in Rag2−/− compared to Rag2−/−yc−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. S5D). These data confirm that NK cells are able to recognize and eliminate the metastatic spread of TNBC cells. The knockdown of CDK8 enhanced this effect; lung metastasis in Rag2−/− mice were almost absent upon transplantation with CDK8-knockdown tumors (Fig. 4D). The numbers of infiltrating NK cells were comparable between lungs of shCdk8–1 knockdown and control transplanted mice; however there was a significant decrease in NK-cell numbers in the lungs of mice transplanted with shCdk8–2 knockdown cells (Fig. 4E). In line with the altered metastasis formation we found that the lung weights were elevated in control mice yet not reaching significance (Supplementary Fig. S5E).

To confirm that NK cells are the key players for tumor control of CDK8-deficient E0771 cells in Rag2−/− mice we performed depletion experiments using an αNK1.1 antibody. Mice were treated three times with the depletion antibody prior to tumor-cell implantation and subsequently treated twice a week (Fig. 5A). The successful depletion of CD3−NKp46+ cells was confirmed (Supplementary Fig. S5F). Again in the control setting CDK8-knockdown tumors grew significantly slower in Rag2-deficient mice. This difference was lost upon depletion of NK cells (Fig. 5B C) unequivocally assigning the differences to NK-cell-mediated tumor surveillance.

Fig. 5: NK-cell depletion allows outgrowth of CDK8-deficient TNBC tumor cells. A Experimental setup of data shown in (B C). Rag2−/− mice were NK-cell depleted by i.p. injections of an αNK1.1 antibody (200 µg/mouse) three times prior to implantation of E0771 control or shCdk8-2 cells and subsequently twice per week. B Primary tumor growth of control vs. shCdk8-2 E0771 cells of mice treated with αNK1.1 antibody (PBS injection served as control). Symbols and error bars represent tumor size (mm2) in mean ± SEM. C Tumor weight of mice at day 15 after tumor implantation at the endpoint of the experiment ±SEM (n = 4 mice per group). Full size image

In summary these data define a role of tumor-cell-intrinsic CDK8 as an immune checkpoint controlling NK-cell-mediated tumor recognition. Expression of CDK8 in E0771 cells facilitates evasion from NK-cell surveillance validating the RNA-seq-based pathway analysis.

CDK8 contributes to IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression

The inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 axis has recently also been implicated in the regulation of NK-cell cytotoxicity besides its important effects on cytotoxic T cells [293031]. RNA-seq data indicated that PD-L1 (Cd274) expression is significantly impaired in E0771 cells upon CDK8 knockdown. We validated this finding on protein level by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3E). PD-L1 is regulated by interferon-γ (IFNγ) signaling and displays interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) binding at its promoter as described in melanoma cells and other cancer entities [32]. As CDK8 has been reported to act downstream of IFNγ we stimulated E0771 cell lines with 100 U/ml IFNγ for 48 h and analyzed PD-L1 surface levels. E0771 cells significantly induced PD-L1 levels upon IFNγ treatment which is impaired in E0771 shCdk8–1 and shCdk8–2 knockdown cells (Fig. 6A). These data suggest that regulation of PD-L1 by CDK8 might partially involve the IFNγ signaling pathway.

A Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PD-L1 expression of E0771 control shCdk8-1 and shCdk8-2 cells cultivated with or without 100 U/ml IFNγ for 48 h (indicated by “−” and “+” on the bottom of the graph); analyzed by flow cytometry. One representative experiment out of two is shown. Symbols and error bars represent mean ± SEM of technical duplicates. B C Patient data from the TCGA database were sub-grouped in TNBC patients (n = 113) and analyzed for (B) overall survival comparing CDK8-high- and CDK8-low-expressing patients and (C) correlation between CDK8 and PD-L1 expression in this human dataset of TNBC patients.

CDK8 correlates with PD-L1 expression and survival in TNBC patients

To explore the human relevance of our findings we analyzed publicly available data from large cohorts of breast cancer patients sub-filtered for TNBC patients (n = 113; The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing data). In accordance with previous studies focusing on breast cancer patients with molecular subtypes luminal A and B basal and HER2+ [5] we extended the link of CDK8 expression to overall survival to a selected TNBC patient cohort (Fig. 6B). Analysis of correlations of CDK8 with genes identified by RNA sequencing of E0771 cells showed a significant association of CDK8 with PD-L1 in TNBC patients (Fig. 6C). These findings support the detrimental role of CDK8 in TNBC patients and link it to PD-L1 levels as potential immune evasion mechanism.",,,,,,,,,

Taken on by First Boston as a bond trader Fink proved “a rare talent” and within a decade had become the youngest managing director in First Boston’s history. “My team and I felt like rock stars” he later recalled. The sky seemed the limit.

But then it all came crashing down. In 1986 Fink’s desk suddenly lost $100m when interest rates unexpectedly fell. “He went from CEO-in-waiting” to “outcast” overnight.

The making of a legend

The episode was a key staging post in Fink’s journey to become the undisputed “king of Wall Street” when he built BlackRock – “the biggest money manager the planet has ever seen” with almost $10trn under management. To put that in context “it is roughly equivalent to the entire global hedge-fund private-equity and venture-capital industries combined”.

One of the biggest shareholders in virtually every major company in America – and quite a few internationally – BlackRock is also one of the biggest lenders to companies and governments around the world.

Born in 1952 Fink was raised in Van Nuys California going on to complete a political theory degree and then his MBA at UCLA. He quickly emerged as “something of a legend on Wall Street”: credited along with Lew Ranieri of Salomon Brothers with transforming bonds from “a sleepy backwater” into a multi-trillion debt-securitisation market says Vanity Fair.

Fink’s particular expertise was mortgage-backed securities. After leaving First Boston in disgrace he began a new venture bankrolled and housed by Blackstone – a rising star of the private-equity industry. When the two companies “divorced” in 1994 BlackRock was born.

Fink now 68 has always chafed at being listed among “the big swinging dicks” immortalised in Michael Lewis’s account of the origins of the financial crisis Liar’s Poker. He attributes the characterisation to “the snobbery of Wall Street’s Wasp investment bankers who looked down on Jewish and Italian traders who were allowed to succeed in the mortgage-bond business only”.

But if his innovations eventually brought “the economy to its knees” BlackRock profited mightily from the clean-up – emerging as “the financial fulcrum of Washington and Wall Street” says Vanity Fair. Who else after all was better placed to advise on analysing toxic securities?

The purchase of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 with its “mountain” of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) propelled BlackRock to the front of the equities world says Fortune. Indeed Fink has “supercharged” the world of passive index funds says the FT. “BlackRock has in effect done for investing what Henry Ford did for the car constructing a financial assembly line that churns out products for investors more efficiently than virtually anyone else.” Alongside Vanguard Fink’s firm now enjoys a virtual “duopoly”.

A sea change in the industry

When Fink announced early last year that BlackRock would put sustainability at the heart of all its investment decisions it was seen as a sea-change for the finance industry. Critics accuse him of “greenwashing” and worry about the concentration of power in one firm.

To some critics BlackRock is “the new Goldman Sachs” says the FT and that puts Fink in the cross-hairs of agitators and reformers who argue the firm is too big to fail. But “barring an epic shift in the political or financial winds” it’s hard to see what could throw BlackRock’s growth. Fink’s reign “at the top of the financial ecosystem” shows no sign of ending.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Nwb3J0L2dhYS9hcmlkLTQwNzI4NjUxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cork Premier SHC: Alan Connolly's brace of goals see Blackrock to semi-final,"Blackrock 3-16 Douglas 1-12

Reigning champions Blackrock advanced to the semi-final of the Co-Op Superstores Cork Premier SHC at Páirc Uí Chaoimh on Sunday. They proved too strong for 14-man Douglas Alan Connolly’s brace of goals - one in either half - and a third Blackrock goal from Robbie Cotter three minutes from time the key scores.

The sending off of Douglas midfielder Brian Hartnett in first-half stoppage was decisive too.

There were two changes on the Douglas team for this city derby - Nathan Walsh and Diarmuid O’Mahony (injured) replaced by Mark Howell and Shane Donegan.

The wind blew into the Blackrock end aiding Douglas in the first-half.

However the opening point came from Blackrock’s John O’Sullivan. It was wiped out by a Shane Kingston free - both players performing full-forward roles. Cotter made it two points to one for the Rockies.

Gathering momentum and in spite of their growing wides tally Douglas fired the next four points through Mark O’Connor (2) Brian Hartnett and Alan Cadogan to lead at the first water-break 0-5 to 0-2.

Blackrock bounced back in the second quarter. Connolly and Cillian O’Donovan exchanged white flags but 1-3 without reply for the Rockies put them in the ascendancy - the goal came after Mark Harrington went down injured but Connolly kept going to billow the net.

A big turning point arrived in the second minute of first-half stoppage with Douglas reduced to 14 men when Brian Hartnett received a straight red card. Shane Kingston pulled a point back for them following a foul on Eoin Dolan.

Blackrock 1-6 to 0-7 in front at the interval.

A positive start to the second-half saw Fergal Ryan's men move further ahead. A goal and five points to four points they outscored Douglas in the third quarter Connolly raised the green flag in the 35th minute for them to go two goals clear 2-11 to 0-11 at the second water-break.

It was hard to see a way back for Douglas despite a late goal from Brian Turnbull. Cotter’s goal in the 57th minute secured a winning margin of 10-points.

Scorers for Blackrock: A Connolly (2-3 0-3 frees) R Cotter (1-2) M O’Halloran (0-4) M O’Keeffe and S O’Keeffe (0-2 each) J O’Sullivan N Cashman and S Murphy (0-1 each).

The monument currently sits on a median in between four lanes of heavy traffic on Bridge Street at the foot of the Victoria Bridge. The only safe way for pedestrians to view the rock is from across the street.

“We commit to move Bridge Street in order to make a big beautiful park a Black Rock that is no longer surrounded by lanes of traffic” said city councillor Craig Sauvé who represents Saint-Henri — Little-Burgundy — Pointe-Saint-Charles.

In the plans Bridge Street would be moved east. The proposed park starts at Des Irlandais street and continues north for about a block. Those involved tell Global News the park will be close to 4.3 acres.

“We won’t have to move the rock with this scenario” said Sauvé.

Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email as it happens.

Victor Boyle the director of the Montreal Irish Memorial Park Foundation along with other members of the Irish community have been fighting to move Bridge Street for decades.

He tells Global News that he is happy the plan makes the Black Rock more accessible for pedestrians. More importantly Boyle said it respects the thousands of Irish buried in the area near the boulder.

The three-meter-tall boulder known as the Black Rock honours the 6000 Irish immigrants that died from typhus upon arriving in Montreal in 1847.

“It helps preserve the integrity of the cemetery. It’s not just a showpiece. It’s to protect the 6000 bodies and people that are buried beneath us” said Boyle.

Boyle said the park would also be a way to share the story of 1847 when residents came together to care for the sick immigrants during the typhus epidemic.

“I think it’s a story that demonstrates some of the values of Montreal — that solidarity generosity welcoming of new arrival the immigrants to Montreal. It’s a beautiful story to tell. It’s an important story” said Sauvé.

In January 2020 the current administration told members of the Irish community that the city aims to create a memorial park. Now it’s an electoral promise and construction will only start in 2025.

Sauvé told Global News that “during the past four years a lot of work’s been done” adding that the project has moved forward with the help of a committee that includes members of the Irish community the city and Hydro Quebec which owns a majority of the land.

The announcement’s timing doesn’t bother Boyle. He said “the fact that they made the announcement close to an election as far as I’m concerned is not an issue as much as the fact that we are where we are and we will continue to move forward.”

Global News contacted Ensemble Montreal and Mouvement Montreal for comment. We did not receive a reply by deadline.

With the luck of the Irish on their side Boyle said the community is committed to seeing the project through no matter who wins the municipal election.

“I know we’re in a spot now where this is definitely definitely going to happen” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Nwb3J0L2dhYS9hcmlkLTQwNzI3OTA0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cork GAA previews: Hurling championships reach knock-out stages,"SATURDAY

The second successive season these two are meeting at the quarter-final stage the Rockies triumphing on a 1-22 to 0-20 scoreline last year. Douglas’ inability to find the net that day has continued into 2021 with not a single goal scored across their three group outings. And given their forward unit contains Alan Cadogan Shane Kingston and Brian Turnbull that almost unforgivable stat has to change tomorrow. The Rockies were so impressive when comfortably coming through their must-win game against the Barrs Fergal Ryan’s charges appear to have timed their run to near perfection.

FRESNO Calif. (KFSN) -- The Fresno Mission's new campus will offer more than just a safe place to call home.

""We want to give the absolute best to the people who sometimes feel like the least"" says CEO Matt Dildine.

Dildine unveiled plans Friday to turn the former Sierra Hospital along Dakota Avenue into a shared campus that will serve as a ""one-stop-shop"" city center for those who may be experiencing life insecurity related to a lack of housing hunger or trauma.

Officials say the build will be like no other homeless and poverty outreach project on the West Coast.

""Everything about this place is designed so when the second someone comes in they immediately begin to feel different about themselves and valued because we have given them a property they have not seen before and it's specific to them"" Dildine said.

The new state-of-the-art campus will offer residential housing for nearly 80 families and include a health care center charter school restaurant and coffee shop with office space for 20 additional non-profits including the Central California Food Bank.

""When this campus opens we will unveil a 3000 square foot grocery store"" says Kim Dildine.

Fresno Mayor Jerry Dyer is throwing his support behind the project after getting a tour of the facilities.

""We're going to do everything we can to expedite all the things that are going to occur on this campus because we have a tremendous need"" he said.

The mission will continue to maintain a presence downtown but officials say this expansion and any other future endeavors will all happen at other locations.

""Seventy-five percent of the homeless population doesn't want to go downtown because of the perception of safety and how it looks and some of those types of things"" Matt said. ""Just like in any business you would never invest in a neighborhood where 75% of your client base didn't want to go.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEwLTI1L2NhbmRlcmVsLWxlZC1ncm91cC10by10YWtlLWNvbWluYXItcmVpdC1wcml2YXRlLWZvci0xLTgtYmlsbGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canderel-Led Group to Take Cominar REIT Private For $1.8 Billion,"Why did this happen?

On Oct. 24 2021 Cominar Real Estate Investment Trust (Cominar or the REIT) (TSX: CUF.UN) announced it has entered into an arrangement agreement for acquisition by Iris Acquisition II LP (the Purchaser). The Purchaser is an entity created by a consortium led by Canderel Real Estate Property Inc.

The ill-fated spacecraft is still under investigation by NASA after a value issue necessitated the scrubbing of an uncrewed test flight in August this year. That test flight was then postponed until 2022 but NASA and Boeing officials say they are working on identifying the underlying cause of the issue.

The problem with the valves on board the Starliner may have been caused by humidity in the launch region according to Michelle Parker chief engineer of Space and Launch at Boeing and Steve Stich manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew program. The Starliner was due to launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida but the state’s famously humid air may have caused corrosion to the valves which caused them to stick in place leading to the errors.

To fix this problem Boeing could install heaters in the valve system and add desiccant material to soak up any excess moisture. Boeing officials say this should fix the majority of the valves and get them working in time for the test flight next year.

Boeing expressed confidence that the capsule would fly safely however the development process is already four years behind schedule and has been plagued by difficulties — including serious issues which could have led to the destruction of the craft during a previous uncrewed test flight. The current aim is to perform the next uncrewed test flight in the first half of 2022.

NASA has also rearranged the crews who were intended to fly on the Starliner’s first crewed test flight and operational mission. Astronauts Nicole Mann who was scheduled to be on the first Starliner crewed test flight and Josh Cassada who will be heading to the International Space Station for a stint there will now be traveling on the SpaceX Crew Dragon mission Crew-5 instead of the Boeing Starliner.

The earliest crewed test flight of the Starliner may go ahead in late 2022 if the uncrewed test flight goes well with operational flights aiming to begin in 2023.

→ Avianca will resume flights between Lima and Bogota in December.

“One of Avianca’s strategic objectives is to simplify its fleet and increase efficiency; the selection of the 787-8 as the only aircraft type for long-haul flights is a relevant step towards this goal. Thanks to the openness and constructive dialogues with Boeing Rolls-Royce lessors and financial institutions we are proud to confirm that we will continue to operate the Dreamliner an exceptional aircraft that given its capabilities features efficiency and comfort is the best for our company and our customers. We look forward to maintaining our business cabin seating targeting business customers while redesigning the rest of the aircraft with state-of-the-art seating over the next 18 months” said Rohit Philip Avianca’s Chief Financial Officer.

→ From Medellin: Avianca announces new route to San Andres and reactivates operations to Bucaramanga.

These are the main benefits of the 787-8 as the only wide-body passenger aircraft in Avianca’s operation:

Future-proof: It remains a state-of-the-art aircraft that provides a long-term solution for your fleet’s long-range flight needs. Passenger comfort: The 787’s design provides better cabin pressurization levels and less dry air enhancing the long-haul experience. Smaller environmental footprint: the Dreamliner’s technology enables it to achieve greater range while consuming 20% less fuel and generating significantly reduced CO2 emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft. Improved financial performance: the aircraft provides superior cargo capacity greater fuel efficiency and more seats improving the contribution of the widebody fleet to the airline’s bottom line.

“We would like to thank Avianca for its continued commitment to the 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft and its leading-edge economic and environmental performance will serve Avianca well as it grows during the market recovery ahead” said Ricardo Cavero Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ vice president of sales for Latin America and the Caribbean.

Pfc. Ronald Leo and Eileen Fahey. The 20 year old honey-blonde girl a secretary for the American Physical Society was slain by a tall slender man who fired six shots as she was reading one of Ronald’s letters.

She had just started her workday in the 9th floor American Physical Society office on Columbia University’s campus in Manhattan.

At 9:20 a.m. on July 14 1952 students teachers and employees heard six cracks the unmistakable sound of gunfire.

Moments later a tall thin man with dark hair about 30 strode out of the office a smoking gun in his hand.

“You better call the police because I just shot somebody. You better call a doctor. I just shot a female” he told a cleaning woman and another APS secretary.

Then he walked to the end of the hallway and disappeared down a staircase.

The body of Eileen Fahey 20 is carried from the Pupin Building on the Columbia University campus at 120th St. off Broadway.

Fahey lay dead on the floor shot several times in the chest. One letter from her fiancé was found opened and crumpled under her body. Two other letters from him were on the desk unopened.

“We have no idea what this is all about” NYPD Deputy Chief Inspector James Leggett told the Daily News. “All we have at present is that somebody shot and killed her. We have no motive.”

Everyone who knew Fahey said she was a wonderful girl with a good reputation. She lived with her parents brother and sister.

Police explored a connection to an earlier family tragedy. In 1947 Eileen’s brother Francis Jr. was killed in a gang fight. The killer had recently been paroled but he did not fit the shooter’s description could prove he was somewhere else at the time and was cleared in about 15 minutes.

This conception of Eileen Fahey’s killer drawn by Daily News artist Steven R. Kidd and based on description of those who saw him was credited as being instrumental in making an arrest in the case.

A sketch by a Daily News staff artist provided a break in the case. The image sparked a memory in a Columbia physics professor who said it looked like a former student — Bayard Pfundtner Peakes 29.

NYC police quickly tracked Peakes down to a furnished room in Boston. He was not there at the time but they searched the room and found the murder weapon in a suitcase.

They were waiting when he arrived home around midnight.

“You got me. I’m the one who killed her” he told them.

Peakes posed for photographers as detectives escorted him onto a train in Boston.

Bayard Peakes (center).

“Yes” he said. “I’m the naughty boy.”

Without a shred of remorse he confessed to shooting Fahey a woman he had never seen before and who was not his intended target.

He was really on the hunt for physicists.

Peakes believed himself to be a genius and had developed some theories like how electronics can increase the human life span to 500 years.

He produced two long works —”How to Live Forever” and a 13000-word pamphlet “So You Love Physics.” At his own expense he had thousands of copies of the physics pamphlet printed up and sent to scientists including Einstein.

No one responded.

Bayard Peakes handcuffed to detective reads copy of the Daily News on train returning to New York from Boston.

He was dismayed that the scientific establishment ignored him or labeled his ideas as pseudoscience or just plain hogwash.

Peakes decided a publicity stunt — shooting a bunch of scientists and blowing up a physics lab at Columbia— would attract the attention he so desperately desired.

In the days before the slaying he bought a pistol in his home state of Maine. Then he took a train to Grand Central and got a room in a hotel on Broadway near Columbia.

No physicists were in the office when he stepped through the door only Fahey all alone reading her letter.

He asked if she knew anything about electrons according to his confession.

She said she knew nothing about that. The next moment Peakes pulled the gun from his pocket and started shooting.

Police said most of his confession was delivered without emotion but he became visibly upset when they asked why he killed her.

“It was my book” he said his voice breaking. “They wouldn’t look at my book. They wouldn’t even look at it. … They should have looked at it. They should have looked at it.”

In his twisted mind murdering Fahey was justified. “It’s like a soldier doing his duty for the benefit of mankind.”

The casket of Eileen Fahey leaving the Church of the Ascension on 107th St. after her funeral. Hundreds of friends and neighbors paid their respects.

An investigation of his personal history revealed a dangerous mind that was unraveling for years.

He had an uneventful childhood growing up in Dover-Foxcroft Maine. After high school in 1941 he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and transferred to the U.S. service in Europe three years later.

In 1945 he was discharged for mental problems and received a 50% disability pension.

Three years later a Veterans Affairs specialist who examined him wrote that Peakes was suffering from a “malignant schizophrenic process.” The specialist said his prognosis “is fraught with danger; picture is bleak.”

Despite several similar evaluations he was set loose in the world with no restrictions or warnings.

On Aug. 19 1952 a panel of psychiatrists determined that Peakes was a paranoid schizophrenic with delusions of grandeur. He had no understanding of what he had done or that it was wrong.

They recommended locking him up to the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.

There he stayed until he was transferred to an institution in Maine to be close to his ailing mother. When he died in 2000 his obituary said only that “circumstances prevented his return to Maine to live until the 1970s.”

He’s mostly forgotten today but his name pops up periodically in conjunction with an APS policy. It allows members at the organization’s scientific meeting to talk for 10 minutes on any physical theory no matter how far-fetched it may be.

The retired Philadelphia Eagles center bizarrely accused Secretariat the horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973 of cheating during the latest episode his his New Heights podcast with brother Travis Kelce.

'Secretariat was juiced to the gills' Kelce claimed on the podcast. 'Secretariat just so happens to be right in the heart of the steroid era.

'(In) 1973 every NFL player every baseball player they were juicing them to the gills. You don't think Secretariat was f–king juiced to the rafters? Of course it's the fastest horse of all-time.'

His comments sparked backlash on social media ultimately forcing Kelce into apologizing with one user claiming that the legendary center must have CTE - the brain disease many NFL stars have been diagnosed with post-mortem especially veterans playing late into their careers.

Jason Kelce admitted he believes he has CTE following his dazzling 13-year career in the NFL

The Philadelphia Eagles legend claimed he can almost guarantee he suffers with the disease

Kelce's bold claims came after he suggested racehorse Secretariat cheated

'[Y]ou know who else makes unsubstantiated claims not backed up by facts. People suffering from CTE. I'll admit I don't know whether @JasonKelce suffers from CTE or not it's impossible to know' they posted.

Kelce surprisingly responded to the dig by suggesting that he more than likely does suffer with the brain disease.

'I mean I can virtually guarantee that I have CTE all the research would suggest I have some degree of it' he replied. 'I think it is entirely reasonable to assume I have some degree of that pathology.'

The social media user later insisted he didn't mean to cause any offense but an unbothered Kelce brushed it off saying it was just the reality he faces.

'I understand I don't take offense at all. what I’m saying is that it’s completely reasonable to think I have CTE' he added.

'Even though there is no test to see if I currently have CTE The evidence suggests I probably do. Just like the reality that a lot if not most of the high level horses of the 70s and 80s were doping because adequate tests were not available.

'But it really doesn’t accomplish anything to bring this up I don’t know why I started Secretariat was still a fantastic horse and legendary specimen.'

An unbothered Kelce brushed it off saying it was just the reality he faces

Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown unsurprisingly had a less-than-sensitive response to Kelce's admission.

Brown who has become an internet provocateur attacking the likes of Tom Brady and Caitlin Clark online has repeatedly joked about having CTE on X.

The controversial former NFL star has even created a social media page known as CTESPN in order to mock the original ESPN network

Brown quote-tweeted a post reporting Kelce's claim writing: 'First step is admitting it. #CTESPN.'

Kelce was also concerned over the impact of CTE towards the end of his career the Philadelphia Inquirer's Marcus Hayes reported following the end of the Eagles' 2023 season and just weeks before the veteran announced his retirement.

He reportedly struggled to remember the date of a teammate's injury and quipped that it was 'the CTE creeping in'.

Antonio Brown unsurprisingly had a less-than-sensitive response to Kelce's admission

The former NFL wide receiver has repeatedly joked about having CTE on social media

Kelce previously expressed his concerns about the impacts of CTE during his Amazon Prime documentary last year.

'There have been little things that are not big things yet but are going to turn into big things the longer I play' he said.

'Not to dress like an elephant in the NFL room but I am fearful about what the impacts of playing football are going to mean long-term. I have two girls and ... some people end up getting CTE and some guys live long healthy lives.

'I have no idea what's going to happen with that because I've thought about this' he said thinking of the amount of physical impacts in the game and if 'it might come back to bite me.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starving brown pelicans overwhelm bird rescue facility in Fairfield,"FAIRFIELD -- A wildlife crisis is playing out in the Bay Area and along the California coast. Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

Recent Articles:

This newsletter issue takes a look at value stocks compared to growth stocks and makes an argument for at least a mild resurgence of value performance. It also provides an update on the current inflation situation particularly for housing.

Value Stocks: Not Quite Dead Yet

Sentiment on value stocks and value investing is still near a historical low point.

With about 90 years of data value stocks have historically outperformed growth stocks in aggregate although not in every decade.

In particular this past 2010s decade has been crushingly in growth stocks’ favor and it hasn’t been close. The mega-cap internet stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) Apple (AAPL) Amazon (AMZN) Facebook (FB) Alphabet (GOOGL) Netflix (NFLX) Salesforce (CRM) and a host of other growth companies like Visa (V) have been the main drivers of US stock market and indeed global stock market performance as most value sectors lagged badly and chopped sideways for much of the decade.

That trend differs significantly from multiple previous decades where an investing approach that leaned towards buying out-of-favor stocks did better. This past decade was a particularly brutal one for value investors and that fact has been well-known for years.

This long-term chart shows the Russell 1000 Value Total Return index divided by the Russell 1000 Growth Total Return index. When it’s going up it means value stocks in aggregate are outperforming and when it’s going down it means growth stocks in aggregate are outperforming.

That particular chart relies on FTSE Russell’s metrics for what constitutes a value stock vs a growth stock. In truth there is no firm definition between the two other than that value stocks tend to be cheaper slower-growing companies that often pay a dividend and return capital to shareholders while growth stocks tend to be more expensive and faster growing and are still reinvesting heavily into their business.

As the chart shows 1) value stocks outperformed for much of the 1980s leading into the savings and loan crisis 2) growth stocks outperformed for much of the 1990s leading into the dot-com bubble 3) value stocks outperformed for much of the 2000s leading into the subprime mortgage crisis and 4) growth stocks outperformed for much of the 2010s leading into the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent fiscally-driven inflationary reversal. The two factors growth and value went in big cycles as economic bubbles and monetary policy shifted around and ultimately ended with excesses each time.

Looking back at the past three years we see that the ratio of value to growth stock performance bottomed in 2020 and started to turn up after lockdowns eased and vaccines were announced. It then had a correction again in 2021 to a higher low in part due to the Delta variant and fiscal spending slowdowns but now is now seemingly back in an uptrend with energy stocks and financials holding up pretty well:

I’m watching to see if it holds this trend or not. Recent years have been full of people making “growth to value rotation” calls but this one has been in place for a while and came with a recession and a rather fundamental shift in fiscal and monetary policy which is when most major value/growth rotations occur.

If we want to go back more than the four decades that Russell has data for here’s a great chart. It shows the rolling 5-year return differential between value and growth stocks from the early 1930s to 2020. When it’s green (positive) it means value stocks have outperformed over that period and when it’s red (negative) it means growth stocks have outperformed:

Chart Source: Michael Lebowitz Real Investment Advice

Value stocks outperformed during 82% of rolling 5-year periods according to that data set but the 1930s and the 2010s were major exceptions where growth stocks outperformed by large and persistent gaps.

Anyone who has followed my work for a while knows that I regularly use the 1930s/1940s analogue to describe the 2010s/2020s economic situation at least in terms of fiscal and monetary policy and the long-term debt cycle. History doesn’t repeat but it does rhyme. The disinflationary 2010s were very similar in many ways to the disinflationary 1930s and the inflationary 2020s are shaping up to be similar to the inflationary 1940s.

This is one of the set of charts among several that I’ve used in my research pieces to show the similarities between those two periods:

Some analysts don’t like that comparison and no analogue will ever be a perfect fit but I find that it provides tremendous context for understanding this unusual market environment. It allowed investors to anticipate major stimulus and inflation in response to the 2020 crisis. A lot of investors say this type of economic environment is unprecedented whereas the truth is it’s just unprecedented in developed markets in our lifetimes. There is historical context for situations like this and then it becomes our job to find the details for how it differs from those otherwise eerily-similar periods. I can’t imagine trying to make investment decisions in this environment without at least having studied that similar period.

It’s not too surprising that the value/growth equity performance differential shows a similarity between the 1930s and 2010s as well. During both eras a massive credit bubble popped and economic growth stagnated for the better part of a decade with interest rates held near zero. Growth stocks significantly outperformed value stocks during those decade-long stagnations as economic growth was weak commodity prices were low bank credit was contracting and investors piled into whatever growth stocks were available.

In the 1930s that state of affairs persisted until the early 1940s when policymakers were basically forced by external catalysts (total war) to do massive monetized fiscal stimulus and to hold rates low despite the high inflation that all of this spending caused. Similarly in the 2010s that state of affairs persisted until the early 2020s when pandemic lockdowns hit a highly-leveraged economy with millions of people living paycheck to paycheck putting policymakers in a position to either massively stimulate or watch a widespread debt collapse happen. And just like the 1940s even as inflation began running hot policymakers have so far kept interest rates low in the 2020s.

As we head deeper into the 2020s I do expect value stocks to catch a stronger bid than they did in the 2010s. Much like how they did in the 1940s. There are some headwinds against that idea like the constant flows of capital into passive index funds that make up a large portion of the equity market. These funds buy based on market capitalization and thus inherently have a large-cap growth momentum strategy. But overall I think the trend is worth watching to see if it overcomes these opposing forces.

Let’s break down how that could happen. This chart shows the S&P 500 sector distribution since 1975:

Image Source: @Rob_Hager

The energy sector is coming back up off of its lowest-ever 2% contribution to the index but still remains extremely low at 3%. I think that sector could double to 6% or more over the next decade after a strong period of outperformance going forward and it will have paid out above-average dividend yields during that journey as well. I wrote about my bullish view on oil and gas this past summer and indeed this autumn we’ve been seeing energy shortages in Europe and rising energy prices everywhere. I think that trend will have dips and surges but that it will persist deeper into the decade. Materials and financials could each increase by a point or two and healthcare could certainly represent a bit more more than it does now considering the world’s aging demographics.

In contrast the technology and consumer discretionary sectors are the growth-oriented areas that could see a relative reduction in weighting into those other areas mainly due to their valuations cooling off a bit. Technology will obviously be a big part of the future as it always is but the valuations placed on tech stocks can change over time and the existing large-cap set of tech stocks are already in their mature business phase (trying to maintain their established moats against competition and regulatory pressure rather than rapidly innovating generally speaking). While it’s not exactly a “tech investment” I continue to prefer a sizable bitcoin allocation over any specific tech stock and I continue to monitor the rapid innovation in that ecosystem via the Lightning network in particular as well as other areas of the ecosystem.

Importantly if value stocks in aggregate do outperform growth stocks (still a big “if” at this point) it could take a few different forms. Both factors could have positive returns with value doing better than growth. Or the value factor could have positive returns while the growth factor has negative returns. Or both could have negative returns with the value factor doing less poorly between the two.

I lean somewhat towards the middle option but there is a lot of variance that can happen based on policy choices and other variables. Overall I like to analyze individual stocks rather than rely on broad growth ETFs or value ETFs because I want to isolate inexpensive stocks that nonetheless have a relevant product or service that is not being disrupted by new technology.

Lastly we can separate “cyclical value” from “defensive value” sectors. Topdown Charts has a great chart on this subject from earlier this month where they classify the energy and financials sectors as being cyclical value and healthcare consumer staples and utilities as being defensive value. The chart compares those two groups separately to the S&P 500. This gives much resolution on how they performed over time:

Image Source: @topdowncharts

Overall some level of mean reversion from the financial sector and especially the energy sector over the next 5-10 years from this low place interests me as a significant possibility.

Interest Rates and Equity Valuations

A lot of people refer to the US stock market being overvalued. And indeed it is trading at historically high valuations by most metrics. With bank accounts and Treasuries yielding below the prevailing inflation rate for a while investors have basically monetized stocks and used them as a store of value wherever possible.

The equity market capitalization to GDP ratio for example reached record highs in recent years at over 200%. Long-term interest rates are in red since that’s an important variable as well:

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

Stock valuations in the United States have benefited from a four-decade long bond bull market (i.e. lower and lower Treasury yields). As bonds offered lower and lower yields it presented a lower and lower discount rate for valuing companies meaning that an investor could justify paying up for higher stock valuations since her risk-free opportunity cost primarily consisted of low-yielding bonds.

And as I described in my summer article on the subject a period of rising yields tends to hurt growth stock valuations if they start the period at very high valuations. Growth stock valuations have been the primary beneficiary from lower yields.

The 2000 dotcom-bubble was somewhat of an anomaly on the stock valuation vs interest rates chart above as valuations briefly reached very high valuations even while Treasury-rates were moderately high. That was a particularly excessive period of stock market euphoria. Besides that unusually high valuation spike we can see on that chart above that the 1980-2020 structural trend was for lower and lower interest rates and higher and higher equity valuations.

If inflation remains sticky at 3-6% or more for a while then 10-year Treasury yields could very well try to keep pushing up from current super-low levels. Their yields are currently far below the inflation rate which has only happened a few times in the past sixty years:

While I don’t think Treasury yields will be allowed by Fed to reach too high (and indeed I expect negative inflation-adjusted yields for most of the Treasury curve to exist for a long time) I also don’t necessarily think the 10-3 yield curve (the difference between the 10-year Treasury rate and the 3-month Treasury rate) has reached its maximum steepness for this cycle yet:

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

I don’t have a particularly strong view on where Treasury yields will end up for the cycle (as that is partially a political decision by policymakers). The longer-term story however is that global developed market interest rates are around zero and likely can’t go much structurally lower and are more likely than not to start grinding sideways for a while and will be negative in inflation-adjusted terms.

A steeper yield curve benefits bank stocks which also have some of the strongest balance sheets they’ve had for decades (a stark contrast to their balance sheet composition in 2007). And the inflationary conditions that push up yields tend to benefit energy and materials stocks or even more directly are often driven by these sectors. These are all value sectors.

Here’s a chart I put together back in May 2021 showing 5-year rolling expansion or contraction in the oil price and the consumer price index over the long run:

On the other hand high inflation and widespread supply chain problems can hurt the profit margins of many companies and a higher long-duration Treasury yield if we get that would likely put pressure on the high valuations of growth stocks.

Apple vs CVS Health

Apple (AAPL) for example is projected by consensus analyst expectations to have a lousy forward two years of EPS growth after its monstrous 2021 growth which makes its current 26x price/earnings ratio and $2.3 trillion market capitalization at least slightly uncomfortable:

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

In contrast CVS Health (CVS) is projected by analysts to have slightly faster EPS growth than Apple over the next two years but the stock is trading at less than half of the earnings multiple as Apple. I’m not saying they should have as high of an earnings multiple as Apple (or that analysts are necessarily correct about the next two years of EPS performance) but I also don’t think the earnings multiple gap going forward should remain quite as wide as it is.

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

One thing I like about CVS is that after their major acquisition of Aetna they prioritized the company around using those greater total cash flows to pay down debt and improve their financial position. Meanwhile Apple still has a strong balance sheet but continues to increase its net debt level.

In many ways Apple already transformed into a value stock because its growth slowed and it began focusing on financialization. But unlike other value stocks Apple stock is rather expensive partly because of the 2020/2021 growth spurt in its earnings and partially because investors are optimistic on its ongoing shift from hardware revenue to ecosystem service revenue.

Cadence Design vs Enterprise Products Partners

An example I’ve used before is Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) vs Enterprise Products Partners (EPD). It’s one of my go-to examples because they are both very high-quality companies for their industries. Cadence provides software for designing electronic and computer systems and switched towards a SaaS model that has benefitted them greatly and justified a higher valuation to some extent because the cash flows are more reliable. Meanwhile Enterprise is a large and diversified transporter of natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil and petrochemicals.

Cadence is expected to have decent growth over the next couple years after a recent multi-year period of rapid growth from converting to the SaaS model but is already trading at a 50x earnings multiple. That valuation is somewhat of a liability if 10-year Treasury rates ever move back up from current historically low levels. Software-as-a-service companies are very attractive investments and justify high valuations but even those valuations have a limit when the PEG ratio is 4x or 5x.

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

Meanwhile there is a global energy and petrochemical shortage occurring and Enterprise has the wide-moat physical infrastructure to transport and export some of these things. It is trading at a historically low valuation and has a historically high (and well-covered) distribution yield of 7%+ that it has grown for 23 consecutive years while its balance sheet ironically carries a slightly higher S&P credit rating than Cadence has.

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

Again Enterprise shouldn’t have the same valuation as Cadence but it seems that investors are piled quite tightly onto one side of the ship towards growth here. Going forward when factoring in the distributions Enterprise is more appealing to me than Cadence in terms of the probability of providing good forward total returns.

Microsoft vs EOG Resources

I’m a fan of Microsoft (MSFT) stock have owned it for years and still do. But with a staggering $2.3 trillion market capitalization and with a price/earnings ratio in the high 30s it should be quite hard for Microsoft to match its past five years of performance with the next five years unless consensus analyst expectations are way too bearish:

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

Meanwhile energy producer EOG Resources (EOG) is generating great cash flow has radically improved its balance sheet to the strongest financial position it has ever been in and yet its stock price still trades rather cheaply compared to its earnings at current energy price levels:

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

The Microsoft/EOG total return performance ratio chart is pretty interesting. It feels like we’ve been here before:

Microsoft radically outperformed in the 1990s up to its peak dotcom-bubble valuation. Then in the 2000s its valuation popped while oil entered a massive bubble of its own. After that in the 2010s oil entered a long bear market and Microsoft rose like a phoenix to outperform many competitors with a transformation towards software-as-a-service and cloud computing and it once again crushed EOG in terms of gains with the performance ratio having an accelerated blow-off top as the stock stocks entered into the pandemic lockdown recession of 2020 and sharply diverged.

But since then EOG is gaining on Microsoft again from that bubble peak (purple line going down). I still think that trade has more to go in EOG’s favor before the dust settles even though it could take years to play out.

Overall these are just some examples of things I’m looking for in the market. The value factor has put in a pretty clear reversal from growth stocks over the past year but the continuation of that reversal is by no means assured. Comparative valuations further justify an allocation to value stocks although growth stocks do have a tendency to surprise to the upside especially in recent years. I like both in my portfolio but prefer value stocks at current levels overall.

Portfolio Updates

I have several investment accounts and I provide updates on my asset allocation and investment selections for some of the portfolios in each newsletter issue every six weeks.

These portfolios include the model portfolio account specifically for this newsletter and my relatively passive indexed retirement account. Members of my premium research service also have access to three additional model portfolios and my other holdings with more frequent updates.

I use a free account at Personal Capital to easily keep track of all my accounts and monitor my net worth.

M1 Finance Newsletter Portfolio

I started this account in September 2018 with $10k of new capital and I put new money in regularly. Currently I put in $1000 per month.

It’s one of my smallest accounts but the goal is for the portfolio to be accessible and to show newsletter readers my best representation of where I think value is in the market. It’s a low-turnover multi-asset globally diversified portfolio that focuses on liquid investments and is scalable to virtually any size.

I chose M1 Finance because their platform is commission-free and allows for a combo of ETF and individual stock selection with automatic and/or manual rebalancing. It makes for a great model portfolio with high flexibility. (See my disclosure policy here regarding my affiliation with M1.)

And here’s the breakdown of the holdings in those slices:

Changes since the previous issue:

I haven’t made many changes to the portfolio recently. I slightly reduced Cameco (CCJ) in favor of some Sibanye-Stillwater (SBSW) replaced Exxon Mobil (XOM) with EOG Resources (EOG) and replaced Home Depot (HD) with PulteGroup (PHM).

Other Model Portfolios and Accounts

I have three other real-money model portfolios that I share within my premium research service including:

Fortress Income Portfolio

ETF-Only Portfolio

No Limits Portfolio

Plus I have larger personal accounts at Fidelity and Schwab and I share those within the service as well.

Final Thoughts: Rent and Wage Inflation

Until 1983 the consumer price index included housing prices as part of the basket. Then housing prices were removed from the index since they are a capital asset rather than a consumer asset but their influence remains in the index as “owner’s equivalent rent” which is a way to try to quantify the rising cost of shelter without including house prices directly. By extension this cost of shelter indirectly includes interest rates since if a house goes up in price but the mortgage interest rate is lower the monthly payment can remain relatively stable.

Back in summer 2021 I noticed that rent CPI was forming a bottoming pattern and this is something I’ve been keeping an eye on and reporting on occasionally since then. Here is an excerpt from my July 2021 newsletter:

As we head into the autumn a third inflation variable to watch is likely to be rent prices. This recent spike to 5.39% official year-over-year broad price inflation occurred at a time when year-over-year rent increases which are one of the biggest components of the inflation basket were on the downtrend to below 2%. Now however rent year-over-year inflation is showing a potential bottom: Chart Source: St. Louis Fed Owners’ equivalent rent (which is the government’s indirect way to include housing costs in the CPI calculation without including the home price itself as a capital asset) historically follows the prices of homes with an 18-month lag: Source: Jeroen Blokland With the rate of rent inflation seemingly bottoming and rolling up now with eviction moratoriums coming to an end and with high housing costs an uptick in rent and owner’s equivalent rent appears set to provide the next round of overall price inflation to keep the broad CPI number somewhat elevated. -Lyn Alden July 2021

Well as of September 2021 data (reported in October) both owners’ equivalent rent and rent itself as part of the official CPI basket have formed a clear trend up in rate of change terms for several months now.

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

Data from Apartment List suggests that these measures still have some catching up to do against the on-the-ground numbers. They have a great chart from last month showing the pre-pandemic rent price trend vs what actually happened in 2020 and 2021:

Chart Source: Apartment List

During 2020 rent prices were flat-to-down under their historical trend. Rent moratoriums and considerable economic uncertainty were themes of that year. However in 2021 rents have sharply risen to levels well above their historical trend.

The combination of rent and owner’s equivalent rent make up about 30% of the headline CPI basket so this move is meaningful. This is likely to keep headline inflation rather elevated for another couple quarters at least along with whatever happens with the rest of the basket of goods and services in the index.

This rising cost of housing necessitates higher wages for workers if they are going to keep up with that. This contributes to ongoing labor shortages and should lead to higher wages which if companies want to try to preserve their profit margins means raising prices on their products and services as well.

The Atlanta Fed Wage Growth tracker shows how low wage growth was during the 2010s decade which contributed to the disinflationary trend of that period. If annual wage growth starts consistently moving over 4% (which is pretty important considering that official headline price inflation is 5.4%) that should be another contributor to higher consumer prices.

Chart Source: Atlanta Fed

It will be interesting to see how the bond market reacts to that and something to keep in mind when making investment decisions. I continue to view the 2020s decade as likely being a significantly more inflationary decade overall than the 2010s decade although it won’t be a straight line.

“We know there was election fraud are you kidding?” said Jason Sullivan a social media strategist for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. “We’re done trying to prove that it happened. We’re about to turn it around.”

Others will have to prove they provided a secure election system he told attendees. Sullivan later led the crowd in chants of “Sheep no more!”

The convention organized by The Patriot Voice faced an uncertain future when Caesars Entertainment dropped the event in August. The event drew media coverage for using QAnon imagery in its advertising materials. Last month the convention found a new venue in the Ahern Hotel.

The QAnon conspiracy started in the fringes of the internet in 2017 but has crept into mainstream right-wing politics. Followers believe a secret group of Satan-worshipping cannibalistic pedophiles control the “deep state” government.

Andre Popa the event’s emcee on Saturday told the crowd that government leaders are paid off to work against the public.

One attendee said during the event that they planned to put up signs asking what really happened during 9/11 a question Popa called “beautiful.”

Popa also raised questions about the COVID-19 vaccines which health officials say are safe and effective.

“When they’re talking about the vax this ain’t no vax” Popa said. “Because typically when you’re getting the flu jab thing it’s supposed to have the flu in it so the body builds its stuff. So is the thing today in this juice? So then how can it be? Therefore it’s not. So then the question is what is it?”

On the second floor of the event area Trump hats and shirts were for sale at a merchandise stand with a “Trump won” flag draped over the front. Flags hanging over a railing that were visible from the ground floor said “Trump is still my president” and “Stop the steal.”

Despite numerous legal challenges no evidence has emerged to suggest there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.

Media access to the event was highly restricted. A Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter was escorted by event staff confined to one area and told to leave shortly before noon.

Shawn Sudduth an executive assistant for one of the event’s organizers said he doesn’t think there is widespread belief in the secret cabal of cannibals conspiracy and that the people behind the event on Saturday are not “those people.”

He said the media has misrepresented QAnon as an organization and that the movement is about a search for truth. This weekend’s convention is not a QAnon event but just an opportunity to bring God-loving American patriots together he said.

He did say it’s possible the cannibalistic pedophile group does exist because “people are capable of all sorts of things.”

The FBI has recognized QAnon as a potential domestic terror threat but Sudduth said the people in attendance want peace.

“Well the federal government has a long history of lying” he said. “It has a long history of being a corrupt institution.”

The convention is scheduled to run through Monday. Nevada secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant a former assemblyman is scheduled to speak at the conference.

The ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" singer says she believes she was meant to meet the rapper. Here's why J.Lo is grateful for meeting her ex Sean Combs.

Jennifer Lopez and Sean “Diddy” Combs dated from 1999 to 2001. Lopez once said she believes she was meant to meet Combs. Here’s what she said about their relationship.

Jennifer Lopez and Diddy had an instant connection

Lopez and Diddy seemed to have an instant connection. During an interview with People magazine she spoke about their relationship and early days of dating. Lopez recalls the time Combs said he loved her the first day they met on the set of a video shoot.

Although their relationship started off well Lopez says she and Combs experienced some frightening situations. “We went through some very traumatic events together” says Lopez referring to the time they were arrested in 1999 after reportedly fleeing a nightclub shooting.

“But like I said I learned a lot about the music business with him” she continues. Lopez also says the relationship helped her grow in her personal life. She learned how to stand up for herself in future relationships.

Lopez says she was meant to meet Sean ‘Diddy Combs’

Lopez made the transition from dancing and acting to singing when she released her first album On the 6. She had major success with the film Selena and she appeared in the movie Out of Sight alongside George Clooney. Now it was time for the singer to spread her wings and fulfill her lifelong dream of being a triple threat—a singer dancer and actor.

During the interview with People Lopez says she learned a lot about the music industry from Combs. “He was great” she says. “It was almost like I was meant to meet him while I was making my first album because helped me a lot. He guided me.”

Lopez jokes that Combs had a “rough way” of guiding her career but he did provide support. According to her Combs would bluntly tell her when something about her image or music didn’t work. “He had a way of communicating that put it very plainly like ‘That sucks; don’t do that.’”

Lopez says she was “smart enough” to take the things that were useful to her and apply them. She says Combs was great when it came to working with artists because he has an A&R background. “He would share his knowledge with me whether I asked for it or not” adds Lopez.

The advice Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs gave Jennifer Lopez that she still follows

In her book True Love Lopez says Combs told her to be careful about what she says in her albums because it can define who she is as an artist. He advised Lopez to think carefully about the lyrics in each of her songs.

“I remember Puffy once saying to me while I was making my very first album ‘Be careful what you sing be careful what you record because it can define you’” wrote Lopez. “Music is very powerful. It goes out into the universe and it takes on an energy; it becomes part of your story. That’s why I would never record anything that’s too negative or too depressing—because that’s not what I want my life to be about.” Lopez says music is more than lyrics on a page. For her music represents her life as an artist. Says Lopez “In many ways you sing your future.”

He’s also a box-office bonanza on the road.

There has been no disputing Mike Tyson’s draw as a star on the Strip. He’s also a box-office bonanza on the road.

The boxing legend is planning a return of his autobiographical show originally titled “Undisputed Truth — Live On Stage” and later “Undisputed Truth — Round 2.” But he says the show won’t be at MGM Grand where it was performed at Brad Garrett’s Comedy Club during its second run in 2016 and ‘17.

“We want to start it at Hard Rock Hotel in Florida in 60-90 days” Tyson said. “That’s a conservative estimate. But we’re going to start there and do a tour of the Hard Rocks around the country.”

Tyson disclosed the plans Thursday just after the unveiling of his beyond-life-size statue at Mulberry Street Pizzeria at Resorts World Las Vegas.

Mike’s wife Kiki Tyson said the couple are producing the show themselves this time. The title is to be determined.

The relaunch would be at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel otherwise known as the “The Guitar Hotel” as its tower is shaped like an old Fender. Tyson has most recently booked at the Seminole Hard Rock Event Center in April 2020 the show canceled by the pandemic. He has also made personal appearances at Hard Rock Tulsa over the years.

“Undisputed Truth” originated at MGM Grand’s Hollywood Theatre in 2012 produced by Adam Steck’s SPI Entertainment. The show performed later that year with Spike Lee at the wheel at Longacre Theatre on Broadway. That led to a 36-show national tour and special on HBO in November 2013.

The fighter-turned-headliner has always been a powerhouse onstage. He consistently filled Brad Garrett’s 300-seater in the Underground at MGM Grand. The show was at once scripted and highly unpredictable. On opening night Tyson flew into a highly entertaining monologue when his ear monitors faltered. You had to be there.

Grambling mecca

Expect a musical spectacle when the famous Grambling State Marching Band performs at halftime of Sunday’s Raiders-Eagles game at Allegiant Stadium. A total of 160 musicians will take the field. Expect master musicianship and choreography.

“We hold band camps every year to make sure everyone can play their instruments and move consistently the whole show” band director Nikole Roebuck said in a phone chat Friday. She is the first female band director in school history.

The set list is to be a surprise but as Roebuck says “We will have something for everyone.” Several Raider alumni attended Grambling including Pro Football Hall of Famer Willie Brown.

Bradshaw out

Knee surgery has sacked Terry Bradshaw in his show at Luxor. The NFL great and Fox Sports broadcaster underwent a scheduled knee replacement (his left) last week. He had his right knee replaced in 2016. His next date at Atrium Showroom is Dec. 3.

Barth show

Vegas-based tattoo icon Mario Barth is presenting the “Life In Ink” country rock show at 6 p.m. Wednesday at Mosaic on the Strip. Lonestar and Tyler Rich are in the mix. Lonestar has charted nine No. 1 hits on the Billboard country charts including “Amazed” “Come Cryin’ To Me” and “No News.” Rich recorded the hit “The Difference” and his new release is “Better Than You’re Used Too.” Tickets are $50 and $75 available at ticketweb.com.

Leaving ‘Legends’

Frank Marino has announced he will be leaving “Legends In Concert” at the Tropicana on Nov. 20 a day before his 58th birthday. He joined the show as emcee in the fall of 2019. Mario is focusing on his “Divas Las Vegas” production which plays Italian American Club on Dec. 3. “I have nothing but great things to say about ‘Legends’ and it was a really great experience for me” Marino said Saturday. “But my plan has been to bring ‘Divas’ back and we are starting that process in December.”

Fisher moves on

Former KTNV-TV Channel 13 anchor Beth Fisher has taken a community relations position with the Metropolitan Police Department. Fisher had been social media officer for the city of Henderson since leaving KTNV in September 2019.

Not so ‘Crazy’

Don’t be surprised to know “Crazy Girls” is looking to Westgate Cabaret as a possible new home. The topless revue was shut down when Caesars Entertainment closed its Planet Hollywood theater in May. The show has a deep history on the Strip 35 years combined at Riviera and Planet Hollywood Resort and a famous statue that could well complement the Elvis in the lobby.

Front-row Ross

The person who handed Lady Gaga a crown — because she is the queen — at Park Theater on Thursday night was Sarah Hester Ross. She is the headliner at Bar at Times Square at New York-New York and also at Notoriety Live at Neonopolis and a reliably funny individual.

Cool Hang Alert

Kelly Clinton-Holmes’ Thursday night “Sit In” at The Nevada Room has turned into a happening. Consistently full. Last week Clinton-Holmes danced it up with Bubba Knight an original member of Gladys Knight & the Pips. They had the classic moves down folks. No cover. Dinner is served. Make reservations or risk being shut out.

View the current offers here.

Capital One made waves when it first added airline transfer partners in 2018. Not long after it expanded its roster to include hotel partners and has continued to improve many of its transfer ratios. Unfortunately it is losing a major airline partner in a few days.

Specifically on Oct. 1 Capital One announced that it would drop JetBlue TrueBlue as a transfer partner effective Oct. 25.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Capital One first added JetBlue as a transfer partner in May 2019. When the partnership launched transfers were at a ratio of 2 Capital One miles to 1 JetBlue TrueBlue point. But this ratio was later improved to a 2:1.5 ratio meaning you can convert 1000 Capital One miles to 750 TrueBlue points.

Capital One gave cardholders a mere three weeks' notice of this change and those three weeks are almost up. So if you have Capital One miles -- potentially from the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card or Capital One Spark Miles for Business -- you have until 11:59 p.m. ET on Oct. 24 to transfer miles to JetBlue.

However you may not want to transfer Capital One miles to JetBlue. Overall this transfer partner removal isn't a huge loss for cardholders since JetBlue was always one of Capital One's less valuable transfer partners.

After all TPG values JetBlue TrueBlue points at just 1.3 cents apiece. So you'll usually get better value transferring your miles to one of Capital One's 1:1 transfer partners like Avianca LifeMiles or Etihad Guest. Additionally you'll continue to be able to redeem your Capital One miles at a fixed value against the purchase of a JetBlue flight.

That said a loss of a transfer partner is still a loss. JetBlue was Capital One's only U.S. airline transfer partner. And some cardholders certainly found value in having JetBlue as a transfer partner when needing to top off their account for a specific award. That said once this transfer partnership ends you will still have the option of converting American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards into JetBlue TrueBlue points so you can start strategizing around that.

Although Capital One's revamped rewards program hasn't been around for too long this isn't the first time it has lost transfer partners. The program lost Hainan Airlines Fortune Wings Club and Qatar Airways Privilege Club as transfer partners in May 2020. But the new partners Capital One has added over the years have more than made up for those departures for most cardmembers. And earlier this month Capital One added six more airlines to its 1:1 transfer tier.

So despite the upcoming loss of JetBlue as a transfer partner there's still plenty of value to be found in Capital One miles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS1hcmVuYS1jYWVzYXJzLXNwb3J0c2Jvb2stMTQ1NzI4NzI5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capital One Arena's Caesars Sportsbook creates a '365-day destination',"Professional sports executives emerged from the pandemic starving to compensate for a year of lost revenue and Monumental Sports & Entertainment (MSE) found a solution: sports betting inside stadiums.

In May 2021 MSE — a private company that owns the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards among other teams and sports brands — opened an 18000-square-foot Caesars Sportsbook (CZR) inside Capital One Arena in Washington D.C. to create additional revenue for the arena.

“We think this is a 365-day destination spot” MSE President of Business Operations Jim Van Stone said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).

Capital One Arena typically holds 230 events each year that send roughly 3 million people through the stadium's turnstiles. And while the sportsbook opened up to an arena at full capacity on October 13 when the Capitals hosted their first NHL game of the season the sportsbook’s biggest impact has come on days when the building used to be quiet.

For example this fall on days without events in the area fans have filed into the sportsbook to watch Premier League soccer college football and NFL Sundays leading Capital One Arena to become a “football facility” Van Stone quipped.

“We think it's really opened up a lot of new and unique opportunities and really probably some sports fans that traditionally wouldn't come down for either a hockey or basketball game” Van Stone said. “And one of the things that we're so bullish on from an industry standpoint about this is that if we could take advantage of maybe those 100-plus dark days a year where we do boxing or MMA pay-per-views inside our building and connect it to the sportsbook we think it's certainly a new revenue opportunity but also a new fan engagement opportunity and helps us you know really build our core business.”

Van Stone said MSE is now early on trend that he believes is just beginning.

In New Jersey which just became the first state to see gamblers bet $1 billion in a month the Prudential Center — home of the NHL’s New Jersey Devils — recently launched the Playup Sports Lounge.

Madison Square Garden stakeholders have also shown interest in adding a sportsbook and attended the Capitals season opener to better understand in-stadium sportsbooks according to Van Stone.

Still in its infancy the Caesars Sportsbook inside Capital One Arena will serve as a case study for the other early-adopter arenas that are hoping to gain more time and attention from fans.

“We're hopeful that [fans] come two or three hours before a Caps game you know take in the festivities of the sportsbook” Van Stone said. “And then after the game you know stay for a couple of hours and enjoy the end of the evening with a nice nightcap and maybe a West Coast hockey game.”

We don’t go to preseason games that often and we often don’t sell out most regular season games. Kyle Kuzma even noticed how quiet a preseason game can often seem during postgame media availability last night.

*15407 — Albert Lee (@aleeinthedmv) October 23 2021

Apparently when Wizards fans go to Capital One Arena they also remain very frugal.

According to Josh Koebert of FinanceBuzz a recent survey of 891 NBA fans including at least 20 from each team’s fanbase Wizards fans are among the frugal in nearly every category.

Here is where Wizards fans ranked:

6th among team fanbases who spend the least amount of money on team merchandise per year ($95 for Washington vs. $155.57 for the league average)

4th among team fanbases who spend the least amount of money on non-alcoholic concessions ($35.94 vs. $68.17 for the league average)

10th among team fanbases who spend the least amount of money on alcoholic beverages ($18.13 vs. $22.65 for the league average)

Why could this be?

It’s difficult to pinpoint any one reason why fans are less likely to spend a lot of money on food drinks or team jerseys. But here are some possible anecdotes:

The Wizards uniforms haven’t changed much in recent years and Bradley Beal has remained on the roster for nearly 10 years — If you’re a Wizards fan and have a Beal jersey from 2015 it looks almost the same as the current jersey he’s wearing. The only difference is that teams have Nike logos or Jordan Brand ones on the shoulder. On top of that the Wizards haven’t acquired many other superstars in the last decade for an extended length of time.

Alcoholic drinks aren’t a good value — I’m not spending $10 for one can of Bud Light.

I’m not spending $10 for one can of Bud Light. Food options are often very generic and/or not a good value. There are many good restaurants near Capital One Arena — Arena food is expensive! And there are many dining options just a block or two from Cap One for someone to have a pre or postgame meal.

Arena food is expensive! And there are many dining options just a block or two from Cap One for someone to have a pre or postgame meal. The people who may spend more money on food and drink often have all-inclusive tickets — If you sit near the court or in a club level area your tickets often include food and drink so there’s no need to buy a bunch of nachos with a tub of half-melted cheesy dip at the regular concession stand among other things.

I’ll admit that with the exception of team merchandise I’m quite frugal with concessions stands when I’m at Capital One Arena. Are you the same way?

SoftBank’s Latin American Fund and GGV participated as new investors in addition to existing backers Kaszek BigBets Nubank CEO David Velez and Kavak CEO Carlos Garcia Ottati.

In May Justos had announced a $2.8 million seed raise that included participation from Kaszek one of the largest and most active VC firms in Latin America and the CEOs of several unicorns including Assaf Wand CEO and co-founder of Hippo Insurance; Sergio Furio founder and CEO of Creditas; Patrick Sigrist founder of iFood and Fritz Lanman CEO of ClassPass. Senior executives from Robinhood Stripe Wise Carta and Capital One had also put money in the round.

Serial entrepreneurs Dhaval Chadha Jorge Soto Moreno and Antonio Molins co-founded Justos having most recently worked at various Silicon Valley-based companies including ClassPass Netflix and Airbnb. The trio ironically none of whom are Brazilian ​​met while playing soccer on an amateur team in San Francisco.

The fact that Justos has yet to officially launch its product and has already attracted such a large group of high-profile investors is notable. According to CEO Chadha its launch is “imminent” and the company already has 12000 “leads” on its waitlist. So far it has launched a driving test and quoting app and in advance of its formal launch it has been collecting data from the driving test.

The process to get insurance in the country by any accounts is a slow one. It takes up to 72 hours to receive initial coverage and two weeks to receive the final insurance policy. Insurers also take their time in resolving claims related to car damages and loss due to accidents the entrepreneurs say. They also charge that pricing is often not fair or transparent.

Justos aims to improve the whole auto insurance process in Brazil by measuring the way people drive to help price their insurance policies. Similar to Root here in the U.S. Justos intends to collect users’ data through their mobile phones so that it can “more accurately and assertively price different types of risk.” This way the startup claims it can offer plans that are up to 30% cheaper than traditional plans and grant discounts each month according to the driving patterns of the previous month of each customer.

“We measure how safely people drive using the sensors on their cell phones” Chadha told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “This allows us to offer cheaper insurance to users who drive well thereby reducing biases that are inherent in the pricing models used by traditional insurance companies.”

Justos also plans to use artificial intelligence and computerized vision to analyze and process claims more quickly and machine learning for image analysis and to create bots that help accelerate claims processing.

The company also has a social good component. The startup has agreed to support five nonprofit organizations in its first year: Instituto Ayrton Senna (education) AACD (disability) Gerando Falcões (economic opportunity) Casa 1 (LGBTQ) and Conexsus (sustainable development in the Amazon).

It intends to cap its profit so part of the amount that is not used to pay claims is donated to those institutions in its first year of operations.

Says the company: “The partnerships reinforce the insurtech’s disruptive vision which as its name suggests aims to build a more transparent relationship with its customers and effectively contribute to improving society.”

The insurtech plans to use its new capital to continue to hire and expand its area of operations as well as toward launching other lines of insurance. The startup has a team of 30 with the goal of having 50 employees by year’s end and 200 by the end of 2022.

Parks and parking are on city council’s agenda for next week including the first update to neighborhood parking permits since the program’s implementation in 1994. That follows a full week where the city’s $462 million 2022 budget was approved along with a development at Diagonal Plaza and selection of the next city attorney.

Read on to learn more about what council is up to. Sign up to speak at next week’s public hearings.

Coming up – Parking price increases

Boulder is in the middle of updating its parking strategies and pricing to better reflect its climate goals and in some cases to pay for the costs of administering services.

The Neighborhood Parking Permit program for example covers less than 50% of its cost; the city’s stretched general fund covers the rest. The first NPP was established in 1994 and prices have not been adjusted since.

That may change after Tuesday if council approves recommended increases. Elected officials have been supportive in recent meetings including January and June study sessions.

A look at proposals:

Resident permits will increase from $17 to $30 per year in 2022 $40 in 2023 and $50 in 2024. Staff anticipates that the program will start to pay for itself by that time; additional increases will be reviewed by council.

More than 3400 households across 13 “zones” use the NPP.

Commuter permits will increase from $100 to $105 per quarter ($400 to $420 annually) next year then $110 in 2023 and $115 in 2024. The permits may go up in price by $20 per year thereafter to achieve cost recovery or beyond.

On-street parking will rise from $1.25 to $1.50 per hour starting in January. The city will keep studying “dynamic pricing” — rates that fluctuate with demand — for a future recommendation. Boulder owns and manages 33200 public spaces citywide: 30500 on-street 2700 off-street.

Rates in the city’s five parking garages will stay the same ($1.25 per hour) to encourage off-street parking but Boulder is doing away with graduated rates (in which the cost goes up after a certain amount of time). Any stay of longer than six hours in a day will cost $15. There is no overnight parking.

A successful $3 flat rate for downtown workers between the hours of 3 p.m. and 3 a.m. will be extended. Weekends and holidays will still be free in garages.

Parking violations may get costlier with the base rate for most fines increasing from $25 to $30. Subsequent violations will be more expensive: $45 for the second ticket and $60 for the third within a year of the first violation. Any parking violation that impacts other modes of transportation (like leaving a car in the bike lane) will automatically result in a $60 ticket.

Other adjustments will be visited in the future with further input from council and the community.

“Following Council’s determination on October 26 staff will issue materials and infographics to aid awareness of residents workers and visitors in Boulder” wrote customer service supervisor Leah Mayotte in response to emailed questions. “We appreciate the community’s participation in this phase of staff’s AMPS implementation work and Council’s direction and support.” (AMPS = Access Management Parking Strategy)

Restaurant rule change not recommended

A months-long kerfuffle over a planned restaurant at Boulder Reservoir inspired staff to recommend a new rule: Restaurants should be allowed at Boulder’s three regional parks without a special process that involves city boards and citizen review.

The ordinanceA piece of municipal (city-level) legislation. would make restaurants automatically allowed if they are located in a large (more than 100 acres) government-owned park and not within 500 feet of a private residence. Leases and liquor licenses for restaurants would still be subject to approval from the Beverage Licensing Authority city council and/or the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board all of which include public participation.

That would only apply to three areas in Boulder: the Rez Flatirons Golf Course and Valmont City Park. Flatirons has had dining facilities on-site since the ’90s (they’re being rebuilt now following the 2013 floods). The Rez was set to get a restaurant after a recent remodel; council approved a lease in February 2020 but neighbors have loudly protested the planned late hours and alcohol service among other aspects of the plan.

Planning Board unanimously rejected the proposals at its Oct. 7 meeting.

“Restaurants in public parks should be considered through a Use Review rather than as by-right uses” staff wrote of the board’s decision. “Application of the same standard to the three regional parks may not be appropriate. The board found that the regional parks have different characteristics and their differences may merit different approaches.”

This item will include a public hearing.

Also Tuesday: An update on work with XcelXcel Energy a publicly traded utility company based in Minnesota. Energy including possible purchase of city streetlights and under grounding of power lines.

What you missed last week

$462M budget approved for next year

City council unanimously approved a spending plan for 2022 with no changes to staff’s recommendation. The $462 million budget includes 1460 full-time employees $9 million for restoration of services and staff cut during COVID and $8 million in expanded offerings. It’s also a big year for capital spending (money that goes toward maintaining or adding new physical infrastructure like roads and bridges) with several big flood projects in the works.

As with the past several years Boulder Police Department is the single biggest department by staff with 288.9 full-time employees budgeted for. (There are many vacancies in the department due to resignations and retirements.) BPD’s $40.5M budget is also the single biggest source of spending for the general fund accounting for 25% of the city’s discretionary dollars. (Transportation’s $41 million budget is bigger but gets more of its revenue from dedicated funding.)

The plan is predicated on restaurant and retail sales continuing their recovery. Boulder with its thousands of in-commuting workers and college students was particularly hard hit by the pandemic but its economy also began churning more quickly than surrounding areas according to analysis from University of Colorado economists.

New city attorney named

Teresa Taylor Tate Longmont’s deputy city attorney will take over the top legal job in Boulder next month after council voted unanimously to accept the recommendation of the recruitment committee.

Tate bested Fort Collins’ assistant city attorney Adam Stephens and Sandra Llanes who has been serving as Boulder’s interim city attorney since Tom Carr left in June.

Llanes has been with the city for more than 19 years. Tate joined the city of Longmont in 2015 from a private practice according to the Daily Camera.

Tate’s start date has not been announced. Her salary which is subject to council approval and therefore public record will be between $230000 and $250000.

Legal settlements with Big Pharma will send $7M to Boulder

A handful of lawsuits with opioid manufacturers will be a godsend for communities struggling with the ongoing addiction crisis. Settlements are not yet final but Colorado is set to receive some $400 million from Johnson & Johnson AmerisourceBergen Cardinal Health and McKesson.

Of that some $7.4 million will make its way to Boulder over the next 18 years. The money can be used for a wide range of addiction treatment prevention and support including housing mental health treatment for substance users and their families and public education and awareness.

A regional governing board will be set up to distribute the funds. Representatives from public and behavioral health the court system law enforcement and human services agencies will hold seats; community members may fill non-voting spots including “those with lived experience with the opioid crisis.” Read more.

Rule change granted for Diagonal Plaza development

Boulder city council unanimously OK’d a workaround to allow more housing to be built at the beleaguered Diagonal Plaza. Developers will have to provide less open space than is required by city code. In exchange they guarantee that affordable housing will be built on the site.

That was the plan anyway. Boulder Housing Partners will add ~60 units to its existing community.

More than 175 market-rate rentals are planned as well. A neighborhood park will be added along with formal streets and sidewalks. If the open space rules hadn’t been relaxed for the property only 50-60 total homes would be allowed.

Odds and Ends

Overnight parking hours changed for open space

The city will no longer allow nighttime parking at Flagstaff an effort to curb partying litter and crime that have risen in recent years. Legal parking hours were restricted between the hours of 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. though special permits are available. Nighttime parking hours for all other city open space were changed too banning cars between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Read more.

We sat down and reviewed this new complimentary dining venue on Mardi Gras.

I don’t know about everybody else but I wasn’t that excited when Carnival Cruise Line first revealed they’d be adding Big Chicken to the lineup of complimentary venues.

It’s not that I don’t like chicken I didn’t see how a place specializing in chicken sandwiches would hold its own as a stand-alone venue. As it turns out I was wrong.

Shaq’s Big Chicken

Location : Lido Deck 16 aft

: Lido Deck 16 aft Type of venue: breakfast and lunch counter service included in the price of your cruise

The menu curated by the cruise line’s “Chief Fun Officer” Shaquille O’Neal — is simple but the chicken is delicious. Shaq’s chicken is tender crispy fresh and made to order making it a slam-dunk for Carnival.

Shaq’s Big Chicken is set up very much like Guy’s Burger Joint one of the most popular eateries in Carnival’s fleet. As at Guy’s the employees at Big Chicken are constantly making the sandwiches and fries so that you can walk up to the counter and walk away with your order quickly.

One thing Carnival has done here — and at several other spots around the ship — is set up with a back-and-forth barrier system to manage any lines that might form. It’s smart works and seems to help with social distancing.

The menu focuses mainly on chicken sandwiches with one strange additional item: a cheese omelet.

Shaq’s Big Chicken is open mornings so they have three breakfast items: a chicken-and-biscuit sandwich bacon (or sausage) an egg and cheese biscuit sandwich and an omelet. Both of the biscuit sandwiches are very good.

Now keep in mind I’m from Jersey… someone from the South where biscuits are practically a religion might not feel the same way.

I do not recommend the omelet unless all you like on your omelet is cheese. As far as I could tell you couldn’t add anything else to it. It feels like something of an afterthought. If for some reason you absolutely insist on getting an omelet here I’d suggest first grabbing a plate from the Lido Marketplace (it’s hard and weird eating an omelet out of a square bowl) and then taking your order over to the BlueIguana Cantina’s toppings bar and get a good sauce for it.

Breakfast is served from 7 am until 3 pm which allows you to grab breakfast food even well into lunch hours something that’s not always an option on some ships.

The rest of the menu is served all day long from 7 am until 5 pm every day including embarkation day. Yes unlike at McDonalds you are able to get fries before 10:30am. These fries aren’t anything like those you’ll find anywhere else on board. They don’t look special but they’re actually really good. They’re kind of like steak fries in that they’re cut wide but also thin enough that they stay nice and crispy.

The end result is that people who don’t like steak fries such as myself will also like them. How good are they? Good enough that it’s worth heading to Shaq’s just for fries even if you’re not interested in anything else on the menu.

The fries aren’t the only thing that are excellent at Shaq’s. The menu may be limited — there are only four sandwiches to pick from plus chicken tenders — but everything I tried was excellent.

Mardi Gras Dining Guide: Which Restaurants Are Complimentary?

To go with your chicken there is a sides-and-sauces bar offering pickles jalapeño slaw and potato salad as well as four sauces: Memphis BBQ Shaq sauce buffalo hot and BBQ ranch.

The jalapeño slaw was really good and the pickles were what you’d expect pickles to be but the potato salad was not great. The sauces were all really different but good in their own way and the french fries are an excellent way to try all the sauces before committing to putting one on your sandwich.

A couple of tips before hitting Big Chicken: First as I mentioned earlier grab a plate from the Lido Marketplace before heading here.

You’ll be glad you did especially if you want to try a couple of sauces. Also if you decide to get the chicken tenders ask for a double portion as a regular order consists of only two and you’ll want more.

Finally if you’re going the dark meat route I wouldn’t recommend asking for it on the Big Aristotle sandwich. That one comes with cheese bacon and fried onions… throw on dark meat and it combines in a way that feels a little too greasy.

On the other sandwiches however the dark meat is great.

I really like that Shaq’s Big Chicken is open both before and after most of the other lunch places because it adds flexibility to my day if I don’t want to eat from the buffet.

The one exception to the food being “fast” is if you want dark meat which is included as an option on the menu. Each time I asked for dark meat I was told it would be a seven-plus minute wait.

MENU: Shaq’s Big Chicken Restaurant on Carnival Cruise Line

I didn’t get confirmation that this is always the case but it seems likely. I think this is a shame because they’re essentially discouraging everyone from ordering dark meat by having the (relatively) long wait time reinforcing that they should only make it when it’s requested.

Maybe they’ll have it already cooked when the ship is sailing at full capacity. That said the dark meat is delicious flavorful and juicy so if you’re not in a rush and you like dark meat I highly recommend making the seven-minute time investment.

Oct. 23 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival Cruise Line today christened Mardi Gras at Port Canaveral Fla. at a ""Universe of Fun"" celebration befitting of the world's most fun cruise ship in the first ship naming ceremony held in the U.S. since the cruise industry's restart this summer.

Carnival's Chief Fun Officer Shaquille O'Neal attended the festivities and cut the ribbon of his first Big Chicken restaurant at sea that debuted on Mardi Gras when she began cruise operations on July 31.

Carnival Corporation President and CEO Arnold Donald Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy Mardi Gras' Godmother Miss Universe Dominican Republic Kimberly Jimenez and Carnival’s Chief Fun Officer Shaquille O’Neal usher in the “Universe of Fun” at Mardi Gras christening.

Miss Universe Dominican Republic Kimberly Jimenez served as the ship's Godmother and officially named the ship and was joined by Miss Universe Andrea Meza and Miss USA Asya Branch who sang the national anthem. The event featured a ""World of Nations"" flag procession to highlight the diversity of the 120 nationalities of Carnival crew members and of course a Mardi Gras parade with a Second Line Band.

""Today's naming ceremony of our flagship Mardi Gras the first in the industry since our restart of operations signifies excitement and optimism as we look to bring our entire fleet back into guest service by spring 2022"" said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line. ""This ship has been amazing guests during her pre-inaugural season and the celebration today with our Chief Fun Officer Shaq our Godmother Kimberly and so many special guests was extremely gratifying and emotional.""

Following remarks by Duffy and Carnival Corporation President and CEO Arnold Donald Carnival friends and partners Romero Britto Emeril Lagasse Kathie Lee Gifford Vanna White and Guy Fieri provided their congratulations on the ship's naming and helped bring the champagne bottle to the ship.

Godmother Jimenez blessed the ship in both English and her native Spanish and activated the traditional champagne bottle break officially naming the ship. In a celebration of the ship's name a special Mardi Gras parade with Duffy Donald and O'Neal leading it capped off the festivities.

Mardi Gras is the first cruise ship in the Americas to be powered by eco-friendly Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and the first to feature a roller coaster.

But — at least in maritime tradition — the ship did not get its designated name until Saturday when a special ceremony was held between cruises at Port Canaveral Cruise Terminal 3 presided over by the ship's godmother Miss Dominican Republic Kimberly Jimenez.

During the Miss Universe competition in May Jimenez received the “Spirit of Carnival” award for embodying the company’s values of fun friendship diversity and inclusion and was given the honor of serving as ship's godmother.

In case you missed it:Port Canaveral returns to profitability after cruises resume after 16 months of losses

Most of Saturday's hourlong ceremony in the Mardi Gras' main theater was a high-tech multimedia extravaganza. But in an homage to tradition Jimenez wished the ship and its crew ""smooth seas and following winds"" as she officially named the ship the Mardi Gras.

Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy said the debut of the Mardi Gras this summer at Port Canaveral represented ""a symbol of great excitement and renewal for our company"" as well as ""a beacon of hope"" as the cruise line returned to sailing following its extended COVID-19 shutdown.

Carnival Cruise Line now has 13 ships sailing from six ports. It will have 17 on the seas by the end of December and 19 by the end of February Duffy said.

Carnival Cruise Line's total fleet is 24 ships and it is the world's largest cruise brand.

It is one of nine brands that are part of the Carnival Corp. umbrella.

Carnival Corp. Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said the ship naming ceremony is ""a real joyful day"" for the company and ""an almost-sacred tradition"" in the maritime world.

Nothing like its namesake

The Mardi Gras is the namesake of Carnival's first ship which debuted in 1972. But the two ships are nothing alike Duffy noted.

The current 1130-foot-long Mardi Gras is Carnival's newest and largest ship with 17 passenger decks. It has a double-occupancy capacity of 5282 and a full capacity of 6465 with a crew of 1745.

The Mardi Gras is the first cruise ship based in North America to be powered by liquefied natural gas. It's also the first cruise ship with a roller coaster called Bolt Ultimate Speed Coaster which reaches a top speed of nearly 40 mph on its nearly 800-foot-long track elevated 187 feet above sea level.

The Mardi Gras also features six themed areas featuring dining entertainment and attractions. The areas are French Quarter Grand Central La Piazza The Lido Summer Landing and The Ultimate Playground.

Among the celebrity chef dining venues aboard the ship are Guy Fieri's Guy's Burger Joint and Guy's Smokehouse Brewhouse; Emeril Lagasse's Emeril’s Bistro 1396; and Rudi Sodamin's Rudi’s Seagrill.

Additionally basketball hall-of-famer Shaquille O'Neal on Saturday participated in the ribbon-cutting for his Shaq's Big Chicken Restaurant on the ship. O'Neal holds the title of Carnival's ""chief fun officer.""

He was mobbed by fans for selfies after cutting the ribbon. They continued photographing him as he sat down to eat a chicken sandwich at his restaurant which is the brand's first on a cruise ship.

Emphasis on diversity

Saturday's ceremony had the theme of ""Universe of Fun"" with Miss Universe Andrea Meza of Mexico and Miss USA Asya Branch participating as well.

Branch sung the National Anthem after a number of Carnival employees paraded into the theater carrying the flag of their home country. In all about 120 countries are represented on the company's staff.

Duffy was on the Miss Universe selection committee this spring. She said she chose Jimenez from among the contestants to be the ship's godmother because Jimenez best epitomized fun friendship diversity and inclusion.

The Mardi Gras on July 31 became the first cruise ship to sail out of Port Canaveral after a 16½-month cruise industry shutdown there because of the coronavirus pandemic.

It later was joined at Port Canaveral by six other ships with regular sailings out of Brevard — the Carnival Magic; the Disney Dream and Fantasy; the MSC Divina; and the Royal Caribbean Allure of the Seas and Mariner of the Seas.

With the Mardi Gras' naming ceremony completed the ship was sailing out of Port Canaveral later Saturday on a seven-night cruise with ports of call at San Juan Puerto Rico; Amber Cove Dominican Republic; and Nassau Bahamas.

Duffy — who is celebrating her 40th wedding anniversary on this cruise — promised Jimenez that there would be another special celebration when the ship docked at Amber Cove and Dominicans welcomed Jimenez back to her home country.

Posted on: October 23 2021 10:46h.

Last updated on: October 23 2021 05:13h.

Sports betting continues to spread across the United States 26 states plus DC now with legal sportsbooks operational. But the gambling activity last week embarked to its largest jurisdiction yet — international waters.

Legal sports betting was limited to Nevada prior to the US Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling that struck down the federal ban. The landmark verdict gave states the right to dictate their own laws on sports betting.

Sports betting is now seemingly everywhere television commercials during pro and college sports flooded with spots from DraftKings FanDuel Caesars Sportsbook and BetMGM.

And as sports betting continues to gain new market access — and lure in more and more sports bettors — the world’s largest cruise line is making sure the action doesn’t stop once players board their ships.

Carnival Cruise Line announced in February that it planned to incorporate sports betting in its onboard casinos once sailing resumed post-COVID-19. That officially began last week as the first bet was wagered onboard the Majestic Princess.

Keeping Amenities Current

Carnival subsidiary Princess Cruises is the first cruise line to offer passengers sports betting upon entry into international waters. Princess is operating its sports gambling odds and lines through its Ocean Sportsbook.

The Ocean Sportsbook interactive platform was developed by UK-based Miomni Gaming. Sportradar provides the book with its odds through a satellite feed that reaches the ships sailing the high seas.

Being that sports betting is everywhere it only makes sense to give those folks that may enjoy gambling but don’t really enjoy sitting in the casino a chance to win big even at sea” John Maddox owner and operator of Travel by John a cruise booking service told TravelPulse.

Most Princess ships come with a Las Vegas-style casino that offers slot machines table games bingo and now sports betting. Passengers can also gamble for real money onboard on their mobile phones with the MedallionClass app.

The majority of travel experts told TravelPulse that incorporating sports betting into the cruising experience is a no-brainer.

“Adding any additional forms of entertainment for cruise passengers to enjoy is a plus for the industry” Cruise Vacations International’s Jeremy Hall opined. “I don’t see sports betting having any negative effect on passengers as it seems the wagers are placed either in the casino or on the app. Gambling and watching sports onboard are both staples for many cruise passengers so kudos for those who found a way to blend both together.”

Cruise Casino Regulations

Carnival Cruise Line and its Princess Cruises are both members of the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). As components of the world’s largest cruise industry trade group Carnival and Princess are required to regulate their ship casinos under the same regulatory standards the Nevada Gaming Control Board imposes on its land-based casinos.

CLIA inspects each member’s casinos annually to assure that the games are fair and regulatory conditions are being followed.

However when a patron has a dispute gamblers have few resources other than the on-ship casino manager. There is no outside governing authority that allows a customer to file a complaint.

The CLIA stresses that “gambling is strictly for the enjoyment of the passengers who choose to avail themselves of this form of entertainment.”"

In order to cope with market growth and consumer needs airlines and shippers have worked together to develop efficient handling techniques and packaging methods to ensure the delivery of perishable goods is always in first class condition.

Shipping perishable goods by air is so well trusted that over 80000 flowers are transported every 24 hours alone. Air cargo ships over 120000 tonnes of Kenyan flowers every single year. In addition a global survey conducted by International Data Company (IDC) indicates that 35% of shoppers will have spent over 25% of their grocery budget online as of 2020. Other perishable air freight includes cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

What Is a Perishable Good?

Perishable goods are time and/or temperature-sensitive items. They require fast and safe delivery to maintain quality and effectiveness. Due to a short shelf life and the very particular storage requirements shipping perishable goods by air is a preferred means of transport.

With each type of perishable good there are specific shipping requirements. The kind of good it is determines how it must be stored. Certain perishable goods need lower temperatures to slow down respiration and therefore slow the ripening process and reduce any harmful effects on the perishable cargo. Meat and seafood should be frozen to avoid harmful microorganisms infecting the product.

Establishing and following appropriate guidelines to maintain the high quality of perishable cargo being shipped ensures as little loss as possible during the shipping process.

Types of Perishables Goods

The transport by air of perishables such as fruits vegetables seafood meat dairy products and flowers continues to increase globally on a yearly basis in line with a growing consumer demand for healthy and fresh produce all year round irrespective of seasonality. Considering the short shelf-life of perishable products air cargo is the preferred mode of transportation providing a unique capability to quickly react to changing conditions.

Some of the perishable goods shipped by air are:

Fruits

Vegetables

Spices and Dried Herbs (although most are sent by sea)

Flowers Tropical Flowers and Potted Plants

Cut Flowers and Florist Greens

Meat and Meat Products

Seafood

Shellfish

Cheese and Dairy Products

Eggs

Baked Goods and Confectionary

Cosmetics Products

Pharmaceutical Products

Frozen Food

Each item has its own packaging and storage requirements and more information can be found in the Perishable Cargo Regulations (PCR). Some items also fall under the Temperature Control Regulations (TCR). Pharmaceutical items have very particular guidelines and you can find more information in this article What Does the Healthcare Industry Look for When Choosing a Temperature Controlled Transportation Partner?





Air Transport of Cut Flowers





Fresh cut flowers have become a global business reaching US $34347.23 million in 2019. While the United States and the United Kingdom are the largest buyers of cut flowers the largest growers are the Netherlands Ecuador Colombia Kenya and Ethiopia. Due to the short shelf life of fresh-cut flowers the need for fast shipping with stabilized and specific shipping conditions is required. Shipping fresh-cut flowers by air is the only method that makes sense.

How to Ship Perishable Foods?

Depending on what you type of perishable good you ship the packaging and shipping instructions might vary. Some foods degrade quickly and others tolerate the rigors of transport much better. No matter the case following the standard packaging labelling and handling procedures found in the IATA guidelines ensures successful shipping.

The best way to ship perishables is by following the instructions outlined in the Perishable Cargo Regulations (PCR) Manual. In short the most important aspects of air transportation of perishables are time and temperature management which therefore need to be supported by appropriate handling process and packaging methods to ensure food safety and other requirements.

Applying Regulations to Perishables Cargo

When it comes to perishable air freight there are regulations in place to ensure the goods are delivered safely and intact. These regulations apply to both the Shipper and the Carrier as they both play in the shipping and handling of the perishable goods air freight.





Shipper Responsibilities





The Shipper or his authorized agent which includes the importer or freight forwarder has to meet the following guidelines:

Declare all details of the shipment

Provide details of booking special handling or conditions needed

Obtain permits including CITES

Marking labeling and documentation

Providing a primary contact

Training staff of their responsibilities

Communicate when ownership ends

Carrier Responsibilities



Just as the Shipper has guidelines that must be adhered to the Carrier has responsibilities regarding the safe delivery of perishable goods. The carrier must consider:

Any regulations or restrictions which may delay the perishable cargo

Communicating discrepancies that could impact the load safety of the crew aircraft structure or health of employees

Whether the goods will arrive in a timely fashion

If sufficient space has been allotted on the flight

Whether special storage requirements are available

Whether special handling is required

If segregation is needed from other cargo

Whether Shipper arranged for appropriate permits

Whether Shipper provided all necessary information

If all security measures have been met

If alternative procedures are in place in case of flight delay

If necessary customs procedures have been met

There are other special conditions that must be met depending on the situation at hand and you can find those in the IATA Perishable Cargo Regulation (PCR) Manual.





What Else to Know About Shipping Perishable Goods?





Ensuring the integrity of perishable goods while shipping means all stakeholders must work closely and promptly to keep cold chain logistics running as smoothly as possible. Understanding each step of the shipping process is vital for the stakeholders involved as working in conjunction ensures that the perishable goods arrive intact and in the best possible condition.





Traceability & Tracking





Traceability and tracking play an essential role when it comes to how to ship perishables. While other systems have been used to track shipments RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is currently the latest tracking system and is showing significant advantages.

Traceability is essential for food shipments as they move through the production and distribution stages in case there are any issues regarding safety such as an e. coli breakout. Traceability should create a link between their origins processing distribution and location after its delivery.

Claims



To ship perishables comes with risks even when the utmost care is taken due to the many factors involved in the deterioration process of perishables. Shippers and carriers alike need to look at the weak points and work together to find solutions to reduce the number of claims being made for perishable goods gone bad during the shipping process. According to the PCR fruits fish and seafood and cut flowers make up about 40% of all claims.

There are various reasons for the claims which can vary from product appearance decay damaged packaging and melted refrigerant. No matter the reason for the claim it is an unfortunate experience for all parties as it costs time and money. If you need help with such claims the IATA Cargo Claims & Loss Prevention Handbook serves as a practical guide for effective processing of air cargo claims and the resource for all industry stakeholders who are concerned with effective cargo claims handling and loss prevention.

CITES





CITES or The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora regulates the international trade of wild animal and plant species including their parts and products through a series of permits and certificates. Supplying all the pertinent information is before shipment helps avoid delays at customs that could harm the animals and plants being shipped. The shipping of live plants and animals takes additional rules and regulations to ensure their safe transport.

How to Pack for Perishable Air Freight?





When packaging perishable goods for transport by air the packaging design must account for changes in altitude maintaining internal temperatures while adjusting to external temperature. It should be sturdy enough to allow for stacking and withstand the rigors of shipping and perishable cargo handling while on the ground and in the air alike.





Common perishable goods packaging used in air freight include:

Fiberboard Packaging

Expanded Polystyrene Packages (EPS)

Rigid Plastic Packaging

Flexible Plastic Packaging

Vacuum and Modified Atmosphere Packages

Wooden Packaging

Metal Cans and Canisters

When shipping perishable goods it is crucial to use appropriate labels including “THIS WAY UP” which should be affixed or imprinted on the side of the box.

Some perishable goods can be shipped with a single packaging but more and more perishables need to be shipped in combination packages meaning having an outer box in addition to the inner package to prevent damage.

Other outer coverings may be used; for example some countries require pest netting a fine plastic net that fits over the pallet to prevent pests. These are used for fruits vegetables and flowers. Another type is polymer films wrapped around the pallet to protect the shipment from getting wet and prevent leakage.

Proper Documentation for Shipping Perishable Goods





When it comes to shipping by air proper documentation is crucial. Perishable air freight requires a variety of documents to be in order beforehand so that the customs process and any steps during the import export transit quarantine or health requirement process are as smooth as possible to avoid delaying the shipment. These documents can include Shipper’s Declaration of Goods Air Waybill CITES proper labeling and making.

Air Waybill





The Air Waybill is a required document for all perishable air cargo shipments and should be filled out completely. It contains pertinent information such as Shipper’s name and address and the Consignee’s name and address. The Carrier’s handling information should be included as well as the nature and quantity of goods.

Ideally everyone in the air transport supply chain should be using the electronic version of the Air Waybill (eAWB). The eAWB is a fast and easy way to share and store information with all stakeholders involved in the process.





Labels





Each perishable air freight shipment should be labeled with a standard IATA “perishable” label. This can be affixed to or imprinted on the packaging but it must meet IATA guidelines as outlined in the Perishable Cargo Regulations (PCR).

All other necessary labels must be used as appropriate. For example “This Way Up” to indicate the handling position or “Dangerous Goods” when using dry ice or batteries. When that is the case Shippers should also refer to the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR).



Marking





All perishable air cargo shipments should be easily identifiable. This means that the Shipper should clearly mark each package with the Consignee’s name address and phone number as well as an emergency contact. It should also be marked with any special information regarding the content if required.

Special markings are required if the shipment contains dry ice as per the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR).

IATA CEIV Fresh Program





The transport of perishable goods by air increases each year as consumer demand rises. Due to the special time and temperature needs necessary to maintain the integrity of perishable goods while being transported a fair amount of standard procedures should be met. The aviation industry felt there was a lack of standardized procedures and best practices so they developed the CEIV (Center of Excellence for Independent Validators) Fresh Program. This program allows organizations the opportunity to meet the standards of perishable logistics with excellence.





Becoming CEIV Fresh certified takes the Perishable Cargo Regulations a step further ensuring a standardized and efficient process that increases staff competency and prevents food loss and waste.

Why Training Is Necessary?





Due to the delicate and quickly deteriorating nature of perishable goods their need for time and temperature control and proper packaging it is important that stakeholders are well trained for such shipping and perishable cargo handling to prevent loss and damage. Mitigating the loss or damage of pharmaceuticals plants and food products is important for al those involved in perishable shipping. As previously mentioned becoming CEIV certified greatly benefits the organizations involved in the process of door-to-door delivery of perishable goods. You can also consult the IATA Shipping Perishable Cargo course which provides professionals with a detailed insight into both the handling of perishable cargo and the practical knowledge of the most up-to-date regulations.





Where to Find More Information?





There are many specific guidelines regarding the shipping of perishable air cargo. The IATA Perishable Cargo Regulations (PCR) is published annually under the authority of IATA Cargo Services Conference and is updated by the LAPB (Live Animals and Perishables Board) along with the TTWG (Time and Temperature Working Group).





IATA (International Air Transport Association) helps stakeholders worldwide get the information they need to comply with the latest rules and regulations regarding how to ship perishables among other aviation guidelines. IATA has promoted safe reliable air services for more than 75 years. You can find more information about them at IATA.org.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTEwLzEyMzcxMDIuc2h0bWw_aWQ9MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China sends new satellite for space debris mitigation technology verification,"China successfully launches the Shijian-21 satellite into preset orbit via a Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China’s Sichuan Province on the morning of October 24 2021.

China successfully launched Shijian-21 satellite into preset orbit via a Long March-3B carrier rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan Province on Sunday morning which marked the 39th space launch of China space [including private sector] in 2021 tying with historical record of 39 launches set in 2018 and 2020.The Shijian-21 satellite is tasked to verify space debris mitigation technology the Global Times learned from space authorities. The Sunday mission marked the 393rd flight of the Long March carrier rocket family.The satellite was developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology. Meanwhile sources with the academy declined to reveal further details of the spacecraft.""The Long March-3B carrier rocket has made three technological improvements for the Sunday launch including cancelling pressure test on the third stage tank which further optimized the pre-launch preparation and enhanced the reliability of the type"" said Zhang Tao a deputy chief designer with the Long March-3B carrier rocket developer China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) in a statement that the CALT provided to the Global Times on Sunday.The Sunday mission also marked the 39th space launch mission for China in 2021 [including two failures by private rocket firm iSpace and a successful one by the Kuaizhou-1A rocket developed by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp] having caught up with the record number set in 2020 and 2018.According to the CALT the Long March-3B carrier rocket is expected to conduct three more launches before January 1 2022.Space observers reached by the Global Times expressed their confidence that the total number of space launches for China this year is progressing steadily toward to the 40-plus goal set at the beginning of this year.As the centerpiece of the busy space launch year of 2021 five missions scheduled for the construction of China Space Station including two manned spaceflight missions of Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-13 have been successfully delivered with a perfect success rate.China National Space Administration established its Space Debris Monitoring and Application Center in June 2015 which has served as a responsible body for tracking waste analyzing hazards developing prevention and disposal plans setting up a database and communicating with other nations and international organizations.Space debris refer to the waste left in space from human activities and also known as the ""space junk"" including defunct artificial objects such as spent rocket stages and old satellites to fragments from disintegration erosion and collisions.The average clash speed of some thousand tons of existing space debris reached 10 kilometers per second and any of them with the size larger than 1 centimeter could completely destroy spacecraft and even those with smaller size at millimeter and nanometer level could also affect the performance of spacecraft or paralyze them according to the administration. In June this year  the International Space Station was hit by a fast-moving space junk but did not cause too much damage according to media reports. Space junk hurtling towards the station smashed into one of its robotic arms leaving a hole.China Manned Space Agency urged on October 15 right before sending the second batch of taikonauts to the Tianhe space station core module for a record six-month stay that relevant foreign space agencies and organizations are urged to pay attention to the data on the Chinese spacecraft that kept updated on the website of the agency to avoid possible collisions and ensure the safety of Chinese taikonauts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzI0L2Flcm9tZXhpY28tcmVwb3J0ZWQtaXRzLWZpcnN0LXBvc2l0aXZlLXF1YXJ0ZXItcmVzdWx0cy1zaW5jZS10aGUtcGFuZGVtaWMtYmVnYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aeroméxico Reports Its First COVID-19-era Positive Quarter Results,"[ Top Story ] By Juan Pedro Sanchez Zamudio

On June 30 2020 Aeroméxico announced the beginning of a voluntary financial restructuring process under Chapter 11 of the legislation of the U.S. which has been carried out while continuing to operate as a going concern and offering services to its clients with the same quality that characterizes it.

Despite this business decision the Mexican flag carrier has known how to strengthen its financial position as well as protect and preserve its operations and assets as well as implement the necessary operational adjustments to overcome the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the financial information presented by the airline to the Mexican Stock Exchange during the 2021 third quarter Aeroméxico’s revenues were $655 million an increase of 32.2% compared to the second quarter of 2021 and 27.9% below the revenues recorded in the same period of 2019.

Aeroméxico’s capacity measured in Available Seat Kilometers (ASKs) increased 24.8% compared to the second quarter of 2021 mainly as a result of the sequential recovery in the domestic and international markets.

Compared to the third quarter of 2019 capacity decreased 26.9% derived from the negative impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Revenue per ASK increased 5.9% compared to the second quarter of 2021 and decreased 1.3% against 2019.

The EBITDA registered during the third quarter of 2021 was $180 million which represents an improvement of $87 million compared to the second quarter of 2021 and a decrease of $35 million compared to the third quarter of 2019.

Aeromexico recorded an operating income of $16 million which represents the first quarter with operating income since the global pandemic began.

This important achievement within the framework of the Mexican carrier’s financial restructuring process represents an improvement of $76 million compared to the second quarter of 2021.

The cost per ASK was $67 which represented a decrease of 7.9% compared to the second quarter of 2021 and an increase equivalent to 4.0% compared to the third quarter of 2019.

The variation is mainly due to the increase in fuel costs of 0.8% and the reduction in the capacity of 26.9%.

The cost per ASK in U.S. dollars was $0.068 which represents a decrease of 6.8% compared to the second quarter of 2021 and an increase equivalent to 1.5% compared to the same period in 2019.

As of September 30 the cash balance was $930 million. Excluding restricted cash cash was $873 million dollars.

During the quarter the net cash flow from operating activities was positive by $60 million accumulating two consecutive quarters with positive operating generation.

Aeroméxico’s active fleet is currently 122 aircraft which represented an increase of 3.4% compared to the previous quarter.

Aeroméxico has successfully managed its network of destinations ensuring that its operations generate positive cash flows.

During the third quarter the Mexican carrier continued to see a recovery in travel demand supported by the strengthening of its national and international network.

News Release Whitehall 22 October 2021: The Royal Navy has successfully tested a new missile system designed to protect the UK’s new aircraft carriers from attacks by swarms of small boats.

During operations in the Pacific Ocean with the UK Carrier Strike Group HMS Defender’s Wildcat helicopter of 815 Naval Air Squadron fired the Martlet lightweight missile at an inflatable target in the sea – known in the navy as the big red tomato. It is the first time this type of missile has been launched on frontline operations by the Royal Navy after rigorous testing at ranges off the UK coast by the Yeovilton-based Wildcat Maritime Force last year.

In 0.3 seconds the missile detached from the Wildcat HMA Mk2 helicopter accelerating to one and a half times the speed of sound towards its target. The purpose of the missile system is to add another layer of protection around the Royal Navy’s aircraft carriers with the Wildcats able to carry up to 20 of the laser-sensor missiles that can be used against stationary and moving targets.

Captain James Blackmore Carrier Strike Group’s Air Wing Commander said: “Martlet is a new air to surface lightweight multi-role missile recently introduced into service for the Wildcat helicopter and provides an offensive and defensive capability against small boats and maritime targets that may pose a threat to the Carrier Strike Group.

“The Wildcat is a phenomenally versatile aircraft and the inclusion of up to 20 missiles on each of the four embarked aircraft adds yet another potent capability to the Air Wing and the Carrier Strike Group.

“This first firing during an operational deployment not only gives confidence in the end to end weapon kill chain but also offers an overt demonstration of one of the many strike capabilities provided by the Air Wing from within the Task Group.”

HMS Defender is currently deployed with the UK Carrier Strike Group on its maiden global operational deployment. And the Martlet missile available for all Wildcats deployed on the task group is part of the ring of protective steel around carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. Frigates HMS Kent and HMS Richmond also embark Wildcats along with Type 45 destroyer HMS Diamond. Meanwhile HMS Queen Elizabeth adds Merlin helicopters and F-35 Lightning stealth fighter jets to the protective ring.

It's one of these...

It's FUZZY! (Craig Allen photo). It's a moth-in-making. (Craig Allen photo) loading...

Come to think of it I am starting to see lots of these fuzzy guys making like chickens...crossing the road.

What's up with that?

Well...

It has been said over the years that the ""woolly bear caterpillar"" with its 13 segments of black and brown is a barometer of the coming winter weather.

Hmmmm.......

The true woolly bear caterpillar is the larval form of the Pyrrharctia isabella the Isabella Tiger Moth.

Woolly bears like other caterpillars hatch from eggs laid by a female moth in warm weather.

The fully-grown woolly bear then searches for a warm winter home like under tree bark or between rocks or logs.

I'm catching this caterpillar in...mid cross! (Craig Allen photo). I'm catching this caterpillar in...mid cross. (Craig Allen photo) loading...

This is why they are seen crossing New Jersey roads or sidewalks this time of year.

In the spring they spin cocoons and transform inside the cocoon into a moth. And the cycle begins again.

The title of this fact-finding article grabbed your attention right?

So how did this particular caterpillar's ""forecasting"" start?

In the fall of 1948 Dr. C.H. Curran the curator of insects at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City took his wife 40 miles north of the city to ""Bear Mountain State Park"" to look at woolly bear caterpillars.

Curran collected as many caterpillars as he could in a single day determining the average number of reddish-brown segments. He then forecasts the coming winter weather through a reporter friend at the ""New York Herald Tribune.""

Dr. Curran's experiment which he continued over the next eight years attempted to prove a weather 'rule of thumb.'

According to legend the wider that middle brown section is (the more brown segments there are) the milder the coming winter will be.

So a narrow brown band is said to predict a harsh winter.

Is there any scientific validity to this rule of thumb?

Dr. Curran knew that his samples were small. One would have to look at a vast number of caterpillars in any location over many years to form any scientific conclusion.

Most scientists discount the folklore of woolly bear predictions as just that: folklore.

Wide brown band...MILD winter? (Craig Allen photo). Wide brown band...MILD winter? (Craig Allen photo) loading...

Look at my woolly bear photos above...and form your own conclusion.

Then there's this caterpillar:

NO brown segments? YIKES! (Craig Allen photo). NO brown segments? YIKES. (Craig Allen photo) loading...

My disclaimer: Just remember...my sample is...small.

Thanks.

Me....I'll talk with the TRUE weather source: NJ101.5 Chief Meteorologist Dan Zarrow.

This butterfly is from the family of brushfoot butterflies (so named for the bristles on its legs) found east of the Rockies. It’s another one of those butterflies with eyespots.

Despite its name the common buckeye is not really that common; in fact its numbers vary considerably from year to year and in some it is not abundant at all. These butterflies do not migrate the way monarchs do: In the spring buckeyes shift their way north to our area gradually as the weather becomes too warm in the South. They often arrive in June but sometimes arrive as early as May or as late as July. In the fall they work their way South as the weather cools in the North.

Climate change may be affecting these butterflies; they have been staying in our region longer in the fall and sometimes have been arriving earlier in the spring. These butterflies have been documented arriving in our area annually since the mid-1800s including in Cambridge in the mid-1930s. (Though most likely around in earlier years the butterfly was not documented before this time.)

This butterfly’s life cycle takes up to 45 days so an early June arrival provides enough time for two generations of buckeyes to be born in our region. You’ll see these guys in the greatest numbers in September.

The common buckeye caterpillar is black with orange spots and spiky bristles that are blue near the base. The caterpillar stage lasts two to four weeks. Then the caterpillar forms a brown chrysalis which is difficult to spot hidden among twigs or leaves. This stage lasts one to two weeks. Finally the adult butterfly emerges. A day after emerging it begins to drink flower nectar.

The female butterfly then lays eggs one at a time on leaf buds or on the upper side of leaves. To find the best leaves she drums her legs to pierce a leaf’s outer layer and “tastes” with her feet the chemicals that are present in the leaf. She prefers bitter-tasting leaves that produce greater concentrations of iridoid glycosides a chemical compound that releases a hormone that activates the digestive system.

Once that sole green egg hatches the caterpillar eats the leaves and stores the iridoid glycosides in its body. This chemical deters predators such as ants wasps and birds. The concentration of iridoid glycosides in a caterpillar is a strong predictor of whether a caterpillar will become food for a predator. The greater the concentration the less likely it is that a caterpillar will be eaten.

This butterfly changes color over time to help it camouflage itself better as colors change with the seasons – in the spring plants are lighter in color but by fall become darker brown; the undersides of the butterfly’s hind wings are tan in the summer and darker brown in the autumn to match.

Plants in the snapdragon plantain and acanthus families are good host plants for this butterfly. Nectar plants for adults are tickseed sunflower aster gumweed knapweed and chicory. In the fall the adult butterflies seem to especially like to drink nectar from late-season asters.

Common Buckeyes prefer sunny meadows open fields and clearings with low vegetation. They like to bask on patches of bare soil. Buckeyes adapt to disturbed areas and will breed in weedy lots and edges of fields. When settlers cleared New England forests in the 1600s through the mid-1800s they increased the habitat for the common buckeye. The numbers of common buckeyes are expected to continue to increase in New England along with global temperatures.

In addition the new addition to Lynx Yachts’ fleet has a spacious lazarette accessible from the swim platform and 75 square metres of open deck space. The owner’s personal Land Rover Defender also has its own bay on board allowing for land-based expeditions as well as maritime ones.

Filippo Rossi sales and marketing manager at Lynx Yachts said “It has been a pleasure to work with this client. His passion for yachting and for the sea is infectious. He knows exactly how he wants to use his YXT and this has helped us to adapt the vessel for him.”

Key features – for owner and guest comfort – include a spa gym and fitness area (plus a basketball court). There’s also a helipad laundry facilities and accommodation for up to three guests in a double cabin with Pullman bed. There is space for four crewmembers.

The YXT 24 will be powered by twin 850hp C12.9 Caterpillar diesel engines for a maximum speed of 13 knots.

And what does it mean for the pending sale of Playtech’s forex division Finalto?

Which former longtime LCG executive was hired as Trading 212’s new COO?

What did ASIC say would happen to the temporary CFD leverage rules that were put in place earlier this year?

Which company did Cboe buy to re-enter the crypto business?

Answers to these questions and a whole lot more appeared first or exclusively this week at FNG. Some of the most read and commented-on FX industry news stories to appear over the past seven days on FNG included:

Playtech to be acquired by Australia’s Aristocrat for £2.1 billion. Online gaming tech and financial brokerage firm Playtech plc (LON:PTEC) has announced that it has agreed to be acquired by Australia based gaming giant Aristocrat Leisure Ltd (ASX:ALL) for £2.1 billion (USD $2.9 billion) in cash. The price of 680 pence per Playtech share being offered by Aristocrat – which has been agreed to by Playtech’s board – represents a 58% premium to Playtech’s closing price of 429.2 pence on Friday. Playtech’s aggressive move to divest its Financials division – Finalto and Markets.com – makes a lot more sense now in the light of the Aristocrat deal. Playtech had seemingly been receiving and entertaining offers for the entire company by larger gaming firms such as Aristocrat but none of the potential suitors were interested in its (non-core) FX and CFD businesses.

Exclusive: Trading 212 adds George Mantilas as COO. FNG Exclusive… FNG has learned that UK/Bulgaria based online broker Trading 212 has hired George Mantilas as the company’s new Chief Operating Officer. He has also been added to the board of the group’s London based FCA regulated entity Trading 212 UK Limited. George Mantilas had worked together with recently hired Trading 212 CEO Mukid Chowdhury at London Capital Group (LCG) for a number of years at the end of the last decade. Mr. Chowdhury came on board LCG as UK CEO and Chief Financial Officer in 2016 where Mr. Mantilas was Head of Dealing Operations and later Head of Markets. After spending more than 11 years at LCG George Mantilas left in 2020 alongside longtime LCG CEO Charles-Henri Sabet moving to Sabet’s new Swiss based online neo-bank/neo-brokerage firm FlowBank where he was Head of Data Infrastructure for the past year.

Australia CFD trading leverage rules extended to 2031 by ASIC. Australia financial regulator ASIC as it recently hinted it would has announced that it is proposing to extend the “temporary” CFD brokerage and trading rules in Australia to 2031 effectively making them permanent. ASIC announced the new rules in October 2020 as a temporary measure with its product intervention order set to expire on 23 May 2022 unless extended. The rules became effective earlier this year on March 29 2021. The rules basically matched those which were put into place in the UK and Europe in mid 2018 although the UK has since gone further and banned crypto CFDs altogether.

Cboe to enter digital asset space via acquisition of ErisX. Cboe Global Markets Inc a leading provider of global market infrastructure and tradable products announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Eris Digital Holdings LLC (ErisX). ErisX operates a U.S. based digital asset spot market a regulated futures exchange and a regulated clearing house. Ownership of ErisX presents a unique opportunity for Cboe to enter the digital asset spot and derivatives marketplaces through a digital-first platform developed with industry partners to focus on robust regulatory compliance data and transparency. Cboe plans to operate the digital asset business as Cboe Digital.

We believe that Colliers is an extraordinary business trading an ordinary valuation multiple. The company is listed on the NASDAQ and on the Toronto stock exchange. In this article we refer to the US listed shares and all amounts are in US Dollars.

Colliers earns revenue through four sources (% revenue as of TTM Q3 2018):

Outsourcing & Advisory (38% of revenue) – outsources property management and property valuation services Sales Brokerage (28% of revenue) – commissions from negotiating sales / purchase of property Lease Brokerage (32% of revenue) – commissions from negotiating leases Investment Management (2%) – overseeing dedicated RE funds

Q3 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc

Geographically the company is concentrated in North America but growing more quickly in other markets and becoming less US-centric. Colliers has a stellar business and long secular growth opportunities as the commercial real estate (CRE) market outside of North America is incredibly fragmented leading to many opportunities for growth via acquisition.

The commercial real estate business is durable at minimal risk of technological obsolescence (each lease or sale is individually negotiated and the commission amounts are trivial compared to the transaction values) and largely fragmented outside of North America which means that the industry leading companies can continue to grow through consolidation for years to come. In the industry we like Colliers to the most due to the strength of its management team and excellent history of capital allocation.

Moat

Colliers has a moat – a durable competitive advantage. This is evident from the company’s sustained high return on invested capital (over 15% each year during the past decade). Colliers operates in an industry were reputation relationships and scale matter more than price. The commissions earned by Colliers are tiny compared to the mammoth transaction sizes in most real estate projects and the end market itself is price insensitive. What we mean by this is that cutting real estate commissions by 20% does not result in more business – in fact that matters to sellers / buyers is their outlook on the CRE market availability of financing etc. not the fees charged by Colliers or their competitors.

Colliers is a global franchise the fourth largest CRE company in the world – a business that took decades to build and one that can’t be easily replicated. This is a fee-based service business that does not require CapEx to grow. All profits can be returned to shareholders or used for acquisitions. The company has compounded shareholder value by 16% for over 20 years now despite operating in what is a traditionally very cyclical industry.

Growth

Colliers operates in an enormous industry ($160 billion USD 2017) that is still highly fragmented. The top 5 firms account for less than 20% of sales. For comparison the top five global accounting firms generate approximately 75% of industry revenue. Colliers currently has less than 2% of the total addressable market and the market itself should grow in line with the value of CRE globally. Historically growth has been balanced between acquisitions (2/3) and internal growth (1/3).

The company has a multi-decade consolidation opportunity ahead of it and has deployed over $600 million in acquisitions over the last 12 months. The latest acquisition to close was announced on January 4th 2019 and encompassed four offices in the Mid-Atlantic Region with 340 real estate professionals. Of note is the company’s acquisition strategy which Colliers calls the “partnership model”. Other brokers (JLL CBRE etc) favor bolt-on acquisitions of entire real estate teams. Colliers on the other hand instead of acquiring 100% of a smaller brokerage favors acquiring a controlling interest and allowing the former management to retain a minority interest (20-30%). Colliers also acquires a call option on this minority interest. This call option allows the company to acquire the remaining interest at a pre-approved multiple at any time in the future. This minority interest is carried on the B/S as “redeemable non-controlling interests” and totaled $335 million as of Q3 2018.

We believe this form of “partnering” with targets improves broker retention and productivity. This approach provides Colliers a competitive advantage when seeking to close deals. We believe that Colliers’ corporate culture remains highly entrepreneurial reflecting the character of the founder Jay Hennick who only recently stepped down as CEO and owns more than 10% of the company.

Capital Allocation

Colliers has demonstrated excellent capital allocation in the past – it has been rational and logical given the company’s opportunity set. We believe that given the fragmented nature of its end market the best use of the company’s capital is aggressive expansion through continued acquisitions. The company continues to do so with thirteen deals announced or closed in 2018. Anytime a company pursues growth through acquisitions it can be a dangerous strategy as it is easy to overpay and destroy shareholder value. It is therefore imperative that management own a large share in the company and that is the case with Colliers. Management and insiders own over 20% of outstanding shares. We believe this is sufficient protection to guard against doing deals for deals sake.

Colliers has also shown that it cares about maximizing shareholder value. In 2015 the company spun off FirstService (FSV) it’s association / property management business which has fundamentally different characteristics than the CRE business of Colliers and wasn’t being fully valued within the combined entity. The company was right to pursue the spinoff as FSV has more stable and sticky revenue which is valued more highly by the market.

In summary the company’s capital allocation is straight forward: acquire more real estate brokerages and continue to consolidate the market.

Valuation

The company makes heavy use of “adjusted” earnings and adjusted EBITDA. A heavy reliance on adjusted numbers is usually a red flag that must be accounted for. In the case of Colliers the most important adjustment to earnings is the accounting treatment of minority interests. As we have stated previously the company usually acquires a controlling stake in a bolt-on acquisition with the local team retaining 20-30% shares. This creates a minority interest which is both callable and puttable to the company – usually at the same price. The strike price is calculated as a multiple of EBITDA and therefore the value of this liability is adjusted annually as the EBITDA of the underlying minority interests increases. This change in value runs through the P/L and depressed GAAP earnings. This type of accounting treatment may be conservative but it dramatically understates the earnings power of the company especially in years of strong organic growth. The value of the company is understated because while the liability arising from the puttable minority interest is recorded on the balance sheet and its change runs through the P/L there is no corresponding recording on the asset side as Colliers own majority interests in all the partnerships reflected in the minority interest.

As of January 8 2019 Colliers share price is down 30% from its recent highs reflecting concerns about a global economic slowdown and downturn in the CRE market. Median analyst estimates for adjusted EPS are $4.57 $5.03 for 2019 and 2020 respectively. Shares are currently trading at 12.7x 2019 EPS estimates. We estimate that adjusted EBITDA is approaching a $300 million annual run rate. The company’s current Enterprise values is approximately $3370 million. Therefore Colliers shares are trading under 12x EV/ adjusted EBITDA – cheap for a business with growth opportunities as large as Colliers.

Recent Developments

On December 6 2018 Dylan Taylor (48) was named the new CEO of Real Estate Services. He has been with the company since 2009 and is a likely to successor the founder Jay Hennick. Mr. Hennick will continue in his role as Chairman.

Summary

Colliers is a business with a moat high free cash flow business model operating in a consolidating industry.

The fragmented market offers the opportunity for multi decade growth via relatively safe and predictable bolt-on acquisitions and partnerships. Growth of 10-15% per year can continue for at least the next decade.

Colliers has an owner / operator management team with high insider ownership and a good history of capital allocation.

The chief risk is a major slowdown in the global CRE market driven by tightening liquidity. Secondarily the company’s growth will slow if it cannot finding suitable acquisition targets.

Shares are likely to return 15% per annum for the next decade on continued EPS growth. The current valuation is undemanding.

Disclosures

We are long shares of Colliers (CIGI).

CBRE says the sale of Lang Lang represents a landmark Australian investment opportunity the 877-hectare facility available across multiple titles suggesting the site could be broken up with access via both the South Gippsland Highway and the existing entrance at 44 Rayner Hoff Drive. The IM shows up to six allotments are available ranging from 2.7 to 335.9 hectares.

Multiple testing storage and office buildings with floor space totalling more than 11920 square meters are included in the sale the IM picturing GMH’s former emissions testing facility alongside a graphic outlining the facility’s extensive 44km of mixed-purpose test roads including the high-speed bowl used to showcase every new Holden range since the FC-series of 1958.

“Buildings vary in age from recently extended / refurbished or greater than 50 years old albeit very well maintained throughout. Significant capital has been invested into the buildings over the past 10 years delivering first class improvements with the most recent upgrade in 2018 costing approximately $7.2m to resurface the circular track” the IM details.

“The four main warehouse facilities which have been constructed onsite include propulsion systems safety and emissions testing facility for the testing of a vehicle’s safety and emission features decommissioned Collision Barrier facility used to test vehicle’s impacts during a collision and durability and vehicle testing garage for the purpose of certification and a storage warehouse.”

The IM also includes details of the agreement between current hirer Walkinshaw Automotive Group who have use of the facility until March 2022. Returns of up to $13750 per calendar month are paid to VinFast for use of the facility’s general road systems ride and handling course circular track and garage area indicating that investors may find opportunities to lease the facility to similar interests moving forward.

Details of capital works carried out at the facility are listed in the document which also outlines the technical specifications of the proving ground’s various roads including the high-speed bowl 4WD circuit global rough track hill circuit 98-metre skid pan and ride/handling circuit.

“The balance of the property comprises a proving ground consisting of a vast range of vehicle testing courses which feature a combination of sealed and unsealed road networks and severe rough roads” the IM says even referencing the famous mid-facility “Chalet” as part of the sale.

At the time of purchase VinFast credited the Lang Lang complex as one of the icons of the Australian automotive industry. The facility was refurbished and upgraded in 2018 and is regarded as one of the best vehicle-testing centres in the world.

At the time of its sale of to VinFast the Lang Lang Proving Ground was the last in series of Holden-owned properties to go under the auctioneer’s hammer which included the 37.7-hectare Fishermans Bend manufacturing plant – which was sold to the Victorian state government for $130 million – and the Elizabeth manufacturing base in Adelaide – which was sold to developer Pelligra Group in 2017.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW5vdGhlci1uZXctaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1vbi1pdHMtd2F5LXRvLWxhbmdmb3JkLTkxODkw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another new industrial development on its way to Langford,"Work on 160000 square feet of industrial business space on McCallum Road will start in January

Construction will soon start on a new industrial strata development in Langford which will provide much-needed space for businesses.

“There are a growing number of small businesses in the area struggling to find space” Elizabeth J. Mears an associate at Cushman & Wakefield said in a statement. “Some companies here are operating out of garages and we see many businesses are moving up from Victoria.”

PC Urban Properties said in a statement the development would be ideal for businesses in e-commerce industrial service high-performance fitness marine service and private investors.

Demand for space for businesses is seeing the limited supply being snapped up almost as quickly as it’s put onto market.

The uniforms follow the same template as the apple green lighting yellow and road white sets Oregon unveiled this summer with a stylized wing design on the shoulders and sleeves with markings that are supposed to mimic a group of flying ducks.

What makes this uniform different from the Ducks’ other white road uniform of course is the dark green speckle pattern throughout the jersey and pants as well as the silver shoulder/sleeve design and nightmare green numbers.

That speckle pattern can also be seen on the “O” logo on the back of Oregon’s nightmare green helmets which were introduced ahead of the 2019 season and feature wings on both sides in a slightly different shade of green.

This marks the seventh different uniform combination for Oregon in seven games this season. The Ducks wore all-white in Week 2 at Ohio State and white helmets white jerseys and apple green pants at Stanford in Week 5.

The world-class regatta that brought rowers and travelers from the four corners of the globe is recovering in terms of lost sponsors and international participation after cancelling in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But on a seasonal sunny Saturday in late October it felt like old times on the banks of the Dirty Water. The rowers boarded their sculls and shells up-river while throngs of spectators partied along the serpentine 3-mile course. The rowers assemble in stages on the spacious Charles River Basin and the course begins where the waterway narrows at the BU Bridge.

The scullers and sweepers race for time upstream against the current. The boats must navigate between the pillared arches of seven bridges and stay between the buoys on a hairpin turn in the final mile.

Those obstacles are a problem for the nimble single scullers and two- and four-man sweeps. But for the dreadnaughts on the course the light and heavyweight eights the trip requires even strokes and a steady hand on the tiller.

A Bridge Too Far

There are many great vantage points on both sides of the river but the observation perch of choice is the Elliot Street Bridge. Spectators lined up shoulder-to-shoulder across the span as rowers streamed underneath in both directions. The Elliot is the final structure on the course and is the place where rowing folklore is made.

There is the legend of the Naval Academy’s fateful trip in 1979 when its heavyweight championship eights crew crashed and sank after colliding with the bridge. The Navy was being dogged by a pair of Ivy League boats when its sweep oars on the starboard side connected with the bridge causing the boat to capsize. Witnesses describe the snapping oars as sounding like a “21-gun salute.”

Needless to say Leyte Gulf on the Charles did not sit well with the gold braids down in Annapolis. The Navy crew returned in 1980 to win the first of four straight championship eights that included course record times in ’81 and ‘82.

The other major incident at the Elliot Bridge occurred on Oct. 24 2006. Unlike the famed Navy crash the sinking of the Peking University’s heavyweight eights boat was captured on video in the internet age.

The cox was an American woman who worked at the media lab at MIT. She got the assignment because the crew’s original coxswain couldn’t get a visa. The Peking boat was clipped by another shell during the race and began taking on water.

The boat became fully submerged under the Elliot Bridge creating a very dangerous situation for the panicked crew in the chilly waist-deep water. The trailing shells had to take evasive action causing a logjam and fortunately nobody was injured.

“They come for the crashes” said John Cotter of Cambridge who has been watching the regatta from this vantage for over two decades.

“I met one of those guys over in China about three years ago and they had no idea how famous they are because they don’t get YouTube.

“Their boat sank underneath this bridge in the middle and the coxswains can’t see them. Nobody is expecting a boat to be sunk in the middle of the river underneath the bridge.

“The boats diverted around and if you were ahead of them you picked up a lot of places because nobody could get by. Unfortunately for a lot of the boats it was the end of their race.”

The Boat House

The Cambridge Boat Club established in 1909 is the nerve center of the HOCR operations.

To step inside the CBC is like a trip back in time to the early years of the last century. The walls are adorned with old photos and plaques the architecture is stained wood beams and white walls but the training facilities are up to date.

The deck at the back end of the club provides a panoramic view of the river where serious boat handicappers watch the approaching sculls and shells through binoculars. The CBC had many of its rowers out on the river competing under the club’s blue and white banner.

The Head of the Charles Regatta was created in 1965 by three Cambridge Boat Club members D’Arcy MacMahon Howard McIntyre and Jack Vincent.

“It is wonderful to see everyone back” said MacMahon. “Back in 1965 Howard McIntyre and I were through with college rowing and we thought we would start a regatta on the Charles just for fun.

“The first year nobody came to watch and I had to write it up in a national rowing magazine. My opening sentence was ‘countless thousands lined the shores’ and it became a very famous quote. Nobody was there — it was countless.

“Anyway the thing grew and grew and we had to invent a system a lottery system on who gets in and who doesn’t.”

MacMahon was quick to remind that the winner of the lightweight championship eights race is presented with the Boston Herald Cup.",,,,,,,,,

""Many internet service providers (ISPs) collect and share far more data about their customers than many consumers may expect—including access to all of their Internet traffic and real-time location data—while failing to offer consumers meaningful choices about how this data can be used"" the FTC said.

This was found as part of a study started in 2019 into the privacy practices of U.S. broadband companies and related entities and how they collect retain use and disclose info about consumers and their devices.

The six broadband providers included in FTC's report are AT&T Mobility Cellco Partnership (aka Verizon Wireless) Charter Communications Operating Comcast (aka Xfinity) T-Mobile U.S. and Google Fiber.

The FTC also included in the study three advertising entities affiliated with these companies: AT&T's Appnexus rebranded as Xandr Verizon's Verizon Online and Oath Americas rebranded as Verizon Media.

Together the six companies currently control roughly 98 percent of the nation's mobile Internet market according to the FTC.

The FTC also noted that these tech giants have expanded beyond fixed residential internet and mobile internet services into other areas.

By including voice content smart devices advertising and analytics services they could further increase the volume of customer data they can collect and share with third parties.

Troubling data collection protection and sharing practices

""The report identified several troubling data collection practices among several of the ISPs including that they combine data across product lines; combine personal app usage and web browsing data to target ads; place consumers into sensitive categories such as by race and sexual orientation; and share real-time location data with third-parties"" the FTC said.

As the FTC further discovered the ISPs amass huge pools of sensitive consumer data and use it in ways their customers do not expect and could cause them harm primarily when classifying them by demographic characteristics including race ethnicity gender or sexuality.

Although many ISPs claim to offer consumers choices the choices they provide are often a sham at times nudging them toward even more data sharing.

""Even though several of the ISPs promise not to sell consumers personal data they allow it to be used transferred and monetized by others and hide disclosures about such practices in fine print of their privacy policies"" the FTC added.

""For example several news outlets noted that subscribers' real-time location data shared with third-party customers was being accessed by car salesmen property managers bail bondsmen bounty hunters and others without reasonable protections or consumers' knowledge and consent according to the report.""

Furthermore because of their problematic privacy practices and protections they can be at least as privacy-intrusive as large advertising platforms given that they have direct access to their consumers' entire unencrypted internet traffic.

Even when connecting to sites that encrypt their traffic or using VPNs ISPs can still collect the domains their customers connect to and analyze their browsing behavior.

Former FCC Chair Ajit Pai blamed for current state of things

U.S. Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement following FTC's report that Ajit Pai the former head of the FCC is likely the one who made it possible for tech firms to disregard their users' privacy by harvesting and using their data for business purposes.

""If Congress needed any more proof that America desperately needs a consumer privacy law the Federal Trade Commission's report about internet service providers' rampant abuse of their customers' private personal browsing information should be enough to get Washington to act"" Wyden said.

""Whether it's advertisers tech companies or Big Cable corporate America is showing absolute contempt for the idea that consumers can control personal details about their lives. Democrats have introduced multiple comprehensive privacy bills that would crack down on this flagrant abuse.

""Finally it's worth remembering that former Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai opened the floodgates to ISPs' unchecked use of browsing data when he repealed the Obama-era broadband privacy and net neutrality regulations.

""The FCC needs every tool available to stop cable companies from gouging consumers and selling their data.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Mr Lawes said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

‘Desire to bring the painting to life’

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

Other experts involved include Sara Charles a medieval book production expert who hand made the original recipe pigments and the brushes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWh1bWJlci02ODk4OTQ5M9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWh1bWJlci02ODk4OTQ5My5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hull: Oldest overseas Danish Church marks anniversary,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2h1bGwtb2xkZXN0LW92ZXJzZWFzLWRhbmlzaC1jaHVyY2gtMDcwMTQwNDUzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hull: Oldest overseas Danish Church marks anniversary,"The world's oldest overseas Danish Church is marking the 70th anniversary of its reopening after the original was destroyed in a World War Two air raid.

The building in Osborne Street in Hull opened in 1871 as a place of worship for the city's Danish community and for visiting sailors.

The night before its 70th anniversary in 1941 it was flattened by German bombers.

It was rebuilt on the opposite side of the road in mid 50s Scandinavian style.

Now named Nordic House the church is a thriving community centre and holds a popular Scandinavian Christmas market each November.

Its reconstruction will be marked with a special service on Sunday conducted by a pastor from Denmark.

The ceremony will feature a local opera singer performing a song by Danish composer Carl Nielsen.

Church manager Charlotte Theill said that a pastor had joked he hoped ""nothing untoward happens on the evening before"".

Referring back to 9 May 1941 Ms Theill said: ""They were getting ready to celebrate"".

""Luckily nobody was injured but obviously the building was destroyed.""

A mangled candelabra was recovered from the ruins of the original St Nikolaj Danish Seamen's Church. It was repaired and now sits on the new altar.

Alongside it is a fragment of stained glass from the old church which was incorporated into the new windows.

With no resident pastor church services rely on visiting Lutheran clergy from Denmark or elsewhere in the UK.

Ms Theill said the church still functions as a place of worship and is ""open to anyone"".

""We're calling ourselves a Scandinavian community centre"" she said.

""Obviously a lot of people use the space hire the the rooms for their own meetings or events.""

She described the church as ""a little piece of home"".

""It's wonderful coming to work and and just having a bit of Denmark here I love that"" she said.

""The lamps the architecture everything is 50s Denmark really it's wonderful.""

Dirinya merilis single berjudul Cinta Tak Ada yang Tahu yang merupakan lagu karangan Pika Iskandar.

Secara cerita Cinta Tak Ada yang Tahu adalah lagu yang berkisah tentang seseorang yang jatuh hati pada sahabatnya. Ketika mendengar lagunya Aqeela Calista langsung yakin menyanyikannya. Sebab ia banyak mendengar cerita serupa sebagaimana yang ada dalam lagu dari teman-temannya.

""Ini tuh lagunya cocok banget sama keadaan sekarang yang cuman friendzone memang benar ada sih di dunia nyata karena lagunya pas sama keadaan jaman sekarang. Aku belum merasakan itu tapi banyak teman-teman aku yang merasakan itu entah friendzone entah suka-sukaan sama teman sendiri"" cerita Aqeela Calista dalam wawancara dengan detikcom.

Menurut Aqeela Calista proses penggaran Cinta Tak Ada yang Tahu terbilang lancar. Ia merasa proses yang ia lalui sejak pertama kali diperdengarkan lagunya hingga selesai tidaklah memakan waktu yang terlalu lama.

""Prosesnya sebenarnya nggak bisa dibilang singkat tapi cukup singkat. Dari proses meeting ke recording-nya nggak jauh cuman dua bulan atau satu bulan setengah. Recording bikin video klip habis itu baru rilis single"" ujar Aqeela.

""Recording-nya juga sebentar banget kok karena aku sangat dibantu oleh kak Pika Iskandar untuk menyanyikan Cinta Tak Ada yang Tahu ini"" lanjut dia.

Bagi Aqeela Calista meski dirinya sudah sering membawakan ulang lagu dari sejumlah penyanyi di kanal YouTube-nya terjun ke dunia musik tetaplah menjadi sesuatu yang baru baginya.

Oleh karena itu sebelum benar-benar menjalani proses rekaman Aqeela Calista lebih dulu melatih vokalnya.

Rupanya meski sudah berlatih sebelumnya Aqeela Calista sempat merasa gugup saat benar-benar harus rekaman. Untungnya dirinya berhasil mengendalikan perasaan gugupnya dan proses rekaman berjalan lancar.

""Les vokal sempat tapi cuman empat hari. Empat hari sebelum aku recording itu aku latihan vokal dulu. Setelah itu aku tahu basic-basic-nya cuman pas recording sempet nervous karena baru pertama kali"" ungkap Aqeela.

""Pasti ada nervous-nya ada gugup-gugupnya tapi alhamdulillah semua lancar sih"" sambung dia.

The 55-year-old team leader attached to Tuas Checkpoint would frequently comment on the physical appearance of his female colleagues and other women such as members of the public who were sitting in their cars.

He would also crack “dirty” jokes about female private parts and sex. While his female team members were disgusted at the comments they did not dare to show their displeasure since the man was their supervisor.

The man who cannot be named to protect the identity of his victims pleaded guilty to two charges of molest on Monday with another two charges of a similar nature taken into consideration for his sentencing.

Responding to Yahoo News Singapore's queries Certis Cisco said that the man resigned from his position on 17 April last year. He was suspended from duties following his arrest on 27 March.

Facts of the case

The two victims in the proceeded charges were female security officers aged 22 and 23.

On 10 March last year the younger victim was attached to a team at Tuas Checkpoint for her first day. She was tasked to check vehicles coming into Singapore and the accused man was her team leader.

During a team break the victim sat on a ventilation pipe while the man sat beside her. He then placed his hand on her thigh and stroked it while asking about her first day.

The victim felt shocked and uncomfortable but had no idea what to do and did not push his hand away.

She made a police report on 27 March stating that she was molested twice in March by the man.

The older victim was attached to Arrival Hall 2 of Tuas Checkpoint and also tasked to check vehicles which were coming into Singapore. The man was also her team leader.

In February last year at Arrival Hall 2 of Tuas Checkpoint the man approached the older victim to inform her of her break time. He then smacked her buttocks over her pants once before walking away. The woman was traumatised by he incident and angry at the man.

She did not dare to report the incident until a while later when she brought it up to her deputy team leader. The latter reported the incident to her supervisors.

The younger victim revealed during investigations that the man had touched the elder victim inappropriately.

The man's lawyer Cheryl Sim told the court that the case has been a ""grave learning point"" in how her client views and treats women and that he had a lot of ""soul searching"" to do. She added that her client had been candid with the authorities and was ""embarrassed and apologetic"" about what happened.

However Deputy Public Prosecutor Kwang Jia Min disagreed that the man was candid. In his statements the man ""went on at length about how he was confronted by his superior...(and) his first response is 'I'm not afraid there are CCTV cameras and I did not touch the girl'"" she said.

He had tried to deny the touches and pass them off as accidental she added.

District Judge Wong Li Tein accepted that there were more victims than the two named in the proceeded charges and said the man had demonstrated a clear abuse of power.

The man had leveraged on his position of authority and banked on the fact that the victims would not be willing or too fearful to complain about him she said.

The Oct. 13 event featured AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond and Chicago labor leaders recognizing the many contributions of Chicago’s building trades to the changing downtown skyline CISCO (Construction Industry Service Corporation) reported in its newsletter.

The Chicago River structure adjacent to Merchandise Mart is the final of the three-phase Wolf Point development.

The event honored the more than 225 union tradespeople currently on-site building one of the largest construction projects in Illinois.

“I want every worker to have the same chance as my family the chance to join a union to work on projects like Wolf Point and to succeed in achieving the dignity and respect all working people deserve. I want every worker to feel the power of the labor movement as a change agent for prosperity” AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Fred Redmond told the gathering.

The BIT is the equity investor for all three phases of the development investing union pension capital to generate more than $1.5 billion in total development in downtown Chicago.

“The BIT’s comprehensive labor policies will generate over 6 million hours of work for union constructions trades on the site” CISCO reported. “In Chicago over $3.9 billion in total economic benefit has been created through construction investments made by the BIT.”

“The impact of BIT’s investments begins with you the hard-working men and women of the building trades. However please know that your hard work today will pay dividends to workers and our great city for years to come.

DNS is used in most user-initiated requests on the Internet e.g. when you click on a link in a browser or type a site manually in the browser's address bar. Up until recently these requests were in plain text; this meant that your Internet Service Provider and other users on the same network could get a clear log of all your Internet activity.

DNS translates human readable domain names and hostnames to IP addresses that computers use. Secure DNS encrypts the data which protects it against spying and also manipulation. Secure DNS in Chromium-based browsers is off by default unless a Secure DNS provider is used on the system.

Since it is beneficial to enable Secure DNS users may want to check the settings of their browsers to make sure that it is enabled or to enable it if it is not.

Tip: you can test if your browser supports Secure DNS.

Configure Secure DNS in Google Chrome

To get started in Google Chrome load the browser's security page by pasting the following URL in the browser's address bar: chrome://settings/security. If you prefer to go there manually select Menu > Settings > Privacy and Security > Security.

The ""Use secure DNS"" preference determines whether the feature is turned on or off. If it is set to off toggle it to enable it. You have two main options at this point:

Configure Chrome to use the default DNS provider of the system

Select one of the preset Secure DNS providers or set a custom provider.

The first option works only if the default DNS provider supports Secure DNS. Many ISPs don't and it is usually better to pick a specific DNS provider from Chrome's listing of supported providers or add a custom provider.

Select the ""With"" option and pick one of the preset providers OpenDNS CleanBrowsing Cloudflare Google or NextDNS or select custom to add a custom provider using a URL (these are provided by the provider).

Configure Secure DNS in Microsoft Edge

The configuration of Secure DNS in Microsoft Edge uses a similar system. Either load edge://settings/privacy directly in the browser's address bar or go to Menu > Settings > Privacy search and services manually.

The preference ""Use secure DNS to specify how to lookup the network address for websites"" determines whether Secure DNS is enabled. If it is turned off toggle it to enable it. Edge uses the current service provider meaning the DNS provider that is set on the system by default. Switch to ""Choose a service provider"" and click in the field below it to pick a preset provider or to add a custom provider using a specific URL.

Configure Secure DNS in Brave Browser

Brave follows the default Chromium implementation of Secure DNS for the most part. Load brave://settings/security in the browser's address bar to get started or select Menu > Settings > Privacy and security manually instead to open the configuration page.

The setting ""Use secure DNS"" determines whether Secure DNS is enabled in the browser. By default the system's service provider is used. You may switch to ""With"" to select one of the preset providers or to set a custom provider. Brave supports Quad9 next to the default selection of providers that Chrome supports.

Configure Secure DNS in Opera

Opera Browser supports Secure DNS called DNS-over-HTTPS as well. Either load opera://settings/?search=dns directly or go to Opera Menu > Settings > Advanced > Browser and scroll down to the System group of preferences.

The preference ""Use DNS-over-HTTPS instead of the system's DNS setting"" determines if secure DNS is enabled. If it is not toggle the preference to get a selection of providers and an option to set a custom provider.

Opera lists several Cloudflare options and Google Public DNS only.

Configure Secure DNS in Vivaldi

Vivaldi follows Chromium's implementation. It is a bit weird that you can't find the option when you browse the regular settings or search for it in the Settings. You need to load chrome://settings/security in the browser to display the option.

There you find the option to toggle ""Use secure DNS"" to enable or disable the feature and to switch between using the system provider a preset provider or a custom provider. Like Brave Vivaldi supports Quad9 next to all other providers.

Configure DNS over HTTPS in Firefox

Firefox supports DNS-over-HTTPS as well. Users of the browser need to load about:preferences#general in the address bar and activate the Settings-button under Network Settings on the page that opens.

The setting ""Enable DNS over HTTPS"" determines if the feature is enabled or not. Check the box to enable it. Firefox includes just two preset providers Cloudflare and NextDNS but has an option to set a custom provider as well.

Closing Words

Most Chromium-based and Firefox-based browsers support similar options.

Now You: Have you enabled Secure DNS / HTTPS over DNS?

Details about divestment to be announced Monday



By Park Jae-hyuk



Citibank Korea's management informed its board of directors Friday that attempts to unload the consumer banking unit here had failed leaving the U.S. headquarters with no alternative but to shut the unit down without selling it according to industry sources and media reports Sunday.



The bank will announce the specifics about its exit plan through a statement to be issued Monday after notifying its employees of the decision.



""We have yet to be informed of the result of Friday's board meeting because it finished several hours after it started at 5 p.m."" a Citibank Korea spokesperson said.



The financial authorities are said to have already been notified of the bank's decision to phase out its retail banking operation here without selling it to another financial firm.



Financial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Koh Seung-beom said at a National Assembly audit Thursday that the commission would ascertain whether a phased liquidation of the bank's consumer banking unit needed its approval.

Citibank Taiwan Ltd (花旗台灣) must ensure that its agreements with prospective buyers do not jeopardize its employees’ rights the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said on Thursday.

The commission made the remarks in response to media reports that the bank had signed confidentiality agreements with prospective buyers barring them from hiring its employees.

Citibank Taiwan has been seeking a buyer for its consumer banking business after its parent company Citigroup Inc in April announced that it is to close its retail banking operation in 13 markets — including Taiwan.

Citibank Taiwan’s consumer banking sector has about 2500 employees.

The commission will investigate the matter in collaboration with the Ministry of Labor Banking Bureau Chief Secretary Hou Li-yang (侯立洋) told a news conference on Thursday adding that it has demanded that the bank file a report with the commission immediately.

The buyer and the seller in a merger must ensure that they do not breach the rights of employees and that the merger would not have a negative impact on society Hou said.

Labor protection would be a key factor when the commission reviews the deal he added.

Citibank Taiwan said in a statement that it respected its employees’ career plans and choices.

“Some employees have left and transferred to other financial companies since our announcement that we are selling the retail banking unit” it said in a statement.

“This fact shows that we respect our employees’ choices and have not stopped them from finding new jobs via normal channels” it said in the statement.

The commission later on Thursday also confirmed that it has received a complaint from Citibank Taiwan’s labor union saying that the bank’s revised bonus system is unfair as it requires employees signing a contract to give up certain rights.

Local media reports said this includes giving the bank the right to reclaim bonuses if it deems an employee has committed an act that is critical or deemed harmful to the company.

“We will look into what changes the bank has made and whether they are reasonable” Hou said.

Two local financial conglomerates and two foreign banks have expressed an interest in Citibank Taiwan’s consumer banking operation and have submitted offers according to Bloomberg and Chinese-language news outlets.

They are Fubon Financial Holding Co (富邦金控) Cathay Financial Holding Co (國泰金控) Singapore’s DBS Group and Standard Chartered the reports said.

None of the companies has verified the reports.

Update: I'm officially an EU resident.

Earlier this year I shared that I applied for European Union citizenship through Portugal's Golden Visa program — a program offered by several European countries that provides a path to residency and eventually citizenship through different types of investments.

This week I'm excited to share that I've received my residency card the first step to gaining Portuguese citizenship. With my resident status I can travel freely throughout the European Union as long as I maintain certain residency standards (more details on that below).

Ever since I studied in the Madrid suburb of Alcalá de Henares in 2005 I've been enchanted by the European lifestyle. While it does vary by country in general I feel Europeans have a better work and life balance and enjoy family and community more than we do in the U.S.

I've long thought about having two passports. Not U.S. passports — I already have two of those — but rather passports from two countries. Residency or citizenship in another country would allow for greater extended stay and work capabilities especially in a diverse bloc like the European Union.

Don't get me wrong I love the U.S. and will always have roots here but as I look to the future and think about starting a family the option of being able to work and live in Europe if even for part of the year is an enticing proposition.

So a couple of years ago I began researching ways to get EU citizenship for myself and realized that countries make it easy through what's known as a ""Golden Visa"" program. Portugal specifically had the plan that best suited my needs.

(Note: If you have family members who were born abroad you may be able to apply for second citizenship directly — rules vary by country. But since all of my grandparents were born in the U.S. my chances of claiming Irish citizenship were very low.)

The Golden Visa

The term ""Golden Visa"" refers to a program offered by numerous countries in Europe and elsewhere that provides a path to residency and eventually citizenship through investment.

Like I mentioned above I found Portugal to offer the most compelling Golden Visa program for my needs and I decided to move forward with the process in 2020. In fact I recently received special clearance arranged by local lawyers to travel to the country in order to set up bank accounts finalize my investment and tour the property that I now co-own.

I'm investing in the forthcoming Renaissance hotel in the Lapa neighborhood of Porto. According to the terms of my specific agreement I'll be able to establish residency within six months or so ideal for me since I'll then be able to travel hassle-free to and around Europe.

Once residency is established there is a process to potentially gain citizenship including a five-year waiting period and a mandatory Portuguese language test which shouldn't be too much of an obstacle since I previously took three Portuguese classes and majored in Spanish in college.

Based on my 350000-euro ($420700) investment the developer RA Group will provide a 3% return annually. I'll also get a free week's stay at the property each year. Additionally I asked if I could get Marriott Bonvoy status as an owner — it never hurts to ask! — and they're looking into it. I won't have to pay taxes in Portugal on my U.S. income since I pay U.S. taxes. (Before making any decisions based on taxes or financial investments you should consult a professional.)

I'm okay with a portion of my retirement savings being in a safe 3% return investment as a way to diversify my portfolio in these wild markets.

To participate in the Golden Visa program your investment in urban real estate must be at least 350000 euros or you must outright purchase a property for at least 500000 euros ($601000).

I'm not giving investment advice but rather giving you an understanding of my thinking behind the decision I made. In addition to the investment in property there are additional legal fees associated with this process. I worked with the Canada-based Mercan Group. I can't recommend them enough — they were so helpful throughout the process.

Upcoming changes to the Golden Visa program

It's true that changes are coming to Portugal's Golden Visa program — and I'm glad that I applied when I did — but there's still time to apply before those changes take place at the beginning of the year.

The real estate investment options for Portugal's Golden Visa program will be modified in the following ways in 2022:

The minimum investment will increase from 350000 euros to 500000 euros.

Real estate properties will need to be located in the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira or in the interior territories (properties in major cities like Lisbon and Porto as well as coastal towns of the mainland are no longer eligible).

In order to apply for the visa under the current requirements your application will need to receive preapproval from SEF (the Portuguese Immigration and Borders Service) by Dec. 31. That means you'll want to get started on your application soon.

It isn't mandatory that you go through a third party like I did but I had a great experience with the Mercan Group and can't recommend them highly enough. If you're considering the hotel rehabilitation investment category you can get $2000 off of the Mercan Group's legal fees by using my personal code GOLD21. (Legal fees are normally 6000 euros so with the code you'll pay just 4000 euros or roughly $4800.)

All proceeds that I earn from my affiliate code will be donated to Rainbow Railroad an organization that works to help LGBTQ people around the world escape persecution in their home countries and one that I'm proud to work with throughout the year.

What's next for me

Now that I have my EU residency card I'm required to spend a certain amount of time in Portugal over the next five years before I can apply for citizenship:

14 days in Portugal in the first two years of residency (by July 2023).

14 days in the next two years (from July 2023 to July 2025).

Seven days in the fifth and final year (from July 2025 to July 2026).

As I look to the future and to starting a family I'm especially excited that my children will be dual citizens of the EU and U.S. and will be able to get an education and health care in the EU — at a fraction of the cost in the U.S. I also want them to be exposed to different cultures and ways of living and I can't think of a better way than with dual citizenship.

Frequently asked questions about the Golden Visa

I've received a lot of questions on the topic of the Golden Visa. Let's go over a few of the top ones here.

Q: Are there different amounts you can invest to receive a Golden Visa?

A: There are many ways to invest to receive citizenship but three avenues are the most popular (note these amounts will increase in 2022):

Buy a finished property for 500000 euros (rules surrounding this type of investment will change next year)

Invest in the rehabilitation of an old building for 350000 euros (this is what I chose)

Invest 280000 euros ($337000) in rehabilitating a property in a less-populated area of the country

Q: When you get citizenship are your kids and family also eligible for citizenship?

A: Yes! This is one of the main reasons I pursued dual citizenship. My children will be able to receive education and health care in the EU at a fraction of the cost thanks to their citizenship. Plus I want them to be exposed to different cultures and a different way of life.

Q: How much time do you need to spend in Portugal?

A: Just two weeks per year for the first four years and then just one week for the fifth year. This is a huge selling point for me. Many countries offer similar visas but they have much stricter requirements for staying within the country — often 183 days or more.

Q: Does the investment have to be paid in cash?

A: Yes.

Q: Is working with a company to liaise for you mandatory?

A: No but there is a tremendous amount of bureaucracy involved. If you want to complete it on your own be prepared to put in hours of research and paperwork. Regardless I'd recommend working with a Portuguese lawyer to help you navigate the process. Mercan Group holds your hand through it all. They helped me open local bank accounts and schedule various appointments even when none were publicly available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcmlzaW5nYXBwbGUuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMjMvbnktbWV0cy1mcmFuY2lzY28tbGluZG9yLWFsZXgtcm9kcmlndWV6LWZvb3RzdGVwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NY Mets: Don't follow in this guy's footsteps Francisco Lindor,Next.

Confiscated items used to committ card skimming on display during a police briefing on December 18 2019. -

In movies bank heists are depicted as action-packed situations where robbers armed with automatic weapons overpower security grabbing as much cash as they can before escaping in dramatic fashion.

In reality however criminals move much more discretely can strike at any time and if you're not vigilant you may not even realise they made off with your money.

Last year the police received over 500 reports of bank card skimming in TT.

As of October 19 2021 the Fraud Squad received over 200 reports of card skimming.

Card skimming is a practice where the personal data from a person's bank card is recorded when used at an ABM or point of sale machine and subsequently replicated onto a blank card.

This blank card can be used to access funds from the person's account to buy items at the person's expense.

Given the restrictions imposed by the pandemic and the need to reduce person-to-person contact in stores it was believed that incidents of skimming would increase during the lockdown period thought online fraud.

In a June 2021 article from the Jamaica Gleaner Jamaica's director of the Regional Security System (RSS) captain Errington Shurland said cybercrime and cybercriminal activity have taken off since the pandemic and described the prevalence of online scams as ""the modus operandi of future criminal activity.""

But local police from the Fraud Squad says there has been a slight decrease in cases since the public health restrictions came into effect last year.

Despite this decline police and banks stress that bank card skimming and other types of fraud are still a major concern and called on banks and the government to focus on the issue of cyber-security as TT pushes towards digitisation.

A Fraud Squad officer who asked not to be named told Sunday Newsday that while digital threats were still in their infancy in TT some criminals specialising in online fraud like data phishing and skimmers have established a foothold in the country with networks in operation.

He said based on intelligence most of the skimming networks comprised of foreigners usually Venezuelans who have access to specialised equipment.

The skimming equipment usually has three components– the skimming device which records the information from a bank card the re-printer which copies the information onto a blank card for later use and the blank cards themselves.

He said once skimmers have successfully recorded and produced a ""dummy"" or replica of a victim's card they usually take cash within the first 24 hours before the person can realise what has happened.

""Most accounts have a limit of $5000 at a point of sale machine in a store and a $3000 limit on cash withdrawal at an ATM so they may go to a liquor mart and spend $5000 on alcohol then they go to the ATM and withdraw $3000.

""As soon as the clock strikes midnight the bank account resets and they go and withdraw another $3000 in cash and then later that day when a liquor mart opens they take out another $5000 in alcohol. That's a total of $10000 in alcohol that can be re-sold for $5000 and they also obtained $6000 so that's $11000 they would have made within 24 hours.""

He says from intelligence gathered skimming is one part of elaborate networks as groceries and liquor stores are suspected of being complacent in the activities as well as anything bought from these businesses stays within the network.

The officer said perpetrators using the copied card will not risk using the ABM themselves and would usually pay someone $500 to withdraw the cash for them.

He says while there is legislation that empowers the police to take action against anyone found with card-skimming equipment but admits there has been some challenges in proving a link between suspected complicit businesses and the skimmers.

Recalling the arrest of two suspected skimmers in the parking lot of Trincity Mall in 2019 the officer said while arrests and seizures of card skimming equipment were made there are challenges in keeping pace with new more advanced technology used by the criminals.

""In the cycle of things the frequency of ABM skimming spikes and it drops and that is because there are people who are the main players they become active they do what they do and then they either go back to their country to do something or are in jail or they make enough money to just sit back for a while.""

He also suspects that the reason why skimming may have seen a small drop during the pandemic is because of how difficult the situation has been for many citizens.

""People who don't have a lot of cash are more likely to notice when something is missing from their account no matter how small it is and because of that they're more likely to report it quicker to their banks who will in turn shut down the card.""

Responding to questions via e-mail on Saturday officials from the Bankers Association of TT also reported that there has been a reduction in skimming but credited this to an aggressive anti-skimming campaign and technology.

This partnership between the police and the banks form an important link in the response to skimmers as the officer stresses the importance of quick response between both parties to clamp down on such attacks.

Banks themselves have also taken measures to protect themselves against cyber criminals.

In 2020 all Scotiabank TT debit cards were upgraded to include EMV Chip technology. The chip technology better protects against card fraud. Using the chip on an EMV Chip card reduces the chance of your data being stolen or copied.

Via e-mail on Friday officials from Scotiabank TT say they have introduced several security measures to guard against skimming including more security at ABMs and a more robust online security systems for banking.

""Scotiabank Alerts provide customers with the ability to receive real-time notifications about activity on their accounts via push notifications on their mobile devices or their e-mail so they can report any suspicious transactions and unauthorised logins quicker.

""Since the introduction of this free feature we have expanded the range of alerts available from transactional alerts to now 21 different types of alerts inclusive of security alerts and credit card controls.""

While card skimming seems to be the most prevalent form of digital attacks there are other threats to cyber security.

Phishing a practice where criminals create e-mails texts social media messages and pop-up windows that look legitimate with the intention of tricking people into sharing PIN numbers passwords or account information.

Scotiabank's management has attempted to tackle this phenomenon with a robust public information campaign warning customers against giving out their information suggesting they call 62-SCOTIA when receiving strange requests online.

""Scotiabank will never present customers with unexpected webpages or send them unsolicited emails asking for their password Personal Identification Number (PIN) credit card account numbers and so on.

""We will never ask customers to confirm or restore account access through unsolicited email.""

As the world pushes towards minimising physical contact there has been the introduction of ""contact-less"" means of payment with newer types of debit and credit cards being introduced to make payment.

Finance blog Sapling reports that in the US where contact-less transfers are common fraudsters can scan and ""read"" your card's data through your wallet or even your purse.

The Fraud Squad officer says that while such features are not yet available in TT he anticipates there will be similar trends when it does come to Trinidad.

He adds that in in cyberspace criminals not only target cash but information as well.

Last October a Russian ransomware organisation targeted the operations of one of this country's largest conglomerates – Ansa McAl.

The attack began in Barbados and spread to the company's operations in TT leading to a temporary shutdown of the insurance subsidiaries Tatil and Tatil Life.

The officer says while data mining attacks are relatively rare in TT there have been incidents where information has been hacked recalling one incident last year where the e-mail address of a government worker was compromised.

""It was a minor person in the organisation whose account was breached and certain confidential documents were accessed but it was never used.

""I feel as though it could have been when the cyber crime unit did the analysis it was just some hacker testing the water to see how far they could get but with no true nefarious reason behind it.""

In their response Scotiabank said that while data mining and cyber attacks were a worldwide issue they were committed to developing their security capacities by ""attracting world class talent to mitigate risks associated with this typology.""

Responding to questions via WhatsApp on Friday Minister of Public Administration and Digital Transformation Hassel Bacchus says the importance of strengthening security in the country's digitisation push has not been lost on him.

He notes that the government's cyber security plan involves a three-pronged approach to building capacities at different levels to protect the data behind key institutions.

""What the government and the Ministry of Digital Transformation is trying to do is build resilience into our ICT architecture. Resilience is not just about preventing cyberattacks but it is also about what happens when an attack occurs and assessing if that attack was successful in what it set out to do.

""In this vein we have two tracks of action where cybersecurity is concerned. We are seeking to review existing processes and systems to strengthen and enhance and we are also building resilience by design in any new solution.

""The reality is the more we add ICT platforms/systems into our ICT landscape the more we increase the potential for an attack. We as a Ministry need to ensure that we deploy and employ appropriate design concepts to protect against and/or to reset if an attack were to happen.

""That is why we are adopting a holistic approach to cyber-security that addresses the three main components of digital transformation: people process and systems.""

As the government makes its first steps towards a digital transformation issues of cyber security in this new frontier are a serious concern for ministries and businesses.",,,

The tournament in the port city of Busan is the third Asian event in the US LPGA season this year after stops in Singapore and Thailand in the spring.

Ko clinched the win to cash the winner’s check of US$300000 in a sudden-death playoff beating South Korea’s Lim Hee-Jeong who had been leading the tournament.

It marked the fourth time the 26-year-old has come from behind in the final round to win in her Tour career.

“It was my first playoff in my professional career so my heart was fluttering” Ko said in a televised interview after her win.

“I feel a little sorry for Hee-Jeong but I think I ended up being lucky” she added.

Ko shot a bogey-free 64 to finish regulation at 22-under 266 stretching the tournament into a playoff.

In the sudden-death playoff that began at the 18th she came through with an outstanding hybrid shot and sank a short birdie putt to clinch victory.

“I knew Hee-Jeong is a solid player and I thought I could secure second place if I played my best” Ko said adding: “So I was fairly relaxed.”

“I did my best but I do think it is an amazing win” Ko said.

Lim who did not have a bogey over 73 holes for four days failed to come up with the final win.

With her latest victory Ko reclaimed the top ranking from Nelly Korda of the United States who did not play in Busan.

Ko first rose to world number one in 2019 and held the ranking for the entire 2020 season — a streak of 100 consecutive weeks — but handed over the top spot to Korda in June this year.

Sunday’s win also marked the 200th LPGA victory by a South Korean with Pak Se-ri Park In-bee and Kim Sei-young among the golfers who have contributed to the feat.

After Busan LPGA has two more tournaments with the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Florida in November.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At first such an ambitious project may seem like a herculean task. But on the other hand it may not be too difficult for the country to achieve its long-term energy goals. India aims to achieve 450 GW Renewable energy capacities by 2030 of which about 280 GW is expected to be solar energy . There is a huge potential in the country for solar power due to the geographical location and terrain of the country. This gives the country an edge over other nations. Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan is the largest producer of solar power plants with a capacity of 2245 MW. Currently in India 90% of the current solar photovoltaic (PV) panel installations are based on crystalline silicon which maxes out at about 22% efficiency. There are other technologies being developed such as ‘perovskite crystal coated panels’ which can bring up this efficiency to about 27%. Also efficiency improvements led to price reductions to such levels that PVs acquired the most dominant position on the world energy stage. Global investment in new renewable energy capacity in the past decade was over $2.5 trillion with more solar power capacity installed than other generation technologies according to the Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2019 report published by the UN Environment Programme.Floating solar plants are also something worth observing; the cooling effect of the surrounding water allows floating panels to produce up to 10% more electricity and slows module degradation. Floating solar plants currently being developed in India are as follows:· Omkareshwar Dam floating solar farm. Capacity – 600MW. Estimated investment – Rs 30 bn Kayamkulam solar project . Capacity – 105MW. Estimated investment – Rs 3.43 bn· NTPC Ramagundam solar power plant . Capacity – 100 MW. Estimated investment – Rs 4.32bnThat said India has already proven itself a leader in solar development having achieved its previous 2022 target of 20 GW – way earlier than expected. The country also hopes to leverage the latest technologies to establish a solar template. However managing and maintaining large-scale solar facilities could be a challenge for the country as there are several electrical components required which India currently imports from its neighbour China and other countries. A hurdle for India is its current dependence on imports to a large degree for solar modules. Another hurdle is financing rates for loans etc. in the renewable sector which is around 12-14% which discourages companies from investing in solar projects. Thus it needs to gauge the availability of technical components manpower and site selection carefully before taking the process to such magnitude.The solar industry is now exploring how digital tools can help them unlock more of the sun’s potential – amid the restrictions and challenges. The solar industry in India has received considerable support from the government during the pandemic. Initiatives such as reducing repo rate making solar plant O&M an essential service removing tariff caps for solar tenders PLI scheme among others are some of the steps the government has taken to help the sector.Earlier this year the IREDA invited bids from solar module manufacturers to set up manufacturing units in India offering them benefits under the PLI Scheme. This is a huge step towards reducing dependency on imports when it comes to solar modules. This will reduce dependency on oil-producing companies and even bring down fuel imports.As countries around the world look on India has a huge opportunity to tap its resources bring in the latest technology in use and use the geological advantage to become the global manufacturing hub for renewable energy. A policy framework encompassing both tariff and non-tariff barriers to boost domestic solar manufacturing is needed.Solar PV tariff dipped to Rs 2.44 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) from about Rs 15 / kWh in the past decade in India. The current decade will be accompanied by more innovations and developments as the country has already learned the art of installing power plants with capacities going up to thousands of megawatts. Here is how technology is playing its part in setting up solar structures and can make it a more efficient process. With the rise in demand storage will become a critical part when it comes to renewable energy. The inclusion of monitoring through the Internet of Things and automation will make plants flexible for fluctuating demand. Silicon-based solar cells for example are well-established technology. They may however be taken over by perovskite solar cells — synthetic hybrid organic-inorganic compounds.Asset and demand-side management will be key and data analytics and digitization of storage could play a major role here. There are immense opportunities for innovation in the field of solar and renewable energy. The innovation in the design of solar plants and maintaining grid stability will also help in changing regulations and standards as solar continues to gain currency. It will be interesting to see how India leverages these changing technologies in the face of several challenges it faces in the energy sector. Digitization delivers unmatched improvements in efficiency and modern technology is helping to drive down development costs.India imports roughly 85% of its solar cells and modules from nearby China. However it plans to make 36 GW of solar components domestically within the next few years. Moreover it has enough IT talent that can help in cultivating IT-based solutions. If India continues to build on technological gains it will be able to achieve long-term renewable energy targets easily.The writer is Managing Director Salasar Techno Engineering Ltd.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvdmlzYWtoYXBhdG5hbS9wcm9wb3NlZC13dGUtcGxhbnQtdG8tbG93ZXItc3RyZXNzLW9uLWxhbmRmaWxsL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg3MjI5NzcwLmNtc9IBggFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L3Zpc2FraGFwYXRuYW0vcHJvcG9zZWQtd3RlLXBsYW50LXRvLWxvd2VyLXN0cmVzcy1vbi1sYW5kZmlsbC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODcyMjk3NzAuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visakhapatnam: Proposed waste-to-energy plant to lower stress on landfill,Once it is operationalised the plant will reduce burden on the landfill as the GVMC has to supply to it 950 metric tonnes of waste a day,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvaW5kaWEtdG8tYmFyZ2Fpbi1mb3ItdW5kZWxpdmVyZWQtY2FyZ29lcy1mb3ItcmVuZXdpbmctbG5nLWltcG9ydC1jb250cmFjdC13aXRoLXFhdGFyL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg3MjM2MjMzLmNtc9IBpQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvaW5kaWEtdG8tYmFyZ2Fpbi1mb3ItdW5kZWxpdmVyZWQtY2FyZ29lcy1mb3ItcmVuZXdpbmctbG5nLWltcG9ydC1jb250cmFjdC13aXRoLXFhdGFyL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NzIzNjIzMy5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India to bargain for undelivered cargoes for renewing LNG import contract with Qatar,"Find this comment offensive?

Coca Cola's latest moves in the area bring its first ever bottle made from 100 percent plant-based plastic to the table produced with technology it says is ready to be scaled up.

The newly unveiled plant-based bottle arrives more than a decade after the company first introduced its so-called PlantBottle consisting of recyclable PET plastic made from up to 30 percent plant-based material. The other 70 percent was made from terephthalic acid (PTA) derived from oil-based sources and this is the portion of the PlantBottle's makeup the company has been working to address.

The company has leveraged a technology developed by plant-based plastics company Virent to develop sugar from corn into a hydrocarbon called paraxylene (bPX) which was in turn converted into a plant-based terephthalic acid (bPTA). It bears noting that as we've seen with ethanol production the use of arable land for industrial crops comes with its own set of environmental impacts though Coca Cola does say this process ""lends itself to flexibility in the feedstock.""

The other 30 percent is made from sugars that have been directly converted into monoethylene glycol (MEG) through a breakthrough process which the company says can be adapted to use hardwood feedstocks from sawmills or other wood industry waste products.

“The inherent challenge with going through bioethanol is that you are competing with fuel” said Dana Breed Global R&D Director Packaging and Sustainability The Coca-Cola Company. “We needed a next-generation MEG solution that addressed this challenge but also one that could use second generation feedstock like forestry waste or agricultural byproducts. Our goal for plant-based PET is to use surplus agricultural products to minimize carbon footprint so the combination of technologies brought by the partners for commercialization is an ideal fit with this strategy.""

Coca Cola says this technology is ready to be commercially scaled up and that it plans to eliminate oil-based virgin PET from plastic bottles in Europe and Japan by 2030 and use recycled or renewable materials instead. It has produced a limited run of 900 of PlantBottle prototypes as first steps.

“We are taking significant steps to reduce use of ‘virgin’ oil-based plastic as we work toward a circular economy and in support of a shared ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050” said Nancy Quan Chief Technical and Innovation Officer The Coca‑Cola Company. “We see plant-based plastics as playing a critical role in our overall PET mix in the future supporting our objectives to reduce our carbon footprint reduce our reliance on ‘virgin’ fossil fuels and boost collection of PET in support of a circular economy.”

However I was amazed to find out that acting isn't about pretending. Instead it's about being authentic and showing your true emotions.



You need to put a bit of yourself in every role; otherwise you are simply pretending and lying to people. We have a saying in theater: ""You don't need to feel everything the character is feeling but it needs to cost something to take a toll on you.""



I realized then that I have worn so many masks throughout the years and lost myself somewhere underneath as a result.

From that moment on acting became my journey of self-development to find myself and to heal. It helped me to process the loss of my father and provided the support I needed. Both acting and therapy complemented each other and it became a positive cycle that enabled me to heal grow and find myself under all the rubble.

In this video clip from ""Beat & Raise"" recorded on Sept. 24 Fool.com contributors Brian Withers and Neil Patel highlight the strengths of each company.

10 stocks we like better than Accenture

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Accenture wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20 2021

Brian Withers: Yeah there was a question here from Fool Fan on ""Which is the better buy Accenture or CTSH?"" which is Cognizant. Fool Fan notes that Tom Gardner has CTSH in his personal portfolio. I know at one point Cognizant was a pick for the Everlasting Portfolio and I think they sold out of it. Let me double-check. Stock Advisor. Yeah. The Everlasting Portfolio sold but it's possible. Tom likes to keep one share of stocks [laughs] that he sold just to remind him that he was in that business and he has since moved on and that helps him keep track of it. Do you have an opinion Neil between these Cognizant and Accenture are very much going after the same digital transformation customers and focused on bringing customers to the cloud. Is there one that you see as a better buy right now?

Neil Patel: Not at for any particular reason off the top of my head. I think this is one of those situations where a rising tide lifts all boats thing and there's just such a multi-generational secular shift toward the internet that's just getting bigger every year. Obviously cyber security is a huge threat companies don't know how to deal with it they don't know how to prepare for it and it's something that I think every company in this space is going to benefit from. I see that Cognizant is selling for a much lower or PE if that's something that's a big deal for you. But I think Accenture's quality particularly in the most recent quarter and over the past 12 months given everything that's going on in the world speaks to its quality. I think if you're interested in the space there's nothing wrong with owning both of those names.

Date 24.10.2021 Read time 5 Min Future Makers are the driving forces that take us forward: using technology determination collaboration and passion to make things happen. From cybersecurity to social media we'll hear from the people and partners using winning formulas to affect positive change.

In the fourth part of our Future Makers series Jefferson Slack Managing Director Commercial and Marketing at Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team examines the impact of sport the value of partnerships and the growing momentum of F1's newest team.

A few things have struck me most about Formula One since I came onboard.

First is the sport's capacity as a storytelling platform. It's so real and authentic: young people can sniff out inauthenticity and they can see that the stakes are real. On the racetrack there's nowhere to hide.

The number of young people who are being switched on to the sport is another real game-changer. Formula One has always traditionally appealed to an older male audience – it was viewed as very expensive and highly exclusive.

But I talk with executives now and they tell me: ""My teenage daughter is a huge F1 fan"" – that's probably not something you would have heard just a few years ago.

Formula One is so real and authentic. On the racetrack there's nowhere to hide. Jefferson Slack - Managing Director Commercial and Marketing at Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team

I'm just as impressed by F1's expansion mindset. Liberty is doing a fantastic job with the universe of Formula One and Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team is doing amazing things too. We had an advantage in some ways because we started from zero and built our brand identity from scratch – off the back of one of the world's most iconic brands Aston Martin.

That meant we could build out in progressive ways: we've shown a social conscience we've got some impressive ESG [Environmental Social and Governance] initiatives on the way and we've supported Pride Month through #WeRaceAsOne.

Clearly you can positively impact people's lives through sport – and we acknowledge that you need to invest time money and people to do that properly.

I've spent 30 years working in sports marketing and you make deals happen because you build relationships with people – you take them to the racetrack or the sports stadium so they can touch and feel the experience. Obviously that went away with COVID.

To a lot of American tech companies Formula One is still a new sport so it was daunting sitting down a year ago asking ourselves how we would fare commercially in 2021.

Happily we've partnered with some incredible companies and we're looking to expand our portfolio into 2022. We're also looking to amplify and grow our brand story and last but not least build and inhabit the first all-new factory in Formula One for 20 years – a space that will create revenue and performance advantages across the entire organisation. That's nothing if not ambitious!

Our new home Ground broken on new team factory Construction of Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team's brand-new buildings has begun. Read now

Another great surprise has been the support and leadership of Lawrence Stroll. He's a force of nature that's the expression I'd use. He's a man with an enormous will to win and nothing really gets in his way.

The most wonderful part is that he couldn't be more supportive: you want to do something for the business he'll want you to go for it. Before I joined I couldn’t imagine a man of his wealth and standing would work so hard. He's working from morning to night doing whatever it takes. He's all in.

The creation of Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team has been a little like working for a start-up. Of course having the Aston Martin brand behind us gives us huge presence but it's been a year of building – and continues to be. Now we're looking to take that initial momentum forwards into next year and beyond.

The satellite industry forms 75% of the space economy with satellite services and ground equipment the highest-revenue segments. In the last decade satellite industry revenues were around $230bn; 2020-2030 is expected to exceed $300bn with a growth rate of 23% not counting low-Earth orbit (LEO) commercial services. Satellite services revenues have remained the largest industry segment with revenues reaching $125bn though these fell to $116bn in 2020.

The MENA region has a long history in investment in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) services; demand makes it one of the largest markets after North America focused on TV broadcasting mobility inflight connectivity (IFC) LTE and hybrid networks government and military. The new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) space will revive the globe with hundreds and thousands of satellites for broadband connectivity from LEO and medium-Earth orbit (MEO). For global coverage the equation is three GEO satellites equals six MEO satellites equals hundreds of LEO satellites. NGSO (LEO-MEO) provides higher bandwidth than GEO.

The NGSO upstream market is expanding rapidly with high capital investment to accelerate the demand for downstream services with lower operational costs. The NGSO sector will extend opportunities to different vertical markets in the MENA region with high-speed connectivity such as maritime oil & gas IFC 5G connected devices video streaming government and military as well as direct consumers and households in rural areas.

Dissecting the landscape and spotting demand

The go-to-market strategy: Countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are investing heavily in industry 4.0 national space programmes energy and smart cities which will create demand and opportunities in the NGSO sector. Tawazunin Abu Dhabi is partnering with Airbus and the National Space Science and Technology Centre (NSSTC) to initiate the country’s first small-to-medium satellite component manufacturing unit and conduct AIT. With this the UAE will be the first Middle Eastern country to unleash the region’s opportunities in the upstream NGSO market.

Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 initiative will trigger demand or acceleration across satellite verticals. In the future the Saudi Space Commission (SSC) will help to further grow the satcom upstream market by shaping new policies and regulations locally. This will create more opportunities in the NGSO upstream market with support from local semi-government organisations and operators. Simultaneously with the emergence of the Egyptian Space Agency and Turkish national programmes/initiatives both Nilesat and Turksat are likely to show interest in the NGSO commercial market.

The MENA region is investing strongly in terrestrial OTT and pay-TV. According to the NGSO forecast there will be dedicated high availability of Tbps capacity which will increase the terrestrial bandwidth via NGSO satellites to further support OTT developments.

Orbofleet forecasts that by 2022 in the NGSO broadband space Ku-band capacity will reach up to 4Tbps to provide capacity services targeting businesses mobility and government markets while other NGSO operators focused on Ka-band will surpass 40Tbps by 2026. From 2027 Q/V-band will gain momentum commercially. This dynamic progress in the use of different high-frequency bands will mean low operational expenditure (OPEX) leading to the opening of business gateways for new downstream customers while also fulfilling their requirements.

Global opportunities with a key focus on MENA

In the short term OneWeb SpaceX’s Starlink and SES mPower’s upcoming satellites will create opportunities that increase NGSO demand especially in rural areas industrial mobility and GSM backhaul and among direct consumers with low-cost operations.

Satellite-based IoT is a crucial solution for the MENA region. IoT provides more flexibility and reduces the operational cost of connecting devices and machines in industrial verticals such as agriculture oil & gas SCADA emergencies and transportation connectivity. LEO satellite constellations will also supplement terrestrial 5G infrastructure in the Middle East.

NGSO’s pace of innovation has encouraged existing LEO operators to develop build and provide a LEO network based on VDES technology a second-generation automatic identification system (AIS) supporting Maritime and Sea a crucial application in the MEA region’s maritime market. NGSO operators have created initiatives to enter MENA and have conducted business opportunity surveys in the Middle East to expand their business units.

Africa remains an opportunity for foreign NGSO satellite operators as local telecom operators already have a significant presence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In the last few years the Gulf region and North Africa have expanded the local market by founding national space agencies such as the UAE Space Agency the Saudi Space Commission the Egyptian Space Agency and the National Space Science Agency in Bahrain. These initiatives will allow small-to-medium satellite businesses to serve their local needs from LEO such as remote sensing but will dedicate space and opportunity in the satcom and telecom applications for both upstream and downstream markets

Conclusion

With the impact of Covid-19 the world has seen huge demand for applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Their intensive use during the lockdown put huge pressure on terrestrial broadband capacity. Support for this via GEO satellites will be limited in terms of speed and high latency. Pandemics and other such emergencies will accelerate demand via NGSO to feed these hybrid networks with higher capacity and speed.

The MENA region will boost not only the downstream but also the upstream local market through continuous investment in the space and satellite industry. Regional satellite operators such as Arabsat E’shailsat Nilesat and Yahsat will no doubt continue to invest in the GEO business but some of them are also involved in partnerships that will eventually unlock future NGSO opportunities.

Bush,"WASHINGTON — Colin Powell the first Black U.S. secretary of state died at 84 of COVID-19 complications after serving with great honor in a variety of public capacities.

To his regret and that of his countrymen he likely will be remembered as the man who made the case for the invasion of Iraq before the United Nations Security Council on the false premise that ruler Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction poised attack the West. They never were found.

Powell acted on the flawed assurance of President George W. Bush who told the nation those weapons existed but offered only artist’s sketches of the WMDs as they were then popularly known. Powell subsequently confessed his regret for what he labeled “a blot on my record” that remains a singular exception from a proud history of public service.

Bush often nicknamed “Dubya” by foe and friend alike had a flippant way of speaking and perhaps unintentionally administered that blot which Powell characteristically accepted. In any event it was a most unfortunate episode that on reflection dishonored Bush much more than it did Powell.

Upon Powell’s death Bush said he and other presidents had relied on “his counsel and experience” without reference to that incident. He noted that Powell had received the Presidential Medal of Freedom twice. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin the first Black person to hold that office called him “one of the greatest leaders that we have ever witnessed.” Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah called Powell “a statesman and trailblazer dedicated to America and the cause of liberty.”

As for George W. Bush the son of the late President George H.W. Bush seems destined now to be remembered as the architect of a distinctively un-American act of aggression against another foreign power. Ironically he has surfaced again in recent days in what could be seen as an attempt to polish his own reputation in the Republican Party.

He recently endorsed Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming daughter of his old running mate. Not long ago she was ousted from the GOP House leadership for her outspoken criticism of Donald Trump and Bush now appears to be joining her in opposing Trump.

Former presidents traditionally have taken to the sidelines in presidential politics. In this instance the junior Bush seems desirous of associating himself with Republicans who now believe Trump is poison to the Grand Old Party to the Constitution and to the rule of law.

In that sense Bush may be seeking redemption in his party for his major mistake of invading Iraq and justifying it on false pretenses.

Trump’s current assault on the American electoral system now strikes at the heart of this system. It challenges the legitimacy of the vote in key states as well as the result in the Electoral College where a simple majority determines the election of the president.

In 2020 the Electoral College clearly validated the election of Democrat Joe Biden who won the popular vote by 7 million ballots. But Trump called on his vice president Mike Pence presiding over the counting of electoral votes to declare him the winner and so certify. To his credit Pence declined earning himself the open wrath of the man who four years earlier had placed him a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Such are early signs that Trump’s grip on the party may be diminishing. Nevertheless no credible Republican of stature or promise has yet emerged to replace him. Another revered old Republican Gen. Douglas MacArthur once told Congress: “Old soldiers never die; they just fade away.” No doubt some in his party now however silently are beginning to hope that Trump does the same.

Longtime friend and retired announcer Tom Durkin said Neumeier's wife Michele told him the death was related to a heart condition. Patch.com reported Neumeier was 70.

“We were very saddened to learn today of the passing of Bob Neumeier” the Breeders’ Cup said in a statement written Sunday afternoon. “Bob was a big part of the NBC Breeders’ Cup World Championships broadcasts for many years as a handicapper reporter and analyst. Bob brought his expertise of Thoroughbred racing and a great sense of humor to every show. We extend our sincere condolences to Bob’s wife Michele and to his extended family.”

Beside his role with NBC Neumeier worked for decades in New England media. He did announcing for the Boston Bruins was a sports anchor for WBZ-TV was the New England anchor for Comcast SportsNet and hosted a midday show on all-sports WEEI Radio.

Durkin remembered Neumeier as ""a joy to be around.""

""Neumy"" as he was widely known ""was just a very talented person"" Durkin told Horse Racing Nation. ""And in several fields. I mean not just as a broadcaster – he did hockey play-by-play for the Boston Bruins. Now people think that calling a horse race is hard. I have no idea how anybody can do play-by-play for hockey as well as Bob. It's lightning fast.

""But his first love was horse racing. He loved the game. He was a very good horseplayer. He won handicapping contests. He conquered the Pick 6 a couple of times. I mean he was a really good horseplayer. And along with that he had great passion for the game.""

Neumeier was hospitalized for a stroke in 2014. Durkin said he had been sick for several weeks.

Another industry veteran Joan Lawrence told HRN ""I had the privilege and honor to work with him when I was involved full time in horse racing with NTRA (National Thoroughbred Racing Association) and working the events in the winner's circle. To be a part of watching Bob work he was fabulous. He was a great horseman analyst fun smart. A wonderful man. I don't know what else to say he was professional kind. And as a friend as somebody I knew on Tom's parties and stuff he was just a lovely lovely person. It's a sad day.""

(WVLT) - A staple employer in the Newport community Conagra Brands ceased all production for the last time Friday Oct. 22.

Approximately 215 jobs were impacted due to the termination of production at the plant Senior Director of Conagra communications Dan Hare said.

“We informed employees many months ago and made sure to keep everyone updated as we finalized the process” Hare said.

There are approximately thirty additional jobs that will be impacted once the warehouse portion of the plant closes. Hare said their current plan was to close the warehouse in late winter to early spring and they would make sure employees were aware of the plan in advance.

“We will make sure our teams are aware of plans and timing as we proceed” Hare said.

District 11 Representative Jeremy Faison posted that the close was tough on the community on Twitter.

Conagra officials released a statement on the closing to WVLT News.

“Yesterday was the last day of production at our Newport facility and it impacted approximately 215 jobs. The decision was based on our need to operate as efficiently and effectively as possible across our full network of production facilities. The products will now be made primarily in Archbold Ohio and Ft. Madison Iowa. We informed our employees early this year and have discussed the timing and transition support as part of the process. Employees are also able to apply for positions at other Conagra facilities” the statement said.

If you are being laid off due to the plant closing Rep. Faison said to call his office at 615-741-6871 and they would help take care of the transition.

The Newport plant was originally built in 1905 and produced Manwich Van Camp’s Beans Ranch Style Beans and Hunt’s spaghetti and tomato sauce.

The Hubble Space Telescope caught a pair of ""squabbling"" galaxies in action according to the European Space Agency.

The pair of objects is known as Arp 86 and includes two galaxies roughly 220 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Pegasus. They are known individually as NGC 7753 and the much smaller companion NGC 7752.

""The diminutive companion galaxy almost appears attached to NGC 7753 and it is this peculiarity that has earned the designation 'Arp 86' – signifying that the galaxy pair appears in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies compiled by the astronomer Halton Arp in 1966"" ESA officials wrote in a statement about the new research.

""The gravitational dance between the two galaxies will eventually result in NGC 7752 being tossed out into intergalactic space or entirely engulfed by its much larger neighbor"" the added.

The Hubble Space Telescope observations were meant to shed light on how cold gas in the area contributes to the formation of young stars observed in the image. The observatory examined star clusters gas clouds and dust clouds in several environments in the neighborhood including other galaxies outside of Arp 86 ESA stated.

The space telescope's work was combined with measurements from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) a set of telescopes in the Chilean Andes optimized to peer through galactic dust in young systems. Between ALMA and Hubble the research team is seeking more information about how stars are formed.

The research will also assist with future work by the James Webb Space Telescope which is set to launch late in 2021 to explore the origins of the universe. One of Webb's research projects will be to look at dusty galaxies (such as Arp 86) to learn more about star evolution ESA stated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZW5nYW1lci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZ3VpZGVzL2dlbnNoaW4taW1wYWN0LW5ldy1jaGFyYWN0ZXItcHJldmlldy1hcmF0YWtpLWl0dG8tcXVpY2stcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Genshin Impact New Character Preview: Arataki Itto,"Arataki Itto is one of the newest characters in Genshin Impact and this character preview will detail all one needs to know to master him. Recently leaked Itto has a number of different skills that will make him handy for damage-dealing.

Mihoyo started the beta testing of Genshin Impact‘s 2.3 Update. One of the new characters has leaked to the public: Arataki Itto. Itto is a 5-Star Geo character in beta. This character preview will detail Arataki Itto’s skills talent constellations and general capabilities before he’s finally fully released.

For some Genshin Impact guides take a look at some of the following articles:

Itto’s General Information

Rarity: 5-Star

Tier: S

Element: GeoPyro

Position: DPS

Weapon: Claymore

Itto’s Skills

First let’s look at Itto’s normal attack:

Normal Attack (Fight Club Legend)

Every 4th attack stacks a buff called “Superlative Superstrength” (SS) Special Charged Attack called Arataki Kesagiri; each use consumes one stack of (SS)



The Special Charge Attack Arataki Kesagiri is the main source of damage for Itto. All of the mechanisms to his character are related to Arataki Kesagiri like his Elemental Skill.

Elemental Skill (Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst!)

Summons a Geo construction – Ushi which can:

Taunts surrounding opponents and attracts their fire.

Inherits HP based on a percentage of Arataki’s Max HP.

When attacked it will provide Arataki Itto himself with 1 Superlative Superstrength stack. 1 stack can be gained this way once every 2 seconds.

It will flee when its HP reaches 0 or its duration ends. It will grant 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength as it leaves.

The most useful side of the Elemental Skill is to provide extra (SS) buff which results in further use of Itto’s Special Charge Attack.

Now let’s have a look at Itto’s Elemental Burst:

Elemental Skill (Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil!)

Itto turns into Raging Oni King mode.

Normal Charged and Plunging Attacks will be converted to Geo DMG. This cannot be overridden.

Itto’s ATK will be increased based on his DEF. His Normal Attack SPD will also be increased.

The first second and third combos of his Normal Attack will grant Itto 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength when they hit opponents.

Itto gains 20% Elemental and Physical RES.

Essentially Itto’s Elemental Skill is a buff that can infuse his attack with Geo element make all of his attacks stack (SS) and provide Itto an ATK bonus based on Itto’s DEF. This ensures that DEF is one of the most important stats for Itto. DEF is emphasized in his talents too in the following ways:

Arataki Ichiban – Consecutive Arataki Kesagiri stacks ATK SPD buff. Bloodline of the Crimson Oni – Arataki Kesagiri DMG is increased by 35% of Arataki ltto’s DEF. Warrior’s Burden – For a short time after using Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst! or performing a dash Itto’s Normal Attack combo will not be reset.

Itto Constellations



As a Genshin Impact player the most concerning side of a character is – What about their constellations? (How much should I prepare to pay for Itto?) Itto’s constellations are as below (C3 and C5 are not mentioned as they are common constellations for increasing the max level of ES and EB):

C1

Using Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil! provides Arataki Itto with further buffs to Superlative Superstrength.

Using it will grant Arataki Itto 2 stacks instead.

From the first second of the skill’s use 1 stack will be added on until a total of 3 have been added.

The mechanism of this constellation is that Itto no longer needs to stack (SS) before using Elemental Burst. Itto can use EB anytime.

C2

After using Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil! each party member whose Element is Geo will decrease that skill’s CD by 1.5s and restore 6 Energy to Arataki Itto. A maximum of 6s CD can be decreased and 24 Energy restored in this manner.

We can see that the developers encourage Itto teaming up with three Geo teammates. This can reduce Itto’s ES CD from 20s to 14s and Energy required from 80 to 56. This is a very important Constellation if you want Itto to be your main DPS.

(Video by AbnormalBeing.)

C4

While in the Raging Oni King state caused by Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil! Itto has a 25% higher CRIT rate against opponents with equal or lower HP percentage remaining than him.

This constellation is simple. It’s nothing more than a 25% CRIT rate buff.

C6

Arataki ltto’s Charged Attacks deal 50% increased Crit DMG. Additionally when he uses Arataki Kesagiri he has a 50% chance to not consume stacks of Superlative Superstrength.

This constellation is straightforward and violent. It is worth getting if you can afford it.

You can see the full description of Itto’s Constellations on Genshin Lab.

Conclusion

To conclude Itto is designed as a Character which uses his Special Charge Attack to deal DMG. DEF is an important stat to him so when you farm artifacts you have to keep those that have DEF stats. If you can C2 you should consider team him with the other three Geo characters. With this character preview you now know all that’s necessary to mastering Arataki Itto upon his release.",,,,,,,,,

Timothy D. Lockwood

Rexville - On Monday October 18 2021 Timothy Lockwood 56 left this world to be reunited with family and friends in the Kingdom of God. He was born in Warsaw to Clifford & Ella Lockwood. In 1994 he married his wife of 27 years Merrie (Ford) Lockwood.

Tim was preceded in death by his infant daughter Faith his Mother Ella (Carmer) Lockwood his Father-in-law Roderick Ford and his twin infant siblings: brother Kevin and sister Lori.

He will be greatly missed by many including his Father Clifford Lockwood of North Chili (formally Nunda) his Brother Terry (Cindy) Lockwood of Henrietta Mother-In-Law Doris Ford (Greenwood) his Brother-In-Law Roderick Ford II (Rik) of Greenwood; Children Shane Lockwood & Vince Lockwood of Rexville and Grandchildren Ember Lockwood & Lincoln Lockwood of Wellsville.

Tim attended Alfred State College obtaining his Associates Degree as a Mechanical Technician. Shortly afterwards he was hired by Corning Incorporated and had worked in the Decker Building Sullivan Park and most recently at the Big Flats Innovation Support Center. He was a dedicated employee for 24 years. He had received two patents during his time there.

In his spare time Tim was an avid lover and supporter of local asphalt modified racing as well as NHRA drag racing. His passion also ran deep for classic muscle cars. Pontiac firebirds in particular.

Above all elseTim was a devoted family man. There was never a more patient kindhearted forgiving and loving Husband Father and Grandfather. He shared his passion of racing and car shows with his Father Brother and Sons. He was a willing participant for a 'professional' cosmetic makeover and manicure by his Granddaughter and would become a nefarious villain for his ""Spiderman"" Grandson to capture. Traveling was a passion that he shared with his wife; they were planning a trip for their 30th anniversary. There are many wonderful family memories that will be cherished.

He leaves behind several nieces and nephews: Josh Lockwood of Rochester Riky & Meah Ford of Greenwood (Canisteo) and Matthew & Dori Copenhaver of Rochester.

At the wishes of the family there will be no funeral or viewing; instead there will be a private burial ceremony. A Celebration of Life will be planned at a later date.

In lieu of flowers we ask that donations be made in Tim's name to the Greenwood Volunteer Fire Department or the Andover Volunteer Fire Department.

“I’m ready for it” she said as she headed toward that part of Acker Gym.

After getting a climbing harness fitted and strapping in to be belayed the 16-year-old Corning High student started climbing.

She was one of about 35 children and teens Friday at the Adapted Physical Education Sports Day held at Chico State.

“Our goal is to reach students with physical and sensory disabilities” said Marci Pope an instructor in the Kinesiology Department at the university and the event organizer.

The sports day introduces students to sports that are played in the Paralympic Games and provides equipment specially designed to help the students compete she said.

In its 20th year the event returned after a hiatus in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pope had considered postponing another year because turnout was expected to be lower than in previous years but she said feedback from the schools from Butte Yuba Shasta and Tehama counties was heartening.

“Teachers were saying ‘my kids would devastated if we didn’t get to go to sports day'” she said.

In a side room at Acker Gym Hill wasn’t the only one excited about climbing the rock wall.

Maera McDonald 11 reached the top of the slanted climbing wall got down and went back up to the top.

The Browns Valley Elementary student said it wasn’t her first time on a rock wall. She had climbed with her sister at the gym and also two years ago at the Adapted Physical Sports Day.

“The slanted wall was easy but those two were hard” she said pointing to two more advanced climbing walls before joining friends and discussing the finer points of climbing.

In the main Acker Gym students tossed footballs played sitting volleyball swung baseball bats and kicked balls at nets.

They also played wheelchair rugby although most of the players were not wheelchair bound.

“They have different activities for students we don’t have” said Melinda Robbins a teacher at Corning High. “It shows them the different abilities they have that maybe they don’t get to experience.”

It also shows them differences other students might have she said.

Anthony Krepp 15 finished playing wheelchair rugby after assisting on a few touches and stood up excited to see what the next available sport was.

“It felt good” to help his team in the rugby game he said although his student volunteer helper was a “traitor” for playing on the opposing team.

Each of the participants were assigned a Chico State student usually from the Kinesiology department to lend a hand and teach them the sport.

Krepp a sophomore at Oroville High had three in tow who followed the excited teen to the next station.

The sports day shows the kids what’s possible and AbilityFirst a nonprofit in Chico seeks to continue helping students with disabilities compete in athletics as their peers do.

“We’re teaching wheelchair sports and Paralympic sports taught by disabled coaches” said AbilityFirst Director Eric Snedeker who was at the event to “recruit” athletes.

The program also has wheelchair water skiing and skateboarding along with specialized hand-pedal bicycles.

Water skiing is hosted by an internationally acclaimed Paralympic Games coach he said.

Watching the wheelchair rugby game AbilityFirst Program Coordinator Elissa “Mouse” Robinson cheered.

A two-time wheelchair basketball National Champion at the University of Alabama Robinson said kids who join the program tend to stay with the program.

“Adaptive sports opportunities decline as you get older” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5ldGl6ZW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC8xMTUwNjYtaG93LWFsYmFueS1jYW4tcmVjbGFpbS1pdHMtd2F0ZXJmcm9udC1iYWQtaGlnaHdhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Albany Can Reclaim Its Waterfront From a Bad Highway,"Built during the highway craze of the 1960s (which arguably continues today) the six-lane Interstate 787 in Albany lets commuters ""make a swift exit to outlying suburbs or points downstate"" but also blocks access to the city's waterfront on the Hudson River. Like other urban highways writes Mike De Socio I-787 ""also devoured about 100 acres of downtown Albany bulldozing homes and businesses cutting the city off from the riverfront and walling off some of its poorest neighborhoods.""

Yet for decades efforts to remove parts of the highway have failed ""[s]o now the city is chasing a number of offbeat workarounds."" Proposals range from an elevated High Line-style park to ""digging a canal through downtown Albany in an effort to bring the river back into the city.""

So far the only project that has broken ground is the Albany Skyway ""an on-ramp-turned-linear-park due to open next year."" According to Matthew Peter executive director of the Albany Parking Authority and one of the driving forces behind the project says ""the Skyway has moved forward where other proposals haven’t because it represented a compromise between tearing down the entire highway and well doing nothing."" With a $13 million budget the Skyway requires much less investment than full-scale highway removal. Peter ""believes that reclaiming the ramp for human-scale pursuits can kick off a gradual process of rethinking and eventually removing the elevated section of 787.""

Workarounds like this are necessary in part because they allow the city to take initiative without state agencies. ""New York State not only controls the highway itself but also the capital complex whose workers depend on it."" But ""[w]ith the highway nearing the end of its planned lifespan"" and highway removal gaining support in cities around the country city and state leaders will have to decide what the future holds for Albany's waterfront. Meanwhile ""infrastructure funds from the Biden administration have inspired fresh hope among advocates for undoing the ill effects of 1960s-era urban thoroughfares.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRtYXJnZS5jb20vYmVhcmQtYmFpdGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Beard Baiting' Is The Latest Australian Dating Trend,"The phrase “dating trend” has been trotted out to the point where it now seems the most mundane aspects of hooking up all have names. But today we’re not here to talk about ‘wokefishing’ or ‘candy corning‘ – we’re here to alert you to the most wholesome dating trend of 2020: beard baiting.

Dubbed “the push up bra for men” beard baiting is when you grow a beard in order to accentuate your jawline (or to hide a small chin). Rampaging through meme accounts it’s no surprise this rather cruel image has embedded itself into the popular culture of 2020 with a beard vs no beard meme proving to be one of the most shared.

DMARGE spoke to Samantha Jayne Australian Relationship Expert and Advisor to Channel 10’s The Bachelor to get her insights.

“Some might disagree but I think beard baiting makes things fair” Samantha told DMARGE.

“Think about it: women wear make up they get their hair blow-dried spray tans fake eyelashes nails filters on social media contouring smaller noses corsets tightening waistlines push up bras not to mention the botox and fillers cosmetic tattoos butt lifts you name it!”

“Women have the advantage when it comes to enhancing beauty or hiding flaws men just don’t have all the tools women do to enhance their looks.”

All up? “Who cares if you’re hiding a little bit of a double chin women would do it too and they have make up tricks that do all sorts of things.”

That said as Samantha explains any “beard baiting” men should do so consciously and be wary it could be very easily exposed.

“Where there is an ethical dilemma is extreme beard baiting – especially when clean-shaven comes back. You will get exposed! Big time! How do you explain your completely different look. I guess it’s a little like seeing your spoodle shaven for the first time you do get used to it…after a while.”

The ideal solution would be for you not to see your chin deficit as a deficit and for society to come to the same solution and for us to all fall around in a big group hug of self love (and for you to find a partner who loves you for who you are).

But let’s be real: when online dating you’re going to want to put your best foot (as considered by the world at large) forward.

But for aspiring beard baiters there’s good news: according to Samantha “It’s totally ok to hide a small double chin enhance your jawline and sculpt the face kind of like a flattering nice haircut for the face” and it’s only sneaky “when you have zero chin and you’re trying to make your jawline look as chiselled like Jason Momoa.”

“If there is an extreme [difference]… that’s a no go zone. Shaping really is the key to a flattering beard.”

“As far as a clean-shaven [profile] photo well… it depends. If you are looking for something short term then no reason not to however if you’re looking for something more longterm and you’d like to be fully transparent then it’s a good idea” Samantha added.

Generally speaking you should “show your true self as close as possible” Samantha then told DMARGE. Why? Because if you don’t: “it ends in disaster.”

“I’ve seen people use great photos are many years younger slimmer more attractive but the problem is when it comes to the face to face meeting the person they meet is disappointed. This is bad for both parties and keeps you single for a lot longer and ultimately experiencing rejection.”

“The perfect profile photo brings out your personality your best features and looks like you. It tells a story and it’s a mix of head shots body shots and action shots.”

Ironically 2020 with the ample opportunity lockdowns have provided Australian men to experiment with their facial hair we have seen an acceleration of a grooming revolution long in the works.

As Samantha told DMARGE there was a time when beards were taboo: “I would hear women say ‘No facial hair’ it’s a turn-off. [But] now more and more women love beards and I mean LOVE! They actually request it.”

“I can’t figure it out this has happened to me too. I was once all for clean shaven; now it’s beard all the way!! There is something so masculine about facial hair that can turn boyish looks into sexy strong confident man!”

“Since lockdown according to Gilette the sale of razors to men have significantly dropped.”

Samantha then provided us with some tips for any man who thinks he may have oversold his mandible: “beard baiting can be a smart way to get more dates however if you are hiding an extreme receded chin then when it comes to shaving it off you might be in trouble.”

“You better make sure you create a true emotional connection with a woman so that she looks more than skin deep.”

Putting aside the fact that you’re probably better off without someone that breaks up with you because “you shaved your beard” here are Samantha’s tips for giving yourself the best chance possible of truly connecting with someone you’re seeing.

“Here’s how you can create an emotional connection Beard Baiting or not Beard Baiting… The key is making her feel good. When you make her feel good she will want more of you. A simple thing like a compliment making her smile being light hearted and having a joke with her can make all the difference.”

“Flirting with her and keeping it clean [and] innocent will make her want more of you especially if you don’t get sexual she will think ‘I wonder why? That makes him unique. Is he different from other guys or maybe he doesn’t find me attractive? Creating that uncertainty within her will make her desire you more. The early phases of dating are all about uncertainty which leads to the excitement of the chase.”

“When you chat with her via text phone email or face to face ask her lots of questions and focus on positive topics where she can dream. Use lots of emotive words such as ‘feels good’ descriptive words like smooth wet slippery most hard…of course keep it clean; her subconscious mind will recognise the words and create a sensation of tingles.”

The stars of Teen Mom OG reunited in Los Angeles to film the reunion but fans noticed Mackenzie 27 was left out of the group photos.

The r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2 Reddit shared Mackenzie's tweet: ""Being left out because one girl hates me. Cool.""

A social media user replied: ""I was wondering why you weren't in the pics? I thought you guys all got along.""

Mackenzie responded: ""Same... I hate how easily my feelings get hurt.""

She previously said she's a victim of ""cancel culture"" after her feud with Cheyenne Floyd over a racial slur.

The Teen Mom OG star claimed Cheyenne has ""cut her off"" after she called Vice President Kamala Harris a ""colored woman"" in a Facebook post.

Cheyenne took to her Instagram Stories on Friday night writing: ""I am not an MTV producer... I don't call the shots. But if you feel the need to keep bullying me over things that haven't happened to make you feel seen... Be my guest.

""You have an odd fixation on me. Your rendition of how things happened are beyond delusional and I wish you would focus on yourself and leave me alone. @MackennzieMcKee.""

Cheyenne's rant continued: ""I have done my best to keep this off social media for months but at this point I have to tell my side of what happened. After Mackenzie's colored comment came out she asked to call me and I told her no problem. We had a conversation that she continued to put her foot in her mouth explaining how she knew nothing about segregation & how black people were referred to as colored where she came from. I took my time to teach a lesson when I did not have to. It is not my responsibility to teach you.

""But since I am the only black cast member on the show she felt like she had to call me and explain. After an hour-long conversation she thanked me for even talking to her because she said her husband thought I was going to be 'one of the angry black women.' They were surprised that I took the call & took the time to explain to her why the term is beyond incorrect. She apologized to me and I explained she did not need to apologize to me. You can't hurt me because I know my history. I am not your colored.

""Later it was presented if I would get on a Zoom call with her while she talked to Color Of Change so they could in fact give her another history lesson. We did the Zoom she barely spoke and at the end she repeatedly said I love you. No I didn't say it back because I didn't know you. When I say I love you to someone I mean it. No I did not laugh at her I actually explained to her that it was just not a term that I don't throw around that's not what I taught.""

Cheyenne added on her stories: ""At the last reunion when she addressed the situation they also had me address the situation and it was edited out. They also edited out Mackenzie having to be coached over and over again on what to say as she continued to say uneducated ignorant and extremely naive comments. Every answer she gave me brought me into it to the point that they stopped filming got her on the phone with Color Of Change again to explain how she was in the wrong again. None of this has been shown. Watching her film her segment showed how after all of the calls and history lessons she received she still just didn't get it. She was upset that she has to even apologize or mention the 'Black Situation.'

""Fast forward to the live she did address everything because she was upset when the reunion aired at how they edited it even though they made her look her best. She continued to force this false narrative and playing the victim bringing my name up again. When I had nothing to do with the situation other than the fact that I am the black cast member that you brought into your mess.""

Cheyenne then said that she hasn't spoken on the situation because she can ""clearly"" see Mackenzie ""needs help.""

The mom of two continued: ""Once again tonight she has made herself the victim when in fact she still can't take a second to see what she has done. You continue to paint yourself to be extremely loving and apologetic when you're not. You are exhaustingly ignorant and if they showed what actually happened at the last reunion people would understand when I would prefer to not be subjugated to your presence. The angry black woman would like to be left alone. Thank you.""

Mackenzie also responded in a lengthy social media video saying: ""Many of you know about the humiliating mistake I made that I was extremely sorry about and I wish more than anything I wouldn't have brought one of the girls from the show Cheyenne into it because it wasn't her mistake. And she shouldn't have had to carry that burden on her shoulder of being brought into it. I really just wanted to have that conversation with her and we did have a really good conversation at first. And for some reason it turned south. I'm just not used to this. I don't have a problem with any of them... I don't like having problems with anyone. I don't know how it turned into this.

""So we did a phone call and the last things I have said... let me hold your hand. I want to support you. I've supported everything she has stood for and nothings going to change that because it's the right thing to do. It was on a skype and my last words to her were 'Hey I've told you I loved you like six times and you haven't said anything back.' And she laughed- like she laughed. And that hurt. And I let things hurt me. I really do. I let things hurt me and it's hurt me a lot that she laughed at me. When I said I love you and let me be there for you she laughed.""

""Before I see all the girls I'm going to say sorry. I'm just going to tell her I've been really selfish thinking about how bad I said you laughing at me hurt me and I don't want to think about my feelings. I want to think about your feelings. I just said I'm sorry and I hope you can forgive me. And so this was the time before I was about to fly out to LA. And she read it and she unfollowed me on Twitter.""

Mackenzie continued: ""I go and MTV texted me 'Hey we're doing things a little different. You're actually not going to come on set.' Basically they were telling me we're just going to do you solo. And when I showed up everyone was gone. They were like 'Yeah all the girls filmed all day. We're doing it different.' I kind of thought maybe it's because of Covid but I just went with it and so in all my photoshoots and in all my photos I did a photo on the couch and they said we're editing all of you guys in on the couch together so just like eat popcorn and be fun.' And I'm like 'okay.' And it was just really weird.

""And I asked them... did me saying sorry to her bother her so much she demanded I was not in these photos? And they just wouldn't answer... And I was told by MTV... they did not do anything with all the girls together and I'm not singled out. It's not that way it's just being done different. And I get off the plane and it's like you might as well have slapped me in the face when I got 100 messages of people screenshotting Cheyenne not only posting a photo of all four girls but her saying 'my favorites.'""

Mackenzie ended the video: ""I hate that I'm sad. I hate that this really hurts me that I was not only lied to but because I said sorry this had to happen... And all the girls are posting all the photos and all the videos that I was lied to about not by them. And everyone was asking why I wasn't in the photo and I said I think it's because Cheyenne hates me... I don't know what the reason was but I know the schedule changed as soon as I said sorry to her. I'm confused. I'm lost and now Maci's mad at me and posting stuff. So I don't understand. I don't know what else to tell you guys.

FIGHTING BACK

In May Mackenzie said she's a victim of ""cancel culture"" after her feud with Cheyenne Floyd over the racial slur.

Mackenzie took to TikTok for a message to ""all the moms"" as she said: ""When you are a mom... and that child makes one little mistake because they're human and that's what humans do do we let that define everything about them? Do we automatically dismiss all the good they do... and we cancel them?

""And we cancel them and they are now known for that one mistake they did and we blow that up and focus on that little mistake? No. Because we're smarter than that...""

She added: ""So why are we doing that to other people? Why do we blow up every little mistake they do and dismiss all the hard work they put in or dismiss where their heart truly is?

""Why do we dismiss all the mistakes we've ever made and just cancel people?""

The MTV star previously said: ""I’m still confused why I can’t get on and stay sorry from my heart.

“We need to get rid of racism and racial injustice but I’m not racist.

“Cancel culture is too big we’re canceling people left and right... But if she (Cheyenne) wants to hate me she can. I said something ignorant.""

In a Teen Mom episode Mackenzie spoke with a social rights activist from Color Of Change to educate herself more on her racially insensitive comments.

She was asked: “What are some of the things you feel like you’ve learned since you said that?”

Mackenzie replied: “My privilege. I used to say ‘how am I privileged I’ve been through hard things too.’ But I realized I never had it hard because of my skin color.""

In January Teen Mom fans labeled Mackenzie racist when she the Vice President a “colored” woman on her Facebook page.

The mom wrote: ""Sorry no. There are a lot of amazing women in the world for my daughters to look up to and see as role models. Kamala Harris is not one of them.

""It blows my mind that out of all the amazing colored women in this world that is the one who is making history.”

While viewers ripped Mackenzie for the comment her co-star Cheyenne 28 got on Twitter to encourage her followers to “educate.”

She tweeted: “It’s time to have a conversation a form something to educate and enlighten because ignorance is pervasive.”

Mackenzie lashed out at Cheyenne for ""cutting off"" contact with her after her comment and she said in an Instagram Live: ""Cheyenne tweeted that I’m ignorant. I would’ve gone live with her I would’ve gone on her podcast. I talked to Cheyenne and I thought things were going to be amazing but it was just a downward spiral from there.""

The Oklahoma native then said of her co-star: “I told Cheyenne ‘I love you.’ And her message back was ‘I have no sympathy for you. Welcome to day 1 of being uncomfortable because of the color of your skin.’""

Mackenzie added: “So if she hates me that’s fine. That’s fine because I said something ignorant but I messaged and told her that I love her.

""I said ‘I love you I want to hold your hand and do this together with you.’ But she decided right then and there she’s done with me. Cut me off.”

This is not the first Teen Mom OG franchise racism scandal as Cheyenne’s baby daddy Cory Wharton’s girlfriend Taylor Selfridge was fired from the popular reality show last season for resurfaced racist tweets.

By Kristen Pizzo San Jose Spotlight

October 21 2021 Costco wants to grow its San Jose footprint—this time in the Westgate West shopping center off Prospect Road. But the proposal isn’t sitting well with local residents.

“Nobody likes seeing empty buildings for long periods of time so it is important to fill it in with viable businesses or dense housing. But let’s get creative” said Gail Wesling a resident of the Prides Crossing neighborhood. “Don’t put in a big box store bringing in hoards of vehicles so close to residential. Let’s make our community more humane.” The West San Jose 160000-square-foot proposed warehouse would take over the Goodwill store Ethan Allen Furniture Company Smart & Final and former Orchard Supply Hardware building along with several other vacant spaces in the mall.

Westgate West is located down the street from Prospect High School. The Almaden Sunnyvale Santa Clara and Great Oaks Costco locations are all within 15-20 minute drives from the shopping center. San Jose Vice Mayor Chappie Jones whose district includes the project notified residents about the proposed tenant in his monthly newsletter last Friday. The company is expected to submit its proposal in early November according to the newsletter.

The newsletter was posted on Nextdoor and received more than 400 comments some expressing excitement about having a nearby Costco but many others lamenting about further traffic congestion at the Prospect Saratoga and Hamilton avenue intersections. Jones told San José Spotlight he hasn’t seen the complete proposal but confirmed it contains plans for a rooftop parking lot.



“The community will have multiple opportunities to weigh in and express opinions and concerns and we will take all that into consideration and make a judgment on whether to support or not support the project” he said. So far Jones said he’s received only a handful of emails about the proposal and one was in support of Costco. Dawn Siemer a resident of the Country Lane neighborhood sent one of those emails. “I wrote a really detailed email to the District 1 email address. I can be an angry NIMBY” she told San José Spotlight. “Seriously as someone who bought my grandparents’ house I have a longtime connection to the neighborhood and I’d hate our quirky little strip mall to be crushed by Costco.” On Nextdoor many residents commented that they didn’t like the idea of losing the current businesses in the shopping center such as Goodwill.

Jones pointed out that the displaced businesses may have the opportunity to relocate to the retail space at El Paseo and 1777 Saratoga Avenue. Overall he’s optimistic about the proposal. “With a project like this the first reaction is to oppose it. But we need to see the value Costco provides to the community in terms of convenience tax revenue strengthening our retail base… We have to weigh all of these different factors when making a decision” Jones said. Kay S. of the Starbird neighborhood said she is worried about the traffic but likes the convenience of having a Costco in her area. “I think Costco is a good company” she wrote on Nextdoor. “They treat their employees well and have great customer service and products I use.”

10 stocks we like better than Costco Wholesale

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20 2021

Brian Withers: This is another one that I'm just super surprised at. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that as the coronavirus abated and people started getting vaccines they're out to Costco and spending more money. I was going to show a couple of slides they have of Costco today presentation that has a couple of interesting little tidbits if you're not super familiar with Costco. Right in the beginning they have a few of the I guess these are the newest Costcos and this is in Japan and I don't know if you noticed there's something a little bit different about this Costco then Demitri sees it. What's different?

Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Unless that's photoshop I see a big parking lot on the roof. [laughs]

Withers: On the roof. Absolutely. It's on the roof and they have the gas station here which is impressive. But I was just like ""Wow look at all [laughs] those cars on the roof."" It looks like it's a double-decker parking lot even on the top. That's pretty interesting. Certainly the parking lot around the edges here smaller. Look at the next one. This is from a place near Nashville. You can see the huge parking lot and there's no parking on the roof. [laughs] Just a couple of more Little Rock Oklahoma Springfield.

Neil Patel: Isn't Japan the country with the third most locations for them?

Withers: It has a warehouse that we'll see in a minute. But I didn't realize.

Patel: They have a lot of stores in the area.

Withers: Yeah. This didn't dawn on me either that they're the third largest global retailer. I think that might be 12th largest retailer in the Fortune 500 I'm not sure. They may even be 12.

Patel: Yeah. It might be 12 overall actually.

Withers: A hundred billion mark.

Kalogeropoulos: It's interesting because I know they were the second largest at least for a while there. I wonder who hedged in there in second place behind Walmart I'd have to check that.

Patel: Amazon maybe.

Withers: I'd wonder if they're counting Amazon as a retailer; 192 billion in sales 288000 employees. Here's the warehouses. They have 30 in Japan. So Canada Mexico. It's likely that these are larger.

Patel: Iceland wow. [laughs]

Withers: Iceland pretty nice. Five hundred and sixty-four warehouses in the US that's impressive. This must be their stores. They call them warehouses right?

Patel: Yeah.

Withers: This number is pretty impressive to this cardholder thing. As you sign up for the executive Demitri you talked a little bit about the executive membership you get I think it's now a Visa it used to be I think a Mastercard. But you get points and you get cashback and stuff and that's a super cool feature. Four billion in membership fee income. You talked about the 91 percent. Really pretty cool. Seems to be just doing well. I know they've worked on their online presence as well and so that's a bigger deal.

Kalogeropoulos: That was something a lot of people were worried about for a while there too. It made sense that the bare idea that Costco's it's pretty a big part of their competitive advantages that they have. They cover wide areas with their stores. They don't have a store within ten-minute drive of everybody. That 564 I think is compared to like a Walmart which might have over 2000 locations in the US. You would think that might limit their ability to do quick drop two-day delivery or within 24 hours like Walmart's doing and what Target's doing. But there's no evidence that Costco is having any trouble with e-commerce compared to Target or any company that has way more stores. It's another wild factor for their logistics team.

Conveniently in the depths of Reddit that conversation is already very much happening.

Fans of the warehouse take to the message boards for just about everything from healthy snack tips to price monitoring to simply geeking out over favorite items (see: this crowd-pleaser pizza). But there is perhaps no virtual discourse as heated as the debate over Costco's food court offerings.

In recent months—largely it appears since the pandemic—the food court's quality has taken a bit of a dire turn. Some staff members and customers alike commiserate that this is due to understaffing. Others are thinking less about why and more about how to make things better: cue the invention of the food court pizza hot dog. But for the rest of Reddit's Costco community the site is an ideal place to complain about their least-favorite items.

We scoured the message boards and here's what we found out. Then be sure to read up on our list of these Popular Costco Foods That Are Making You Gain Weight Say Dietitians.

Pizza

The pizza is an absolute Costco staple but according to online sources it's not as mouth-watering as it once was.

""Pizza at my local Costco has been going seriously downhill"" says u/BigSugar44. ""They are either using frozen dough or not proofing the dough because it appears to be undercooked and dense.""

u/BeatElite agreed adding that it seems like the mega-store has started skimping on cheese.

But more alarmingly than just slight product changes u/MakePeaceAndBeFree found a UPP—that's Unidentified Piece of Paper—in their crust and shared a picture with the community. Talk about a spooky turn of events for Costco food court fans!

Chicken Bakes

Ah the chicken bakes. These bad boys have followed a similar trajectory to the pizza attracting a lot of negative heat online in recent months. According to the Costco Reddit community the general consensus seems to be that Costco started sending these premade and frozen to their stores instead of having food courts make them fresh onsite as they used to.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

u/Moms_Chapagetti said they taste ""gritty"" and u/BeatElite proclaimed that they are now ""like a glorified hot pocket rather than an actual doughy chicken bake.""

Lest there be any debate here u/PM_MeYourAvocados settled it. ""I have probably had about 100 or so chicken bakes so far in my Costco career and these new ones do not hit the same way.""

Churros

The Reddit distaste for Costco's food court churros is so strong it almost feels unanimous. With hardly any dissenting opinions threads about churros go on and on about how they are unpleasant to eat citing texture and taste issues.

""Churros definitely taste like crap now"" says u/white-christmas. ""I'm a Costco fan I still go there every week I still grab a hotdog from the food court. But it's very disappointing and undeniable that they are cutting costs and with cutting costs means cutting some quality.""

On the same thread u/comments_Wyoming was even more to-the-point: ""The churros are hard as heck.""

Café Drinks

The apparent issue with the café drinks—the cold brew latte and mocha freeze in particular—is their lack of consistency.

""When the drink is colored too light it weighs a lot less and you don't get the perfect texture that sets the freeze apart from so many other blended coffee drinks"" says u/ballinforfood. ""All I wish for is a consistent product. Some days this is the only thing I have to look forward to.""

French Fries

In a similar vein to the café drinks the french fries seem to be under the ""love them or hate them"" variety. Depending on how they are cooked these delicacies can either enhance or break a food court meal.

""French fries are both best and worst"" says u/pwastage. ""If cooked properly they were delicious. However sometimes the workers pre-package the french fries (put in the bowl covered in foil to keep it warm) but this makes the fries soggy and not as good.""

The original poster clarified that the price for the mug and beer set at least in their area was just $7.99. Another user chimed in that it was $8 at their San Jose Costco location so it seems that you should be able to pick up the item for under $10 at most Costco locations.

""Paulaner is one of the finest breweries that ever breweried"" one fan wrote loving the beer that was chosen to come along with the mug. Another was impressed by Costco's ingenuity and decision to package the two together and make it a seasonal Oktoberfest-themed item writing that the ""buying team at Costco knows a good gimmick when they see one.""

User MarvelHulkWeed validated the authenticity of the mug and gave the other users some beer vessel history writing that they ""had these in Germany"" and the mug ""is actually really good quality"" also adding that the drinking vessel is actually only called a stein if it's made of stone (according to Renegade Brewing in German the word ""stein"" actually means ""stone"").

Oktoberfest fans will want to stop by their nearest Costco location in search of this item and while they're at it may also want to begin brushing up on their German — Prost!"

How much land does the Royal Family own?

The current Royal Family is the product of a thousand-year-long dynasty that started with William the Conqueror in 1066.

While he is long gone some of the land he and his successors collected remains in the royal grasp to this day.

What remains is split between the Firm's most senior members and their families.

The museum has reopened since COVID-19 but the keep has remained closed to visitors.

This £13.5m National Lottery Heritage funded scheme is one of the largest heritage projects of its kind currently underway in the UK so it's unsurprising so many are waiting with anticipation for its reopening in 2022.

They certainly seem to be working hard but what are they actually doing?

Summed up the keep is being transformed into five levels as it would have looked in the 12th century. This means the keep is being returned to its original layout for the first time in its museum history.

So what do these five levels and all changes entail? Let’s break it down:

The five levels

(Image: Cambridge News)

The recreation will include the artistic and imaginative historical recreation of Norman interior space. The original ground floor will be reinstated for the first time since it fell into disuse. A lift will be built to provide easy access to the other floors.

Each floor will provide an insight into medieval life the royal court and the history of Norwich through the ages.

Each floor will also have dedicated learning spaces including a multi-sensory area with augmented reality displays for children that will help them to visualise the rich history of the Castle and what it would have looked like 900 years ago.

At the very top a unique viewing platform is being installed on battlement level which will offer views of present day Norwich.

Medieval gallery

A new and unique medieval gallery is being created developed in partnership with the British Museum that will showcase national medieval treasures alongside objects from Norfolk’s own creations.

Café toilets and shop

Museums are nothing but disappointing if the facilities they provide are not up to standard.

Norwich Castle Museum's renovation is seeing the rebuilding of the toilets with changing places facilities the creation of new visitor and school entrances a brand new shop and a new café that will overlook the gorgeous Atrium which will be an internal glass bridge leading into the Keep.

Later phases of the renovation will see innovative uses of projections and digital technologies to animate the building with the sights and sounds of King Henry I’s East Anglian fortress.

On the Norwich Museum and Art Gallery website  they list five reasons why this renovation is so exciting:

Royalty Revealed: re-creating the palace of Norman Kings – one of Medieval Europe’s most important buildings

The People’s Palace: For the first time in 900 years everyone will be able to explore all 5 levels of the Keep – from basement to battlements

Medieval Treasure: The British Museum’s first Medieval gallery outside London will bring treasures of international importance to Norwich

Keep Learning: Over 5 years of events and activities will open up the Medieval world to all ages

A Jewel in the Crown: Norwich Castle will take its place as one of the UK’s premier heritage attractions

If it does manage to open as planned in 2022 its reopening as a renovated Medieval castle will help to put Norwich in a deserving position on the map as a key tourist location in the tour of Medieval England.

THE Nano Nagle Cup will rest in East Cork this winter after Fr O'Neill’s bridged a 10-year gap to be crowned SE Systems Intermediate Champions in horrific weather conditions in Castle Road.

Playing with the gale-force wind in their favour in the opening 30 minutes O’Neill’s laid the foundations for victory and In the second half they really battened down the hatches adding just a point to their tally but just how important that point was as in the finish it was the score that separated the sides.

Playing against the howling wind Cliona Healy fired Aghabullogue into an early lead. Yvonne Murphy replied before Aghabullogue stretched it with two points as Emma Flanagan and Ella Foley hit the target.

Digging deep and playing with huge determination Fr O’Neill's drove forward. Keelagh Cullinane scored and by the end of the opening quarter they hit the front with Yvonne Murphy’s long-range free going all the way to the net.

The weather deteriorated but both sides worked hard. The Aghabullogue defence had their hands full as O’Neill's continued to push forward with the elements in their favour.

The sides exchanged frees through Kate Harrington and Cliona Harrington but the East Cork side led by a goal on 25 minutes.

With Yvonne Murphy Claire O’Brien and Kate Harrington to the fore O’Neill's were on top and they grabbed a vital goal four minutes before the interval as O'Brien finished Yvonne Murphy’s long-range free to the net.

They were turning into the wind in the second half but had a two-goal advantage: 2-5 to 0-5.

The second half was all about grinding out a result. The rain came teeming down but the intensity of the contest increased too.

O'Neill's dropped Clodagh Finn back as they set about containing the Aghabullogue attack. Meadhbh Ring pointed to cut the deficit five minutes into the half but Keelagh Cullinane replied for O'Neill's.

From then on it was about protecting their lead as Aghabullogue pushed forward. Cliona Healy converted a free and it took a superb save from keeper Nicola Nagle to deny Emma Flanagan as Nagle got her hurley to the ball and deflected it over the bar at a crucial time in the contest.

Flanagan caused problems for the Fr O'Neill's rearguard and at the second water break it was 2-6 to 0-9.

Aghabullogue were far from out of it. Ciara McCarthy and Healy scored as the O'Neill's tried to batten down the hatches excellently marshalled well by captain Ciara McGrath Aoife Higgins Rachel Steele and goalkeeper Nicola Nagle.

With eight minutes on the stopwatch left Healy split the posts to leaved just a point between the sides. The finale was frantic as Aghabullogue battled furiously for an equaliser and Fr O'Neill's brought all bar two players behind the ball as they dug deep to protect their lead.

They survived with The Echo Player of The Match Yvonne Murphy in the thick of the action as they worked the ball to safety to the sound of the full-time whistle.

Goel has dedicated the last few years of his life to make that happen by developing Sortifyd a life and family organizer app that launched in May 2020 for iOS and Android.

“Sortifyd was born of a personal need to keep our home and family life more organized” said Goel a Carmel resident. “What I realized was there is a lack of a complete and reliable solution to manage home life today. While all of us cobble together systems for our homes that seem to work there are a few key challenges that exist in almost all of our systems. We are trying to help families be better sorted and be in more control of their life so they can focus on things that really matter.”

For starters Goel said information is generally fragmented and scattered all over the place across paper email cloud apps and individuals. As a result people often don’t have access to their information when they need it.

“In times of emergencies families struggle to pull together their critical information” he said. “Finally many of the methods we rely on are not always secure or private such as email or sticky notes to store passwords.”

Goel said the app is in thousands of households in all 50 states and in more than 100 nations around the world.

“Sortifyd is a cloud-based mobile life organizer app that was designed to provide one secure and private place for everything you and your family rely on every day” Goel said. “As a life and family organizer Sortifyd allows you to organize your family’s schedule important paperwork records passwords create lists and assign to-dos to anyone you add to your account. We like to think of it as an app that helps you live a more organized simplified and Sortifyd — our way of saying all-sorted — life. As your family’s command center we wanted Sortifyd to be a complete solution.”

Goel said he wanted the app to be simple for everyone not just those with a technical background. It’s designed to be easily accessible by the whole family and a platform they can always trust.

“We’ve adopted a freemium subscription model that works for all types of households from single users all the way to large families” Goel said. “The app is a free download with in-app purchase of subscription plans priced between $2.99 a month to $7.49 a month.”

Goel said he has more than 20 years of corporate and management consulting experience across global markets with McKinsey & Co. Applied Materials and most recently with Cummins.

“I left Cummins in 2018 to follow my heart and start Sortifyd” he said.

Playing yesterday at the IMG Academy in Bradenton Florida the young lady Tridents held the lead for 44 minutes but conceded two goals in nine minutes to lose to Caribbean counterparts Belize 2-1.

Barbados began the game confidently as they passed the ball around comfortably and enjoyed the majority of possession.

Captain Rayna Cummins and midfield partner Jessie Robinson controlled the flow of the game and linked up well particularly with wingers Tekoa Hope-Downes and Kayghun Rouse whose pace was obviously too much for the Belizean fullbacks.

Belize came close to breaking the deadlock midway through the first half but the bravery of goalkeeper Lisa Harding kept the score level.

Barbados took the lead in the 42nd minute when Cummins played a delightful pass from midfield behind the high defensive line of Belize and Rouse ran onto the ball from her left forward position and showed tremendous composure to shoot the ball powerfully and accurately into the far post from just inside the penalty area.

Signs of fatigue became evident in the latter stages of the game and the Lady Tridents found it difficult to replicate their strong possession play that they displayed in the first half.

Belize capitalized on Barbados’ withering play in the 86th minute.

Khalydia Velasquez converted from the penalty spot after one of her teammates was tripped in the area and referee Shandor Wilkinson awarded a penalty kick.

Belize snatched victory from Barbados in the final minute of added time via a counterattack.

Velasquez was left all alone to dribble approximately 50 yards into the Tridents box and coolly place her right-footed effort to the left of the outstretched Harding.

Barbados will have a chance to redeem themselves in their final group encounter tomorrow when they face Curacao at 11:10 am"
CVS,CVS Health,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbWVkY2l0eW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvZW5nYWdlLWF0LWhsdGgtaG93LWN2cy1jYXJlbWFyay1wbGFucy10by1hZGRyZXNzLWhlYWx0aC1kaXNwYXJpdGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How CVS Caremark plans to address health disparities,"



In the last two years many health plans have turned an eye to health disparities magnified by the pandemic. But how do you actually address the impact of these structural inequities on people’s health?

CVS Caremark is starting by focusing on addressing inequities across three conditions: sickle cell disease HIV and cardiovascular disease. The company’s goal is to improve awareness access to health services and treatment.

“What we see with health disparities is that there are structural challenges to helping people achieve their health outcomes” CVS Caremark Chief Medical Officer Dr. Sree Chaguturu said in a discussion at HLTH’s engagement track. “They tend to be seen at race and ethnicity but it’s broader than race and ethnicity — it’s about housing transportation food security…”

CVS’ approach has been to see how it can use the different components of its business such as its pharmacists insurance plans and in-store clinics to help people achieve the health outcomes they want in spite of these barriers.

The company is also partnering with community organizations and patient advocacy groups to figure out the best approach Chaguturu said.

When it started this initiative CVS compiled more than 400 different data elements to help plan sponsors better understand the extent of social disparities in their population. It then focused on three initiatives to start:

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Doubling the number of patients taking hydroxyurea a generic medication for sickle cell disease and increasing trait testing.

Increasing awareness about HIV testing and prevention and working with stakeholders to increase access to PrEP medication.

For patients with high blood pressure increasing the start of medication therapy among people facing health disparities and ensuring those already on treatment are taking the optimal dose.

“These initiatives are really about bringing together stakeholders… working in communities to increase testing and awareness around the drugs providing services and measure the improvement in access to medications and treatments over time” he said. “We just launched this initiative and we’re really excited about making this just part of what we do.”

CVS is also partnering with health plans sponsors in communities with high burdens of HIV or sickle cell disease to accelerate this work.

Although it’s too early to measure the results in the future it plans to expand the model to additional health conditions. CVS plans to do so by partnering with physician groups patient advocacy groups and plan sponsors.

In particular CVS is looking to address health conditions that disproportionately affect people of color in the U.S. that have significant disparities in health outcomes and where CVS can use its different lines of business to improve people’s health.

“We didn’t get here in five or 10 years. It’s been decades centuries of unfortunate destruction of our social safety net and barriers to access to care” Chaguturu said. “My hope is that in five to 10 years that we’ve made substantial progress but knowing this is going to be decades of work for us to address.”

With that goal in mind CVS Pharmacy is rolling out Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 booster shots at 9800 locations across the country including 80 here in the Commonwealth.

What You Need To Know CVS made COVID-19 booster shots available Oct. 22



As of Oct. 22 Kentucky has a total of 734137 COVID-19 cases 9559 deaths and a 6.25% positivity rate



CVS will offer Moderna and Pfizer booster shots and both the CDC and FDA have approved mixing and matching of shots and boosters



Ashlee Slocum a CVS Health district leader supporting retail pharmacy operations is helping Kentuckians understand the importance and convenience of getting the booster shot at their neighborhood CVS location

“We know of course science thus far has proven that the safest most effective way to prevent against not only COVID-19 but those serious complications like hospitalizations death is through is vaccination"" said Ashlee Slocum a CVS Health district leader. ""So the approval of the booster dose ensures we got optimal protection for those specific populations against COVID-19 and those complications.""

Currently Kentucky's COVID-19 numbers reflect a positivity rate of 6.25% 9559 deaths and total of 734137 people infected according to the Kentucky Cabinet for Health & Family Services. A large focus on getting overall COVID-19 cases down across America has been a part of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s plan as he previously stated during interviews on ""Face the Nation.""

“We can do it by people getting vaccinated and [we're] also in a situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time” said Fauci.

With the holiday season coming up more boosters being made available can ensure families a safe gathering if they wish to do so. Dr. Anthony Fauci recently came under fire in early October about his holiday guidance. He stated “I encourage people particularly the vaccinated people to have a good normal Christmas with your family.”

After the backlash of sending the wrong message the guidance was updated as “the best way to minimize COVID-19 risk” is to get vaccinated if eligible.

Places like CVS Pharmacy are making getting the booster shot easy and convenient.

“We have made it really easy to visit CVS.com or our CVS app. We also show which location carries which type of booster dose whether Pfizer or Moderna and you are able to see all available appointment times so you pick the location that works best for you in your community and the vaccine that works best for you” said Slocum.

9800 total CVS locations across the United States have the COVID-19 booster shot available. The corporation currently has Moderna and Pfizer available for third doses. Those who have been vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson are still eligible for a dose of the booster through the new approved ‘mix and match’ from the CDC.

Booster shots will be available in CVS standalone and Target stores and the corporation said people can also schedule their flu vaccine at the same time as a COVID-19 booster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5qcm4ubXN1LmVkdS8yMDIxLzEwL21lcmlkaWFuLXRvd25zaGlwLXBoYXJtYWNpZXMtaG9waW5nLXRvLXJlY2VpdmUtbW9kZXJuYS1ib29zdGVyLXNob3RzLXNvb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meridian Township pharmacies prep for Moderna booster shots,"Pharmacies in Meridian Township are gearing up for the Moderna booster shots recently approved by the FDA.

Since the FDA approved the Pfizer booster shots for individuals who are ‘high risk’ or over 65 pharmacy managers are preparing themselves to distribute the COVID-19 Moderna booster.

News has been developing quickly when it comes to the COVID-19 booster shots. It can be hard to keep track of all the new information and many individuals have lots of questions. What vaccines have been approved for a booster? What are the eligibility requirements? What locations are providing booster shots?

The FDA also approved the booster mix-and-match approach. This allows those who are vaccinated to receive the second dose of a different COVID-19 vaccine from the first a strategy known as heterologous prime-boost.

“Most People are really excited to get it they are really anxious but they’re doing really well with it” said Lansing CVS pharmacy manager Kim Schieberl. “People are especially excited to get their third dose entering winter months with the Delta Variant.”

Destinee Shelly Target located at 4890 Marsh Road Okemos Michigan 48864 has a CVS pharmacy inside who are hoping to soon provide Moderna boosters

You can schedule your free COVID-19 vaccine or booster shot appointment here at the CVS in Okemos.

A panel of outside advisers to the FDA voted unanimously to recommend a booster shot of the Moderna vaccine to those with underlying health issues.

“We are lucky to be giving the booster shot to those who are immunocompromised” said Schieberl. “But right now that is the only thing that has been approved.”

Much like the Pfizer booster shot which is the only vaccine that has emergency use authorization for a booster shot the Moderna will not be available for everyone right away. The Moderna booster will likely be prioritized for seniors adults with health problems as well as those that live or work in areas that put them at a higher risk.

“People are really anxious waiting for the shot calling every week to see if we have it” said Walgreens pharmacy manager Mckenzie Grulke.

Destinee Shelly Walgreens Pharmacy located at 2131 W Grand River Ave. Okemos Michigan are waiting and hoping for FDA approval for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson booster shots soon.

After receiving the Pfizer booster shot Meridian Township resident Dominique Brown hopes to keep his family safe from the coronavirus when he goes home to visit them.

“Someone in my family has cancer so it was important that I get the booster shot to be able to protect them whenever I go home” said Brown.

Many people are trying to get the vaccine due to health-related issues with family vaccine mandates for work or school and some just want everything to go back to normal.

“I would recommend everyone to get vaccinated” said Brown. “It is important to protect those you care about and get back to normal life.”

A FORMER meat processing plant in Tiermaclane looks set to reopen under new management over the coming weeks according to Deputy Cathal Crowe.

The plant is being taken over by Asba which has offices in Shannon and specialises in the production processing and supply of stun-free Halal meat products and seafood.

Deputy Crowe said the new owners are on site on a managerial basis but noted the plant will not be operational until it obtains the necessary licence from the Department of Agriculture.

Acknowledging the licensing process can be slow during normal times Deputy Crowe confirmed he has been engaging with Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue Department of Agriculture staff and the regional veterinary officers to fast-track the necessary paperwork as quickly as possible.

Following talks with Minister McConalogue Deputy Crowe confirmed progress is being made towards securing a possible reopening date.

The Fianna Fáil Deputy confirmed the Halal method of slaughtering is currently under review by senior veterinary officers in the Department of Agriculture.

There is some speculation that a stunning system before slaughter that is already available in European countries may be introduced in Ireland.

Deputy Crowe said the reopening of this meat processing facility will be welcomed by Clare farmers as it will have far reaching tentacles into the Irish meat markets and Europe.

“It offers the farming community a meat processing facility within the county and it will also create jobs which is an exciting prospect as we emerge from Covid-19.”

In February 2020 Kepak staff were told the plant would close for four to six weeks due to “challenging market conditions”.

In a statement issued to the newspaper at the time the company confirmed it would temporarily suspend operations at its Clare site in Drumquin.

“Despite a comprehensive review and significant efforts to keep the Clare abattoir operational management at Kepak has determined that the site is no longer competitive.

“Against a backdrop of challenging market conditions for the beef industry in Europe Kepak Clare has been procuring cattle at a price premium associated with markets such as the United States China and the UK.

“However given Kepak Clare is not approved for export to such markets it consequently cannot achieve the associated price premium to remain competitive leaving no alternative to a temporary closure” the company stated.

However the plant never reopened prompting fears for the long term viability of the plant.

When Kepak Clare was acquired in 2016 it employed in the region of 21 people which was almost half of the 47 workforce when Kepak took it over from John Kelly Meats in 2017.

Tom Hayes the secretary-treasurer for Laborers' Local 177 said union contractors were supposed to pour concrete inside a factory at John Deere Des Moines Works in Ankeny. But because the workers declined to cross striking United Auto Workers picket lines outside of the plant he said his members lost the work Wednesday afternoon.

""That's one less job that our workers will be able to do this year"" Hayes said.

The squabble touches off on the tense relationships between Deere and outside unions who have stood in solidarity with the UAW since the 10100-member strike began Oct. 14.

In some cases members of outside unions have shown support by picketing Deere factories and warehouses. But often the union members' support has come in ways that create more headaches for the Moline Illinois-based ag machine giant.

Unionized blue-collar workers in fields ranging from construction to trucking and railroad transportation are declining to cross UAW picket lines further complicating Deere's ability to build and ship machines.

""Look at what this strike symbolizes to other workers"" said Jesse Case the secretary-treasurer for Teamsters Local 238 in eastern Iowa. ""This is a significant strike in terms of drawing a line in the sand and saying 'Enough is enough.' ""

The company in turn has accused UAW members of violating labor laws by picketing in places where they're not supposed to be giving outside union members the ability to legally withdraw from work for Deere.

A judge granted Deere's request for an injunction against UAW members in Davenport on Wednesday forcing them to limit their number of members to four per gate and to leave an entrance un-picketed. Another judge meanwhile was still mulling Deere's request for a similar measure in Ankeny as of Friday night.

More: Deere workers are on strike. Here's why and what led to the UAW's contract rejection

For his part Hayes accused Deere of creating ""chaos"" by failing to follow steps outlined in the National Labor Relations Act. Like other union members he said workers with Laborers' Local 177 have clauses in their contracts that allow them to ignore work if a job requires them to cross a picket line.

However contractors have a carve-out for this rule. Building trades unions sign National Maintenance Agreements which allow companies that are subject to strikes to continue to receive service from unionized workers.

The company has to establish a neutral contractors' gate which the union cannot picket. The company puts a sign outside the gate listing which contractors are allowed to come through.

In the company's petition for an injunction filed Wednesday a Deere labor relations employee wrote that she showed UAW leaders which gate at the Ankeny plant would be the neutral entrance.

But Hayes told the Des Moines Register on Friday that Deere failed to properly establish the gate. He said company representatives had not put out the proper sign and had not informed the local trades unions about the gate in writing steps that he said are standard during strikes.

""They know the labor laws as well as our groups do"" he said.

Without a sign he said his union members would not cross the line onto Deere property. He added that he was not sure who exactly made the decision to fire his members.

Hayes said the members were working for Ryan Cos. But he was not sure if Deere hired Ryan Cos. directly or if the group was operating as a subcontractor for another company as is often the case on construction projects.

A spokesperson for Ryan Cos. declined to comment Friday evening while a Deere spokesperson did not return an email seeking comment.

""Ryan Cos. had no problem with our members not crossing the picket line"" Hayes said. ""They understand what we're about. They understand that portion (of the labor law). They're not any happier than we are about not having a contractors' gate.""

Earl Agan business manager for Operative Plasterers’ and Cement Masons' Local 21 said his members also lost work when someone terminated Ryan Cos. from the Des Moines Works job this week.

He too blamed the company for failing to follow the proper steps for a contractors' gate. He said other companies usually write him letters telling him where his workers need to enter a campus during strikes.

""Notification is necessary"" he said. ""If it's not been put in writing and they haven't put a sign up it's my opinion that notification hasn't been given.""

Outside warehouses a game of cat and mouse

Case the Teamsters leader said some of his local's 2000 UPS and truck drivers noticed some unusual shipments at the beginning of this week.

He said drivers noticed that they were picking up Deere parts and supplies at warehouses where the company does not normally operate. He said he believed the company began storing supplies in new places because UAW members were picketing the company's warehouses. (A Deere spokesperson did not return an email asking if the company had shifted supplies to third-party warehouses.)

Like other unionized workers he said Teamsters drivers have clauses in their contracts that state they don't have to cross picket lines. This means the transportation company would need to tap salary employees or managers to drive the vehicles.

""Deere's trying to be cute to get around the solidarity of labor"" Case said. ""... The legal question is what can we do about it? We're looking at those options.""

John Klootwyk the business agent for Teamsters Local 120 in Dubuque said his members also heard that Deere was using third-party warehouses. Earlier this week he said union members picketed outside one such location a warehouse on Kerper Boulevard in Dubuque owned by Hodge Co.

""They made it so our drivers didn't even have to go in there"" said Klootwyk.

Michael Fullan vice president of business development for Hodge confirmed that his company is storing Deere's material at its warehouses. But he said the company has been doing do ""for a lot of years."" He said Hodge employees — not Deere staff — are the ones working inside the warehouse.

He said he had noticed ""on and off"" picketing outside his warehouse this week. He said the protest didn't disrupt business especially with a slowdown in Deere operations.

""With the strike and the unions"" he said ""there’s obviously not material that’s being transported and transferred to the factory.""

University of Iowa law professor Paul Iversen who used to represent unions said picketing warehouses is a tricky activity during a strike. While union members can picket their employer the law does not protect what are known as ""secondary boycotts"" — essentially picketing any company that works with Deere.

More: Lawyers for Deere UAW quarrel over striker traffic violations in Ankeny plant injunction hearing

But he added union members can picket warehouses if their employer is only contracting with the outside company to replace the strikers' work. He said the strikers would need signs illustrating that they are specifically picketing against Deere as opposed to a neutral sign that says ""UAW on strike.""

The specifics of each case are complicated Iversen said and unions decide to play it safe to avoid an expensive lawsuit.

In the case of the Deere strike the company's attorneys argued in a court petition Wednesday that UAW members were illegally picketing outside of a Deere-owned warehouse. The attorneys said union members couldn't picket there because no Deere employees actually work at the warehouse. They said only contractors from another company were inside.

During a hearing on the petition Thursday a UAW member testified that the people in the warehouse do the same work as the striking employees do. He added that he thinks Deere employees are in fact working in the warehouse.

Iowa Federation of Labor President Charlie Wishman who has picketed with UAW members since Oct. 14 said he has heard rumors about other third-party warehouses that Deere is supposedly using around town. But even if they are he said he's worried about picketing in those places.

""I am not comfortable putting anybody in a position of breaking the law"" he said.

Railroad workers not crossing the line

About 700 rail workers have also declined to work at Deere plants.

Sheet Metal Air Rail and Transportation Workers Iowa State Director Chris Smith said the union's members will not work with the company until the strike ends. He said he has not heard from his members whether companies like Iowa Northern and Canadian National are sending salary workers or managers across the lines and a Deere spokesperson did not return an email asking similar questions.

Smith said Iowa Northern employees normally pick up Deere's finished tractors at a loading site at Warren Transport in eastern Waterloo. He said a train with eight flats holds about 32 of Deere's smaller tractors hauling them to ports where ships take them overseas.

Without the trains he said the company would have to ship the tractors on semitrucks. He estimated a truck could cold two of the same tractors.

""It's not economical"" he said. ""It doesn't make sense.""

He said Canadian National employees meanwhile normally bring scrap steel to Deere's foundry in Waterloo. Deere employees then melt the scrap into the material used to build the company's machines.

He said he has not heard of any workers hauling that steel since the strike started.

""They are upholding the strike"" Smith said. ""Our members are not being forced to cross.""

Editor: This article is part of the “Telling the Story Project” a collaborative effort involving the Upper Midwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center with funding from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

HOLMEN Wis. – Caleb Orebaugh steered his slow-moving John Deere 4320 straight down the familiar hillside when suddenly he felt the weight of the mower start pushing his tractor forward.

“It was during a drought and the ground was dry and hard” Orebaugh said. “I started sliding and I pushed the brakes but I didn’t have any traction and kept sliding sideways.”

Orebaugh was losing control.

“When the mower’s tongue caught the rear tire I just hung on.”

Time seemed to slow down as he gripped the steering wheel. The tractor rolled onto its side stopping when the rollover protection structure (ROPS) hit the ground.

The ROPS!

Orebaugh 34 had installed it just a few months before the July 2020 incident becoming the first reported participant in the Wisconsin Rollover Protection Structure (ROPS) Rebate Program to survive a tractor overturn with a ROPS installed through the program.

“I bruised my elbow when it hit the inside of the (sun) canopy and that was about it” Orebaugh said.

National data suggest that 1 of every 10 tractor operators overturns a tractor in his or her lifetime. Tractors are the leading cause of death on U.S. farms; the most frequent cause of tractor-related deaths are overturns nearly 100 per year. Approximately half of U.S. tractors do not have rollover protection.

A ROPS is designed to create a protective zone around the operator. A ROPS when used with a seatbelt is 99 percent effective in preventing serious injury or death in the event of an overturn. Even when used without a buckled seatbelt as was the case with Orebaugh a ROPS is 70 percent effective.

Seeking shade

Orebaugh’s father Allan heard about the Wisconsin ROPS Rebate Program on the radio. The rebate program started in 2013 by the National Farm Medicine Center Marshfield Clinic Research Institute was offering rebates of up to $865 toward the cost of purchasing and installing a ROPS. (The National Farm Medicine Center has since made the program more cost-effective by limiting out-of-pocket retrofit expenses to $500 no matter the cost of the retrofit.) All Wisconsin farmers are eligible. The program is funded through philanthropic support from the Auction of Champions and other generous donors.

“When Caleb called me and told me he’d rolled the tractor I remember feeling very relieved that six months earlier we put that rollover bar on there” Allan said. “We had farmed that land for two or three years without one.”

The Orebaughs grow about 100 acres of hay and other crops and raise a few beef cattle. Both work off the farm. This part of Southwest Wisconsin features steep rolling hillsides rocky outcrops and deeply carved river valleys features that escaped the flattening effects of glaciation during the last ice age.

But it wasn’t the hazardous topography that motivated Allan and Caleb. The ROPS retrofit grew out of a simple desire for sun protection.

“We had talked about getting an umbrella” Caleb said. “But then we thought ‘no it would just get snagged on the trees and wrecked’ so we thought we might as well look for a ROPS with a canopy.”

“And sure enough” said Allan thinking about what might have been.

“The funny thing is” Caleb said “that’s not even the steepest part of the farm. I’d always thought if I had a rollover it would be somewhere else on the property not where it happened.”

The ROPS came from Iron Bull Manufacturing in Indiana a couple hours west of where the Orebaughs used to farm near Muncie Ind. Caleb was 14 when Allan moved the family from the flat land of the Hoosier State to the Holmen area.

Caleb a former mechanic put the ROPS on himself. He rented workspace at the local John Deere implement dealer to do the job a dealer where he had worked for a dozen years. He now works at the nearby John Deere construction equipment dealer.

Did the ROPS save his life?

“I can’t say for sure but the roll bar definitely stopped it from rolling further.”

The incident

Unknown to Caleb a spectator watched as he dusted himself off from the rollover.

“One of the neighbors called her mom and said ‘I think they just rolled a tractor out here’” said Allan relaying a conversation the neighbor had shared with him. “‘Is he OK? Yeah I guess so he is walking away from it.’”

A shaken Caleb made his way downhill to the farm house where Allan lives and called Allan at his place of employment.

“I can’t even remember what I was thinking” Allan said of the call from Caleb. “You’re just trying to figure out what to do first.”

Once he realized his son was OK the men’s thoughts turned to the functionality of their only tractor.

“We used the skid steer and a jack and got a neighbor’s tractor and dragged the haybine out of the way and called a tow truck to roll the tractor back upright.” Caleb said.

One of the rear tires had gone flat so they dragged the tractor down to their workshop.

“I felt lucky that I wasn’t under the tractor and also lucky that I didn’t completely destroy it” Caleb said. “There wasn’t anything major wrong with it. Snapped the PTO shaft off the tractor bent the outer PTO shaft on the haybine had to straighten the exhaust and put a new sun canopy on. We were able to do all the work ourselves other than the rear tire.”

A ROPS normally limits the degree of rollover thereby reducing damage to the tractor say engineers. Another reason to retrofit.

Caleb waited to tell his wife Kara after she got home from work. She took the news in stride Caleb said but thinking about his family he said that he now buckles his seat belt if he is on the “steeper stuff.” The couple has two children Emilea 6 and Ian 2.

Rollovers can happen on flat ground too

Farms don’t have to be hilly for rollovers to occur say researchers. It is possible to tip any tractor on flat ground if the turn is short enough and the speed is high enough. Additionally operators must be alert for ditches embankments holes and ramps. Banks of ditches can give way if the tractor is driven too close to the edge.

Most overturns involve the tractor rolling on its side however tractors also roll over backwards. This can occur when trying to pull out a tree stump or a piece of equipment stuck in mud. Hitching too high can result in backward tips. For each tractor consult the operator’s manual for acceptable hitch points.

ROPS are engineered to mount on specific tractor models and designed to operate with the tractor’s mounting brackets and frame. This provides a structure that is flexible yet rigid enough to withstand the loads produced during a tractor overturn. Prototype ROPS must pass engineered crush static and dynamic tests to assure adequate performance before they are produced for the public. These prototype ROPS must meet the standards set by the Society of Automotive Engineers and the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

If a tractor with a ROPS does overturn the ROPS should be replaced because it is specifically designed to bend to absorb the energy generated by the tractor contacting the ground engineers say. ROPS are designed and certified to withstand just a single overturn

Orebaugh said he is considering replacing his ROPS with another ROPS from the rebate program.

Make the call

If you your family or hired help operates a tractor without rollover protection make the call today.

To check on retrofit options for your particular tractor go to the National ROPS Rebate Program website https://www.ropsr4u.org/. If you are a Wisconsin farmer click on Wisconsin or call 1-877-767-7748. Not all states have rebate funds available. When available funds are applied toward the purchase shipping and professional installation of the ROPS.

“The process went smoother than I thought” said Caleb Orebaugh.

Smoother than a ROPS-less overturn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15YnVja2hhbm5vbi5jb20vMTA0NzI4LTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man arrested for allegedly possessing stolen tractor brush hog,"BUCKHANNON – An Upshur County man was arrested recently for allegedly being in possession of a stolen tractor and brush hog.

Carroll Chapman 46 of Buckhannon was arrested Tuesday Oct. 19 for receiving or transferring stolen property a felony in connection to an incident that allegedly occurred in early 2021.

According to the criminal complaint in the Upshur County Magistrate Clerk’s Office filed by investigating officer Deputy Dakota Linger with the Upshur County Sheriff’s Office on Jan. 14 2021 Linger received a call from John Moss at the sheriff’s office at approximately 10:45 a.m. Moss said his John Deere 670 tractor finish mower four-foot brush hog and a 16-foot trailer was stolen from his property on Osborn Run Road.

Officers recorded the serial numbers for the equipment and took photos.

Then six months later on July 14 2021 Upshur County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Mike Coffman and Sgt. Theron Caynor were driving down the Old Elkins Road and noticed a John Deere tractor that matched the description of the stolen tractor. Coffman and Caynor stopped and spoke to an individual present at the address who informed the officer that the tractor reportedly belonged to Carroll Chapman according to the report.

Based on that information Coffman and Caynor then went to Plum Drive and spoke with Chapman. Chapman told Coffman and Caynor the tractor was his and he paid $2500 for it and the brush hog. Coffman and Caynor then had the tractor to towed and released back to the owner.

Upshur County Magistrate Alan Suder set bail at $10000 cash or surety and as of Saturday Chapman was no longer listed on the West Virginia Regional Jail Authority website.

The penalty for receiving or transferring stolen property is confinement for not less than one but not more than 10 years or confinement for not more than one year and a fine of up to $250.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWlsaXRhbnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMjMvc3RhdGlvbmFyeS1lbmdpbmVlcnMtc3RyaWtlLTI0LWthaXNlci1ob3NwaXRhbHMtaW4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stationary engineers strike 24 Kaiser hospitals in California – The Militant,"OAKLAND Calif. — Some 700 members of Local 39 of the International Union of Operating Engineers continue to maintain picket lines around the clock at 24 Kaiser hospitals in Northern California. The strikers are demanding respect and a contract that is competitive with those of other stationary engineers in the Bay Area. The unionists have been on strike since Sept. 18 and are gaining more support.

Contingents of workers from Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West a union of 57000 medical assistants technicians and other healthcare workers began joining the engineers’ picket lines Oct. 18 at different Kaiser hospitals each day.

Striking engineers from Oakland San Francisco San Leandro Vallejo San Rafael and beyond converged at Kaiser’s hospital here Oct. 13 to protest the company’s refusal to budge from its contract offer. They were greeted by honks of support from passing cars.

“These are my fellow workers out here. We are all labor and we need to stick together” emergency-room nurse Stacey Eddie told this Militant worker-correspondent on the Kaiser Oakland hospital picket line. Eddie said she’ll be talking with other nurses about how they can do more to support the strikers.

“The wage being offered is far below inflation” said Anna Perts a Local 39 retiree who worked as a biomedical engineer at Kaiser for 35 years. “They have been working throughout the pandemic and this is the thanks they get!”

Strikers at the hospital here said that during the first weeks of the strike they were able to keep trucks from entering. But then cops threatened to arrest them for peacefully picketing and they were forced to stop.

At the same time more than 24000 nurses and other Kaiser workers in Southern California and in Oregon overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike against the bosses’ offer of a 1% pay raise a year as well as its demands for a two-tier wage scale that could reduce the pay of new hires by at least 26%."

The newer clubs are more stylishly-designed and they offer more and better food options. Delta of course doesn’t have dedicated business class lounges the way United does (and there’s finally a re-opening plan for those) let alone first class dining the way American offers (and those are re-opening as well).

There are a number of things flyers complain about with United Clubs. These no longer have showers. They’re too crowded. Poor Newark flyers have waited ages for a functional club experience after having theirs taken away to make that dedicated business class lounge.

But I stopped into one briefly in Houston and was shocked to find… food. It was packaged food but there were sandwiches and snacks in addition to a ramen bar (admittedly with packaged heat-and-serve ramen to add the fixings to).

I suppose my expectations are just so low since I normally experience American Airlines clubs. United is doing more for premium cabin food in the air and for premium cabin food in lounges on the ground. American’s recent innovation is a ‘make your own mezza’ station which is a real step down from prior offerings in my opinion especially when I see it not being maintained and getting messy.

American Airlines often talks about ‘monitoring the competition’ and I’ve criticized them for this – they should be focusing on delivering value to customers not doing what everyone else does. However here they aren’t even doing what everyone else does.

A packaged sandwich offering like United still has isn’t just more robust it’s also more convenient. Very little time between flights and long lines at airport vendors? Sure you can use the Grab app at some airports to order food from an airport restaurant before you deplane and pick it up on your way to your next gate. Or you can go into the club grab the sandwich and eat it when you board.

On this trip it turned out to be a real saver. I thought I had plenty of time in Houston for my connection. I had to change terminals and took the inter-terminal train which broke down while I was on it and the time I’d planed to use to grab a quick bite quickly evaporated.

I was still able to eat something. It wasn’t gourmet but it was appreciated.

Such tactics could become the norm as the Golden State’s water supply dwindles due to climate change. A 2021 state report predicts a nearly 15 percent decrease in water supply if the temperature rises 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now California almond farmers and electric utilities both of which use massive amounts of water can bet against the future availability of water.

And just last year the Chicago Mercantile Exchange started the first-ever futures market for water meaning farmers as well as investors municipalities and hedge funds can buy a legal agreement known as a “futures contract” that locks in a predetermined price for water that will be used in the future. If an event like drought drives up the price the contract seller must make up the difference (and vice versa) if it drops. This kind of speculative trading has long been done for commodities such as gold or oil but not for a life-sustaining resource such as water.

Trading Water

Its advocates claim that futures water trading could better align water supply and demand in the face of growing scarcity. For instance University of California Berkeley’s Ellen Bruno and North Carolina State’s Heidi Schweizer both agricultural economists say trading water futures is simply about the price of water. Investors do not acquire water rights from municipalities or indigenous groups.

But others say creating a water futures market won’t solve the bigger problem of what’s causing the dearth of water availability in the first place. “Water scarcity is not primarily driven by individual farmers making bad choices about using water. That’s a minor factor” says Basav Sen climate justice project director at the Institute for Policy Studies. Rather he says it’s the burning of fossil fuels which drives climate change and the agribusiness empire — which can harm water quality through chemical and animal waste runoff — that must be changed to ensure there’s enough clean water for everyone.

What makes things even worse says Sen is that some of the people who profit from water scarcity are also profiting off of what's driving that scarcity to begin with. ""Wall Street and its big financial institutions make loans to fossil fuel companies or perform bond issuance to them or provide insurance underwriting"" he says. ""They’ve profited off of the climate crisis and now [with a water futures market] they’ll get a chance to profit off the solution which honestly feels like a scam.”

Bruno and Schweizer point to a 2019 Journal of Commodity Market’s study which found that futures markets do not artificially affect the price of commodities or their supply; rather such trading reflects the normal forces of supply and demand.

The two also say there’s reason to think this idea won't work. For one thing farmers are pretty risk adverse when it comes to financial outlays says Mike Wade executive director of the California Farm Water Association. “The farmers I know don’t want to risk capital buying water contracts. They’d be more interested in putting effort to into actually buying water in the present.” For another water’s dependency on weather makes it hard to predict a future price. Lastly investors who are not farmers might be skeptical of the data which in this case is coming from financial firms rather than the more familiar USDA.

So far trading has been low. During a two-week period in July the highest volume of open contracts for water traded on a single day was just 15 compared to 3600 for cheese. So investors it appears aren't thirsting for water futures just yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNTMzNDAvaW5kaWUtc2luZ2VyLWNlaHJ5bC1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLWhvbmcta29uZ3MtbXVzaWMtc2NlbmXSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS95cC9kaXNjb3Zlci9saWZlc3R5bGUvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTUzMzQwL2luZGllLXNpbmdlci1jZWhyeWwtY2hhbGxlbmdlcy1ob25nLWtvbmdzLW11c2ljLXNjZW5l?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indie singer cehryl on focusing less on Instagram followers more on making art,"Sometimes Cheryl Chow’s recordings accidentally include the sounds of her father’s footsteps.

The indie singer-songwriter better known as cehryl started making music from her bedroom during her secondary school years. Even after graduating from music school in the US in 2014 and moving back to Hong Kong five years later she continued to use her home as a studio.

“I can’t afford [to book a studio] … but that’s Hong Kong” she said highlighting the financial difficulties many singers like her face in the city.

J. Arie may not be a lawyer but she’s still ‘perfectly guilty’

Indie singers are independent artists who are not represented by a record label or whose songs are generally considered different from mainstream music.

Chow 25 is known for her dreamy and intimate beats. Her songs Side Effects and angels (emily) have racked up a total of 4 million streams on Spotify since being released in 2017 and 2020 respectively.

Many consider the 80s and 90s to be when Hong Kong’s music scene reached its peak. At the time Canto-pop’s “four heavenly kings” were well-known beyond the city. While Hong Kong still produced popular singers after 2000 its music scene no longer enjoyed global attention as people shifted their interest to K-pop and Mandopop.

In recent years the local music scene has experienced an invigorating comeback but not just because of popular boy bands like Mirror and Error. The rise of indie singers like Chow Gareth. T and Tyson Yoshi have also caught the attention of music lovers in Hong Kong.

But in making music without the financial backing of a record company indie artists face unique challenges. Chow for instance cannot afford a studio so she records music – and some background noises – in her bedroom.

Armed with a laptop mic guitar and headphones she sees the challenge as an opportunity for growth.

Rising singer Jace Chan shares how she overcame self-doubt

“Instead of trying to book a place and having to get someone to help you press a button doing everything yourself is a good skill” the singer explained.

After graduating from an international school in Hong Kong Chow went to the US to study music production and engineering at the Berklee College of Music a prestigious music school in Boston.

During her time in the US she formed a band in Los Angeles with two other musicians. Western culture she recalled was very different because no one considered any out-of-the-box music to be “silly”.

AGA shares how the sounds of Hong Kong influence her music

“That definitely pushed me to not be so safe or not be so worried about things not working” she said.

When Chow was growing up in Hong Kong she found its music scene boring because it had not evolved over the years. But upon her return to the city in 2019 she was captivated by the local indie pop scene where she found like-minded artists who also wanted to make new music.

“It’s really small but … a lot of young people are doing really cool things which are not commercial” she said describing indie singers as “big fish in a small pond”.

Gareth. T makes honesty a living

While the “indie” label usually meant the artist was not represented by a record label Chow said it had become more difficult to define the term as many of the city’s indie artists were signed to record companies.

“The word ‘indie’ could be really confusing. Nowadays people use it to describe a genre” she said.

But she believes that indie artists are not just defined by making music that stands out but also by showing their true personality in their music rather than one that is manufactured by a company.

In the past few years Chow has thought more about what she wants – and it’s not fame.

“I don’t want to spend my 20s looking at Instagram and feeling insecure or feeling my music isn’t good enough because I don’t have as many followers” she said adding that she wants to work on music that isn’t just about herself.

She is making music for two documentaries one of which is about homelessness. Recently she composed 15 tracks to accompany the exhibition of a local illustrator Kazy Chan.

We can’t let shining star Keung To burn out

Writing music for other projects allowed Chow to step out of her bubble.

A Dollar General in Indianapolis was robbed four times in three months.

Critics say this is representative of a larger trend: that dollar stores are crime hotspots.

The lack of staff and the fact they carry cash makes these stores more vulnerable they argue.

On September 9 a Dollar General store in Indianapolis was robbed for the fourth time in three months. According to a local news report the armed suspect left the store with a bag of cash but no one was hurt.

When Insider contacted the Indianapolis police department a spokesperson confirmed the incident and said that the frequency of robberies was ""not unusual"" or ""particularly shocking"" for a dollar store in the area.

A spokesperson for nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana told Insider that smaller convenience stores and gas stations are also often targeted.

As dollar stores have flourished across the US people campaigning against their rise have described them as crime hotspots that put local communities and employees at risk. Their ubiquity – there are more than 34000 dollar stores in the US – and the fact they are often located in already high-crime areas are at least partly to blame. Critics say however that dollar stores are uniquely more vulnerable than competitors such as Walmart.

These critics often point to the lack of staff in dollar stores.

Dollar stores have thrived in the US in the years since the Great Recession by offering rock-bottom prices made possible by keeping overheads such as labor down. Critics say the company's efforts to keep costs low has resulted in understaffing. Some stores can be operated by one or two employees at a time.

It's therefore easier to break in and overwhelm staff Kennedy Smith senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) a nonprofit that advocates for community businesses said in a recent phone conversation with Insider. She described these stores as ""crime magnets.""

But it's hard to determine whether they definitively attract more crime than other types of stores. According to the Gun Violence Archive a nonprofit that catalogs incidents of gun crime in the US from local law enforcement and news sites there have been more than 420 incidents involving guns at dollar stores across the US since the start of 2017.

By comparison the GVA cataloged more than 700 incidents involving guns at the over 4700 Walmart stores around the US since 2017. The data includes any incident with a gun that takes place in or around these stores including Walmart's giant parking lots.

There is no comprehensive source that tracks exactly how many robberies take place inside stores so it's not possible to directly compare the data.

However Smith said her perception is that it's easier for someone to rob a dollar store than to rob a Walmart which has more staff and often security guards that dollar stores rarely have she said.

In a statement to Insider a spokesperson for Dollar General said that the company has a series of safety and security protocols to protect workers and shoppers without specifying what. The company also works closely with law enforcement in local areas they said.







""We do not publicly comment on specifics of these [safety] measures because doing so potentially compromises the integrity of those measures and may place customers and employees at risk by providing a roadmap to could-be wrongdoers"" the spokesperson said.

When Insider spoke to store manager Christy Laurence who runs the Dollar General store on the east side of Indianapolis that was robbed four times over the summer she said that the company was understanding of the situation and that workers were offered a day off and counseling if they were in the store during a robbery.

Dollar General would not confirm this when contacted by Insider.

Daniel Rosenberg director and coordinator of nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana said that people also choose to rob these stores over for example a Walmart because dollar stores generally carry cash. Given that most items cost under $10 shoppers tend not to buy on card. The same is true for convenience stores and gas stations he said.

Plus dollar stores often have blocked-out windows which makes it harder for workers to see who's coming in and easier for would-be robbers to stay hidden from passersby on the street.

Ed Delaney a state representative for Indiana who has campaigned for years to make local lawmakers investigate the safety of working at dollar stores said there's still no organized effort to help these workers because these stores aren't unionized and the ""system doesn't pay much attention.""

This might soon change – a handful of workers at a Dollar General store Barkhamsted Connecticut are currently pushing to unionize their store which could pave the way for other locations to follow.

But Laurence the Dollar General store manager isn't convinced that it would be any better elsewhere. ""It's no different from any other job"" she said. ""It's just business that I am in.""

When it comes to dollar stores there’s a lot to unpack—like their tendency to pop up in food deserts and their impact on a local economy—but that’s not what we’re talking about today. Because regardless of how you view these discount chains 80% of Americans shop at dollar stores at least occasionally according to a June 2021 survey from Consumer Reports.

And as long as that’s the case it makes sense to have a better understanding of which household items are legitimately good value at dollar stores and which ones aren’t worth it.

Recently a group of experts from Consumer Reports provided some tips for being a smart dollar store shopper. Here are some to help you get the best deals on necessities for your home courtesy of John Galeotafiore associate director of product testing at Consumer Reports.

Don’t pass the automotive aisle

Though you may not think of dollar stores as the place to pick up stuff for your car it can come in handy for getting general products like windshield wiper fluid wipes for cleaning up spills and cords for plugging in electronics.

And while many stock motor oil Galeotafiore says to check the bottle and make sure that it carries the American Petroleum Institute’s certification mark. “Even if it’s a brand you don’t recognize that mark means it meets the latest industry standards” he explains.

The hardware section has the basics (but not much else)

The hardware aisle of the dollar store may look extensive but Galeotafiore recommends going in with realistic expectations. Sure you can expect to find things like measuring tapes claw hammers and screwdrivers but if you’re looking for anything more specialized or for more complicated tasks he suggests going directly to the hardware store.

Paper products in a pinch

Not everyone is able to go to wholesale or big-box stores to buy their toilet paper and tissues in bulk. In situations like that paper products and other household items are likely going to be cheaper at dollar stores than they would be at other local establishments like convenience stores or gas stations.

People already seem to know that though given that a majority of people who shop at dollar stores usually buy household goods there according to the survey from Consumer Reports.

Pay attention to light bulbs

Yes you’re going to find light bulbs at dollar stores and yes they’re going to be cheap. But according to Galeotafiore they are more likely to be incandescent bulbs than LED ones. And although the LED bulbs themselves are usually more expensive they use less energy and last much longer so they end up being better value in the long run.

“To save time and money” Galeotafiore says “note the details of the bulb you’re replacing so you don’t end up with something that isn’t quite right.”

Speedway may be demolished rebuilt in Middletown,"The current Speedway has four double-sided pumps and the new one would have 10 double-sided fuel pumps said Eric Boyd senior project manager. He said the additional pumps are needed to support the larger location.

Last year Speedway placed a parcel under contract with Sawyer’s Mill Project.

During the pre-development process Speedway worked with the Warren County Commissioners to ensure driveway access on Manchester Road and Dixie Highway according to the city documents. But the commissioners would not allow the new store to have full access drives on either right-of-way.

Speedway then requested a variance from the county for full access on Manchester. The county agreed as long as Speedway could acquire additional properties along Manchester to shift the proposed driveway west.

The current Speedway entrance on Manchester is about 100 feet from the intersection and doesn’t provide a safe access Boyd said.

He said the gas station is “run down worn out” and a new station would improve the look of the intersection.

Speedway LLC wants a map amendment and development plan amendment request to rezone three properties on Sawyer’s Mill Road from attached residential to community business district according a Middletown staff report.

The properties are located near the intersection of Manchester Road and Dixie Highway and are a total of 1.305 acres according to the city.

If approved by council the properties will be removed from the Sawyer’s Mill Subdivision and Speedway will construct a new gas station within the City of Middletown.

Boyd told Middletown council that a six-foot fence would be erected with landscaping behind the station to create a “buffer” and “soften the view” of the back of the building for residents in the Sawyer’s Mill subdivision.

Council will vote on the second reading of the legislation at its next meeting on Nov. 2."

“For decades our customers have enjoyed the ‘thrill-of-the-hunt’ for value at one dollar — and we remain committed to that core proposition — but many are telling us that they also want a broader product assortment when they come to shop” Dollar Tree President and CEO Michael Witynski said.

The store plans on offering items at the $1 $3 and $5 price points at new Dollar Tree Plus locations in an effort to provide a wider variety of products for customers. By the end of 2021 Dollar Tree plans on having 500 Dollar Tree Plus stores.

“We believe testing additional price points above $1 for Dollar Tree products will enable us over time to expand our assortments introduce new products and meet more of our customers’ everyday needs” Witynski said.

However their efforts are not ending there. The dollar store plans to open 1500 more of these stores in 2022 and then expect to have a total of at least 5000 Dollar Tree Plus stores by 2024.

“We are a ‘test-and-learn’ organization which is what we are doing with this new initiative” Witynski said. “Our merchants have proven that they are among the best in the industry in working with suppliers to create extreme value and we will continue to deliver the ‘thrill-of-the-hunt’ to our customers.”

Nurse and discount shopper Hannah Lanser shops at both Dollar Tree and Goodwill on a weekly basis. While she understands the change Dollar Tree has implemented she isn’t happy about it.

“Unfortunately this isn’t really the purpose of the Dollar Tree since it’s not going to be a dollar for everything” Lanser said. “Kind of disappointing [yet] understandable since everything else is going up in price all around us — like the McDonald’s dollar menu is not really a thing anymore so I guess they have to stay competitive with the other industries.”

Meanwhile Goodwill will stop accepting furniture and larger exercise equipment on Nov. 1 and will discontinue the sale of those products on Dec. 1.

The DePaulia spoke to a Goodwill manager who asked to remain anonymous as store employees aren’t supposed to speak to the press about the policy. While Goodwill did not directly tell the manager why these changes were implemented they have a few ideas.

“We’re getting lots of furniture but only selling a couple pieces a day” the manager said. “To throw away most of this furniture costs us hundreds [of dollars] and the sales of the furniture does not cover these costs at all.”

The work of the donation attendant position at Goodwill Stores is often busy moving furniture and other large merchandise on the floor. But this manager still thinks there is enough work to go around.

“I do not think this will interfere with any workflow during the day but we will lose customers due to the fact we won’t have such cheap furniture — we’re known for furniture people can afford” they said. “However we’re already too busy. This won’t affect our employees; in fact I think it will lessen their load.”

A new couch can cost well over $100 sometimes even over $1000. Allowing low-income shoppers who need more affordable options to feel the repercussions of this new policy.

The manager did say they are personally upset Goodwill is discontinuing furniture sales. They also said that furniture was often a big item for regulars who made money off reselling products they found at the store.

Devoted shoppers like Lanser have seen items disappear from Goodwill’s shelves over time and worry about what might be to come.

“I hear they are going to be [discontinuing certain items] now” Lanser said. “I have noticed they don’t have personal items like bras and underpants anymore and they used to at least new pairs … I feel like it’s not going to be the same they’re not going to have the same items I normally shop for.”

Despite this change and potential future changes to come Lanser does not see herself ever walking away from Goodwill since her love for the store is too strong.

“I just love the thrill of going in there and not knowing exactly what you’re looking for but searching through everything to find a good deal” Lanser said. “Searching through the racks searching through the selves — honestly [it’s] just exciting.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9mb29kLzIwMjEvMTAvMjMva2VsbG9nZ3Mtc3VlZC1zdHJhd2JlcnJpZXMtcG9wLXRhcnRzLWlsbGlub2lzLTUtbWlsbGlvbi82MTYwNjc1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kellogg's faces $5 million lawsuit for not having enough strawberries in its Pop-Tarts,"Kellogg’s strawberry-flavored Pop-Tarts need more strawberries according to a lawsuit filed against the company in August.

A class-action lawsuit filed by Anita Harris in the Southern District of Illinois argues that the Kellogg Sales Company is misleading consumers by promoting the breakfast pastry’s strawberry filling in its labels and marketing giving an impression that the fruit filling contains ""a greater relative and absolute amount of strawberries than it does.”

In reality the company’s “Frosted Strawberry Toaster Pastries” contain 2% or less of “dried strawberries dried pears dried apples” and “red 40” according to its nutrition label.

Harris claims the Pop-Tarts “cannot provide a true strawberry taste” since it is overwhelmed by “significant amounts” of pears and apples and says the red food coloring gives consumers “the false impression” that the pastries contain more strawberries.

The lawsuit said if Harris had known the truth she would not have bought the Pop-Tarts.

“Whether a toaster pastry contains only strawberries or merely some strawberries ... is basic front label information consumers rely on when making quick decisions at the grocery store” the lawsuit reads. “Strawberries are the Product’s characterizing ingredient ... (consumers) believe they are present in an amount greater than is the case.""

The lawsuit compares Kellogg’s product to similar toaster pastries from other brands like Walmart’s Great Value and Dollar Tree’s Clover Valley. The competitors also offer “frosted strawberry” pastries but note that they are “Naturally & Artificially Flavored” according to the lawsuit.

Kellogg’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit goes on to cite the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act which says deceptive acts such as “false pretense false promise misrepresentation or the concealment suppression or omission of any material fact” is unlawful.

But then I saw the preview for next week's episode wherein Lisa Barlow finally turns her sights to taking down Mary Cosby's Church of Donuts and I realized that this episode wasn't fluff…

It was Lisa's Joker-origin story. Plus even its fluffier moments like Whitney making the snow tubing losers wear wigs she dug out of a Dollar Tree dumpster on Nov. 1 had their payoffs. Because it meant that when Lisa finally breaks down and indignantly screams ""My grandfather was gay"" everyone staring back at her in stunned silence looks like some combination of Ronald McDonald and the Fanta girls.

See things aren't going well for Lisa Barlow. Over a well-rounded afterschool snack of Wendy's junior bacon cheeseburgers Starbucks cake pops and Bahama Buck's shaved ices Lisa's 9-year-old son shares that he's dealing with a similar situation at school where a boy inexplicably no longer wants to be his friend and when little Henry still tries to be his friend the other boy tells him he's ""not a good kid."" Now I don't want to pull a Jen Shah on Henry Barlow… but what are the chances here that he also sabotaged the catering of a friend's philanthropic casino night? Because the fallout sounds exactly the same as his mom's with her friend Angie… and Angie's friend Whitney… and eventually Whitney's friend Mary.

Outside of the RHOSLC playground drama things are also not going well for Jennie but that's just because her husband is the living breathing embodiment of ""men will literally commit polygamy and break their wife's/wives' heart instead of going to therapy."" I couldn't believe this episode didn't open back up on the mountain where we last saw Jennie storming away from Duy after he suggested they get a sister wife since Jennie after losing nine pregnancies and raising three children does not want to continue attempting to birth and raise babies.

Instead we find Jennie and Duy at date night because Jennie says she may still be mad at him but she's not going to deprive herself of oysters and martinis because of it. Which is my kind of girl except for the fact that she immediately brings up Duy's inappropriate sister-wife comment which means she ruins a good dirty martini by having to listen to Duy once more be completely flippant and heartless regarding her wants and needs while she drinks it. Of course now we now know that part of Duy's bullishness about having more children is due to witnessing the loss of their infant daughter after childbirth. But his emotional loss and his tendency to treat his wife more like a walking uterus than a woman with feelings is not a one-to-one correlation…

So everything makes a little more sense when Jennie finally tells Duy that he needs to seek professional therapy to help work through his lingering grief over their daughter and he responds ""There's nothing wrong with me to get help."" As they said in the olden days of yore: ""Whoop there it is."" Duy goes on to say that there's an emptiness inside him that he wants to fill with more children… which is the exact type of thing you could say to a therapist who could use their subject matter expertise to tell you that's not how things work.

The other gals are mostly doing fine though — and by ""fine"" I of course mean taking shots at a birthday party for multiple 1-year-olds and drunkenly collapsing like one of those inflated tube men at a car dealership because their pleather pants are so tight their knees can't even bend to break their fall.

And while I wish that had happened to multiple women it was actually just Angie which is why she's hungover when she shows up to the snow tubing party bus the next day. Mary says that Whitney picked an event that was two hours away — ""that's 60 minutes twice!"" — so she had to figure out a way to be comfortable. And naturally the only way to be comfortable was riding a stretch hummer the length of a city block. But if this is Mary comfortable then I shudder to think what uncomfortable looks like. On the ride Mary easily finds a way to mention for a second time in her Housewives tenure that carbonation ""hardens your ovaries."" Lisa said she was going to have to google that which seemed pretty innocuous to me…

But not to Mary! She snipes back at Lisa ""Don't do that… don't talk to me like I'm dumb!"" Lisa backs off fairly quickly but Mary has more to say: ""I mean you really have an attitude Lisa!"" It is both a wild overreaction and perfect. Mary so rarely flies off the handle that she must have been feeling some kind of way about Lisa for a while. And we know she's not the only one because it's starting to feel like Jennie is just about her only friend left. Which may be why Jennie then flies off the handle at Mary when she won't stop fussing at Lisa and then fussing at Jennie for using the f-word. ""This is how I talk. If you don't like it you don't have to listen Mary"" Jennie hollers over her shoulder as she storms toward the snow tubing facility fuming about how she just wants to have fun.

And even though most of them have just screamed at one another in the very recent past it seems like the girls do have fun tubing (excluding Mary who is physically exhausted after — checks notes — riding a moving sidewalk while holding a tube full of air). But nothing good can last especially when there are Bloody Marys and wigs involved…

The women retire to lunch after tubing where Jen asks if Mary and Lisa have worked things out. They mostly agree it was a misunderstanding but Lisa says she doesn't understand why everybody always wants to assume the worst in her. Angie takes that moment to say that she knows their relationship is forever changed now but she'd like to move on if they can. But surprisingly Lisa ""Loves to Move On"" Barlow says NO. Not unless that request to forget it comes with an apologetic plea to forgive it.

Angie wants Lisa to see her side of things but Lisa wants Angie to understand how badly the accusation hurt her. Whitney jumps in to say that Angie was also hurt and all hell breaks loose. ""DON'T BRING YOURSELF INTO THIS!"" Lisa yells citing their clean slate that has never not once been any cleaner than the air vent Whitney's dog peed in earlier. These two will never be friends. But Angie might still be on the table after Lisa breaks down into sobs saying that her grandfather was gay and she would never sabotage an event that supports a group of people she loves (which leads one to wonder about events that support say women who wear colors other than black — would she sabotage them?)

Angie walks over in her Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle coveralls hugs Lisa and says she believes her. Jennie gets angry at Mary one more time but Mary has already engaged more than she wanted to and has eaten exactly nothing to sustain her Housewives energy levels so she completely checks out. And with that so do we — see you back here next week for the first clips that will one day be used in the true-crime podcast they make about Mary's church.

Elizabeth and Isabella Thomas help pack shoeboxes for Operation Christmas Child at Green Valley Church in Hoover in 2020.

Michelle Thomas and her 12-year-old twins Elizabeth and Isabella always look forward to fall.

That’s when they get to put together shoeboxes filled with toys school supplies and hygiene items for needy children around the world as part of the Operation Christmas Child project organized by the Samaritan’s Purse nonprofit.

The family spends time throughout the year making crafts by hand to include in the shoeboxes which they put together at Green Valley Church with other volunteers.

The Thomas family and the family of Corey Green the shoe box project leader at Green Valley have been putting shoe boxes together for at least 16 years and now try to fill 150 boxes a year Michelle Thomas said.

This year she and her daughters made bead people out of pipe cleaners and beads dish towel teddy bears plastic and canvas crosses fish and stars out of crochet thread airplanes out of clothespins and popsicle sticks pipe cleaner lizards and clothespin caterpillars and birds among many other things. They also bought 50 baby dolls from Dollar Tree and Michelle’s sister-in-law made 12-by-12-inch quilts for each doll.

Items don’t have to be handmade but the Thomases like to be creative.

Michelle’s mom joined the effort this year too and her husband Joe and three sons — Nicholas Trenton and Travis — always help load the boxes and get them where they need to be.

Green Valley Church has been a central dropoff location for the area since 2012 Green said.

Green Valley is the only official dropoff point in Hoover but numerous churches groups and individuals throughout Hoover participate in the annual effort which started in 1993. This year’s national collection week is Nov. 15-22 but individual churches and groups often start in October or earlier.

Green Valley Church last year collected about 450 boxes by itself and roughly 3000 total from the community as a whole Green said. There are seven other dropoff points in Jefferson and Shelby counties including churches in Bessemer Columbiana Gardendale Hueytown Pleasant Grove Trussville and Warrior.

Each of those dropoff sites carry their shoe boxes to Gardendale First Baptist Church where all of them are loaded onto tractor trailers and taken to a regional processing center in Atlanta said Tricia Buriff one of three regional managers for the Southeast who also runs the Atlanta processing center.

Last year Samaritan’s Purse collected 27630 shoeboxes in Jefferson and Shelby counties which was down slightly from about 31000 in 2019 likely due to the pandemic Buriff said. The goal for Jefferson and Shelby counties this year is 34000 shoeboxes a 4% increase from 2019 and 23% increase from last year.

Some of the churches that normally participate didn’t last year because they weren’t meeting in person at the time but many of them have rejoined the effort this year Buriff said. The goal this year is to collect 880000 shoeboxes from Alabama Georgia and Mississippi she said.

In 2020 there were 7.8 million shoe boxes collected in the United States and more than 9.1 million collected worldwide including from Australia Austria Canada Finland Germany New Zealand South Korea Spain Switzerland and the United Kingdom. This year the global goal is 9.7 million shoeboxes.

Since 1993 Operation Christmas Child has collected and delivered more than 188 million shoe boxes with gifts to children in more than 170 countries and territories.

Christ Church United Methodist off Caldwell Mill Road has been collecting shoe boxes about seven years missions pastor Ben Birdsong said.

Last year the church collected 68 boxes but that was down from the normal number of about 120 due to COVID-19 he said. Christ Church United Methodist wasn’t meeting in person during collection time last year he said. He’s expecting better participation this year.

“It’s just an opportunity to connect people in Birmingham with mission needs around the world and meet practical needs for families in different parts of the world” Birdsong said. “It’s typical that families will do it together as a project.”

Green said it’s about so much more than just the gifts in the boxes. Since 2009 more than 26.5 million children who received the shoeboxes participated in a 12-lesson discipleship program in which trained volunteers share about Jesus Christ with them according to Samaritan’s Purse.

“It’s a really special way to spread the gospel truth” Green said. “It’s a very intentional purposeful presentation.”

Nancy Reeves another member at Green Valley said her family has filled shoeboxes for six or seven years. She and one of her 12-year-old daughters recently got to meet a 27-year-old man who received a shoebox as a child when he was in a Ukrainian orphanage.

The man Nicky Schweickert said in a video for Samaritan’s Purse that he had never before received anything so personal and dear to his heart. “I know that with a simple act of kindness and a simple shoebox a lot of hearts can be changed and brought to Jesus” Schweickert said.

Reeves said Schweickert’s testimony was impactful to her daughter who already loved picking out gifts for other people. “It helped validate the end result of a ministry she believes in” Reeves said.

Operation Christmas Child helps people in other parts of the world know about God’s love she said. “We might not can go in person but we can be part of it.”

Flesch reached 13-under 131 with his second straight bogey-free round on The Country Club of Virginia's James River Course. He has played the back nine in 9 under.

Vancouver's Stephen Ames is tied for eighth at six shots back. Fellow Canadian Mike Weir is tied for 30th at 10 shots back.

""I did a lot of the same stuff as yesterday"" Flesch said. ""I didn't get off to a quick start I parred the first five but then when I got to six I made a nice birdie and played another great back nine today.""

The 54-year-old Flesch won the 2018 Mitsubishi Electric Classic for his lone senior title. He won four times on the PGA Tour.

""I've just been kind of playing this week like I have the last I guess two months"" Flesch said. ""I'm not hitting shots I don't feel comfortable hitting. I'm just kind of I hate the term `playing within myself' but I'm just hitting shots I know I can pull off and I'm not taking unnecessary chances.""

Langer the 64-year-old German star who leads the Charles Schwab Cup points standings also had a 67. He won the Richmond event in 2017.

""The pins are tough and the greens are very firm"" Langer said. ""So it's difficult to get the ball near the hole to stop when the pins are in the front and when the pins are in the back you don't go over the back so it's a tricky situation.""

Alker disappointed with own putts

Alker the 50-year-old New Zealander who had a one-stroke lead over Flesch after an opening 63 dropped back with a 70.

""I didn't quite obviously putt as well"" Alker said. ""Sixty-three you've got to putt well so it wasn't quite there but I didn't give myself as many chances. Wedges weren't as close. Kind of struggled on the back nine a little bit.""

Tim Petrovic (67) and Doug Barron (68) were 10 under and Jeff Sluman (68) and Gene Sauers (68) followed at 8 under.

Jim Furyk was 7 under after a 68.

Defending champion Phil Mickelson closed with quadruple-bogey 9 on the par-5 ninth for a 74. He was tied for 49th at 1 over.

Although the band does have one studio album to their credit Live At The FIllmore East may be their crowning achievement in terms of audio recordings.

This is an incredibly easy to listen to album one that combines original Dominos songs and Eric Clapton tunes with a splash of cover songs mixed throughout. Derek and the Dominos was a band that essentially came together during the recording of George Harrison’s first solo album All Things Must Pass. And while their shelf life may have been short thanks to this album their legacy will live on forever in a very positive way.

The band wastes no time getting into an immediate early groove for the album-opening “Got To Get Better In A Little While.” A song that was planned for the band’s second studio album that never came to fruition it features Clapton and Bobby Whitlock going riff for riff on guitar and piano respectively in a tasteful jam that stretches out to nearly 14 minutes in length. Whitlock adds some nice vocal harmonies as well as the chorus rounds back into place with the music picking up a collective head of steam.

This first track was pulled from the opening night of music on October 23. Here’s a taste of the October 24 version that didn’t make the album cut.

For the next number this time drummer Jim Gordon and Whitlock kick things off on “Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad?” Eventually Clapton gets his guitar’s wah pedal going in full force and a crisp little jam ensues before the first word is ever sung. This is the first of many songs pulled from the group’s epic Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs album that would be released just weeks later. Co-written by Clapton and Whitlock who again adds some impeccable backup vocals it’s another one of the longer tracks on the album thanks to a whirlwind jam that never lets off the gas pedal ably fueled by Carl Radle on bass. After coming a to head the band shifts the tone into a much quieter bluesy one for several minutes before the chorus comes back around one last time. The Fillmore crowd demonstrably shows their appreciation to the Dominos after this one.

This helps set the tone for “Key To The Highway” a cover of an old blues standard that dates back to the 1940s. Clapton takes center stage and shows why he’s considered one of the great blues players of this generation delivering one stinging guitar lick after another. Another Layla song this one made it onto the album by pure happenstance. Allegedly Clapton and Duane Allman who was prominently involved with the album’s studio recording – playing on 11 of the 14 tracks heard the song being played in a neighboring studio and decided to play along to it. “Blues Power” slides in perfectly behind this a song that appears on Clapton’s first solo album that Leon Russell helped write. These last two blues-heavy numbers are both taken from the October 24 recording.

The first of this two-disc releases out first with “Have You Ever Loved A Woman” another blues cover that found its way onto Layla. This one is even slower and “bluesier” if that’s possible with the tempo never going past a slow shuffle. Clapton lets both his vocals and guitar do all the singing on this one while Whitlock adds some delicate piano fills throughout. Then “Bottle Of Red Wine” wraps up the first part of the album another rollicking blues-infused song that Clapton navigates with ease with Whitlock jumping on the organ for assistance now.

The second half of this iconic albums begins with “Tell The Truth” another Clapton-Whitlock collaboration pulled from Layla. The two essentially share lead vocals on this fun little number that ebbs and flows with emotion and soul. Once the vocals are out of the way Clapton reverts back to rock legend mode and lays down a tremendous solo spearheading one of the longer jams of the album. Up next is another sterling cover of a blues standard. This time it’s “Nobody Knows You When You’re Down And Out” originally written by pianist Jimmie Cox in 1923. Clapton’s bluesy drawl is backed perfectly by Whitlock and Gordon on piano and drums respectively.

The Dominos then return to their own catalog with “Roll It Over.” While it wasn’t on the original Layla release it did make its way on to the 40th Anniversary Deluxe reissue. It’s a classic rock number the sees Clapton explore a few different tones in his guitar play during a steadily progressive jam. The Fillmore crowd immediately recognizes the next song as “Presence Of The Lord” made famous by one of Clapton’s former bands Traffic. It’s the only Traffic tune on the album but the Dominos do it justice as a mellow laid back composed section gives way to a rapid intense sequence of music before reverting back.

The final three tracks of Derek and the Dominos: Live At The Fillmore may be one of the best three-song sequences of the album and naturally it contains a pair of incredible covers. The first of these is Jimi Hendrix’s “Little Wing.” Whitlock’s organ fills give this cover more than a soulful feel as both he and Clapton take care of the vocals with ease. Not one to be outdone Clapton then delivers a few bars of a psychedelic guitar solo that serves a truly fitting homage to the great Hendrix who passed away barely a month before this performance in 1970.

This jaw dropping cover is followed by what very well may be the best track on the album a scintillating and exploratory “Let It Rain.” It’s the last of three singles from Clapton’s solo album and the Dominos stretch this one out and then some. Clapton and Whitlock go tit-for-tat with each screaming out “Let It Rain” in succession towards the end of the composed section. Afterwards all hell breaks lose starting with one more mesmerizing run by Clapton on the fretboard as the rhythm section just tries to keep up. Eventually Clapton switches from wailing guitar mode to a heavy funked out “wah” effect taking the jam to another level. This eventually gives way to a Jim Gordon drum solo that goes on for well more than four minutes before the guitar finally reenters the mix. After a few more minutes of some fun Gordon and Clapton call and response interplay the band explodes back in the chorus emphatically. It’s by far the longest track on the album and arguably the most enjoyable as the “beautiful” Fillmore crowd (so labeled by Clapton at song’s end) would surely attest.

The album then closes with the last cover song of the evening made famous by another one of Slowhand’s former bands. This time it’s the great Robert Johnson’s “Crossroads” although in fitting with the tone of the album it’s a much slower and soulful take than the version Cream made famous. It allows for one last great Clapton guitar solo which ends the album in grand fashion and serves as the last reminder of one memorable two-night run by Derek and the Dominos at the Fillmore that took place truly at the height of their powers.

This album is available to listen in its entirety on Youtube here. Also be sure to check out the video below of all the great songs and outtakes that didn’t quite make the final cut.

Fats Domino is perhaps the most underrated artist in rock and roll history. Very much rated by those in the know namely the white adherents that gave the blues a rebirth in the early 1960s Domino’s legacy is incredible. However despite his mammoth impact for some unknown reason he seems to get overlooked in favour of the more iconic rock ‘n’ rollers such as Muddy Waters Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry.

Of course it is not outrageous to say that the likes of both Berry and Waters were perhaps the two most influential musicians on the development of rock ‘n’ roll aside from the long-deceased Robert Johnson but Domino’s effect on its development was massive and this is why his absence from many discussions is a puzzling one.

After learning his craft in the bars of New Orleans as a teenager Domino signed to Imperial Records in 1949 and it was this that set him on his path to greatness. His success preceded the ‘British Invasion’ and with his contemporaries such as Berry and Waters he created the sound of the ’60s that was about to change popular culture forever and give the music industry its ‘Big Bang’.

Showing just how huge Domino was (musically) the 1949 hit he and Dave Bartholemew penned ‘The Fat Man’ sold over one million copies by the onset of 1951 – an incredible achievement for the era. In fact ‘The Fat Man’ is cited by many as being the first definitive rock ‘n’ roll record.

After this he assembled a band that at different points featured the likes of the saxophonist’s Herbert Hardesty and Alvin ‘Red’ Tyler the bassist Billy Diamond and the drummer Earl Palmer. Furthermore he hired his trusted bandleader Fred Kemp who would be his second in command for years to come. With this solid foundation Domino and Bartholemew would go on a hit writing run over the next fourteen years.

The interesting thing about Domino is that he was so much more than solely a bluesman. He even crossed over into the mainstream with the release of ‘Ain’t That A Shame’ in 1955. A man clearly adept at fluidity his records crossed the segregational line that was the cultural definer of the day in America but unfortunately in some ways the racial and social mores still trumped his efforts.

A milder version of the song hit number one when it was released by country singer Pat Boone owing to the segregationalist attitudes of many in white America. Regardless Domino was still one of the era’s most successful artists. Chuck Berry claimed in his memoir that by 1955 Domino was said to be earning $10000 a week from touring.

Imperial Records was sold in 1963 and consequently Domino left the label. “I stuck with them until they sold out” he said in 1979. Of the 60 singles he released for Imperial 40 were top ten hits a remarkable feat.

After his departure from Imperial he moved to ABC Paramount Records that year; due to his new label his collaborative work with Bartholemew was over and he continued to record steadily until around 1970. In 1965 he also moved to Mercury Records but this didn’t matter as his career was slowly winding down.

Much of this was to do with the fact that those he had inspired The Beatles and The Rolling Stones et al. were now the day’s biggest stars. They had taken the formula of Domino and his contemporaries and repackaged it for the next generation.

In a strange way one could argue that Domino’s reluctance to heed the dawn of rock ‘n’ roll was perhaps what added to Berry and the like surpassing him in terms of status. In 1957 he famously said: “What they call rock ‘n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans”. Of course this was true. It’s just Berry seemed to miss the point. It was a new generation of blues adherents who had grown up listening to Domino and inspired by him formed this thing called rock ‘n’ roll.

The way in which he managed to cross the stark segregational lines was nothing short of astounding. Although racism still ruled with an iron fist as the Boone record shows Domino’s efforts in dispelling racism between the youth was pioneering.

His records and tours brought together black and white youths unifying them under the banner of music and what was starting to become known as rock ‘n’ roll. The appreciation of his music played a considerable role in the cultural breakdown of segregation in the US. Furthermore it helped to bridge racial divides in places such as the UK and Western Europe.

There is nothing more indicative of Domino’s legacy than what occurred during Elvis Presley‘s first sold-out concert at the Las Vegas Hilton on July 31 1969. Domino just so happened to be in the audience of 2200 to watch Presley strut his stuff. At the press conference after the show a journalist referred to Presley by his nickname ‘The King’ and Presley swiftly gestured to Domino who was watching on.

“No” Presley said “That’s the real king of rock and roll.” Elvis didn’t stop there either. He continued: “Rock ‘n’ roll was here a long time before I came along. Let’s face it: I can’t sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.” He appended that Domino was “a huge influence on me when I started out”.

Aside from Presley and the ‘British Invasion’ bands Domino has also been a huge influence on disparate artists such as Norah Jones Willie Nelson and even Jah Wobble. Showing just how far his influence reaches his tendency to accentuate the offbeat in his rhythms such as on his classic rocker ‘Be My Guest’ was a defining influence on the development of ska.

Even today Domino’s great influence can be found in many different musical realms and this was his true genius. Although at the time he didn’t necessarily accept the pioneering strides his music was making this didn’t matter as everybody who lapped up his records has been quick to cite him as an inspiration. Duly his music lives on vicariously through the works of others as well as the innumerable classics he recorded.

There will have been many times you’ve listened to Fats Domino and not been aware of it. Your favourite musicians favourite musician it’s about time the mainstream woke up to the pioneering brilliance of Fats Domino.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvd2hhdHMtb24vcmV2aWV3cy9kb21pbm9zLWZlc3RpdmUtbWVudS1yZXZpZXctaGVhdmVubHktMjE5MDA4MDLSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlcnBvb2xlY2hvLmNvLnVrL3doYXRzLW9uL3Jldmlld3MvZG9taW5vcy1mZXN0aXZlLW1lbnUtcmV2aWV3LWhlYXZlbmx5LTIxOTAwODAyLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dominos Festive Menu review: Heavenly After Eight Cookies and tasteless festive pizza,"The festive season will soon be upon us and many are already shopping for the big day.

Supermarkets have released their Christmas ranges and delivery slots and now the nation's favourite takeaways are joining in on the action.

Domino's Pizza is the latest eatery to announce their festive menu with a new pizza featuring all the trimmings of a Christmas dinner and a brand new dessert merging their popular cookies with a classic brand.

It's the first time Domino's has released a Christmas themed pizza.

The Festive One includes turkey breast marinated in sage and onion traditional Cumberland sausage and bacon to give you a taste of the top trimmings.

Their new cookies - Cookies with After Eight - feature a soft mint centre similar to the popular After Eight chocolates.

But is the menu as Christmassy as it sounds and could you really opt for that instead of a traditional festive feast?

We tried out the two new festive additions to help you make your mind up.

The Festive One

This limited-edition pizza is sure to be a popular choice for the season and I couldn't wait to try it.

Expectations were high with this festive feast and I was expecting a pizza full of flavour that would actually get me in the mood for turkey and all it's glorious trimmings that go with it.

We ordered a large as we shared it between four of us and also got a large pepperoni passion ( a classic winner) just in case no one liked the new addition!

A word of advice for the pizza sizes at Domino's - you're actually better off getting a large because you get more for your money - the large pizzas are priced at £20.99 whereas the mediums are £18.99 - so for an extra £2 you can get a couple of more slices in perfect for leftovers or if you're eating in a group.

Anyway back to The Festive One.

The smell of stuffing balls was enticing but I was worried the sage and onion flavour mixed in with the turkey pieces was going to be too overpowering.

It wasn't.

There was just the right balance of sage and onion and the smoked bacon helped give it that pigs in blankets essence I was after.

However after one slice I found myself reaching for the Pepperoni Passion instead - not because The Festive One was horrible in flavour but because it unfortunately lived up to the dread we all fear at Christmas - a dry turkey.

The tomato sauce base was minimal on The Festive One - the turkey had soaked up almost of all the sauce and yet still tasted dry.

After one slice my taste buds were bored of the texture and craved the traditional cheesy picture sauce of a pizza.

For me a Cumberland sausage was a mistake too but that's just because I prefer a pork sausage in taste.

The rest of the group didn't agree with me though and quickly demolished most of the pizza claiming they would definitely order it again.

For me I'm not so sure.

I feel Domino's may have missed a bit of a trick here and could have experimented with flavours a little more but I understand they want to play it safe and go for something most customers would enjoy.

Perhaps a vegan Christmas pizza is next on the cards?

They definitely need to sort out the tomato sauce base balance ratio to toppings out though on The Festive One.

Overall I'll give it 3/5 stars - tasty but not overwhelming in flavour like a Christmas dinner can be.

The Festive One is available to buy at your nearest Domino's now - £9.99 for a personal £16.99 for a small £18.99 for a medium and £20.99 for a large.

Cookies with After Eight

At Christmas there's always a box of After Eight's lying around in our household.

They have become a staple part of Christmas Day and festive celebrations so I can see why Domino's have paired up with them to make new cookies.

The 'posh chocs' can now be enjoyed in cookie form and they haven't lost their gooey goodness.

Upon opening the box of warm cookies I was instantly hit with the minty smell. It was like a warm refreshing hug that didn't feel too strong on the senses.

Domino's normal chocolate cookies are just as good - served warm - with their indulgent chocolate bursting inside.

These Cookies with After Eight are not only indulgent but also act as a little palette cleanser - something you'll need after all that cheese!

I have to admit I was a little upset I had to share the four of them and could only have one!

I'm not normally a massive chocolate fan as I find some cocoa desserts a little too rich - but these are worth it they are so moreish and just want another as soon as you have finished the first.

After feeling a little disappointed from The Festive One pizza I was ready to dismiss the Domino's Christmas menu altogether but the Cookies with After Eight saved the day.

If you're going to try anything this Christmas I would say you need to try these - only if you're a mint or After Eight fan of course if not I'll happily eat yours.

5/5 stars.

The Cookies with After Eight are available for just £4.99.

It comes in batches of four and you can get two for £6.99.

There is also a special dessert deal where customers can get two Ben & Jerry tubs of ice creams for £10.99.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZ3VpZG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwL2x1eC1pbi1kb21pbm8tYS12YWxlZGljdG9yeS1hZGRyZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lux in domino: A valedictory address,"Rev. Fr. Primitivo E. Viray Jr. Superior of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus; Rev. Fr. Roberto C. Yap SJ University President; Ms. Bernadine T. Siy Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Ateneo de Manila University; Rev. Fr. Jose Ramon T. Villarin SJ former University President and baccalaureate mass homilist; Mayor Victor Ma. Regis N. Sotto Mayor of Pasig City; Dr. Maria Luz C. Vilches Vice President for the Loyola Schools; Vice Presidents of the University Deans Administrators Faculty Professionals and Staff of the Loyola Schools; parents families friends; fellow graduates good day.

First off heartfelt Congratulations Batch 2021; we made it! As cliché as it may sound I think it’s a beautiful and comforting phrase to hear today. Despite the extraordinary hurdles and challenges we’ve been through the past year here we are celebrating this great feat in our lives.

And all this was made possible with the help of our devoted families teachers and university administrators professionals and staff. Thank you as well to our front liners—to our doctors nurses security guards grocery staff delivery riders public servants and many more front liners who allowed our lives to go on while they risked theirs. Perhaps the great question that lies ahead of us today with everything still going on is this: What do we do now? To what purpose do we devote our lives?

Imagine yourself leaving home not knowing where to go exactly. In fact Ateneo has been like a second home to us students for the past four or more years and it is rather sad to bid it goodbye. And while we may be leaving our beloved alma mater enlightened by all that it has taught us it might also be true that we are leaving it somewhat lost dazed and confused because of the darkness that surrounds us.

I vividly recall my first experience of darkness in college back in my second year. I attended an NSTP (National Service Training Program) recollection facilitated by Sir Cholo Santos of the Office of Campus Ministry. It was a very calming session until he asked us this question: ”What do you seek in life?” I had nothing really to say at that point except happiness—genuine happiness.

Then he started asking each one of us again “What steps are you taking to get there?” At that time I had this flashback moment of what I had been doing with my life. I wasn’t so sure how to answer the question authentically because truthfully I really wasn’t taking any conscious steps toward what would make me genuinely happy.

I remember the session ended with me sitting on the floor by the front right corner of the chapel just crying as I struggled to write anything in my reflection journal. My heart was simply filled with anxieties and worries about where my life was headed. It felt like my life was surrounded by darkness with no light to lead me to where I wanted to go.

But in that same year through the experiences and people I encountered I found light and hope in chasing the happiness that I sought. I found light in seeing my org mates all work together beyond class hours at MVP [Building]—not for a grade but for a project we believed could create an impact on the lives of the people we were making it for. I found light in Princess a kid from our EDGE partner community who despite having only one cupcake for baon offered me half of it before we started discussing the lesson. I found light in Iva who broke down during a Central Board meeting out of frustration; as well as in the members of our all-girl executive board who each had a share of burnout moments. But nevertheless got back up knowing how important our work was to the community. I found joy while working with and for people towards a greater cause beyond ourselves.

Fast forward to today as we graduate into a world shrouded in darkness in chaos and surrounded by selfishness and injustice: The pandemic happened Taal erupted typhoons like Ambo and Ulysses struck—disrupting if not taking lives and exposing existing faulty systems that we had long taken for granted. Schools work and even transportation all stopped.

But even then life went on. Life went on because courageous people stepped up and became bearers of light. When darkness took over and no beam of light was in sight they decided to be it—to be the light bearer. Not only for themselves but for the rest of the people around them who walked in darkness.

Come to think of it when we look back on our online college journey we may not have even realized taking for granted the lights that kept us going.

I saw light in our frontliners who work day and night sacrificing not only their time with their families but also their own lives to spearhead this battle against the virus. I saw light in Sir Bobby Guevara Sir Raul Rodriguez and every other professor who— despite their initial struggles with technology—learned adapted and still inspired each one of their students. I saw light in student leaders of all organizations this year who despite this difficult online setup pursued and continued to serve both the students and their communities. I saw light in Ate Jam and Ate Mich and many other people I met at CYA (Christ Youth in Action) who patiently answered all my questions about life and faith and guided me in strengthening my relationship with God. I saw light in friends who would check up on me from time to time and become a virtual shoulder to cry on during moments we feel so isolated from the world.

I saw light in our commencement speaker today Mayor Vico Sotto who continues to challenge society’s norms in his efforts to genuinely and honestly serve the people— addressing contractualization for around 100 Pasig City Hall employees and standing up for the human rights of even the most marginalized of his constituents. I saw light in Ms. Ana Patricia Non who first started the community pantry initiative that sparked a movement across the country; from a single bamboo cart outside her house to thousands of community pantries founded on the core principle: “Magbigay ayon sa kakayahan; kumuha batay sa pangangailangan.” (Give according to what you can; take according to what you need) I saw light in Kuya Nelson Diaz the taho vendor from Kawit Cavite who selflessly laid out a table of taho for a community pantry.

I saw light in the communities that worked together to make things easier and better for one another. I see light in people who choose to do and see things lovingly even at such a dark and disquieting time; people who have unknowingly become pillars of hope in our lives by the choice they had made to love to be a light and to share their light.

And as we graduate today the theme of our graduation poses a challenge for us to be that source of change in the beleaguered world in which we live. “Gawing Buo ang Bansa” (Make the country whole) Feels overwhelming doesn’t it? It could be daunting out there for graduating students like us to be sent off with such a great responsibility when we are still trying to learn from experience and are still discerning our life vocations. I am sure at some point you’ve asked yourselves too—how can someone like me just me make change happen?

I will not deny having moments of self-doubt whenever I realize how seemingly small I am and that there’s only so much I can do as one person. For all the Marvel fans out there it’s not like we have the infinity stones and gauntlet with us to change the world in just one snap. But even then we don’t give up. This truth about our limitations should not keep us from hoping. Rather we should seek to do our best out of love for the people around us and for the God who loved us first and whom we serve.

As Fr. Jett Villarin once beautifully stated “Magis is a translation that while we never reach the summit we keep on climbing. We may never reach the stars yet we continue to look at them to guide our lives. And when we look at the stars I hope we see God smiling at us.”

In moments when we realize how faint our spark of light is in a pitch-black room we do not put it out and deem it useless. Rather we use whatever little light we have to illumine our paths or pass on that same light to another and create a bigger one.

Sabi nga ni Sir Jethro Tenorio “Nag-iisa ka lang pero hindi ka nag-iisa.” (There’s only one of you but you’re not alone.) You are one of a kind and you have your own unique self flame and light to offer to the world. Realize as well that you are not alone. You have a community people around you with whom you can work in making a change and in getting out of the dark together. After all we are called to both live with and for others.

Timely enough today we graduate close to election year—2022. It is one opportunity for us to use the light we have within us to choose the leaders whom we could challenge and work within forging a more just and sustainable future for all Filipinos. But it does not end here. Whatever happens from then on the mission we carry with us today remains. And going back to the great question posed before us today: What do we do now and to what purpose do we devote our lives? I have nothing definite to say even for myself except—Lux in Domino. Light in the Lord through His people.

Wherever you may find yourself allow the Lord’s light to be present in you and radiate it to illumine the lives of others as we journey out of this darkness together and beyond it.

Dark as we may see the world let us not be afraid. Let us not be afraid of journeying through the dark with whatever light we have. We can cry feel lost anxious distressed and angry today. All of these feelings are valid but it does not end there. Let us use these tears dark experiences feelings of frustration and anger as St. Ignatius of Loyola did during his cannonball experience to move us and fuel us to get back on our feet because we know we have something to offer to dispel the pains sorrows and darkness in the world we see today.

In fact for over four years Ateneo has helped us discover and ignite this flame within each one of us. It is now time to ask ourselves: How do we use this flame to set the world on fire?

Magkakaiba man tayo ng mga landas na tatahakin tulung-tulong pa rin nating buuin ang bansa sa pamamagitan ng dangal integridad katapatan pagmamahal at liwanag na tunay nang umiiral sa bawat isa sa atin.

(Even if we go down different paths may we unite the country through with the dignity integrity honesty love and light that exists in each of us.)

To God be all the glory! Thank you so much Batch 2021 and everyone here today. May God be with us and bless us all!",,,

DOW,Dow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXdlYWx0aG9mY29tbW9uc2Vuc2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvaW5mbGF0aW9uLXZzLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1yZXR1cm5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inflation vs. Stock Market Returns,"The headlines from this week make it feel like people are throwing in the towel on the idea of inflation being transitory:

I’m still not sure we can all agree on what ‘transitory’ actually means at this point but it’s hard to deny prices seem to be rising across a wide range of goods and services in the economy.

Maybe this will turn out to be a one-time spike that falls back to trend but it’s hard to say at this point. No one knows how the combination of a pandemic and unprecedented government spending will turn out.

Plus predicting inflation even in “normal” times is not easy.

If higher inflation is here to stay it would seem to be a big risk to the stock market. It is possible an inflation scare could spook investors but there’s no clear sign of this from the historical data.

Here’s a look at the calendar year returns on the S&P 500 along with the annual inflation rate going back to 1928:

There’s no clear pattern here.

That could be because the stock market is supposed to be forward-looking and inflation involves backward-looking data but even if you did some sort of look-ahead there’s nothing there.

And even when inflation has been as high or higher than it is right now the stock market has held up pretty well in the past.

Here’s a table that ranks the highest calendar year rates of inflation with the corresponding returns on the stock market:

The average returns for the S&P 500 in these years were 9.4%. That’s basically the long-term average over the past 90+ years.

Not bad.

Eight out of the 17 years were double-digit returns. Nearly one-third of the time returns were more than 20% when inflation was the highest.

Obviously those returns were lower on a real basis after accounting for the higher inflation. But it’s not like it’s a total disaster for stocks when inflation runs hot.

It does make sense the stock market would hold up in an inflationary environment if you think about it from the perspective of corporations. It’s not like most companies willingly eat higher prices themselves. Most of them pass along those higher prices to their customers.

That’s how prices rise in the first place.

So input costs rise but so do profits. In fact some of the highest earnings growth historically occurred in the 1940s and 1970s.

What do these two decades have in common?

Both decades experienced high rates of inflation (as you can see from the table above).

It is worth pointing out the 1940s and 1970s weren’t exactly the greatest decades for the financial markets. But the following decades in the 1950s and 1980s saw extraordinary bull markets.

I’m not going to pretend to know what comes next when it comes to price levels in the economy. Your guess is as good as mine.

But if inflation is higher going forward than it had been in the recent past it’s not automatically a death sentence for the stock market.

And the strategy worked.

The Catamounts scored twice in the first 12 minutes of the match and walked away from Virtue Field on Saturday with a 2-0 win over America East rival Albany.

“When we're at home we're going to be aggressive” said coach Rob Dow. “This field is a place where we want to dictate the pace of the match.”

With the win the Catamounts hold sole possession of second place in the conference with a 9-4-2 record on the season.

Zach Barrett opened the scoring at the seven-minute mark on a corner from Alex Nagy that the sophomore was able to bury with his right foot.

Joe Morrison scored just five minutes later on a master-class touch from Nacho Lerech who shook one defender before dropping it to the senior for a sliding kick goal in the lower left corner.

“I really think we collectively put in a great shift” said senior Todd Smith. “It was definitely good to represent the seniors there and be able to just kind of have a full game throughout.”

Catamounts’ 2021 play

The Catamounts have been strong on defense in the nine wins this season. Allowing just 14 goals in 15 games senior goalie Nate Silveira recorded his seventh shutout in the victory and has an impressive 0.84 goals against average on the year good for second in the conference.

“He did what he needed to do” Dow said of Silveira. “And the backline really helped him out but to get a shutout in conference play is really difficult especially against a team like Albany.”

After a hot start to the 2021 campaign highlighted by five consecutive shutout wins the Cats slid and dropped three games including a loss to conference opponent Stony Brook. The team found itself at 5-3-1 when conference play fully commenced but were able to get back on track with wins over UMBC NJIT and Hartford.

Leading the scoring this season like last year is All-American Alex Nagy last week's league offensive player of the week. Nagy has 14 points in 2021.

Right behind the sure-footed senior from New Hampshire is first-year transfer Lerech.

Along with Lerech Matt Black also leads a group of transfers and graduate students that Dow knew in August could have an impact this season.

The Cats are unbeaten at home this year — four wins and one tie — and with two games left in the regular season a victory against UMass Lowell at Virtue Field on Oct. 28 would go a long way to securing the second seed in for the league playoffs.

“It feels amazing” Smith said of having control of second place. “Honestly it makes for a run and push into playoffs now.”

Special to Detroit Free Press

On a gloomy damp afternoon 50 years ago Sunday 54418 excited football fans made their pilgrimage to Tiger Stadium to see if the Detroit Lions sporting a four-game winning streak and tied for first place with Minnesota in the NFC Central Division could defeat the “Monsters of the Midway” led by Chicago’s Dick Butkus.

Local radio listeners — the regional telecast was blacked out in Detroit — were glued to the play-by-play of Van Patrick and Bob Reynolds on WJR-AM (760).

With the Lions in a two-minute drill and trailing 28-23 little-used Chuck Hughes who entered the game in the fourth quarter replacing the injured Larry Walton made a 32-yard catch from quarterback Greg Landry for a first down on the Bears’ 37-yard line.

However by 3:30 p.m. Oct. 24 1971 the game’s outcome seemed meaningless. The tragedy that occurred with a minute left to play would forever serve as a glaring reminder of life’s fragility.

It is believed Hughes is the only player from the who died while competing in a game.

Hughes all 5 feet 11 and 185 pounds of him made his first reception of the season despite being hit by Bob Jeter and Garry Lyle.

[ Lions may miss Matthew Stafford but neither he nor Jared Goff are the answer ]

Who was Chuck Hughes?

Although a walk-on at Texas Western (later the University of Texas-El Paso)Hughes finished his college career with the second-most receiving yards and the third-highest number of receptions in NCAA history. He was the 1967 fourth-round draft choice of the Eagles and played sparingly in his three seasons with Philadelphia.

The reserve receiver was acquired ahead of the 1970 season when he made a remarkable 42-yard catch that helped seal the victory over the Oakland Raiders in the Thanksgiving Day game.

“Chuck didn’t have great speed but he was a good player a great guy and teammate and he worked like hell at practice"" former Lions head coach and Hall of Famer Joe Schmidt said earlier this month. “He would follow me up and down the sidelines asking to get in the game but Chuck never complained.”

Added Landry:

“Chuck ran great routes and had great hands but what we all remember most about him was the quality of the person and how well-liked he was by everyone” Landry said recently. “He was always upbeat and never down and was someone you always wanted to associate with.”

A sudden tragedy

After Hughes’ first-down catch Landry threw the ball out of bounds to stop the clock and then appeared to connect with end Charlie Sanders — until the tight end was slammed to the ground by Butkus just as the ball arrived.

With 1:02 showing on the game clock the 28-year-old Hughes began running back to the huddle when suddenly he grabbed his chest. He dropped face down onto the turf at the 25-yard line.

Bears defensive end Ed O’Bradovich will never forget what he witnessed that day.

“After the play I turned around and I saw Chuck fall to the ground about 12 yards away and when he was laying there his eyes were wide open” O’Bradovich now 81 said from his home in Illinois. “The Lions were out of timeouts and I was thinking he was trying to get an injury timeout so I started yelling at him ‘You no-good so-and-so and I screamed at the referee that he was faking it. But then I saw Butkus bend over and start waving to the Detroit bench for medical help and I thought ‘Oh (expletive) what can this be.’""

Lions center Ed Flanagan saw the linebacker waving his arms while standing near Hughes.

“When I first saw Butkus standing over him I first thought ‘Oh God don’t tell me Dick hit Chuck’ but as we learned no one had hit him on that play’” Flanagan said recently.

Former Detroit radio and television personality Tom Ryan was sitting with his wife Joan in the upper deck at the opposite end behind the south end zone.

“We didn’t have a portable radio or binoculars with us and we assumed Hughes had been knocked unconscious but then it progressively looked more serious with the medical personnel out there for so long and with the crowd becoming eerily so silent’"" Ryan said.

Lions team physicians Dr. Richard Thompson Dr. Edwin Guise trainer Kent Falb and assistant trainer Gary Tuthill rushed onto the field. After carefully removing the receiver’s helmet Guise began administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Hughes as Thompson began rhythmic thumping on Hughes’ chest.

“When I got to Chuck it was an athlete trainer’s worst nightmare because he was not breathing and was extremely pale” said Falb who ran to the concourse area under the stands near the Tigers’ bullpen to notify the awaiting ambulance personnel. They came out with a gurney to transport Hughes to Henry Ford Hospital 3 miles north of the ballpark.

'Someone doesn't just drop'

As the minutes ticked which many witnesses thought felt like an eternity a man ran out with an oxygen tank while a Grosse Pointe anesthesiologist Dr. Eugene Boyle ran down from the upper deck stands and onto to the field to assist the Lion doctors.

Meanwhile on the radio broadcast Van Patrick and Bob Reynolds in very somber tones tried to fill the time as best they could. Patrick kept saying ‘This doesn’t look good this doesn’t look good at all.’

Hughes’ wife Sharon was sitting in the west upper deck stands with the other player wives.

“Normally after a play I would be talking with my friend Dru Robb (wife of defensive end Joe Robb) but for some reason after the play ended I was focused on Chuck and saw him grab his chest and fall down” Hughes said last week from her home in San Antonio Texas. “I knew right away it was serious because someone doesn’t just drop in mid-stride when you haven’t been hit. I thought maybe he had choked on his mouthpiece. Dru and I immediately ran down and although they would not let us on the field we waited next to the ambulance.""

As the medical personnel ran Hughes off the field on the gurney the fans were standing and not a sound could be heard. The receiver one of 14 children raised in meager circumstance in west Texas never regained consciousness.

“I knew something horrible had happened because when they were rolling Chuck off the field one of his arms fell down and his hand was flopping around back and forth and I thought to myself ‘Holy Christ I think he’s dead’” said O’Bradovich.

Falb said his wife remembered it was “so quiet in the stadium that the only thing you could hear was the fading sound of the ambulance siren until it finally made it to Henry Ford Hospital.”

Hughes had jumped into the ambulance and accompanied her husband to the hospital.

“Kent Falb worked continually on Chuck giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and I don’t know how he kept on and on but he did” said Hughes a college homecoming queen who began dating Chuck when the couple attended Texas Western.

None of the players at that point cared about the game and when play resumed with 62 seconds left the Bears ran out the clock with their 28-23 victory after Landry threw an incomplete pass to Altie Taylor.

“When we got into the locker room we all got down on one knee and prayed for Chuck” says O’Bradovich.

With the media banned from entering the Lions locker room head coach Joe Schmidt had gathered his players many of whom were sitting in front of their lockers still in their uniforms and openly weeping.

“I was so confused and upset that I really didn’t know how to handle it but I did my best to speak with the team and asked everyone to pray for Chuck before I went to the hospital” said Schmidt.

How did this happen?

After the game a distraught Thompson told reporters “His heart stopped on the field. We thought we got it going one time but couldn’t be sure. It stopped again.”

At 4:41 p.m. Charles Frederick Hughes was pronounced dead. He was 28.

“I know that the doctors and Kent Falb tried their very best to save Chuck” says Sharon Hughes.

Free Press sports editor Joe Falls wrote the next day that as team owner William Clay Ford was choking back tears he said: “Never ever in the wildest moments would you ever believe a thing like this could happen. It’s just inconceivable. Our whole team is filled with a great sense of sorrow. Chuck was a great player and a great person.”

The following day the autopsy report revealed Hughes had died from an undiagnosed and advanced “arteriosclerotic coronary heart disease with acute coronary thrombotic occlusion” or as otherwise described by Thompson: ""He had a hardening of the main artery supplying blood to the heart and a clot had formed in this artery shutting off the flow of a blood.”

The report also mentioned that there was old scarring on the posterior wall of the heart indicating evidence of previous heart trauma.

Guise told reporters “One dies officially when one is pronounced dead but in my heart I feel Chuck died on the field.”

To this day Falb agrees.

“We did everything we could based upon the skills and everything we knew at the time. You could have had the Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic on the field that day but he was not going to survive. He was dead” says Falb.

'Rare and unusual'

When speaking to reporters upon the release of the autopsy report Guise said “The degenerative disease was coming on for years and there’s no way to detect this. I’ve been talking to cardiologists all over the place and no one has devised a test to discover hardening arteries. If I had known he had the disease I would have advised him not to play football.”

Guise revealed Hughes’ parents also “died of what it appears to be heart disease.”

The Lions doctors explained that injuries Hughes suffered in an exhibition game Sept. 4 against Buffalo had required two hospitalizations and testing gave no indication that his heart was damaged. Prior to an exhibition on Sept. 26 Hughes told one reporter:

“I’ve had sharp pains in my stomach and chest and they’ve made all sorts of tests but nobody seems to be able to figure them out. I want to play though. They aren’t that bad.”

Sharon Hughes said Chuck never felt the same after the exhibition game injury.

“He then always seemed to have heartburn and was always asking for Alka-Seltzer” she says.

“It’s pretty rare and unusual to have a 28-year-old athlete die from atherosclerotic coronary heart disease” said Dr. Michael Emery co-director of the Sports Cardiology Center at the Cleveland Clinic. “If 50 years ago an athlete received the typical evaluation athletes get today significant coronary heart disease would still not likely be found because our typical cardiac preparticipation evaluations in young athletes focuses on inherited genetic heart conditions affecting the heart muscle or electrical system. It’s one thing to find coronary heart disease after the fact from an autopsy but determining that in advance would have been extremely difficult back then.

“We’ve done tremendous work in the last 50 years of lowering people’s chances of dying from a heart attack with better diagnostics — such as calcium scoring — recognizing who is most at risk modifying those risk factors and treating people with medications such as statins and lifestyle changes.” says Emery.

Trying to pick up the pieces

Two days after the game a mass was held at St. Aloysius Church on Washington Boulevard in downtown Detroit and on that Wednesday the entire Lions team and front office as well as representatives from the NFL attended the service and burial in San Antonio.

An education scholarship fund for the Hughes’ son was quickly established while letters of sympathy poured were sent to the team and the Hughes family.

By the end of the week Sharon Hughes received a personal heartfelt sympathy letter from President Richard Nixon that read in part:

“Our thoughts and those of countless fellow Americans are with you as we share your grief on your husband’s death. The tragedy that took him at such an early age is lamented by all who knew him and by countless admirers who so appreciated his skill and good sportsmanship.”

Jeff Haag a former newspaper writer in Cedar Rapids Iowa who has been working on a Chuck Hughes biography manuscript for several years was 9 years old when he watched the Lion receiver die on television.

“It always had an enormous impact on me because I didn’t have the concept of death associated with the game that I was falling in love with” Haag said recently. “It was a surreal experience. The camera close-up of Steve Owens on the sideline with his helmet off and a very worried look on his face is an image that has always stuck with me.”

The late Lions linebacker Wayne Walker told Haag in 2007 “After that day the only thing that really mattered to me was going back to the locker room with the same number of guys I’d gone out there with. Screw that ‘Winning is everything’ nonsense.”

Coaches finally began practices on that following Thursday in preparation for a Monday night game against the Packers in Green Bay. Team announced the players would wear black bands on their sleeve in memory of Hughes and that his No. 85 was retired.

In addition the Lions revealed their team physicians were creating a cardiac unit containing treatment machines and auxiliary equipment and they would be taking a portable cardiac unit to road games. In making the announcement Guise said “even if we’d have had this special equipment there considering the autopsy findings of massive cardiac damage it probably wouldn’t have been of any benefit in the Hughes case.”

In the Monday night game the Lions tied the Packers 14-14 and went on to end the season with a 7-6-1 record.

“We lost everything when Chuck passed away and it was really tough to play the rest of the season"" Greg Landry said. “We had a good team and a good record up to that point but our hearts weren’t in it after that.”

In the months following her husband’s death Lions quarterback Bill Munson introduced Hughes' widow to high-profile Detroit attorney Joe Louisell. In October 1972 two months after Louisell’s own untimely death Sharon Hughes left with a toddler to care for filed a $21.5 million malpractice lawsuitagainst Henry Ford Hospital alleging the failure to diagnose the potentially fatal condition. Two years later the suit was settled for an undisclosed amount of money after three days of testimony at a jury trial.

Now 76 Hughes is retired after working for the school system in Sheridan Texas. Her son Shane 51 is married without children and works for Capital Group in San Antonio.

However she’s disappointed that her husband's No. 85 was first reissued by the Lions in 2005 for wide receiver Kevin Johnson who requested the number. Others who have since worn the number include Tony Scheffler and Eric Ebron and this year wide receiver Tom Kennedy wears 85.

“The family has not appreciated that and we really think it should have remained retired” she said.

How does she remember her late husband?

“Chuck was a very kind congenial person who laughed a lot with a distinct giggle. He was a good husband and a good father and Shane was a delight in his life” she said.

Here's how it changed the way I think about music,"New York CNN —

Twenty years ago this weekend Apple launched the original iconic iPod. Six years later I was gifted my first and only version of the device: a third-generation iPod Nano fit with a square screen a click wheel and an engraving on the back: “Sofia Barrett Happy 11th Birthday.”

By that time the iPod line had begun its long decline from relevance. Apple had already introduced the iPhone which would become the centerpiece of its ecosystem of products and catapult it toward being the most valuable tech company in the world. But for the next five years — a key part of my teenage life — the iPod helped shape my relationship with music and technology.

If the iPod was a gateway for many customers into Apple’s hardware and software products it was also an early gateway for me into a type of consumption that we take for granted online: a seemingly limitless amount of content available the moment you want it at the tap of a button often for less than it cost in the analog era. (Though as a teenager with no job I still asked my parents for their credit cards to buy songs like “Fergalicious” and “Hot N Cold” for $1.29 a piece.)

Sure my generation had always been able to take their music with them — in my case starting with using my parents’ portable CD player in elementary school — but the iPod took that to another level. It was more transportable came in pretty colors and made it easy to listen to far more artists at a time.

But the next generation of music listening also changed how I thought about the music. I found myself caring far too much about iTunes data showing when an album was released what genre it was classified as and how many times I replayed each track. My music taste and enjoyment was all at once simplified into data points.

As I started to use my iPod and iTunes daily the data helped me understand my listening habits. On my iPod I kept an eye on the Recently Played and Top Rated playlists that came pre-programmed. On iTunes I used every data column at my disposal: last played date added number of skips and release date. It was concerning how much I parsed my enjoyment of Rihanna’s “Disturbia” into numbers as opposed to how ‘danceable’ it was. My entire music listening experience felt gamified – sometimes quite literally in the form of the ‘Music Quiz’ game on my iPod – which wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. I was curating my own experience listening to the artists I wanted on my own terms.

As my iPod replaced my skipping CD player the iPhone I got in high school replaced it. There was no need for me to carry two devices that both relied on the same music library. My iPod was laid to rest in one of my junk drawers.

But there was a clear straight line from my experience with the iPod to the streaming services like Spotify that I and many others shifted to in later years. Now the songs I wanted to hear didn’t even need to be purchased and downloaded. Suddenly I was listening to more music than I ever had before. My personal jam sessions weren’t about cherishing $1.29 singles anymore – they were about discovery abundance and choice. And above all data.

As revealing as the data on iTunes could be Spotify felt even more so. “Spotify Wrapped” one of the most viral Spotify features provides the most explicit example of this. I listened to 57777 minutes of music in 2020 which means I spent about one tenth of the entire year listening to music. I obsessively shared my top Spotify artists with all my friends almost as tangible proof of my laborious study into the history of Yacht Rock and Kanye West samples (yes they’re related.) Every Monday morning the “Discover Weekly” playlist reminds me that Spotify is analyzing my every move just as other streaming music and video services do.

Surprisingly I don’t find this invasive in any way. iTunes and my iPod have prepared me by introducing hard data into my music listening experience.

Today if a friend asks me now who my favorite artist is I would say The Strokes. But the data doesn’t lie: In 2020 my “favorite artist” was Ariel Pink according to Spotify. By simplifying my very personal music tastes into data points I may know more unbiased facts about myself. But I worry with the data and the algorithmic recommendations I’ve lost some of the romanticism and serendipity of sitting by the radio and hearing new unexpected music – between commercials – as I once did before the iPod.

The modern listening experience that the iPod helped kick off may be convenient to a fault. But nostalgia is hard to shake. I still keep my iPod in my junk drawer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlbGxhbmRnb29kLmNvbS9pbnRyb3ZlcnQtaGFuZ292ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Introvert Hangover Is a Real Thing—This Can Help,"As a Sagittarius rising I often get mistaken as extroverted—people are surprised to learn that I am in fact an introvert. One of the most common misconceptions about introverts is that we're shy and don't like people says Field Trip Health psychotherapist Mike Dow PsyD. ""Introversion may look like shyness to an extrovert—but it's really more about the energy depletion and the way they experience the world"" he explains. We just need a lot of alone time to recharge after being social whereas an extrovert thrives on the energy of other people. Like many an introvert I've woken up the morning after hanging out with people nursing both an alcohol hangover and an ""introvert hangover” exhausted from the effort of being around others.

According to Dr. Dow the concept of introversion originally focused on all the mental energy that introverts use when socializing. ""I've also seen my own introverted patients experience a depletion of physical energy when socializing too much"" says Dr. Dow. ""This is why introverts need alone time. That combination of both mental and physical energy depletion is what I would identify as the 'introvert hangover' despite the fact it's not a recognized diagnosis.""

In addition to being drained physically and mentally you can also be drained spiritually Dr. Dow says. ""I tell my patients that 'feelings are information.' Thus this introvert hangover is information that you overdid the socializing and haven't spent enough time alone in your own thoughts/within your own psyche—where introverts thrive"" he says.

An introvert hangover can leave you too exhausted to deal with people IRL and can last anywhere from a few hours to a few days or more. If you experience the latter Dr. Dow says you really know you overdid it and seriously need to prioritize some alone time. An introvert hangover can even make responding to texts feel like an insurmountable task. (Speaking from personal experience this happens even if those texts are from close friends and family.) ""If you don't have the energy to text back you know that you have really depleted your inner battery of physical/mental energy"" says Dr. Dow. ""Ask yourself: What did I learn from this experience? How can I manage my energy better next time?""

The good news is that introvert hangovers can be helped and even prevented with the right recharge methods. First up: taking some alone time. Dr. Dow suggests meditation a session of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (which is what they specialize in at Field Trip Health) gardening or time reading as means of doing so.

It can also be helpful to set up systems to explain to friends and family why you are going to be MIA for a bit. ""Don't feel guilty about this time within your own inner world” says Dr. Dow. “This is where introverts thrive. Let your closest family and friends know that you've upping your self-care game and thus are going to go into brick mode on your phone and set your away message on email when you're going into introvert recharge mode. This will save you from having to send individual texts.""

Dr. Dow also says to own your self-worth and be honest with people. ""When you're in a good space tell them something like: 'I'm being more conscious with the way I pay attention to what I need and my energy. If you ever get a brick mode text back or my flower emoji you'll know I'm recharging.'"" He adds that you can prevent abandonment and hurt feelings by making clear the time limit. ""So if your mom keeps on texting say 'Hey mom I'm in recharge mode. I'll text you back tomorrow' instead of 'I can't talk right now'"" he says. ""The former is positive and specific; the latter is negative and vague. Positive and specific communication makes relationships better—whether they're personal or work."" He adds that the person who needs a time out is the one who should come back. (Meaning: You DO have to text your mom back after the recharge time you set up.)

But there is no need to rush to recharge. ""Use the methods above until you notice your energy returning"" Dr. Dow says. As you start to incorporate them and become more aware of how much time with others is too much Dr. Dow says you can begin to make adjustments to prevent an introvert hangover from happening in the first place.

Mayor Mike Duggan seeking a third term as Detroit's mayor garnered massive donations from top executives at companies such as Quicken Loans the Forbes Company and DTE Energy between August and October. His opponent Anthony Adams however told the Free Press he will file his campaign statement on Wednesday as he wraps up tallying his contributions and spending.

The deadline to file was Friday according to the Michigan Bureau of Elections.

Records show that Adams an attorney who served as deputy mayor under former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick missed another filing deadline. He received notices to file his post-primary election report which was due Sept. 2 according to the Wayne County Campaign Finance reporting system.

Failing to file results in a fee. Records show that Adams paid the $500 fee and Wayne County then submitted a letter acknowledging the receipt of his fine. The letter also stated he still had to file his post-primary campaign finance report.

Adams told the Free Press he filed the post-primary campaign report. But the campaign statement was not reported as of Friday in Wayne County's finance system. Messages were left with the Wayne County Clerk's Office.

Wayne County also flagged anonymous contributions in his pre-primary finance statement using his committee's mailing address. Committees that receive anonymous contributions must donate them to a tax-exempt charity per Michigan campaign finance laws.

Simon Schuster executive director at the Michigan Campaign Finance Network said that candidates cannot take any amount of anonymous contributions.

""It’s a misdemeanor to accept these things"" Schuster said.

Adams said he corrected the reported anonymous contributions by adding the names of the donors. But the latest filing doesn't show marked changes.

""The names were submitted in the amended report"" Adams said.

Duggan who has faced numerous remarks from Adams about accepting corporate contributions said his opponent was legally obligated to file the report on Sept. 2.

""I've never seen a campaign where someone didn’t even file"" Duggan said.

Duggan overwhelmingly swept Adams as the top vote-getter in the August primary with more than 72% of the vote while Adams trailed with nearly 10%. The mayor raised more than $1.1 million before the August primary election between January and July while Adams raised $160575 according to campaign finance statements.

This sets Duggan at more than $1.7 million in campaign donations which includes post-primary contributions from July to August. His new donor base also grew by 40% this election cycle compared with his run in 2017 according to Alexis Wiley campaign manager.

""We've grown our new donors compared to last cycle we’ve grown our Detroit donors. What we’re seeing overall is the mayor's base of support is growing just as we saw in the primary"" Wiley said. ""When compared to the last cycle our number of Detroit donors have doubled.""

Duggan continues to shore up his campaign with donations from out-of-state contributors including real estate developers and employees from companies such as Comcast Whole Foods and Google.

Longer more frequent outages afflict the U.S. power grid as states fail to prepare for climate change

WILMINGTON N.C. — Every time a storm lashes the Carolina coast the power lines on Tonye Gray’s street go down cutting her lights and air conditioning. After Hurricane Florence in 2018 Gray went three days with no way to refrigerate medicine for her multiple sclerosis or pump the floodwater out of her basement.

“Florence was hell” said Gray 61 a marketing account manager and Wilmington native who finds herself increasingly frustrated by the city’s vulnerability.

“We’ve had storms long enough in Wilmington and this particular area that all power lines should have been underground by now. We know we’re going to get hit.”

Across the nation severe weather fueled by climate change is pushing aging electrical systems past their limits often with deadly results. Last year the average American home endured more than eight hours without power according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration — more than double the outage time five years ago.

This year alone a wave of abnormally severe winter storms caused a disastrous power failure in Texas leaving millions of homes in the dark sometimes for days and at least 200 dead. Power outages caused by Hurricane Ida contributed to at least 14 deaths in Louisiana as some of the poorest parts of the state suffered through weeks of 90-degree heat without air conditioning.

As storms grow fiercer and more frequent environmental groups are pushing states to completely reimagine the electrical grid incorporating more batteries renewable energy sources and localized systems known as “microgrids” which they say could reduce the incidence of wide-scale outages. Utility companies have proposed their own storm-proofing measures including burying power lines underground.

But state regulators largely have rejected these ideas citing pressure to keep energy rates affordable. Of $15.7 billion in grid improvements under consideration last year regulators approved only $3.4 billion according to a national survey by the NC Clean Energy Technology Center — about one-fifth.

After a weather disaster “everybody’s standing around saying ‘Why didn’t you spend more to keep the lights on?’ ” Ted Thomas chairman of the Arkansas Public Service Commission said in an interview with The Washington Post. “But when you try to spend more when the system is working it’s a tough sell.”

A major impediment is the failure by state regulators and the utility industry to consider the consequences of a more volatile climate — and to come up with better tools to prepare for it. For example a Berkeley Lab study last year of outages caused by major weather events in six states found that neither state officials nor utility executives attempted to calculate the social and economic costs of longer and more frequent outages such as food spoilage business closures supply chain disruptions and medical problems.

“There is no question that climatic changes are happening that directly affect the operation of the power grid” said Justin Gundlach a senior attorney at the Institute for Policy Integrity a think tank at New York University Law School. “What you still haven’t seen … is a [state] commission saying: 'Isn’t climate the through line in all of this? Let’s examine it in an open-ended way. Let’s figure out where the information takes us and make some decisions.’ ”

In interviews several state commissioners acknowledged that failure.

“Our electric grid was not built to handle the storms that are coming this next century” said Tremaine L. Phillips a commissioner on the Michigan Public Service Commission which in August held an emergency meeting to discuss the problem of power outages. “We need to come up with a broader set of metrics in order to better understand the success of future improvements.”

Five disasters in four years

The need is especially urgent in North Carolina a state that has declared a federal disaster from a hurricane or tropical storm five times in the past four years. Among them was Hurricane Florence which brought torrential rain catastrophic flooding and the state’s worst outage in over a decade in September 2018.

More than 1 million residents were left disconnected from refrigerators air conditioners ventilators and other essential machines some for up to two weeks. Elderly residents dependent on oxygen were evacuated from nursing homes. Relief teams flew medical supplies to hospitals cut off by flooded roads. Desperate people facing closed stores and rotting food looted a Wilmington Family Dollar.

“I have PTSD from Hurricane Florence not because of the actual storm but the aftermath” said Evelyn Bryant a community organizer who took part in the Wilmington response.

The storm reignited debate over a $13 billion proposal by Duke Energy one of the largest power companies in the nation to reinforce the state’s power grid. A few months earlier the state had rejected Duke’s request for full repayment of those costs determining that protecting the grid against weather is a normal part of doing business and not eligible for the type of reimbursement the company had sought.

After Florence Duke offered a smaller $2.5 billion plan along with the argument that severe weather events are one of seven “megatrends” (including cyberthreats and population growth) that require greater investment according to a PowerPoint presentation included in testimony to the state. The company owns the two largest utilities in North Carolina Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.

Vote Solar a nonprofit climate advocacy group objected to Duke’s plan saying the utility had failed to study the risks of climate impacts. Duke’s flood maps for example had not been updated to reflect the latest projections for sea level rise they said. In testimony Vote Solar claimed Duke was using environmental trends to justify investments “it had already decided to pursue.”

The United States is one of the few countries where regulated utilities are usually guaranteed a rate of return on capital investments. That business model incentivizes spending regardless of how well it solves problems for customers and inspires skepticism. Ric O’Connell executive director of GridLab a nonprofit group that assists state and regional policymakers on electrical grid issues said utilities in many states “are waving their hands and saying hurricanes” to justify spending that would do little to improve climate resilience.

Duke Energy spokesman Jeff Brooks acknowledged that the company had not conducted a climate risk study but pointed out that this type of analysis is still relatively new for the industry. He said Duke’s grid improvement plan “inherently was designed to think about future needs” including reinforced substations with walls that rise several feet above the previous high watermark for flooding and partly relied on federal flood maps to determine which stations are at most risk.

Brooks said Duke is not using weather events to justify routine projects noting that the company had spent more than a year meeting with community stakeholders and using their feedback to make significant changes to its grid improvement plan.

This year the North Carolina Utilities Commission finally approved a set of grid improvements that will cost customers $1.2 billion. But the commission reserved the right to deny Duke reimbursement of those costs if it cannot prove they are prudent and reasonable. The commission’s general counsel Sam Watson declined to discuss the decision saying the commission can comment on specific cases only in public orders.

The utility is now burying power lines in “several neighborhoods across the state” that are most vulnerable to wide-scale outages Brooks said. It is also fitting aboveground power lines with “self-healing” technology a network of sensors that diverts electricity away from equipment failures to minimize the number of customers affected by an outage.

As part of a settlement with Vote Solar Duke Energy last year agreed to work with state officials and local leaders to further evaluate the potential impacts of climate change a process that Brooks said is expected to take two to three years.

High costs create hurdles

The debate in North Carolina is being echoed in states across the nation where burying power lines has emerged as one of the most common proposals for insulating the grid from high winds fires and flooding. But opponents have balked at the cost which can run in the millions of dollars per mile.

In California for example Pacific Gas & Electric wants to bury 10000 miles of power lines both to make the grid more resilient and to reduce the risk of sparking wildfires. Its power equipment has contributed to multiple deadly wildfires in the past decade including the 2018 Camp Fire that killed at least 85 people.

PG&E’s proposal has drawn scorn from critics including San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo who say it would be too slow and expensive. But Patricia Poppe the company’s CEO told reporters that doing nothing would cost California even more in lost lives and property. The plan has yet to be submitted to the state but Terrie Prosper a spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission said the commission has supported underground lines as a wildfire mitigation strategy.

Another oft-floated solution is microgrids small electrical systems that provide power to a single neighborhood university or medical center. Most of the time they are connected to a larger utility system. But in the event of an outage microgrids can operate on their own with the aid of solar energy stored in batteries.

In Florida regulators recently approved a four-year microgrid pilot project but the technology remains expensive and unproven. In Maryland regulators in 2016 rejected a plan to spend about $16 million for two microgrids in Baltimore in part because the local utility made no attempt to quantify “the tangible benefits to its customer base.”

In Texas where officials have largely abandoned state regulation in favor of the free market the results have been no more encouraging. Without requirements as exist elsewhere for building extra capacity for times of high demand or stress the state was ill-equipped to handle an abnormal deep freeze in February that knocked out power to 4 million customers for days.

Since then Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Starwood Energy Group each proposed spending $8 billion to build new power plants to provide backup capacity with guaranteed returns on the investment of 9 percent but the Texas legislature has not acted on either plan.

New York is one of the few states where regulators have assessed the risks of climate change and pushed utilities to invest in solutions. After 800000 New Yorkers lost power for 10 days in 2012 in the wake of Hurricane Sandy state regulators ordered utility giant Con Edison to evaluate the state’s vulnerability to weather events.

The resulting report which estimated climate risks could cost the company as much as $5.2 billion by 2050 gave ConEd data to inform its investments in storm hardening measures including new storm walls and submersible equipment in areas at risk of flooding.

Meanwhile the New York Public Service Commission has aggressively enforced requirements that utility companies keep the lights on during big storms fining utility providers nearly $190 million for violations including inadequate staffing during Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020.

“At the end of the day we do not want New Yorkers to be at the mercy of outdated infrastructure” said Rory M. Christian who last month was appointed chair of the New York commission.

The price of inaction

In North Carolina as Duke Energy slowly works to harden the grid some are pursuing other means of fostering climate-resilient communities.

Beth Schrader the recovery and resilience director for New Hanover County which includes Wilmington said some of the people who went the longest without power after Florence had no vehicles no access to nearby grocery stores and no means of getting to relief centers set up around the city.

For example Quanesha Mullins a 37-year-old mother of three went eight days without power in her housing project on Wilmington’s east side. Her family got by on food from the Red Cross and walked a mile to charge their phones at McDonald’s. With no air conditioning they slept with the windows open in a neighborhood with a history of violent crime.

Schrader is working with researchers at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte to estimate the cost of helping people like Mullins. The researchers estimate that it would have cost about $572000 to provide shelter meals and emergency food stamp benefits to 100 families for two weeks said Robert Cox an engineering professor who researches power systems at UNC-Charlotte.

Such calculations could help spur local governments to do more to help vulnerable communities for example by providing “resilience outposts” with backup power generators heating or cooling rooms Internet access and other resources Schrader said. But they also are intended to show the costs of failing to shore up the grid.

“The regulators need to be moved along” Cox said.

In the meantime Tonye Gray finds herself worrying about what happens when the next storm hits. While Duke Energy says it is burying power lines in the most outage-prone areas she has yet to see its yellow-vested crews turn up in her neighborhood.

“We feel” she said “that we’re at the end of the line.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9qdXN0LW51dHMtb25lLXNxdWlycmVsLWNhdXNlcy1hLW5jLXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZS1mb3ItMTAwMDAtY3VzdG9tZXJzLDI3NTg2NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Just Nuts: One Squirrel Causes a N.C.

Commentary

The General Assembly doesn’t seem to understand that its job isn’t to limit women’s options for pregnancies nor to require everyone in Ohio to pack heat.

Instead Ohio’s state senators and representatives are supposed to be Brush Hogs hacking and thinning Ohio’s bureaucratic thicket. Too bad they aren’t.

A good place to start would be Ohio’s bloated K-12 bureaucracies. Ohio ranks No. 34 among the 50 states in geographic size. Ohio has 609 school districts not counting vocational districts. Texas ranks No. 2 (after Alaska) among the 50 states in geographic area. Texas has 1029 school districts according to the Texas Association of School Boards.

Thomas Suddes:Ohio Legislature's sleight of hand reaches everything from sports betting to environment

There’s a lot not to like about Texas whose Legislature makes Ohio’s General Assembly look like a chapter of Mensa. But does anyone honestly think Ohio whose population isn’t really growing needs 609 school boards?

Likewise if COVID-19 has taught Ohio anything (besides the fact vaccines don’t magnetize the human body) it’s that Ohio’s public health laws need a rewrite. Their basic framework was hammered together in 1919 by a General Assembly that rural Ohio then dominated. Health boards and their staffs should be regionalized at least which is about the best you can expect of a Legislature that thinks Ohio’s Health Department is a dictatorship in waiting.

Thomas Suddes:'Forgetful' lawmakers focus on 'magnetic vaccines' and keep quiet as Ohioans continue to pay coal plant bailouts

Then there is the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio which depending on the day of the week either plays helpless bystander when electric and gas companies raise rates or cheers them on.

Opinion:Costly debacle shows why PUCO should be reformed to protect Ohioans from corrupt utilities

The panel created just before World War I is even older than Ohio’s health boards. Its real purpose is to insulate governors and the Legislature from the consequences of pro-utility favors legislators pass and governors sign. In that respect the PUCO deserves a smidgen of sympathy for taking punches that should land elsewhere.

After all it is the Legislature not the PUCO that is sitting on major pro-consumer legislation such as Senate Bill 117 which would abolish one huge vestige of House Bill 6 the scandal-pocked nuclear power plant bailout law.

Legislators repealed some parts of HB 6 but not all. They left this part of the bill in place: Ohio electricity consumers are paying extra every month to subsidize three Ohio electric utilities that are among owners of two coal-fueled power plants one in Indiana.

House Bill 6:Lobbying push by lawyers others on FirstEnergy Solution's team detailed in filing

According to the Office of Consumers’ Counsel Ohio electricity consumers have paid American Electric Power AES/DP&L and Duke Energy more than $153 million so far in coal plant subsidies. SB 117 to repeal them is languishing in a Senate committee. The subsidy repeal’s sponsors are Sens. Mark Romanchuk an Ontario Republican and Hearcel Craig a Columbus Democrat.

Meanwhile the Legislature also is dawdling over a bill to abolish Ohio’s no-refund legal policy in instances when Ohio’s Supreme Court overturns a PUCO-approved rate boost That bill’s sponsors are Reps. Laura Lanese a Grove City Republican and Dan Troy a Willowick Democrat.

The legal rigmarole behind that rule which dates to a Cincinnati Bell rate case in the 1950s is kind of like what the British diplomat Palmerston said about a complicated German-Danish dispute: Only three people understood it he said: One died one went mad and the third Palmerston himself had “forgotten all about it.” But utilities’ lawyers haven’t forgotten the Keco case as it’s known which is why utility refunds are comparatively rare.

Any legislator who says he wants Ohio’s utility consumers to get a fair break – but won’t support the Romanchuk-Craig and Lanese-Troy bills – is being … economical … not with ratepayers’ money but with the truth.

Correction

Rep. Haraz Ghanbari a Perrysburg Republican voted “no” on House Bill 175 now in the Senate which would end Ohio’s regulation of ephemeral streams “surface water … that flows or pools only in response to precipitation such as rain or snow” the Legislative Service Commission reports.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency which answers to Gov. Mike DeWine opposes the bill as does a raft of environmental groups. My Oct. 10 column incorrectly said Grove City’s Lanese was the only House Republican to vote “no.”

The first signs can only be seen on close inspection: White dust comes off the backsheet when your fingers wipe over the back of the module. With a closer look fine cracks can be seen in the spaces between the cells and even a yellowish discoloration.

All these are indications of a backsheet film that is slowly losing its resistance to moisture. However it is not clear what will happen from here. In the best case the film will continue to chalk but this will not result in a loss of power output. In the worst case cracks develop quickly moisture penetrates the module and it needs replacement. It can no longer be safely operated. This is a danger that currently threatens many PV plants.

Lucie Garreau-Iles the technical regional manager at Dupont Photovoltaic Solutions prompted fierce opposition at the pv magazine Quality Roundtable in 2018 when she dared to predict based on DuPont field tests that almost all modules fitted with polyamide backsheets would fail over time. What seemed to some like advertising for DuPont‘s own alternative Tedlar-containing films now appears to be becoming a reality.

Particularly affected by defects in backsheet films are large solar farms in Germany dating from the solar PV boom between 2010 and 2014 when producers first introduced the then-new polyamide backsheet films.

Peter Lechner head of the PV module test lab at ZSW the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg estimates that 10 GW of modules with pure three-layer polyamide films were installed worldwide at the time.

But other types of backsheet are not immune to such defects. The vast majority of installed solar modules have backsheets composed of three different layers rather than three identical ones. Many have a layer of polyethylene terephthalate or PET at their core.

In field studies the ZSW found 12 types of film with PET cores each with an inner and outer layer comprised of different materials. These include films with an outer layer of DuPont’s polyvinylflouride (Tedlar) as well as a combination of PET core and outer polyamide film.

DuPont puts the percentage of defective backsheet films across all types in the field at 16%. That figure in the Global PV Reliability report published in 2020 is based on an examination of 3 GW of installed capacity the report found. In 64% of those cases cracks were evident in the inner or outer layers. DuPont said that in addition to polyamide a significant increase in cracks in films with polyvinylidene fluoride was of particular concern. Other defects included yellowing and delamination.

Films containing a layer of Tedlar on the other hand were very rarely affected by degradation. Overall Garreau-Iles estimates the industry is heading toward a situation in which about 5 GW of modules per year are at risk in the next few years.

Complain replace

Garreau-Iles describes a typical failure case from an eight-year-old plant in France with a capacity of 3 MW. Modules with pure polyamide backsides and modules with polyvinylidene fluoride backsheets were installed. The operator’s series of measurements on six inverters clearly showed how the insulation resistance of the modules had decreased between 2014 and 2018 said Garreau-Iles. In early 2018 water ingress occurred in around 4% of the modules. A complaint to the manufacturer was filed and modules replaced. However the new modules did not have the same power output as those replaced.

As a result the project operator had to dismount the cracked modules replace them with other old undamaged modules of the same type and form new strings from the new modules. But even that didn’t solve the problem said Garreau-Iles. Gradually more and more modules developed cracks so that the operator had to repeat the procedure three more times within two years. Only then she reports did the manufacturer agree to replace all the polyamide-backed modules.

However manufacturers usually only replace modules and rarely pay for the installation work or the loss of yield. That makes this route expensive lengthy and ties up capacity for everyone involved.

It’s even worse when the module warranty period has already expired or the module manufacturer no longer exists. Steven Xuereb director of sales and project delivery at PI Berlin reported on such a case from Italy in the same pv magazine Roundtable session. The warranty period for the 20 MW power plant had expired. The operation and maintenance service provider inspected the modules and found chalking on the backsheets of a quarter of them but had not yet discovered any cracks. PI Berlin was to determine whether cracks were to be expected and when.

Backsheet defects

Peter Lechner presented the investigation results at the PV Symposium in May of this year. Of 25000 modules from well-known manufacturers that HaWe Engineering inspected across 45 solar parks 600 were examined more closely by his team in the ZSW laboratory. While still in the field visual and thermographic inspections and insulation resistance measurements were performed. In addition the researchers used FTIR spectroscopy. This makes it possible to determine in a non-destructive fashion what material the outer layer of the backsheet is made of.

Such tests often reveal a surprising variety of materials even if the modules come from the same manufacturer and even the same factory Lechner reported. In one park for example four different types of backsheet had been installed in one project. This alone can mean damage in individual modules and not in their immediate neighbors. In addition different levels of light exposure or fluctuations in the microclimate can be responsible for individual modules being more or less affected.

In the laboratory further properties can then be determined on random samples. At the ZSW the modules were subjected to a detailed visual inspection and the power as well as the insulation resistance were measured under wetting. An elongation at break test could then be carried out on film samples. In such testing strips of the film are stretched in each longitudinal and transverse direction until they tear to measure the remaining elasticity. Peel tests can be used to determine the residual adhesion to the embedding material and finally the exact multilayer structure can be determined.

“Unfortunately park operators almost never have the material list of their modules” Lechner noted. “So we now have to make up for that with laboratory analysis.”

To evaluate the tests Lechner divided the foils into two groups. In the first group were films in which the outer layer inner layer and core are made of polyamide (AAA) and in the second films with PET cores.

The test results from modules that have been in operation for five to ten years showed that those more than eight years old and possessing backsheet films belonging to the AAA group showed significantly more torn backsheets than newer modules.

AAA-classed backsheets from modules which have been in operation for five to eight years show significantly more cracks than backsheets of newer modules. For newer PV plants at comparable locations the percentage is in the low single digits while for plants only two years older the percentage is 80% to 90% says Lechner. The pattern described by Dupont where only the damaged modules were replaced over several rounds would thus predictably result in unnecessary costs.

To identify susceptible polyamide backsheets however chalking is not a reliable indicator Lechner emphasized. For example he says there are polyamide films that do not chalk and films with Tedlar that chalk but are not expected to crack.

Stretch tear

A more targeted approach is to first use FTIR spectroscopy to determine the different backsheet-film types. “Critical film materials such as polyamide can be clearly identified by such FTIR screening even before the first damage becomes visible” said Lechner. In the next step an elongation-at-break test can then be used to determine the residual elasticity of the films on a few random module samples from which the risk of cracks occurring can be deduced.

For example in samples with a remaining elongation of up to 10% cracks had already been detected in almost 60% of the cases. In contrast modules were always free of cracks when the elongation at break was still above 30%. By comparison the elongation at break in freshly produced polyamide films is often more than 200% Lechner says. Such a sample can be stretched to three times its length before it cracks. After the five- to eight-year run however 65% of the modules using AAA-classed material reached below the critical value of 30% elongation at break.

The elasticity of PET films too the results show has significantly decreased after five to eight years. However only very few samples were below 30% and most were well above that at 70% or 100%.

In the case study described by Steven Xuereb from PI Berlin the ZSW also tested a carefully selected sample of backsheets. The experts found that the backsheet films with chalking consisted of two layers of PET and one layer of EVA (PPE). The result was worrying. Although none of the modules had yet exhibited less than 10% elongation at break 72% of the modules were between 20% to 30% elongation at break and only 28% were still above the critical mark. Even if operators are yet to face the immediate failures they must now take precautionary measures and for example set aside funds and replacement modules where possible said Steven Xuereb.

Repair procedures

At the same time however the operator can use the time to test repair options. DuPont for example has developed a process that should allow on-site repair. The company offers a Tedlar film that is bonded to the existing backsheet. Lucie Garreau-Iles said DuPont has selected the company SC-Refit as the exclusive service partner in Germany which will use suitable equipment to carry out the repair. Once repaired modules are expected to last 30 years. Trained personnel from accredited partners will be used. This should cost about half as much as replacing the modules with new ones.

According to SC-Refit the cost is €0.16/Wp for standard modules – but this figure doesn’t include module disassembly and assembly. The first customer project is scheduled to start in the next few weeks. The ZSW is also working with an industry partner on a procedure for repairs reported Peter Lechner.

Before an operator accepts such a repair they should be provided with a detailed overview of the procedure Steven Xuereb points out. Not every procedure can be transferred from the laboratory to the dusty windy and often damp field without problems. He recommended that repair examples be provided and the resistance of the repaired modules checked in the lab. A thorough inspection of repaired modules is also required advised Xuereb before reinstallation. Only long-term test results however can truly show whether the repair film harmonizes with the various film types.

Lechner added that it is also necessary to consider which defects can actually be permanently repaired by gluing over them as Dupont suggests. For example he says an internal polyethylene layer is responsible for severely yellowed films. These modules already showed significantly reduced adhesion in peel tests. Repairing the outside would probably not prevent the edges from delaminating in the long term. The same can apply to cracks in the inner film. The lab showed that ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) which is also prone to delamination had then been used for the inner layer. “In addition continuous cracks in the AAA polyamide cannot be filled by gluing over them. What longer-term risk these voids pose is difficult to assess” said Lechner.

The simple test of running a finger over the back of a module can reveal chalking and potentially signs of troubling degradation to come. But there is much complexity on closer inspection. And the decision for or against a repair solution is a difficult one to make and must be considered carefully for each project.",,,,,,,,,

Police said the dogs had been shot multiple times while they were in the water. All three dogs were pit bulls and had numerous scars which led police to believe they were being trained as fighting dogs.

Police were called about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday to the eastern boat ramp which is accessed from State Line Road. The ramp is about quarter-mile west of the New York-Pennsylvania border.

Police were called by a New York couple who were at Eaton Reservoir walking their dogs. The couple who asked not to be identified said they were hailed by a man in a kayak who told them about the dogs and asked them to contact authorities.

“We were absolutely appalled” said the man who contacted the police. “Both my wife and I broke into tears when we saw the dogs. We cannot believe that anyone could do such a thing.”

Three Pennsylvania State police troopers responded to the call. After completing an initial investigation they contacted Officer Eric Duckett who with Officer Stevie Hargenrater are associated with the Animal Cruelty/Neglect Division of the ANNA shelter in Erie. These officers work with state police on animal cruelty cases in Erie and Crawford counties

Duckett said he believes the animals were brought in from out of state. “I cover Crawford and Erie counties and I haven’t had a call about dog fights for five years” he said. Duckett also said they collected six shell casings from the scene.

Duckett asks that anyone who has any information or who noticed suspicious persons in the area to please contact him at (814) 572-5913.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXl0b25kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGF0ZS10ZW5uaXMtY2VudGVydmlsbGUtZG91Ymxlcy10ZWFtLXdpbnMtZGl2aXNpb24taS1jcm93bi1lYXRvbi1zd2VlcHMtZGl2aXNpb24taWktdGl0bGVzL0dRSldLWTMyQlZFVkRLSVZTS1VLREZESEQ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State Tennis: Centerville doubles team wins Division I crown; Eaton sweeps Division II titles,"“This” was a Division I state doubles title. Owen a sophomore and Hinshaw a junior topped Kayra Koprulu and Caroline Moritz of Magnificat 6-3 6-0 for the title at the OHSAA Girls State Tennis Tournament at the Lindner Family Tennis Center on Saturday in Mason.

One year earlier the Elks doubles team fell short in the title match. That loss was all the motivation Owen and Hinshaw needed.

“Their groundstrokes are better this year their net play is much crisper and they were more coachable this year” Long said.

The Centerville duo was tested early as they faced Magnificat’s Audrey and Natalie Smitek in the semifinals. The Elks lost to the Blue Streaks team in a third-set tiebreaker six weeks earlier. This time it was Owen and Hinshaw who came out on top 6-3 5-7 6-3 to advance to the D-I state doubles final for the second time in as many years.

Owen and Hinshaw split duties at first and second singles for most of the regular season but were ready to go at doubles as soon as tournament season got underway.

“They’re used to each other and are usually attached at the hip” Long said. “They enjoy being with each other and it shows.”

The win Saturday marked the first girls state doubles title for the Elks since 1997.

Division II

There was a lot of tournament hardware heading home with the Hitchcock family Saturday.

It was a repeat for Eaton’s Macy Hitchcock as the junior claimed the Division II state singles title for the second straight year. Hitchcock beat Alexis Nyborg of Pepper Pike Orange 6-1 6-2 in the championship match.

“It was as cool maybe better the second time” Macy said with a smile. “I showed everyone I really earned it.”

Not to be outdone little sister Mallory and partner Grace Murphy handled the D-II doubles competition. Murphy a senior and Hitchcock a freshman beat Kate and Ally Mills of Hathaway Brown School 6-2 6-1 for the D-II doubles title.

Having a two-time state champion for a big sister provided some added motivation for Mallory.

“It definitely helped me a little bit now no one can say you’re just Macy’s little sister” she said.

It was truly a family affair as their dad John Hitchcock is the Eaton tennis coach.

“Tennis is a small world but we’ve worked hard to make Eaton tennis relevant” John said.

Alter senior Grace Lampman wrapped up her high school tennis career with a third-place finish in the D-II singles competition.

Not only is there a gorgeous view of Lake Huron but plentiful & fragrant pine trees fire pit picnic table wildlife trails swimming sandy beach cool & calming lake breezes…..and the grave of a man who drowned and was washed ashore on that spot.

WHAT???

It’s true. The man was A.J. Michalowski who died here in 1865 at the young age of 26. There is an old sturdy gravestone planted there under a tree with pebbles left by visitors on top. Trinkets are sometimes left but they don’t last long.

There is even a marker there that reads: “A.J. Michalowski - Born 3-16-1839 Died 11-6-1865. Buried here in 1865 where his body washed ashore he worked at the old Oliver sawmill. He lived in Ossineke. Drowned while attempting a trip to Alpena across Thunder Bay in a small sailing craft.”

Noting the month of his death – November – it’s logical to assume “the gales of November” may have been responsible for capsizing his small boat. This marker and grave can be found at Site Number 4 in the campground in case you’re curious and would like to camp next to a dead guy.

But why all the fuss over this man? All I can do is guess. This is where his body was found so instead of moving him around and trying to locate the right cemetery to put him in they probably just planted him there with a gravestone chiseled and marking the spot where he was found.

Call it morbid cool fascinating interesting.....or just call it “the way Michigan was”. Either way it definitely does make for a unique camping experience. I wonder if any past campers have seen his spirit wandering around the campsite? Might be interesting to go and find out for ourselves.

The gallery below shows you a few photos of the area.

Research finds that eBay has been a primary driver in creating an environment for equitable entrepreneurship for women.

According to the Equitable Entrepreneurship: Empowering Women Through eCommerce report complied by eBay Main Street which monitor and participates in a variety of legislative and regulatory issues on behalf of the eBay community ecommerce opportunities on eBay have helped women deal with the economic and social challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Based on the findings of the research eBay Main Street composed an infographic highlighting key takeaways of the report including the reasons for the surge in eBay selling among women.

Women Took Up or Increased eBay Activity Because of Hardship

82% of women who began or increased selling activity on eBay during the pandemic did so because of hardship. The reasons for the female-centric hardship have been attributed to women being likelier to work in sectors hit hard by the pandemic. These industries include hospitality foodservice and in-store retail.

Motivating Factors for Selling on eBay

73% of the women surveyed for the report cited needing to earn an independent income as the top motivating factor for their ecommerce activity. 74% highlighted being able to work from home as the most important benefit of selling on eBay.

The specific reasons women increasingly turned to selling on eBay efforts during the pandemic were also raised in the report. 82% of participants said they either started to sell or increased their selling activities because of losing their jobs a reduction of income illness loss of childcare or some other hardship.

The report shows the international selling opportunities eBay provides. 97% of the women-owned small businesses on eBay export their products reaching 16 different countries on average each year.

That's precisely what Karina Bogle did.

Nearly a decade since her days as a teenage sales associate at White-Balmer Shoes in Stratford Ont. Bogle took over as owner in 2019 and pivoted to online sales at the start of the pandemic.

That pivot helped earn Bogle the Emerging Ecommerce Entrepreneur of the Year Award at eBay Canada's annual Entrepreneur of the Year Awards. Today White-Balmer Shoes continues to operate as both an online shop and as a physical location in Stratford.

Bogle shared her story with CBC Radio's Afternoon Drive. Here's part of that conversation edited for breadth and clarity.

You have a pretty long history with the company. Tell us a bit about your first exposure to the business.

I started working for White-Balmer Shoes as a sales associate during high school in 2009. That's where the development of my passion and interest for shoes started and I knew then that I wanted to stay within the footwear industry. I went to the University of Guelph and moved to Toronto after that where I worked for a Canadian shoe distributing company. I was there for about five years when Pat White and Glee Balmer the previous owners of White Balmer contacted me and let me know that they were ready to retire. I jumped at the opportunity to purchase it from them and I've had the store now for just over two years.

Did you have any idea back in high school that you would eventually want to come back later in life as the owner?

No. Not specifically here. I thought maybe I'd own some sort of shoe-related business. But as soon as I heard this it was like 'yes this is what I'm meant to do.'

You took over as owner in summer of 2019. How much of the business was being done online then?

Nothing. Nothing at all.

And in less than a year in your time as owner COVID hit. What was that like?

It was very challenging. I was just learning the ropes of owning the company and then it hit. So trying to pivot and adapt to all of those challenges was something that was very unexpected.

White-Balmer was one of many businesses that had to pivot to become an online store during lockdown. What made you decide to concentrate on eBay as opposed to focusing on building a White-Balmer webstore?

I did build a website first actually. And that was going okay. But I found that being a new website some people weren't comfortable purchasing on a site that they don't know much about. I already had some experience selling personal things on eBay so I thought 'OK I'll link our website to eBay and give that a shot.' And that has worked really well because it's a global marketplace that people know and trust and are comfortable shopping on.

We are thrilled to announce Karina Bogle as eBay Canada’s Emerging Ecommerce Entrepreneur of the Year! Purchasing the store where she worked as a teen was a major career moment but pivoting to ecommerce to keep business thriving through the pandemic has become a major career. —@eBayCanadaBiz

There's certainly a convenience in online shopping but I imagine some would say it's not nearly as personal as having the owner of the store with you as shop in-store.

That was a challenge (while the physical store was closed during lockdown). We tried to do everything that we could: we did a lot of local deliveries lots of emails sending photos and phone calls back and forth. And as online orders come in we always write little notes to the customers whether if it's special care instructions they need to know about their shoes or really just thanking them and letting them know that we really appreciate their business and choosing to shop with us.

You get $10000 as part of this award. Have you decided how you're going to spend it?

Yes a big chunk of it is going to go toward bringing new brands to the store. And I was also able to give a nice little gift to my two employees who have been so flexible and patient and understanding through the whole pandemic.

What would your advice be to any small business owner trying navigating a path for themselves during a pandemic?

I'd say just try to keep a positive happy outlook on things. I chose to be optimistic about it. And with the pandemic challenges try to pull away positive things and use it as a learning experience and jump on all the potential opportunities that you could have.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9tb25leS8xNjUxODQ2NC9yYXJlLWVycm9yLXBvdW5kLWNvaW4tc29sZC1mb3ItaHVuZHJlZHMtZWJheS_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvbW9uZXkvMTY1MTg0NjQvcmFyZS1lcnJvci1wb3VuZC1jb2luLXNvbGQtZm9yLWh1bmRyZWRzLWViYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare error £1 coin sells for £206 on eBay – how to spot one in your change...,"THAT'S MINT Rare error £1 coin sells for £206 on eBay – how to spot one in your change

A RARE £1 coin with a notable minting error has sold on eBay for £206.

Only last month a similar coin sold for almost the same price as a buyer walked away from the online auction after paying £205 for a coin with the same fault.

2 The rare coin has a minting error that means there's no silver middle Credit: eBay

2 There were 16 bids placed on the coin before one buyer snapped up the coin at £206 Credit: eBay

That fault left both coins in a distingishable state where the silver centre was missing from the design.

The coin that sold on eBay on October 3 is a copy of the new British pound that was introduced into circulation in 2017 but buyers were willing to pay over 200 times its face value due to the deisgn error.

It is supposed to have a gold coloured outer-rim (nickel-brass) and a silver coloured middle (nickel-plated alloy) as the coins are designed to be bimetallic but the error version is gold all over instead.

All that did though was drive up the price over a series of 16 bids placed by keen collectors.

The listing actually began under-value as the first bid plaed was only at 99p - 1p less than the actual denomination of the coin itself.

But it didn't take long before the auction reached triple figures and eventually sold for over £200.

The Royal Mint manufactures between three million and four million coins a day so it can be common for things to go wrong.

A whole number of mistakes can make their way onto the finished product just as one example in April showed how a rare round pound sold for £155 after an error left it with upside down writing on its side.

Meanwhile in February last year another mis-struck £1 coin was sold for £112 with an error that left the silver-coloured inner part of the pound looking like a fried egg.

Though these errors were notable and somewhat comical to collectors error coins can easily slip into your own change too and they're often overlooked as the faults can be sometimes hard to spot.

If you have a keen eye though you may be able to cash-in on the errors in your change as often sellers can get big money exchanging the collectables on sites like eBay.

Compare other rare coins on eBay to see how much they have sold for as reference and check you're not overpaying for a rare error coin if you buy one yourself.

You can get imperfect coins verified by the Royal Mint too which will let you know if your change is legitimate or not as unfortunately there are many fake coins in circulation.

Getting the coin looked at can also reassure your buyer that they're paying for the real deal - and it could push up the price too.

Online tools from change experts like Coin Hunter are helpful to see how much it could be worth too.

Plus the number of bids on the listing can help you establish that the coin is the real deal as well.

But remember that if you're selling on eBay you need to keep in mind that a buyer could pull out as well which means it won't have sold for the price that it says it has.

We will directly support efforts that enable a broad public debate about the disclosures and evidence Frances Haugen has brought to light” stated Luminate in a blog an organisation that is backing the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen. Luminate is a global philanthropic organisation with the goal of empowering people and institutions to work together to build just and fair societies. Luminate was founded by The Omidyar Group established by philanthropists Pierre and Pam Omidyar. Pierre is the founder of eBay and a well-known tech billionaire who supports a number of similar initiatives.

According to recent media reports Omidyar’s global philanthro pic organisation Luminate is handling Haugen’s press and government relations in Europe and his foundation last year gave $150000 (R2.19 million) to Whistleblower Aid the non-profit organisation that is providing Haugen’s legal representation and advice. Another prominent tech-world figure in Haugen's camp is a Harvard constitutional law professor and former Democratic presidential candidate Larry Lessig. According to media reports he is providing ""limited"" pro bono legal and communications work. Omidyar’s own network has also become increasingly involved in agitating against major tech companies. Last year his advocacy and investment group Omidyar Network distributed widely read papers laying out the antitrust cases against Facebook and Google. The group also hosted a series on whistleblowing in the tech industry in early February of this year months before Haugen came forward.

The blog by Luminate concluded with these words: “For those who are considering blowing the whistle we know that it is a difficult and often dangerous and expensive decision. That’s why we supported tech leader and whistle-blower Ifeoma Ozoma and her many partners in creating The Tech Worker Handbook a collection of resources for people “who are looking to make more informed decisions about whether to speak out on issues that are in the public interest. “We are grateful to the brave people who have called out Big Tech for its bad behaviour. They are an important part of creating systemic checks and balances for Big Tech. Because of them policymakers are taking notice and taking action to rein in their excessive power and restore trust and balance in digital markets.”"

The Bonn Chan-mentored squad completed a dominant season that saw them suffer from only two losses one regular season loss to Onic and another to Omega Esports in the playoffs.

The triumphant Season 8 conquest made Blacklist only the second team in MPL history to take back-to-back titles after Sunsparks did it in Season 4 and 5.

Despite Blacklist leading for most of Game 1 Onic held on and caught an out of position Danerie James “Wise” Del Rosario in the botlane in the 10th minute that resulted to a 3-1 exchange plus the luminous lord to balance out the game once again.

Blacklist needed to come out on top of a 23rd base turret aggression to finally take the opening win 1-0.

Onic was not to be outdone though as they leaned on Marky “Markyyyy” Capacio's (Natan) heroics in the 20th minute of Game 2 as his triple kill led to a 4-1 exchange that turned out to be the equalizer 1-1.

Blacklist then secured Johnmar “OhMyV33nus” Villaluna's Mathilda pick in Game 3 that became crucial in the early game as OhMyV33nus scored a 5-0-0 KDA by the 6th minute helping Blacklist take a 3k gold lead.

The defending champs proved steady down the stretch and scored a 14th minute wipe out to go up 2-0.

Blacklist then completed a superbly dominant Game 4 performance with a 17-0 kill rampage and finished the match in just 11mins.

OhMyV33nus (Mathilda) led the way with a 3-0-10 KDA complemented by Salic “HAD JI” Imam's (Paquito) 5-0-7 KDA.

The Season 7 champs continued their rampage in Game 5 and imposed themselves from the get go taking a 4k gold lead by the 8th minute after a 3-0 wipe.

Another 4-1 takedown in the 10th minute was the final decisive clash needed by Blacklist to take the title for the second straight season.

Limerick social influencer Sinead O’Brien is proud to announce the official launch of her new brand ‘Vacious by Sinead.’

The first product to be released from the brand will be her shapewear line ‘Vacious Shapewear’ which will be available on her website soon.

“It’s only taken me two years to make this happen but I can now proudly say that I have built the most incredible piece of shapewear that you will ever own” she said.

She also explained the meaning behind the name ‘Vacious by Sinead’ that it is an abbreviation for the phrase “Value all curves Inspire our unique self.”

So far she has only shown ‘the all rounder’ which is the first of many styles to come within the range.

“This bodysuit is designed to smooth and sculpt the tum hips and bum and give support and shape where needed” she explained.

This is the first of the Vacious Shapewear that she designed as it’s the style that she wears the most. She confessed that she’s been wearing it for months and has been dying to tell her audience.

She said “Designed from scratch by yours truly you can absolutely take it from a girl who’s fluctuated in size all her life the one thing I know and know well is shapewear!”

Her website which was supposed to launch on Monday October 4 but was delayed due to Facebook and Instagram being down launched on Tuesday October 5 so make sure to keep an eye out on her Instagram for updates!

SEPTEMBER 1 2020

Popular Limerick social media influencer Sinead O’Brien known as Sinead’s Curvy Style has recently announced the launch of her brand ‘Vacious by Sinead.’

The Patrickswell woman said “I am beyond excited to finally be sharing the words that have been so tight-lipped over the past two years.

“I never in my wildest dreams thought I’d be launching my own brand I’m so proud of what I have created.”

While the product remains a secret Sinead assured her followers that it will be announced in October and that they are currently in the middle of manufacturing.

“They say good things don’t come easy well my god this has been one hell of a process and believe me I am bursting to tell you what the first product is” she said.

The official Vacious by Sinead Instagram account reached 10k followers in under 3 hours which Sinead said took her a year and a half to reach when she first started her blog.

“To think I haven’t even said what the product is yet goes to show the incredible love and support that I have from all my followers. I thought I was excited before but now I am just mind blown” she said.

Since announcing her new brand on Friday August 27 the Instagram account has already got over 22k followers.

Sinead is not just a social influencer but also a singer model and a stylist who shares her style and life on social media daily. She has over 81k followers on Instagram and over 42k likes on her Facebook page.

She has successfully created a platform for herself where she can promote body positivity throughout Ireland.

Sinead had her first big breakthrough in the fashion world in 2012 when she won a national competition to find a new curvy model to be the Face of Tempted. This win was the birth of Sinead’s blog ‘Sineads Curvy Style’ and her modelling career took off from that point onwards.

She found herself being invited to participate in fashion shows yet finding herself at the side of the stage watching the show as there were often times where there were no clothes provided to fit her.

“I would walk in so confident and loving my curves but the shops involved in the show would let me down as they would say they had nothing for me to wear. I’d watch all the other models go out on the ramp and it was so disheartening” she said.

This inspired her to do her own events which quickly skyrocketed going from Dolan’s pub in Limerick to doing events all around Ireland.

Sinead said that she has never been more ready to take the next step into her new venture and thanked all her fans for their continued support.

Congrats Sinead! We love you and are all rooting for you! You go girl!

(October 23rd),"Team of the Week

Our Pick: Josip Iličić (86 — CF — Atalanta)

SBCs

Objectives and Misc.

Welcome to the Locker Room. Here we can talk about all of FIFA 22 's Ultimate Team mode news once a week. That includes a list of the Team of the Week cards including our chosen pick as well as the newest SBCs and the objectives for the week.Headlining the picks this week is an 86-rated version of Firmino an 86-rated Gnabry an 88-rated Szczęsny and an 86-rated version of Ginter. The star player this week is the Uruguayan right back from Getafe Damián Suárez. He is coming in at 84-rated with some pretty well-rounded stats. The unfortunate reality is that this card isn't really good enough to stand out amongst some cheaper alternatives like Carvajal. The two other standouts on this list are Barcelona's young-star Ansu Fati out on La Liga's underpopulated LW and Dortmund's CM Jude Bellingham. Look at those well-rounded stats! The boy is nearly there without the in-form. I've been using his base card for a while and it's lasted me until Division 5 so I'm thinking that one more upgrade and the boy is going to be a prime Bundesliga midfield option.The Atalanta man had to be our pick. He is a little slower than most players would like and he is playing in an unfrequented position. That means he flies below the radar of most leaving him open to bargain deals on the market. He is currently trading at around 18k. That is a joke for a guy with elite shooting passing and dribbling. Place faster players around him to do the running use a 4-3-3 False 9 or a 4-3-3 Attacking with Iličić in CAM and make sure he is drifting in available positions outside the box or is heavily involved in the build-up. The slightly slower pace of the game this year (though it has seemed faster after the last update much to my dismay) means you will do just fine with this thread of gold in your laces.This week there are plenty of great talents on offer. We have picked the currently available SBCs and priced them as per FUTbin 's amazing listings. Lens CM Seko Fofana  the Ligue 1 Player of the Month has a 160k valued card that is 86-rated. With some actually amazing all-around stats with great H/H work rates if you have the budget and can find the Ligue 1 links for him then it is probably worthwhile. For 120k you can get an Iñaki Williams card that will rock your world. The Spanish La Liga player has a Rulebreaker card and it is absolutely filthy. He's probably a great starter for now and he will later turn into a great late game bench player. If you are reading this the day of release you have a few hours to grab Nabil Fekir  too. Another La Liga player that a certain Ray Hudson might describe as ""a smooth as a nurses touch.""You will have around five days from the day this article releases to grab two objective players. The more treasured of the two players will be the Road to the Finals version of 83-rated Lille CDM Benjamin André . With dirt work rates and some dodgy technical stats though I wouldn't be putting in the effort no matter how good Lille do in the Champions League. But hey we all have a soft spot for a player (hello Hakan Çalhanoğlu!). So you will need to head to the FUT Friendly: Group Stage Glory and grab 11 assists with French players (in separate matches boo!) ten finesse goals with Ligue 1 players assist six with CDMs and win nine games. That's like two hours or more! Get outta here.A 74-rated version of French striker Randy Nteka from Rayo Vallecano in La Liga is the Silver Star for the week. So head over to the FUT Friendly: Silver Lounge and grab three wins eight goals and six assists to get your hands on him. Across the rest of FUT the Road to the Finals cards (see above) are in packs but obviously we would recommend grabbing them from the market as it is an easier and cheaper route to them. These cards will upgrade after three group-stage wins and it's one per advanced knockout round. Players like Nordi Mukiele are worth the price of admission even if they never get an upgrade so definitely consider raising the coin funds with a bit of trading if one appeals to you.

But what will you be grabbing this week? Any player taking your fancy? Agree with our Player Pick from the TOTW?

While graphics tablets are the standard tool of the trade for digital artists the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro could be considered an all-in-one package that combines the peripheral and a computer into one easily carriable device. Here's one artist's opinion on Apple's stylus and tablet and how it could impact their workflow.

I work as a full-time cartoonist illustrator and cartographer in the tabletop gaming industry. I am fortunate to have a large fanbase and a rogue's gallery of clients who keep me busy working in my home office and in the days before the pandemic I maintained a healthy travel schedule for conventions and appearances.

Back then in the ""before times"" it was fun to pack up and hop onto a plane for a long weekend — or longer for an event like GenCon. But for years I wrestled with the crushing anxiety of leaving my work behind.

Sure taking along a laptop or tablet for emails calendars and written work was easy enough. Taking along a mobile workstation for digital illustration was a bit more of a chore than holding a video call in a hotel lobby.

Add in the stress from potentially damaging expensive equipment when on the go and the prospect never made me feel at ease.

In years past we have seen the arrival of hardware from various manufacturers attempting to produce all-in-one options for digital illustrators on the go. While some came close their high price tags and fragility did not make them an industry standard so the search continued.

In a move that should surprise no one Apple ultimately delivered an alternative that answered the problem while going above and beyond: the Apple Pencil.

I know that the arrival of the Apple Pencil is not breaking news but the expanding microcosm of tools and versatility that developed around mobile digital illustration is newsworthy for digital illustrators everywhere. I recently took myself on a tour of what the Apple Pencil an iPad and software can do.

Hardware and Specs

For the purposes of this hands-on piece I used a 2018 11-inch iPad Pro and a second-generation Apple Pencil. Photoshop for iPad was used as my primary testing software given that I already have the license for it.

Setup

Setting up the iPad Pro Apple Pencil and Photoshop took minutes.

I am not exaggerating when I say that it took literal minutes. I expected the process to be more of an ordeal honestly and I was stunned by how quickly it was all set up and ready to work. If you wade into this process with a brand-new iPad there would be a little bit of extra time needed to set your accounts emails and preferences of course.

With the iPad set up I opened the Apple Pencil and prepared to go for my bronze medal in the pairing Olympics that some peripherals require only to discover that all I need do was place the magnetic Pencil into the groove along the side of the iPad and the paring process was automatic.

That was it. It took longer to open the box. Hello silver medal podium.

From there I downloaded Photoshop from the App Store signed in with my Adobe information and I was swiftly greeted by a welcome screen. Again it was mere moments.

The only thing that could slow this process down is a forgotten or misplaced password for the App Store or Adobe accounts or the need to set up a new Adobe account.

I am driving this point about speed home because in the moment of deciding to wade into the process you'll be ready in moments. Even if you're sitting in that meeting when the client would like to see a ""quick change"" or waiting for that delayed plane to board.

That matters and that time you save stacks up.

The Apple Pencil

The Apple Pencil feels and behaves like most stylus offerings associated with digital tablets.

The second-generation Apple Pencil loses the metal band and cap from the first-generation model.

The Pencil is lightweight and durable unless you are the type of person who gets buck wild when drawing with a flat edge for easier grip and gesture response features.

The battery life of the second-generation Pencil working for the time I used it in my environment lasted for hours. With every break I would place the Pencil back on the iPad for charging just in case but I had no issues with battery life not meeting work expectations.

Honestly my only quibbles with the Pencil are matters of personal preference.

The standard nib on the Apple Pencil is very very smooth with no resistance on the iPad surface. With my Wacom stylus I utilize the nibs that mimic the friction of Pencil on paper. I like that little bit of resistance and I missed it here.

In my research during the review I learned that such nibs exist for the Apple Pencil. There are also screen overlays to make the iPad feel more like a sheet of paper. I'll be testing them soon and I will talk about them here.

My second issue is with the gesture response features on the Pencil. As with the Wacom stylus I disable that feature as I tend to rotate the stylus in my hand while I work and I tire of the unwanted actions.

Again it is a personal preference and I am glad the Apple Pencil offers gesture controls for those who enjoy using them.

Software

With Photoshop open and a blank document I started with the intent of laying out a sketch for a new map I am working on soon. My only purpose here was to learn the UI and lay out a clean sketch to build on later.

This app and hardware can do so much more but this environment is new to me so I set my goal low with room to grow.

An illustration in progress on the iPad Pro.

I use Photoshop more than any other on a day-to-day basis and I hoped that I would have the most familiarity and comfort with the transition into a new workspace. I did but a learning curve still presented itself and while this is not a full review of Photoshop for iPad or Adobe's other mobile products I will offer a few thoughts on my Photoshop-on-iPad experience.

What to expect when moving from Photoshop on the Mac to the iPad

Expect to learn a new UI. The UI is clean and minimal to make the most use of the iPad real estate but there is a period of adjustment to learn how the menus behave.

Expect to adjust your muscle memory. If you bring in pressure-sensitive brushes expect to adjust their settings for the iPad/Apple Pencil space.

If you work on large digital surfaces prepare to adjust your motions on the iPad space. For example I am a full-shoulder motion illustrator ordinarily but with the iPad I had to adjust for micro wrist movements. I adjusted but it required time.

Allow Photoshop on iPad to save your work as you go.

The maximum file size for a document in Photoshop for iPad is 2GB. If you work large expect to flatten layers or make accommodations.

Pair a keyboard to your iPad to make use of the key commands and shortcuts. I initially worked purely with the UI and pencil commands and after an hour I had to pair a keyboard and use the muscle memory I have for speed and ease of use.

After an hour I had my clean sketch and I was happy with the results and overall experience. I have created other pieces with this configuration and each time I sit down with it everything is a little smoother and more refined with fewer growing pains.

Photoshop is great for this (and other design forms) but it is not the only option. With a wide range of illustration software on the market for iPads and the Apple Pencil I recommend you do your own research to find the perfect app to meet your needs. A few of the industry standards include:

Procreate - A great (and beloved) well-rounded app for creating art

Inspire Pro - A fast intuitive app for rendering realistic images and art

Clip Studio Paint - Wonderful for creating comics manga and digital paintings

Illustrator for iPad - The industry leader for vector-based art and design

Photoshop for iPad - A clean minimalist approach to the industry leader

Possibilities...

I enjoy the freedom the iPad and Apple Pencil gives me. I can sit on my patio on nice days and sketch with no issues or take the show on the road when travel and conventions return.

This was the goal for me anyway: To have a great way to enter meetings or attend conventions without an entire Pelican case of equipment to set up. I have that now.

I will not replace my Intel Mac Mini and Wacom Cintiq just yet. I can tell you that I know other professional artists who have made the jump with larger iPads Apple Pencils and their software of choice and never looked back.

It is possible to create amazing professional-quality art with this configuration. It is happening in the industry right now and based on what I have experienced here it will only get better.

When the 2018 iPad Pro shipped it didn't have some of Apple's newer inventions. Since them Apple released Sidecar for using the iPad for more Mac screen space and drawing with the Apple Pencil on the Mac and Universal Control is coming at some point in the fall.

Even thinking about that much newer M1 iPad Pro the software isn't quite as flexible for me on the iPad as it is on the Mac. So there remains a place for desktop machines and tablets to handle the larger files and complex documents.

If the trend toward beefier iPads in the Pro line continues and we see iPadOS continue to change we could see more of a shift in the years to come.

We'll be talking more about the specific tools I use to get the job done and how my workflow can adapt to the iPad in the coming weeks and months.

For small biotech companies hoping to strike a deal with larger drug developers there’s no greater destination than the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. In early January 2020 leaders from the start-up Shape Therapeutics made the annual pilgrimage to this mecca of biotechnology networking in San Francisco to make a pitch: What if you could edit someone’s genetic code without ever touching their DNA?

The biotech industry is awash in companies using tools like CRISPR gene editing to fix or turn off problematic DNA. If gene editing works it could provide a one-and-done cure. But some researchers are worried that if CRISPR slips up and cuts DNA at the wrong site the damage could also be permanent. “Targeting DNA has a lot of all-or-nothing consequences” says David Huss head of research at Shape.

At the conference Huss explained to potential partners that Shape’s solution was to edit RNA instead of DNA. Our cells constantly produce short-lived RNA molecules that convert the DNA code into functional proteins. Incredibly our bodies have already evolved an ingenious tool for editing RNA: an enzyme called ADAR—adenosine deaminase acting on RNA. The enzyme converts select adenosine (A) bases one of four letters that compose the messenger RNA (mRNA) code into another base that the cell interprets as guanosine (G). Shape was founded in 2018 on the basis of academic work showing that synthetic molecules called guide RNAs could recruit ADAR and direct it to make these A-to-G edits at precise sites.

Scientists estimate that A-to-G editing could fix mutations responsible for nearly 50% of genetic diseases. “We have a tool that can be applied to so many diseases that we couldn’t possibly do them all ourselves” Huss says. When Shape executives pitched their RNA-editing technology to the Big Pharma company Roche the two teams clicked says Sylke Poehling head of therapeutic modalities at Roche.

It was the first and last time that leaders from the two companies met in person. But as the pandemic unfolded videoconferencing between Copenhagen Denmark and Seattle kept the connection strong. In August 2021 Shape and Roche formed a pact to develop RNA-editing therapies for multiple conditions including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Two weeks later the Dutch biotech firm ProQR Therapeutics announced it had struck its own RNA-editing partnership with Eli Lilly and Company to develop therapies for liver and nervous system diseases.

RNA editing recently considered a niche research field is now an area of focus for at least a dozen companies. Although most of these companies’ initial sights are set on treating genetic diseases many are already dreaming up more creative applications of RNA editing such as introducing mutations to disrupt interactions between proteins. “The field has really started to mature over the past few years and it is really picking up steam incredibly quickly” says Andrew C. Adams vice president for new therapeutic modalities at Lilly. “We would like to be one of the first to push the science forward from a large pharma perspective.”

Making the edit

In contrast to DNA’s iconic double-stranded helix RNA molecules are often depicted as single strands of nucleotides floating inside cells without any obvious structure. But sometimes a portion of an RNA strand can loop back and pair with itself forming a double-stranded landing pad for ADAR explains Peter Beal who studies the enzyme at the University of California Davis and is working with ProQR on RNA editing therapies. At that site ADAR converts an adenosine into an unusual base called inosine—what scientists call an A-to-I edit. When translating mRNA to make proteins our cellular machinery then interprets the inosine as the more common base guanosine making the net result of ADAR’s reaction an A-to-G edit.

Scientists have devised several methods for controlling where this editing takes place but the general idea is to create a landing pad that draws ADAR to the right spot on an RNA strand. Some firms rely on the length of their guide RNA to form a large double-stranded segment of RNA that attracts ADAR. Others add a sequence to the guide RNA that folds into a 3D structure called an ADAR-recruiting domain to attract the enzyme.

Sometimes there are multiple adenosines in the landing pad and to control which one ADAR edits scientists design their guide RNAs so that a cytidine sits directly across from the target adenosine. Cytidine and adenosine don’t normally pair and the mismatch creates a bulge in the double-stranded RNA that ADAR preferentially targets. Beal and his colleagues recently discovered that using a certain artificial nucleotide in the guide RNA instead of the mismatched cytidine strengthens the RNA’s interaction with ADAR and improves editing.

Beal is excited to study how adding artificial nucleotides or chemical modifications to other parts of the guide RNA could improve editing even further. “It is going to keep us busy for a while” he says. The success of RNA-editing therapies will hinge on designing better guide RNAs an area that stands to benefit from more than 4 decades of research on antisense oligonucleotides which are synthetic single-stranded RNA molecules that bind to mRNA to stop or alter protein production.

We have a tool that can be applied to so many diseases that we couldn’t possibly do them all ourselves. David Huss head of research Shape Therapeutics

There are already multiple approved antisense oligonucleotide drugs and several firms developing new ones. Daniel A. de Boer CEO of ProQR which is developing antisense oligonucleotide therapies views RNA editing as “a new application of an existing modality” which he says helps make it a less risky investment. “All the lessons we’ve learned from single-stranded oligonucleotides can be applied” to RNA editing he adds. Paul Bolno CEO of Wave Life Sciences which has several antisense oligonucleotide programs in clinical trials agrees. “This is just a natural extension to the work we’ve been doing” he says. Lilly and Roche have research programs focused on antisense oligonucleotides as well.

Most firms including ProQR and Wave are planning to administer their guide RNAs just as they would with an antisense oligonucleotide therapy: directly into the eye for vision diseases intravenously for liver diseases and into the spinal fluid for brain diseases. Unlike CRISPR which in theory makes a lifelong change to DNA RNA editing would last only as long as the guide RNA molecules remain in the body likely on the order of weeks to months. “The reversible nature of RNA editing is a feature rather than a bug” Lilly’s Adams says. “It takes away some of the concerns we might have with a permanent edit.”

Two companies EdiGene and Shape stand out for their focus on an approach that would make RNA editing more permanent but without the risk of irreversible DNA damage that comes with gene editing. Both firms plan to use adeno-associated viral vectors to deliver into the body a set of DNA instructions that would allow cells to perpetually make the guide RNA. This would turn RNA editing into a form of gene therapy—an attractive feature to Roche which owns the gene therapy firm Spark Therapeutics. “What we liked about the Shape technology is that you don’t cut the DNA” Poehling says “but you still have a permanent effect so you don’t need redosing.”

Endless applications

Most companies are planning to assess their RNA-editing technology in genetic diseases first. “I think that is the best test of the technology in a clinical setting” Lilly’s Adams says. “There are a lot of potential diseases that we can make interesting medicines for with A-to-G switches.” Shape has disclosed a list of more than three dozen disease-implicated genes that it thinks could be addressed with its RNA-editing technology. As an example Huss points to a relatively common mutation in the kinase LRRK2 that is linked to genetic forms of Parkinson’s disease.

At least three companies—ADARx Pharmaceuticals Korro Bio and Wave—are using RNA editing to tackle alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. They want to reverse the effects of a mutation that causes the alpha-1-antitrypsin protein to misfold aggregate in the liver and damage the organ. Even if they are successful these companies could face competition from many other drug developers trying to develop treatments for the same disease with nearly every approach imaginable including small-molecule drugs protein replacement and even gene editing.

While fixing genetic mutations is an obvious starting point for the technology some people including Korro CEO Ram Aiyar are more excited by RNA editing’s more creative applications in which cleverly swapping out an amino acid in the right place can change a protein’s function and treat disease. “That’s the reason I joined the company to be completely honest” Aiyar says. “The indication space is as vast as small-molecule drug development.” Roche’s Poehling says that an “obsession” with fixing point mutations “might hold people back from really seeing the true potential of the technology.”

Roche and Shape want to use RNA editing to selectively disrupt the interactions between two proteins something that is difficult for conventional small molecules to do. The approach could allow drug developers to target proteins that are so fundamental that you don’t want to block them entirely. Although the companies are not disclosing specific targets Huss says that Shape has focused on two classes of enzymes: secretases and kinases.

Kinases activate or inactivate other proteins by adding phosphate groups to specific amino acids on the proteins. Secretases cleave proteins at specific sites to alter their function. Instead of directly targeting a kinase or secretase RNA editing could change a single amino acid on a protein the enzyme acts on. For example γ-secretase cleaves more than 90 proteins including one whose cleavage is linked to Alzheimer’s disease. In theory RNA editing could remove a cleavage site on that Alzheimer’s-implicated protein without disrupting γ-secretase’s other functions.

Transcription factors a class of proteins that turn genes on or off are also difficult to target with small-molecule drugs. In a recent presentation to investors Wave’s chief technology officer Chandra Vargeese described how the company used RNA editing to change a key amino acid to block the interaction between the transcription factor Nrf2 and its repressor Keap1 proteins implicated in inflammation and oxidative stress. A single edit in either protein could prevent their interaction and increase protective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant genes Vargeese said.

Shape and Wave have also independently discussed using RNA editing to decrease gene expression modify protein stability or alter the process of RNA splicing. Some researchers are working on using RNA editing to change the structure of sodium channels responsible for pain. Lilly’s Adams even suggests that RNA editing could be used to “engineer in protective mutations” to prevent a disease although this is not the company’s initial focus. “In the long term there is a lot of really cool stuff you can potentially do with editing but we want to cross the more proximal bridges first.”

Refining the edit

For now companies developing RNA-editing therapies are offering more promises than data. Clinical trials of the technology are likely still a year or more away and it could be at least a couple of years before any company begins human tests of RNA editing drugs.

Some companies developing RNA-editing therapies are holding back their excitement until they can evaluate data from their own studies. “The clinical applicability remains to be seen” says Judith van Deutekom chief scientific officer at Vico Therapeutics which is developing RNA-editing therapies for brain diseases. “It is still an early technology and we still need to learn a lot about it.”

For example the field is grappling with the limitations of relying on ADAR. The enzyme is picky about its surroundings and certain bases preceding or following the target adenosine can increase or decrease the likelihood that ADAR makes the edit. Scientists also can’t say for sure if our cells routinely make enough of the enzyme for RNA-editing therapies to be effective. And there’s the risk that guide RNAs may overwork ADAR and distract it from its normal duties. “Those are the things we will need to measure” EdiGene’s CEO Dong Wei says.

Studies by academic scientists suggest that guide RNAs typically spur low levels of editing in cells. Companies say they’ve boosted editing efficiency. Wave for instance says it can edit 50% of a target mRNA in monkeys but the results are yet to be published in peer-reviewed journals.

The field has really started to mature over the past few years and it is really picking up steam incredibly quickly. Andrew C. Adams vice president for new therapeutic modalities Eli Lilly and Company

Improving the therapies will rely heavily on the development of better guide RNAs. Shape is taking a high-throughput screening approach and testing 250000 to 500000 guide RNAs with unique sequences that target a single adenosine to determine which designs edit most efficiently and specifically. It then feeds these results back into its machine-learning programs to “learn more and more about what makes a good guide RNA” Huss says.

Even as the field works out the kinks of A-to-G editing some researchers are trying to expand the base-editing alphabet. For instance more than 10% of genetic diseases are caused by mutations in which an errant uridine base in mRNA prevents cells from fully making a protein. In 2011 at the University of Rochester Medical Center Yi-Tao Yu discovered a way to convert those errant uridines into a similar base called pseudouridine which restored protein production. The approach uses a guide RNA to direct an enzyme called pseudouridine synthase to make the edit at specific sites.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20va3lyc3Rlbi1zaW5lbWEtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWwtZ2lhbnRzLWNhbXBhaWduLWRvbmF0aW9ucy1kcnVnLXByaWNlLXJlZm9ybS0yMDIxLTnSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2t5cnN0ZW4tc2luZW1hLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2FsLWdpYW50cy1jYW1wYWlnbi1kb25hdGlvbnMtZHJ1Zy1wcmljZS1yZWZvcm0tMjAyMS05P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kyrsten Sinema stands with pharma giants as drug price reform stalls,"In this July 16 2019 file photo Senate Security and Governmental Affairs Committee member Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema's campaign has received $500000+ in campaign donations from the pharma industry.

The $3.5 trillion spending bill would save the US ""hundreds of billions"" on health care spending.

The biotechnology company Amgen gave Sinema $25500 and is one of her largest financial backers.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona is said to be opposed to the current prescription drug pricing proposals in bills put forth by both the House and Senate as well as an alternative from House centrists that would limit the drugs subject to Medicare negotiation according to unnamed sources cited by Politico.

Sinema's stance has stalled the passage of the $3.5 trillion spending bill crafted by the Biden administration and fellow Democrats even though it could jeopardize her own bipartisan infrastructure bill. Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington has previously said the majority of the Congressional Progressive Caucus which she chairs would not vote for Sinema's infrastructure bill without first passing the spending package.

If passed the $3.5 trillion spending bill would lower the cost of certain prescription drugs by instituting reforms and allowing Medicare to negotiate prices which would save the federal government ""hundreds of billions"" on health care spending according to a memo for Democratic senators.

Sinema is a ""pharma favorite in Congress""

Since launching her political career Sinema's campaign committee has received more than $500000 in donations from the pharmaceutical and health product industries according to OpenSecrets.

Kaiser Health News dubbed Sinema a ""pharma favorite in Congress"" after her campaign received $98500 from PACs run by employees of drug companies and their trade groups during the 2019-20 election cycle.

One of her largest financial backers has been Amgen a biotechnology company that manufactures prescription drugs for individuals with illnesses that have limited treatment options such as cancer patients and chronically ill individuals.

Insider reached out to Sinema and her team but has not received a response.

Many prescription drugs made by Amgen have hefty price tags. Overall the company made $24.24 billion in global product sales in 2020.

Amgen did not respond to inquiries about whether it lobbied Sinema on prescription drug pricing reforms or how the bill's passage would impact the company's bottom line. In 2021 Amgen has spent $4.72 million on lobbying Congressional representatives over 17 bills the majority of which address issues related to prescription drug pricing according to OpenSecrets.

A super PAC with pharmaceutical industry ties funded a recent Sinema ad

According to Google's Transparency Report a September 9 political ad for Sinema was paid for by Center Forward a super PAC dedicated to supporting the election of centrist Democrats according to The Washington Post.

In its registration with the Washington DC Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Center Forward lists Libby Greer and Cindy Brown from the lobbying firm Forbes Tate Partners as governors on its board. Greer and Brown are lobbyists for several pharmaceutical companies including Bayer Gilead Sciences Eli Lilly Novartis Amgen and Merck & Co according to documents obtained by the Daily Poster and reviewed by Insider.

Greer and Brown did not respond to inquiries about the scope of their involvement in the Sinema political ads. Center Forward Executive Director Cori Kramer Smith said that day-to-day activities programming and messaging do not fall under the board's responsibilities.







Merck was the second-highest pharmaceutical industry contributor to Sinema's campaign donating $20500 to her campaign committee and leadership PAC between 2015 and 2020 according to Kaiser Health News' ""Pharma Cash to Congress"" tracker.

Eli Joseph the husband of Sinema's chief of staff Meg Joseph worked as the executive director of federal policy and government relations for Merck & Co. from 2012-2015 according to his LinkedIn. Meg Joseph's LinkedIn also shows that she worked as a lobbyist from 2007-2008 at Clark & Weinstock which lobbied on behalf of several pharmaceutical companies and major industry trade groups during her tenure Salon reported.

Neither of the Josephs responded to inquiries about their previous work as lobbyists or connections to the pharmaceutical industry. Merck spokesperson John Cummins said Eli Joseph handled Senate affairs and was not involved in decisions surrounding House contributions.

In addition to Sinema four House Democrats are also opposed to direct government negotiation of drug prices. Reps. Scott Peters Kurt Schrader Stephanie Murphy and Kathleen Rice voted against advancing a drug-pricing provision on September 15 although it would be approved later in the day by the Ways and Means Committee the Los Angeles Times reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNDM4OTc1L2FudGlwbGF0ZWxldC1kcnVncy1tYXJrZXQtaW5jcmVhc2luZy1pbmNpZGVuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antiplatelet Drugs Market - Increasing incidence,"Antiplatelet Drugs Market - Increasing incidence of cardiovascular diseases is expected to drive growth of the antiplatelet drugs market

Recent Articles:

This newsletter issue takes a look at value stocks compared to growth stocks and makes an argument for at least a mild resurgence of value performance. It also provides an update on the current inflation situation particularly for housing.

Value Stocks: Not Quite Dead Yet

Sentiment on value stocks and value investing is still near a historical low point.

With about 90 years of data value stocks have historically outperformed growth stocks in aggregate although not in every decade.

In particular this past 2010s decade has been crushingly in growth stocks’ favor and it hasn’t been close. The mega-cap internet stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) Apple (AAPL) Amazon (AMZN) Facebook (FB) Alphabet (GOOGL) Netflix (NFLX) Salesforce (CRM) and a host of other growth companies like Visa (V) have been the main drivers of US stock market and indeed global stock market performance as most value sectors lagged badly and chopped sideways for much of the decade.

That trend differs significantly from multiple previous decades where an investing approach that leaned towards buying out-of-favor stocks did better. This past decade was a particularly brutal one for value investors and that fact has been well-known for years.

This long-term chart shows the Russell 1000 Value Total Return index divided by the Russell 1000 Growth Total Return index. When it’s going up it means value stocks in aggregate are outperforming and when it’s going down it means growth stocks in aggregate are outperforming.

That particular chart relies on FTSE Russell’s metrics for what constitutes a value stock vs a growth stock. In truth there is no firm definition between the two other than that value stocks tend to be cheaper slower-growing companies that often pay a dividend and return capital to shareholders while growth stocks tend to be more expensive and faster growing and are still reinvesting heavily into their business.

As the chart shows 1) value stocks outperformed for much of the 1980s leading into the savings and loan crisis 2) growth stocks outperformed for much of the 1990s leading into the dot-com bubble 3) value stocks outperformed for much of the 2000s leading into the subprime mortgage crisis and 4) growth stocks outperformed for much of the 2010s leading into the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent fiscally-driven inflationary reversal. The two factors growth and value went in big cycles as economic bubbles and monetary policy shifted around and ultimately ended with excesses each time.

Looking back at the past three years we see that the ratio of value to growth stock performance bottomed in 2020 and started to turn up after lockdowns eased and vaccines were announced. It then had a correction again in 2021 to a higher low in part due to the Delta variant and fiscal spending slowdowns but now is now seemingly back in an uptrend with energy stocks and financials holding up pretty well:

I’m watching to see if it holds this trend or not. Recent years have been full of people making “growth to value rotation” calls but this one has been in place for a while and came with a recession and a rather fundamental shift in fiscal and monetary policy which is when most major value/growth rotations occur.

If we want to go back more than the four decades that Russell has data for here’s a great chart. It shows the rolling 5-year return differential between value and growth stocks from the early 1930s to 2020. When it’s green (positive) it means value stocks have outperformed over that period and when it’s red (negative) it means growth stocks have outperformed:

Chart Source: Michael Lebowitz Real Investment Advice

Value stocks outperformed during 82% of rolling 5-year periods according to that data set but the 1930s and the 2010s were major exceptions where growth stocks outperformed by large and persistent gaps.

Anyone who has followed my work for a while knows that I regularly use the 1930s/1940s analogue to describe the 2010s/2020s economic situation at least in terms of fiscal and monetary policy and the long-term debt cycle. History doesn’t repeat but it does rhyme. The disinflationary 2010s were very similar in many ways to the disinflationary 1930s and the inflationary 2020s are shaping up to be similar to the inflationary 1940s.

This is one of the set of charts among several that I’ve used in my research pieces to show the similarities between those two periods:

Some analysts don’t like that comparison and no analogue will ever be a perfect fit but I find that it provides tremendous context for understanding this unusual market environment. It allowed investors to anticipate major stimulus and inflation in response to the 2020 crisis. A lot of investors say this type of economic environment is unprecedented whereas the truth is it’s just unprecedented in developed markets in our lifetimes. There is historical context for situations like this and then it becomes our job to find the details for how it differs from those otherwise eerily-similar periods. I can’t imagine trying to make investment decisions in this environment without at least having studied that similar period.

It’s not too surprising that the value/growth equity performance differential shows a similarity between the 1930s and 2010s as well. During both eras a massive credit bubble popped and economic growth stagnated for the better part of a decade with interest rates held near zero. Growth stocks significantly outperformed value stocks during those decade-long stagnations as economic growth was weak commodity prices were low bank credit was contracting and investors piled into whatever growth stocks were available.

In the 1930s that state of affairs persisted until the early 1940s when policymakers were basically forced by external catalysts (total war) to do massive monetized fiscal stimulus and to hold rates low despite the high inflation that all of this spending caused. Similarly in the 2010s that state of affairs persisted until the early 2020s when pandemic lockdowns hit a highly-leveraged economy with millions of people living paycheck to paycheck putting policymakers in a position to either massively stimulate or watch a widespread debt collapse happen. And just like the 1940s even as inflation began running hot policymakers have so far kept interest rates low in the 2020s.

As we head deeper into the 2020s I do expect value stocks to catch a stronger bid than they did in the 2010s. Much like how they did in the 1940s. There are some headwinds against that idea like the constant flows of capital into passive index funds that make up a large portion of the equity market. These funds buy based on market capitalization and thus inherently have a large-cap growth momentum strategy. But overall I think the trend is worth watching to see if it overcomes these opposing forces.

Let’s break down how that could happen. This chart shows the S&P 500 sector distribution since 1975:

Image Source: @Rob_Hager

The energy sector is coming back up off of its lowest-ever 2% contribution to the index but still remains extremely low at 3%. I think that sector could double to 6% or more over the next decade after a strong period of outperformance going forward and it will have paid out above-average dividend yields during that journey as well. I wrote about my bullish view on oil and gas this past summer and indeed this autumn we’ve been seeing energy shortages in Europe and rising energy prices everywhere. I think that trend will have dips and surges but that it will persist deeper into the decade. Materials and financials could each increase by a point or two and healthcare could certainly represent a bit more more than it does now considering the world’s aging demographics.

In contrast the technology and consumer discretionary sectors are the growth-oriented areas that could see a relative reduction in weighting into those other areas mainly due to their valuations cooling off a bit. Technology will obviously be a big part of the future as it always is but the valuations placed on tech stocks can change over time and the existing large-cap set of tech stocks are already in their mature business phase (trying to maintain their established moats against competition and regulatory pressure rather than rapidly innovating generally speaking). While it’s not exactly a “tech investment” I continue to prefer a sizable bitcoin allocation over any specific tech stock and I continue to monitor the rapid innovation in that ecosystem via the Lightning network in particular as well as other areas of the ecosystem.

Importantly if value stocks in aggregate do outperform growth stocks (still a big “if” at this point) it could take a few different forms. Both factors could have positive returns with value doing better than growth. Or the value factor could have positive returns while the growth factor has negative returns. Or both could have negative returns with the value factor doing less poorly between the two.

I lean somewhat towards the middle option but there is a lot of variance that can happen based on policy choices and other variables. Overall I like to analyze individual stocks rather than rely on broad growth ETFs or value ETFs because I want to isolate inexpensive stocks that nonetheless have a relevant product or service that is not being disrupted by new technology.

Lastly we can separate “cyclical value” from “defensive value” sectors. Topdown Charts has a great chart on this subject from earlier this month where they classify the energy and financials sectors as being cyclical value and healthcare consumer staples and utilities as being defensive value. The chart compares those two groups separately to the S&P 500. This gives much resolution on how they performed over time:

Overall some level of mean reversion from the financial sector and especially the energy sector over the next 5-10 years from this low place interests me as a significant possibility.

Interest Rates and Equity Valuations

A lot of people refer to the US stock market being overvalued. And indeed it is trading at historically high valuations by most metrics. With bank accounts and Treasuries yielding below the prevailing inflation rate for a while investors have basically monetized stocks and used them as a store of value wherever possible.

The equity market capitalization to GDP ratio for example reached record highs in recent years at over 200%. Long-term interest rates are in red since that’s an important variable as well:

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

Stock valuations in the United States have benefited from a four-decade long bond bull market (i.e. lower and lower Treasury yields). As bonds offered lower and lower yields it presented a lower and lower discount rate for valuing companies meaning that an investor could justify paying up for higher stock valuations since her risk-free opportunity cost primarily consisted of low-yielding bonds.

And as I described in my summer article on the subject a period of rising yields tends to hurt growth stock valuations if they start the period at very high valuations. Growth stock valuations have been the primary beneficiary from lower yields.

The 2000 dotcom-bubble was somewhat of an anomaly on the stock valuation vs interest rates chart above as valuations briefly reached very high valuations even while Treasury-rates were moderately high. That was a particularly excessive period of stock market euphoria. Besides that unusually high valuation spike we can see on that chart above that the 1980-2020 structural trend was for lower and lower interest rates and higher and higher equity valuations.

If inflation remains sticky at 3-6% or more for a while then 10-year Treasury yields could very well try to keep pushing up from current super-low levels. Their yields are currently far below the inflation rate which has only happened a few times in the past sixty years:

While I don’t think Treasury yields will be allowed by Fed to reach too high (and indeed I expect negative inflation-adjusted yields for most of the Treasury curve to exist for a long time) I also don’t necessarily think the 10-3 yield curve (the difference between the 10-year Treasury rate and the 3-month Treasury rate) has reached its maximum steepness for this cycle yet:

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

I don’t have a particularly strong view on where Treasury yields will end up for the cycle (as that is partially a political decision by policymakers). The longer-term story however is that global developed market interest rates are around zero and likely can’t go much structurally lower and are more likely than not to start grinding sideways for a while and will be negative in inflation-adjusted terms.

A steeper yield curve benefits bank stocks which also have some of the strongest balance sheets they’ve had for decades (a stark contrast to their balance sheet composition in 2007). And the inflationary conditions that push up yields tend to benefit energy and materials stocks or even more directly are often driven by these sectors. These are all value sectors.

Here’s a chart I put together back in May 2021 showing 5-year rolling expansion or contraction in the oil price and the consumer price index over the long run:

On the other hand high inflation and widespread supply chain problems can hurt the profit margins of many companies and a higher long-duration Treasury yield if we get that would likely put pressure on the high valuations of growth stocks.

Apple vs CVS Health

Apple (AAPL) for example is projected by consensus analyst expectations to have a lousy forward two years of EPS growth after its monstrous 2021 growth which makes its current 26x price/earnings ratio and $2.3 trillion market capitalization at least slightly uncomfortable:

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

In contrast CVS Health (CVS) is projected by analysts to have slightly faster EPS growth than Apple over the next two years but the stock is trading at less than half of the earnings multiple as Apple. I’m not saying they should have as high of an earnings multiple as Apple (or that analysts are necessarily correct about the next two years of EPS performance) but I also don’t think the earnings multiple gap going forward should remain quite as wide as it is.

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

One thing I like about CVS is that after their major acquisition of Aetna they prioritized the company around using those greater total cash flows to pay down debt and improve their financial position. Meanwhile Apple still has a strong balance sheet but continues to increase its net debt level.

In many ways Apple already transformed into a value stock because its growth slowed and it began focusing on financialization. But unlike other value stocks Apple stock is rather expensive partly because of the 2020/2021 growth spurt in its earnings and partially because investors are optimistic on its ongoing shift from hardware revenue to ecosystem service revenue.

Cadence Design vs Enterprise Products Partners

An example I’ve used before is Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) vs Enterprise Products Partners (EPD). It’s one of my go-to examples because they are both very high-quality companies for their industries. Cadence provides software for designing electronic and computer systems and switched towards a SaaS model that has benefitted them greatly and justified a higher valuation to some extent because the cash flows are more reliable. Meanwhile Enterprise is a large and diversified transporter of natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil and petrochemicals.

Cadence is expected to have decent growth over the next couple years after a recent multi-year period of rapid growth from converting to the SaaS model but is already trading at a 50x earnings multiple. That valuation is somewhat of a liability if 10-year Treasury rates ever move back up from current historically low levels. Software-as-a-service companies are very attractive investments and justify high valuations but even those valuations have a limit when the PEG ratio is 4x or 5x.

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

Meanwhile there is a global energy and petrochemical shortage occurring and Enterprise has the wide-moat physical infrastructure to transport and export some of these things. It is trading at a historically low valuation and has a historically high (and well-covered) distribution yield of 7%+ that it has grown for 23 consecutive years while its balance sheet ironically carries a slightly higher S&P credit rating than Cadence has.

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

Again Enterprise shouldn’t have the same valuation as Cadence but it seems that investors are piled quite tightly onto one side of the ship towards growth here. Going forward when factoring in the distributions Enterprise is more appealing to me than Cadence in terms of the probability of providing good forward total returns.

Microsoft vs EOG Resources

I’m a fan of Microsoft (MSFT) stock have owned it for years and still do. But with a staggering $2.3 trillion market capitalization and with a price/earnings ratio in the high 30s it should be quite hard for Microsoft to match its past five years of performance with the next five years unless consensus analyst expectations are way too bearish:

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

Meanwhile energy producer EOG Resources (EOG) is generating great cash flow has radically improved its balance sheet to the strongest financial position it has ever been in and yet its stock price still trades rather cheaply compared to its earnings at current energy price levels:

Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

The Microsoft/EOG total return performance ratio chart is pretty interesting. It feels like we’ve been here before:

Microsoft radically outperformed in the 1990s up to its peak dotcom-bubble valuation. Then in the 2000s its valuation popped while oil entered a massive bubble of its own. After that in the 2010s oil entered a long bear market and Microsoft rose like a phoenix to outperform many competitors with a transformation towards software-as-a-service and cloud computing and it once again crushed EOG in terms of gains with the performance ratio having an accelerated blow-off top as the stock stocks entered into the pandemic lockdown recession of 2020 and sharply diverged.

But since then EOG is gaining on Microsoft again from that bubble peak (purple line going down). I still think that trade has more to go in EOG’s favor before the dust settles even though it could take years to play out.

Overall these are just some examples of things I’m looking for in the market. The value factor has put in a pretty clear reversal from growth stocks over the past year but the continuation of that reversal is by no means assured. Comparative valuations further justify an allocation to value stocks although growth stocks do have a tendency to surprise to the upside especially in recent years. I like both in my portfolio but prefer value stocks at current levels overall.

Portfolio Updates

I have several investment accounts and I provide updates on my asset allocation and investment selections for some of the portfolios in each newsletter issue every six weeks.

These portfolios include the model portfolio account specifically for this newsletter and my relatively passive indexed retirement account. Members of my premium research service also have access to three additional model portfolios and my other holdings with more frequent updates.

I use a free account at Personal Capital to easily keep track of all my accounts and monitor my net worth.

M1 Finance Newsletter Portfolio

I started this account in September 2018 with $10k of new capital and I put new money in regularly. Currently I put in $1000 per month.

It’s one of my smallest accounts but the goal is for the portfolio to be accessible and to show newsletter readers my best representation of where I think value is in the market. It’s a low-turnover multi-asset globally diversified portfolio that focuses on liquid investments and is scalable to virtually any size.

I chose M1 Finance because their platform is commission-free and allows for a combo of ETF and individual stock selection with automatic and/or manual rebalancing. It makes for a great model portfolio with high flexibility. (See my disclosure policy here regarding my affiliation with M1.)

And here’s the breakdown of the holdings in those slices:

Changes since the previous issue:

I haven’t made many changes to the portfolio recently. I slightly reduced Cameco (CCJ) in favor of some Sibanye-Stillwater (SBSW) replaced Exxon Mobil (XOM) with EOG Resources (EOG) and replaced Home Depot (HD) with PulteGroup (PHM).

Other Model Portfolios and Accounts

I have three other real-money model portfolios that I share within my premium research service including:

Fortress Income Portfolio

ETF-Only Portfolio

No Limits Portfolio

Plus I have larger personal accounts at Fidelity and Schwab and I share those within the service as well.

Final Thoughts: Rent and Wage Inflation

Until 1983 the consumer price index included housing prices as part of the basket. Then housing prices were removed from the index since they are a capital asset rather than a consumer asset but their influence remains in the index as “owner’s equivalent rent” which is a way to try to quantify the rising cost of shelter without including house prices directly. By extension this cost of shelter indirectly includes interest rates since if a house goes up in price but the mortgage interest rate is lower the monthly payment can remain relatively stable.

Back in summer 2021 I noticed that rent CPI was forming a bottoming pattern and this is something I’ve been keeping an eye on and reporting on occasionally since then. Here is an excerpt from my July 2021 newsletter:

As we head into the autumn a third inflation variable to watch is likely to be rent prices. This recent spike to 5.39% official year-over-year broad price inflation occurred at a time when year-over-year rent increases which are one of the biggest components of the inflation basket were on the downtrend to below 2%. Now however rent year-over-year inflation is showing a potential bottom: Chart Source: St. Louis Fed Owners’ equivalent rent (which is the government’s indirect way to include housing costs in the CPI calculation without including the home price itself as a capital asset) historically follows the prices of homes with an 18-month lag: Source: Jeroen Blokland With the rate of rent inflation seemingly bottoming and rolling up now with eviction moratoriums coming to an end and with high housing costs an uptick in rent and owner’s equivalent rent appears set to provide the next round of overall price inflation to keep the broad CPI number somewhat elevated. -Lyn Alden July 2021

Well as of September 2021 data (reported in October) both owners’ equivalent rent and rent itself as part of the official CPI basket have formed a clear trend up in rate of change terms for several months now.

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

Data from Apartment List suggests that these measures still have some catching up to do against the on-the-ground numbers. They have a great chart from last month showing the pre-pandemic rent price trend vs what actually happened in 2020 and 2021:

Chart Source: Apartment List

During 2020 rent prices were flat-to-down under their historical trend. Rent moratoriums and considerable economic uncertainty were themes of that year. However in 2021 rents have sharply risen to levels well above their historical trend.

The combination of rent and owner’s equivalent rent make up about 30% of the headline CPI basket so this move is meaningful. This is likely to keep headline inflation rather elevated for another couple quarters at least along with whatever happens with the rest of the basket of goods and services in the index.

This rising cost of housing necessitates higher wages for workers if they are going to keep up with that. This contributes to ongoing labor shortages and should lead to higher wages which if companies want to try to preserve their profit margins means raising prices on their products and services as well.

The Atlanta Fed Wage Growth tracker shows how low wage growth was during the 2010s decade which contributed to the disinflationary trend of that period. If annual wage growth starts consistently moving over 4% (which is pretty important considering that official headline price inflation is 5.4%) that should be another contributor to higher consumer prices.

Chart Source: Atlanta Fed

It will be interesting to see how the bond market reacts to that and something to keep in mind when making investment decisions. I continue to view the 2020s decade as likely being a significantly more inflationary decade overall than the 2010s decade although it won’t be a straight line.

The offer of €480 per share comes a little over two weeks after H&F increased its cash bid from €460 to €470 per Zooplus share matching an offer made by EQT earlier in the month. The latest offer represents an 85% premium to the company’s three-month volume-weighted average.

Stefan Goetz a partner at H&F and Johannes Reichel head of EQT’s advisory team in Germany said in a joint statement that the decision resolved a deadlock in the tender process and enabled the continued pursuit of the investment. KKR had also been in talks to acquire the Munich-based company but dropped its bid in September.

Zooplus was founded in 1999 and sells its products in 30 European countries. In its half-year report the company said it was benefiting from the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged more Europeans to get a pet. The number of new dog registrations in Germany increased in June 2020 by 25% year-on-year according to the report.

Other PE firms are tapping into this trend. Last month for example CVC Capital Partners reportedly reached an agreement to buy Medivet a UK chain of veterinary clinics owned by Inflexion Private Equity in a deal worth more than £1 billion (about $1.4 billion).

There are now over 65 members in the group and new people are joining every week according to the founders in just one sign of how much more seriously investors are taking what’s known as data-driven deal sourcing.

“VCs back innovation but they also need to keep innovating themselves to stay competitive. VCs are realising that data is an edge and that’s why we are seeing more funds investing in data and research teams to make sense of it” say Francesco Corea head of research at Balderton and Sarah Guemouri an Atomico senior associate two founders of the group.

Data-driven deal sourcing — essentially trying to find companies to invest in by looking at data for signs of growth and traction — is not new. But it is growing and many of the group’s members are the first hires that their companies have made in data.

Investors also say that there is a growing consensus that Europe is a particularly fertile ground for developing new techniques.

“The cultural and geographic distribution of the region especially lends itself to [data-driven sourcing]” says Mike Arpaia a computer scientist and partner at Moonfire Ventures. “It’s a really interesting way that European venture can differentiate itself from US venture.”

What is data-driven sourcing?

Data-driven sourcing is about using signals about talent and companies to find and engage with startups before the competition. Those signals might include an ex-Deliveroo founder changing their LinkedIn status to “stealth” suggesting they’re working on a new company or a startup starting to aggressively hire salespeople suggesting there is demand for their product. That’s different from methods that VCs have traditionally used to scout founders such as personal referrals.

Those signals can be harder to track across Europe than in the US and investors say that it is harder to track company data across countries. One common gripe is how founders in many eastern European companies record their headquarters as being in the US making them harder to spot.

But investors say that despite the difficulties of data gathering in Europe it’s worth it to keep up with the increasing number of active firms. There are about 200 investors making five or more investments in Europe yearly up from 183 in 2016 according to Dealroom.

Europe's data sourcing origin story

A few European VCs have been pioneering the data-driven sourcing playbook for years. These include Sweden’s EQT Ventures Earlybird in Germany and InReach Ventures in the UK.

When EQT Ventures partner Ted Persson dials in to chat to Sifted about the company’s internal data and machine learning platform Motherbrain he’s wearing a black Motherbrain hoodie a souvenir from a recent team offsite. The fact that the 20-person Motherbrain team has swag says it all.

One common gripe is how founders in many eastern European companies record their headquarters as being in the US making them harder to spot

“The core of it is a bespoke tool for a data-driven investment workflow” he says. “It's kind of like CRM like but it's not a CRM because a CRM is manual and it's not smart.”

Since launching Motherbrain in 2016 EQT Ventures has invested €150m in 14 companies sourced by the platform. Persson says that Motherbrain excels in identifying companies outside major tech hubs and in identifying the best time to engage with a founder.

Motherbrain also goes further than simple data scraping. Because the team enters all investment decisions and interactions into the platform Motherbrain can suggest companies that investors should investigate. The team has a Slack channel to share “spooky” stories about how accurate Motherbrain’s suggestion can be.

A data-first future

The new generation of data-driven sourcing is being driven by younger firms putting data first. One of those is Moonfire founded by European tech veteran Mattias Ljungman. Arpaia the computer scientist says he was the company’s first hire after Ljungman himself.

“I like to say we're a technology company that does venture rather than a venture capital firm that uses technology” he says. “We're building bionic suits for investors like civil infrastructure that investors can use to make themselves 10 times or even 100 times more efficient.”

Firms are also working with alternative data providers to find new data signals. One of those companies is Specter which tracks billions of data points about companies and talent. Cofounder Marco Squarci says the firm has more than doubled its client base over the past year.

Squarci says many younger smaller firms are looking to leverage Specter to manage an increasing number of competitors at the earliest stages especially if they don’t have the resources to build an engineering team in-house. “Knowing on week one or day one makes the difference between getting into the deal or not” he says.

Data-driven sourcing and diversity

But some investors worry that reliance on data signals will only strengthen bias against founders who haven’t traditionally had access to capital. For example if investors are tracking founder-alumni from successful tech companies they’re likely to be men. And that’s even more difficult in Europe where GDPR makes it tricky to collect data on diversity beyond gender.

Eva-Valérie Gfrerer of Berlin quantitative VC MorphAIs believes that data and machine learning can actually tackle bias if used in the right way. Her background is as a behavioural scientist and she also counts mathematicians statisticians machine learning and psychology specialists on her team.

“We start with formulating plausible assumptions for example the ability to found a successful company is independent of gender” she says. “Then we collect evidence in the form of data to support this knowledge and formulate actions to induce this knowledge into the models. This is how we get investment recommendations that are less biased.”

I like to say we're a technology company that does venture rather than a venture capital firm that uses technology. We're building bionic suits for investors

Diversity is also on the agenda at EQT Ventures’s Motherbrain. Persson says they’re “actively adding features to dial-up underrepresented groups” which could include separate funnels for underrepresented founders or tweaking what investment suggestions Motherbrain offers.

Sometimes improving diversity also just starts with collecting data on the portfolio. The VC arm of Canadian pension plan Omers launched a survey across the global portfolio last year and got responses from over 1000 employees. “The survey was done in compliance with GDPR so for the UK and Europe the questions we asked were scaled back to include only those allowed under current regulations” the firm says.

What’s next?

So when every VC knows the best ways to scrape LinkedIn or track app downloads will data-driven sourcing give anyone an edge?

Thomas Marsal at France’s Ring Capital says that data on startups will be a commodity in “three to four years” for investment funds. Marsal’s role includes working on the Ring App a tool to collect internal and external data on companies and decisions — to hopefully make better investments.

“How we will continue to be competitive is by using our data for things like market intelligence and ecosystem management. Our data can also be helpful for our portfolio companies to help them find business opportunities or help them find people to hire” he says. “Finding the right use cases with data for investment funds will always be a way to differentiate.”

Casey Rovinelli growth director at Omers Ventures says that collecting internal data about fund decision-making processes accounting and even conversations with potential targets will still give firms a competitive edge. “Time horizons get compressed and that naturally leads you to want to get smarter faster.”

Persson at EQT Ventures says he hopes that Motherbrain will be able to provide a “no slide” version of an investment memo so that investment team members don’t have to spend precious time building slides. The company is also working on adding acquisitions and competitor mapping.

“Another vision is of course for Motherbrain to become sort of autonomous” he says. “Now [Motherbrain] is a tool to augment ourselves as investors but it would be super cool when we can let go of the steering wheel.”",,,,,,,,,

But seniors are especially vulnerable when it comes to financial abuse and scams.

It’s easy to see why: Americans aged 70 and above have accumulated a total net worth of nearly $35 trillion much of it in their homes and other real estate holdings. According to the FBI seniors are targeted by con artists because they tend to be financially stable and often own their homes outright.

So-called “confidence/romance fraud” is the No. 1 type of fraud perpetrated upon seniors in terms of losses with email scams coming in second. But losses from crimes involving real estate have been increasing recently rising from $36 million in 2019 to $50 million last year.

The swindler can be just about anybody: a relative a supposed new friend a realty agent a mortgage lender an appraiser or investor. That’s why the friends and relatives of any senior entering into a real estate deal should watch for red flags – as should the agents lenders title companies and other professionals involved in the transaction.

The Most Popular Frauds

One of the most popular scams the FBI sees revolves around home equity conversion mortgages aka reverse mortgages. A legitimate HECM allows eligible owners to extract equity they’ve built in their houses over the years without having to make payments until they leave the property for good. Although there are some proprietary programs available reverse mortgages are mostly insured by the Federal Housing Administration.

Con artists looks for seniors who are not familiar with the loans’ requirements or the detailed approval process. In some cases the Oregon FBI reported recently the scammer will pressure seniors into taking out loans that they don’t need or that are totally inappropriate for their situation.

Another popular real estate ruse uses elders as “straw buyers.” Here the criminal wants to buy a house but for some unknown reason can’t qualify for a mortgage. So they persuade a senior to sign the necessary papers “as a favor.” Or maybe they offer some cash to go along with the deal.

In the end the bad guy ends up skimming all of the equity out of the property and leaving his victim not only holding a hefty 30-year mortgage but also with potential criminal liability.

Some years back Sacramento agent Elizabeth Weintraub learned of a case in which a law firm advised a senior that she could do a loan modification on a second mortgage that was already charged-off through bankruptcy – and then took her money. Weintraub said she was “appalled not only at the audacity of the lawyer but that crooks are still running elder abuse scams like this and getting away with it.”

In other real estate-related scams seniors are offered free houses investment/refinance opportunities or ways to get out of a timeshare or avoid foreclosure. But the result is often the same: The senior loses all or part of their nest egg and their credit history is left in tatters.

Telltale Signs

So how do you know when a senior in your life may be headed down the wrong road? Here are some telltale signs:

If you can never speak directly to the person the elder is dealing with your antennae should wiggle. Most con artists hide behind the telephone email and text messages. Or maybe they claim to live in some far-off country. Either way they don’t want to be seen so they cannot be identified.

On the flip side be leery if your senior is not allowed to speak for himself or herself. If the “partner” does all the talking the senior is probably being taken advantage of.

If your senior cannot explain what they are about to do and why they should not move ahead. Push them to demonstrate that they fully understand the transaction and its implications.

If they say this newfound pal is a nice person and that they just want to help him out bring in the authorities or at least ask a certified housing counselor to look over the details. Criminals always try to gain their targets’ trust and seniors are often not only trusting but polite.

Look for documents that support the transaction if there are any and run them by a real estate attorney to make sure they are on the up-and-up.

Con artists sometimes use fraudulent powers of attorney. And if the proceeds are disbursed to someone other than your senior stop the transaction in its tracks.

If the senior is being pressured to act quickly don’t let them. Scammers often create a sense of urgency so try to get in the way and slow things down.

Check contact information online – names phone numbers addresses – to see if anyone else may have been ripped off by the same scammer. People who have been stiffed often post their stories in hopes of preventing others from going through the same thing.

Meanwhile realty and allied professionals involved in the deal should take note of any signs of cognitive impairment confusion or lack of understanding by the senior. And if the senior is accompanied by an overbearing third party with no apparent role in the transaction the professional should ask the senior to consult with a relative or friend – or even make a call themselves.

Said Weintraub: “We can’t sit on the fence and be part of the problem.”

Sydney startup OwnHome is helping Australians without deposit get onto the housing ladder.

Watch the video above to learn more about OwnHome

Over the weekend it had its first customers move into their new home.

Lance Purvis and his partner Beau Fraser have settled into their first home after undertaking background financial checks similar to those run by mortgage lenders.

And while they don’t own their home just yet the rent they pay each week will contribute to its ownership.

“A lot of our friends have bought property in the last few years and out of all of them only one was able to buy without assistance from family or friends” Purvis said.

The couple is now saving for their deposit by buying straight into the house.

“The deposit hurdle affects a large number of Australians - across types of work that is done across age groups across family position” OwnHome CEO Tim Harley said.

OwnHome has more than 400 applicants on its waitlist and aims to buy 200 homes for approved customers over the next two years.

How does it work?

OwnHome makes its money from an up-front fee and the rent charged.

If you buy a $1 million house you’ll initially pay $70500 a year in rent.

OwnHome will keep most of that - but the rest will earn you 2.5 per cent equity in your home each year.

After five years you will have 12.5 per cent ownership - enough to switch to a bank mortgage and convert the title to your name.

OwnHome and the homeowners will have agreed on a price for the property that grows at 3.8 per cent per year.

If the property is worth more the customer keeps the extra value.

The customer can then purchase the property within three to seven years at the pre-agreed price.

If the customer decides not to buy - they’ll forfeit the equity stake they’ve built up.",,,,,,,,,

2 How She Likes to Sweat

""I don't do any regulated exercise but I'm very active. On the weekends I go for long hikes with my dogs. I try and stretch every day. I do the occasional yoga or Pilates class but mostly it's just self-exercise at home.

There was no intense diet or training to prep for her role as a Bond girl Ana recently revealed to Harper's Bazaar. ""I tried to have a training plan! My preparation for No Time To Die was not as long as I would have liked it to be. I was shooting Blonde and I had only a few days to train so I went straight from Blonde to shoot for Bond.

3 She Doesn't Really Diet

Ana has a moderate approach to diet. ""It's hard not to get into that dynamic here not to let them get inside your head. There are too many expectations"" she told People en Español. ""The truth is that I'm not very disciplined with diets. In general I do whatever makes me happy in life and food makes me quite happy!""

4 She Loves to Exercise

""Exercise also makes me happy but it has to be fun. I do something different every day — one day boxing the next spinning or weight training — to not get bored"" she told People.

5 She Uses a Theragun for Recovery

Ana is a huge fan of the Theragun Mini. ""I hold all of my tension in my shoulders and my legs and this device is truly incredible. I have two of them: the big one is very intense and someone has to use it on you; but I also have a mini that I travel with"" she told Vogue. ""It's a triangle shape that fits anywhere—in all of my purses—and I bring it with me on the plane to set to my trailer. Especially on this movie there's so much action and this is great for a warm-up before we start the choreography as it activates everything and you can use it again to cool down. It's a good complement to Epsom salts and arnica cream as it helps the muscles to relax.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5saXZlLmNvLm56L25ld3MvMjc5NjE2LXRoaW5rLXBpbmstYnJlYXN0LWNhbmNlci1uZXh0LXdlZWtlbmQuaHRtbD9wb3N0PTI3OTYxNi10aGluay1waW5rLWJyZWFzdC1jYW5jZXItbmV4dC13ZWVrZW5kLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Think pink for breast cancer next weekend - The Bay's News First,"Breast Cancer Foundation NZ is asking the people of Bay of Plenty to generously support local pink ribbon fundraisers happening next weekend.

Volunteer collectors will be stationed around the region for the Pink Ribbon Street Appeal on Friday October 29 and Saturday October 30.

Following this on Sunday October 31 Breast Cancer Awareness Month culminates with New Zealand's first ever neighbourhood Pink Ribbon Walk.

Extended Covid-19 restrictions around the country have forced the cancellation of two major fundraisers this year – the iconic Pink Ribbon Walks in Auckland Wellington and Christchurch and the Pink Ribbon Street Appeal in Auckland.

The charity expects to lose more than $500000 in income as a result and it's now appealing to the people of Bay of Plenty to help make its remaining events a success.

'As a charitable trust that receives no government funding we rely entirely on the goodwill of New Zealanders to keep our life-saving work going” says Breast Cancer Foundation NZ CEO Ah-Leen Rayner. 'But the ongoing Covid restrictions are severely impacting our ability to fundraise. Every dollar we've lost to Covid is money we can't spend on supporting patients in their time of need cutting-edge research and education programmes to stop deaths from breast cancer.

'We know this is devastating for our supporters who volunteer or walk to honour the women they've lost or to mark their own journey with breast cancer. However we're still committed to making the rest of our events a huge success and we hope the Bay of Plenty community will get behind our efforts to fight against breast cancer.”

Breast cancer is the leading cause of death for New Zealand women under 65 and every year around 190 women are diagnosed with it in the Bay of Plenty District Health Board area.

The neighbourhood Pink Ribbon Walks encourage people to fundraise by getting dressed up in pink and walk in their own communities.

Participants will get the chance to warm up virtually with Celebrity Treasure Island star Joe Naufahu and win prizes via social media throughout the day from event sponsors Estee Lauder Companies The Hits SBS Bank and Pink Lady Apples.

Sign up for a neighbourhood Pink Ribbon Walk at pinkribbonwalk.co.nz/virtual and follow @pinkribbonNZ on social media for all of the virtual action on the day.

Donations can be made to the Pink Ribbon Street Appeal through volunteer collectors who will be out in force shaking pink buckets across Bay of Plenty on October 29 and 30 or online at pinkribbonappeal.co.nz.

Money raised from the Pink Ribbon Street Appeal and neighbourhood Pink Ribbon Walks will go towards Breast Cancer Foundation's work to support patients fund ground-breaking scientific projects and educate New Zealanders about the importance of early detection.",,,,,,

Tribune Columnist

Ellen Brenneman is a noted artist in South Bend. She is known for her animal ink drawings that have strong colors. Bold and beautiful. Eyes that draw you into the art. Now she has a new outlet for her art — ESPN.

Near Labor Day she received a call from a creative director who found her work on Etsy. The director liked her snake art. Sure we all do. But the director wanted it for the show “Out of Pocket” which is broadcast on Wednesdays on the SEC Network. The director wanted it as soon as possible.

Yes thanks to the internet something good came out of this summer.

Shipping the art was out of the question — the producer needed it pronto. A high-resolution digital file filled the bill.

Ellen said she isn’t one to watch ESPN very much or ever. “When I heard from the director I questioned if this was for real.” Yes it was.

“I nervously sat down to watch the show (at the premiere in September) and was stunned to find the art taking up the whole wall on the right side of the set” Ellen said. “It was quite a week. It was a miracle it all came together.”

Andraya Carter who is one of the two women on the show is a fan of snakes. Happily the production crew found a snake to fit her dreams.

Ellen studied graphic design at Ball State. Art was always important in her life. Later she worked in art therapy then murals as furniture painter and as a full-time artist. “I joke that I am an overnight success after 10 years” she said.

She feels connected to animals and their spirit. The animals are the inspiration.

Ellen said she received a lot of support from Dr. Rachel Sparke of the Roseland Animal Hospital. Rachel asked her for some artwork for the clinic.

“Ellen's art is bright and brings positive energy in to the space"" Rachel said. ""The way she captures the animals is incredible. I feel like their spirit is showing on the paper. I have her art work in each of my exam rooms as well as within my home. They make me feel at peace and I can often find myself daydreaming when I look at her tree art. They are whimsical. The benefit is the friendship we share which is also felt when I gaze at her artwork.”

Visit Ellen Brenneman and/or the Creative Kind both on Facebook. The Creative Kind page has online auctions for charity. Also there is an Etsy site and ellenbrennemanstudio.com. Lots of ways to find Ellen.

A few people who were near and dear.

The Tribune lost a few alumni in the past few weeks. Time to give them a little more space. Anita Glenn worked at The Tribune for a number of years in advertising City Line and the ""Remember …"" series of books. She was always up for fun and a big Elvis fan. She died at the end of September.

Mike Siroky was on the copy desk for years but I always thought he should have been a character actor. He had a face that would have worked in many movies. He loved sports his family small towns Gary Ind. and writing. Often it would overlap. More importantly he was a softball groupie. His wife Patti played on The Tribune team.

He once told me I was challenging to edit. I don’t think that was good.

Mike wrote deep and heartfelt comments and stories. I’ll miss those stories that made me think about life. Mike died Oct. 8.

Bev Cloud worked in accounting at The Tribune. If you had a problem with a check or time off that meant a trip to the third floor and Bev. Coming into office meant she solved the problem and there were a few stories about golf eating or news in the building. She always made me smile.

John Frazier was recently featured in this column. He was an avid woodworker who produced dulcimers. Lots of dulcimers and sold them at craft shows. John taught industrial art at Navarre Middle School. One of his students Joe Radzikowski left his dulcimer project at the end of the school year.

Fast forward: John retired from teaching in 1994 but he kept Joe’s dulcimer. John’s wife Patricia decided it was time to find Joe. Thanks to Facebook she found Joe in West Lafayette. Joe and John were reunited and the dulcimer was back with its original owner.

I recently got an email from another dulcimer owner who wanted to contact John. I hope the person had the chance.

I spent a lovely Saturday morning with the Fraziers and the Radzikowskis. Teacher and student reunited. I’m glad I was able to share in the time.

Time for something happy. I got the grass cut. Well most of it.

Founded by Kalandra Mcfarquhar and run from her home studio in Birmingham you'll find an array of coasters trays and ornaments in solid colour and marble effect finishes each one completely unique.

'I do everything from the product design and research to the making and packing of orders and of course social media. I graduated as a 3D Designer Maker in 2019 where I discovered the material I specialise in today' Kalandra tells House Beautiful UK.

'I have always had an interest and calling for design and being creative from a young age and was lucky enough to carry that through my education all the way into what I do today. Although I love to design my passion has always been making – using my hands to create something from scratch is so fulfilling and why I'm making products every day.'

Kalandra tells us more about the inspiration behind KLNDRA and exactly how she found her niche.

What year did you start your business?

I started my business back in lockdown 2020 – I was furloughed from my day job and had previously been working to start up over the Christmas period but just didn't have the time to build the basis for my platform to grow. I began as I heard amazing things about the selling platform for small businesses and it was super easy to set up. Selling on Etsy gave me the confidence to grow my business and eventually create my own standalone website.

KLNDRA  and  KLNDRA via Etsy

What was the inspiration behind launching KLNDRA?

Coming out of university as a design graduate I quickly realised that the job I wanted didn't exist – I spent months looking but everything was computer based and generic. I knew that I wanted to make to be hands-on with my work and create things that I would love to have or enjoy. So that's where the motivation sparked: my business specialises in contemporary small homewares made from an eco-friendly composite called Jesmonite. I studied this material in my final year of my degree and fell in love with it and knew it had great potential to start a small business once I found my niche in aesthetics and values.

KLNDRA

Does your heritage feed into the products you create and sell?

I believe so. It's obvious in some collections more than others like for example the BLM collection – a collection deliberately designed in the movement as my way of expressing that Black is beautiful no matter your shade. The collection is driven by the motive to spark conversation in your homes and act as a daily reminder that Black lives matter.

What has been the most rewarding part of being a small business owner?

The most rewarding part for me is when I get a returning customer – it amazes me every time when I have someone place another order for a product I have made all by myself. For me that really hits home on the efforts of my work being recognised.

What does Black History Month mean to you?

Black History Month is important in so many ways. It is a chance to celebrate and promote the achievements of the Black community including representation integration and most importantly the appreciation of the struggle of past generations for freedom but at the same time confronting the racism that still exists today. The month allows for a time of focus on such subjects and to spotlight inspiring figures and events that have been overlooked whilst educating and spreading the knowledge.

KLNDRA

How can people continue to support KLNDRA on Etsy now and beyond?

Everyone thinks that to support a small business you have to buy from them but that is not the case. If you have purchased from me leaving a review or a picture of the product in your home is a huge support too! Favouriting items or my shop also goes a long way. Following me on social media so you are up to date with the latest but also can see what I get up to behind the scenes and learn more about me and my business is also rewarding for everyone. These are all methods of showing support that do not cost a penny but mean so much to small business owners.

NOBLESVILLE Ind. — Women incarcerated in Hamilton County are taking steps toward business ownership after their release.

The Launch HOPE Foundation led by Butler professor Kristi Mitchell is working with nine inmates to teach them skills to be able to sew marketable products which will allow the women to run a business when they get out of jail.

One of the program's participants Kaitlin Vanderpool has already launched a shop on Etsy to sell some of her creations. According to the Hamilton County Jail Vanderpool was sentenced to three months in jail earlier this summer for a third DUI offense. The 36-year-old said she has struggled with addiction for nearly 20 years and turned to alcohol following a divorce.

Launch HOPE gave her a chance at a new start.

""I know now that I cannot have a relationship with alcohol. This is the first time I feel like I have control over it. This program saved my life. I have a plan and I’m ready to go"" Vanderpool said.

Vanderpool learned how to sew from her mother a seamstress. The program allowed her the ability to sew while in jail while taking entrepreneur classes twice a week. Her Etsy store Kiki's Collections features handmade blankets baby bibs headbands and accessories for dogs. The shop will eventually grow into a boutique with help from students with Butler's Lacy School of Business.

“My students have helped Kaitlin conduct research vet her business concept develop a business model set-up an online storefront and go to market” Mitchell said.

In the meantime Vanderpool continues to learn many of the aspects of running a business. Her boutique will be supported by Launch HOPE's Business Accelerator program for five years.

While she and her mother will initially sew all of the items by hand a Launch HOPE industrial center in Indianapolis will later provide employment support and industrial sewing capabilities to help Vanderpool build an inventory for her boutique.

For Vanderpool she's not only found a purpose after jail but also a way to give back and help others.

""This program offered me a lifeline that I might not have gotten somewhere else. I want to be that for someone else. I want to serve as a mentor for those who come behind me"" she said.

In addition to the nine women currently participating in the program ten female inmates are on a waiting list to join.

“We’re thrilled to be the pilot for this program” said Hamilton County Jail commander Captain Josh Carey. “Launch HOPE is a unique and incredible way to equip and empower these ladies to start careers and businesses they are passionate about.""

Special to the Detroit Free Press

Madison Heights Bishop Foley made school history Saturday at Detroit’s Ford Field.

The Ventures who had never won a Catholic League football title broke through with a crazy 43-37 victory over three-time defending C-D Division champion Clarkston Everest Collegiate.

Riding the arm of Dylan Gough and the quick-strike playmaking ability of Jackson Zeiter Foley ended the regular season 8-1 and defeated Everest for the first time in six tries.

Gough was tremendous as he finished the game hitting 15 of 21 passes for 334 yards.

“He does that on a weekly basis he’s up there in the state for leading passing yards” said Zeiter who had four catches for 122 yards and the game-winning touchdown grab. “And I know what he can do. The whole team knows what he can do and we let him throw the ball and we let him make plays.”

Gough’s 38-yard touchdown pass to Zeiter with 1:59 remaining gave the Ventures (8-1) a 43-37 lead after Everett had clawed back to tie it at 37.

“Right before the play I told coach (Brian Barnes) ‘I like that matchup I like that play call’” Zeiter said. “I told Dylan to trust me and we’ve been playing since probably 9 years-old so we have that trust we have that confidence. He led me perfectly and I made the play.""

The key play however came on a surprise onside kick — by Gough — as Angelo Costanza recovered it at the Mountaineers’ 44. The Ventures then made a pair of first downs to run out the clock and clinch the win.

“Coach (Barnes) told me we’re going for the onside kick” Gough said. “I thought go at the most unathletic player and I said ‘That’s where I’m kicking the ball.’ And it was perfectly executed by my buddy Angelo who picked it up perfectly off the bounce. I knew then we needed a couple of first downs and it was ours.”

It wasn’t the first time this season Foley had recovered an onside kick but it was a bold move by Barnes given the late game situation and it paid off.

“We were struggling a little bit we were banged up on defense . . . and we said ‘You know what? We’re here for a reason’” The Foley coach said. “We said going into it we’re going to have fun and we’re going to take some chances and ‘Let’s just do it right now’ and it worked out for us. We’re proud of our guys we trusted our guys and we came through.”

Trailing 24-7 at the half Everest tried to make a game of it with a methodical 68-yard 11-play drive capped by Jimmy Nedwick’s 8-yard TD run to cut it 10 with 5:00 left in the third.

Just 13 seconds later Gough connected with Zeiter who bounced off an Everest defender for a 68-yard TD pass to put the Ventues up 31-14.

“I’ve played with him (Zeiter) for a long time he’s been like a brother to me” Gough said. “I trust him he trusts me. I know where he’s at at all times and I got to let him play. He’s a big playmaker.”

The Mountaineers then mounted another long drive going 66 yards in 14 plays capped by a Nathan Beggs 1-yard run but Foley answered on Gough’s 1-yard TD keeper after he connected with Gus Toppi on a pass for 39 yards to goal line. But the extra point fell shot and Foley had a 37-21 advantage with 8:41 left.

Things got interesting when Beggs scored a 2-yard TD run and quarterback Joey Thibodeau made the two-pointer to pull Everest (7-2) to within 37-29 with 6:10 to go.

After Foley went three-and-out the Mountaineers evened the game at 37-37 with 2:54 to play on 5-yard TD run by Beggs followed by two-point run by Beggs.

Adam Kidder’s interception at the Mountaineers’ 40 resulted in Foley’s first score a 1-yard TD run by Zeiter with 7:34 left in the first quarter. The touchdown was set up by a circus 37-yard catch by Kidder from Gough down to the Everest 12.

Joey Hildreth then added a 24-yard field goal with 10:30 to go in the half to put the Ventures up 10-0.

Everest cut the deficit to 10-7 with 8:13 left in the half when Thibodeau hit a wide-open Johnny Nedwick for a 34-yard TD but on the ensuing kickoff Zeiter got a lane down the left sideline and took it all the way 77 yards for a score to put the Ventures up by 10 again 17-7.

With 2:52 remaining in the second quarter Foley padded its lead on a 1-yard TD keeper by Gough to make it 24-7 at the half. In the first half Gough was an efficient 10 of 14 passing for 151 yards.

“Fantastic athletes and fantastic football players” Barnes said of his QB and Zeiter. “They’ve done everything we wanted all year. Really proud of them. A lot of times we put the game in their hands . . . and they made plays and it worked out for us.”

Foley ironically never trailed in the game but had to pull out the victory while earning its first victory in seven tries all-time against Everest.

“I’ve been pretty excited all week emotional all week just not for me our guys and coaching staff but everybody that’s part of our Bishop Foley community all of our alums and they’re very special” Barnes said.

And for Gough and his teammates it was a ground breaking achievement.

“It feels really good” the QB said. “We’re the first team from Foley ever to be here and the first team ever to win it. It feels great to win the biggest game in school history.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Point Thomson on state land east of Prudhoe Bay is a large reservoir of natural gas and gas condensate.

Exxon will maintain its 60% ownership stake in the field said Hans Neidig the company’s Alaska public affairs manager.

“ExxonMobil remains committed to Point Thomson and will continue to have a leadership role in exploring all options to monetize its gas resources” he said.

Exxon will also maintain its ownership stake in Prudhoe Bay and the trans-Alaska pipeline Neidig said.

Some 38 employees are affected by the transfer. They might be hired by Hilcorp Neidig said while others could be reassigned to other positions at Exxon.

Exxon has been active in Alaska’s oil and gas industry for decades. Despite its large working interest in the North Slope Point Thomson was the first and only Alaska field that Exxon decided to operate itself Neidig said.

Hilcorp is a newer player but has a much larger profile in Alaska operations. It became the main oilfield operator in the state after it bought BP’s Alaska assets last year.

Production of condensate from Point Thomson began in 2016. It travels through the trans-Alaska pipeline. Commercial production of Point Thomson gas will depend on a large liquified natural gas system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjMxMDIwMjEvdG90YWxlbmVyZ2llcy1rbmV3LWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWV4eG9ubW9iaWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Total Accused of Campaign to Play Down Climate Risk From Fossil Fuels,"The French oil and gas giant TotalEnergies was aware of the link between fossil fuels and rising global temperatures 50 years ago but worked with other oil majors to play down the risks for at least three decades according to internal company documents and interviews with former executives.

The research published on Wednesday by three historians in the peer-reviewed Global Environmental Change journal outlines alleged efforts by the French energy group to cast doubt over emerging climate science in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s while pushing back against emissions reduction and climate-related taxes.

The study follows similar allegations made against other oil and gas majors in recent years including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell some of whose scientists have also been shown to have identified the climate risks associated with fossil fuels decades ago. The revelations come at an awkward time for Total and the wider oil industry as it seeks to regain public trust and build support for new strategies focused on cleaner fuels.

Total rebranded itself Total Energies this year as part of a pivot to tackle the climate crisis and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 but some climate activists have argued this is too little too late.

“These revelations provide proof that TotalEnergies and the other oil and gas majors have stolen the precious time of a generation to stem the climate crisis” advocacy groups 350.org and Notre Affaire à Tous said in response to the report.

The research shows that Total personnel received the first warnings about the potential for “catastrophic global warming from its products” by at least 1971.

Total’s company magazine Total Information warned that year of a possible increase in average temperatures of 1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius partial melting of the polar ice caps and a “significant” sea level rise “if the consumption of coal and oil keeps the same rhythm in the years to come” the researchers found.

Despite the warning Total said little on the issue for most of the next two decades according to the research. The historians reviewed all editions of Total’s company magazine from 1965 to 2010 and after the 1971 article did not find another reference to climate change until 1989.

In the interim as public discussion of emissions and global warming gained prominence Total began to work with other oil companies to cast doubt on the link between fossil fuels and climate change the historians said.

At a 1988 meeting at Total’s headquarters in Paris the global oil and gas industry association IPIECA formed a new “ad hoc” group later renamed as the “working group on global climate change” chaired by a scientist from Exxon according to the research.

In a 1989 strategy paper the Exxon executive recommended emphasising uncertainties in climate science in order to defeat public policies that might shift the energy mix away from fossil fuels.

A former executive at the oil company Elf which Total acquired in 1999 told the historians that the French oil and gas industry had been happy to allow Exxon to take the lead given its “weight in the scientific community”.

Through the IPIECA Total Exxon and other oil companies approved funding in the 1990s of scientific research that could “sharpen” the industry’s ability to highlight the limitations of current climate models and “potentially make global warming appear less alarming” the research said.

By the time the UN framework convention on climate change was ratified in Kyoto in 1997 Total was no longer prepared to overtly attack the scientific consensus on climate change the historians said. Instead it shifted to emphasising “equivocal descriptions” of global warming and playing down the significance of the available evidence.

Total said it was “wrong to claim that the climate risk was concealed by Total or Elf in the 1970s or since” adding that the company’s historic knowledge of climate risk was no different from that published in scientific journals at the time.

“TotalEnergies deplores the process of pointing the finger at a situation from 50 years ago without highlighting the efforts changes progress and investments made since then” it said.

Exxon said it had not seen the academic paper and could not immediately comment.

The image on the plaque is from Chaoui’s 2017 Boston Marathon run through Wellesley.

Chaoui who passed away on Aug. 3 2020 at the age of 56 from metastatic breast cancer made a positive difference in many people’s lives. While fighting hard against cancer herself Chaoui spearheaded numerous efforts to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to support cancer research and important local causes.

Friends plan an information celebration of Chaoui on Friday Nov. 5 her birthday after their usual morning group run.

A more formal pre-race dedication will take place on Nov. 25 Thanksgiving morning at the Wellesley Turkey Trot. Plans are to hold the race in-person this year  though a virtual option is available (last year the race went entirely virtual due to the pandemic). Organizers urge runners to register now to secure a shirt.

The Linden Square plaque is the result of collaboration by Kate Maul Martha Collins Amin Chaoui and Linden Square property manager Federal Realty.

The indictment in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh was unsealed recently and claims the defendants made thousands in profits by applying through HUD to purchase foreclosed houses in what should have been prioritized for families who intended to occupy the homes.

J. Reed Pirain 45 and Renee Vasilko 48 who are siblings and Upper St. Clair residents were each indicted on felony charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and false statements after investigators said they falsified an application to make it appear that Vasilko planned to occupy a foreclosed house she had purchased according to court documents.

Vasilko was able to bid on the property before other investors because she indicated she planned to live in the house as part of her HUD application used on foreclosed homes that defaulted on federal loans. She paid $67800 for the foreclosed house in the Brookline neighborhood of Pittsburgh in February 2018 but sold it for $189900 in March 2019 after “flipping” it by making extensive renovations according to court documents.

Pirain is a licensed real estate agent and represented Vasilko in the purchase. Both are partners at NextHome PPM Realty in Dormont and officers at Pirain Enterprises Inc.

In a separate but similar case Matthew Durbin 41 of McMurray and Richard Sunseri 36 of Pittsburgh are accused of purchasing foreclosed properties in Bethel Park and Dormont in 2016 and 2017 before selling the houses less than a year after their purchase and splitting the profits according to court documents. Investigators said the two are both licensed real estate agents and represented each other on the two sales while writing in their applications that they planned to occupy the houses they each purchased.

Durbin sold his Bethel Park house for $200000 in March 2017 less than 12 months after purchasing the property for $113000. Durbin is listed as a real estate agent in South Fayette.

Sunseri sold his Dormont house for $235000 in December 2017 after purchasing the property for $99000 six months earlier. Sunseri is listed as real estate agent with NextHome PPM Realty according to its website.

Both are charged with two felony counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States and one felony charge of false statements.

All four defendants who were indicted Sept. 21 are free on $10000 unsecured bond.

The HUD’s “Single Family Property Disposition” program that the defendants are accused of defrauding involves helping families purchase properties that they intend to occupy. Federal investigators said the schemes for profit allow real estate investors to purchase properties by outbidding families while also “jumping the line” to make their bids.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL21hc3NhY2h1c2V0dHMtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWZvci1oYW1wZGVuLWhhbXBzaGlyZS1hbmQtZnJhbmtsaW4tY291bnRpZXMtb2N0LTI0LTIwMjEuaHRtbNIBmAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL21hc3NhY2h1c2V0dHMtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWZvci1oYW1wZGVuLWhhbXBzaGlyZS1hbmQtZnJhbmtsaW4tY291bnRpZXMtb2N0LTI0LTIwMjEuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Massachusetts real estate transactions for Hampden Hampshire and Franklin counties Oct. 24 2021,"Agawam

Real Estate Developer Shady Awad 41 of Allen Park pleaded guilty Friday to conspiring to commit bribery with Sollars as well as with Taylor Community Development Manager Jeffrey Baum a former treasurer for the Committee to Elect Richard “Rick” Sollars the release said.

As part of his plea Awad said he gave Sollars cash household appliances free renovations to his home and lake house and other gifts in connection with the city's Right of First Refusal program Acting United States Attorney Saima Mohsin said in the release. State law lets cities have the first chance to acquire from counties any tax-foreclosed properties that are eligible for redevelopment and the case against Sollars alleges that between 2015 and 2018 he steered to Awad the vast majority of Taylor’s tax-foreclosed properties in the city’s Right of First Refusal program.

According to court records between 2016 and 2018 Shady Awad paid for more than $50000 in improvements Sollars’ home and lake house and gave at least $4000 in cash to Sollars while Sollars gambled in Las Vegas. The renovations included new hardwood flooring garage doors and front entrance doors a deck and railings at the lake house and kitchen appliances as well as a washer and dryer at Sollars’ home.

In addition court documents say Awad provided his credit card information to another developer interested in acquiring tax-foreclosed properties in Taylor and let that developer charge more than $19000 to his credit cards which the developer converted to cash and gave to Sollars. All of the gifts were ""in exchange for Sollars’ assistance in obtaining tax-foreclosed properties"" through the city's program the documents say.

The bribery conspiracy count to which Awad pleaded guilty carries a maximum sentence of five years of imprisonment. Under federal sentencing guidelines he likely will receive a sentence of 37 to 46 months as well as a fine of up to $250000 according to Friday's news release. Awad's sentencing is scheduled for March 1.

It's unclear to what extent Awad may testify against Sollars whose trial is expected to start in January. Awad's lawyer David DuMouchel declined comment Friday according to a Detroit News story.

Sollars was indicted in December 2019 on federal bribery and wire fraud charges accused of helping Awad's company Realty Transition according to previous Free Press reports. The lengthy indictment was unsealed nearly a year after FBI agents raided Taylor City Hall and searched Sollars' house and vacation home. In the raids agents seized more than $200000 in cash from the mayor's house according to the previous reports.

Despite Sollars' indictment he registered to run for re-election in Taylor's primary in August although he was kept off the ballot after the city clerk determined that Sollars did not file campaign finance reports and owed thousands of dollars in late fees. As a write-in candidate Sollars ran fourth in the primary thus failing to be one of the two top vote-getters and qualify for the November election. One of the top two will be elected on Nov. 2 and be sworn in on the following Monday according to Taylor's city charter pushing Sollars out of the mayor's seat. The job that pays him about $108000 a year according to a city official.

After Awad's plea federal officials said they would continue with vigorous prosecution of Taylor's current and former city officials.

“Today’s plea is a step towards ensuring that the citizens of Taylor receive the honest government services they are entitled to"" Mohsin said in the release. Added Timothy Waters Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Detroit Division: “Mr. Awad’s investigation is proof of the FBI’s resolve to root out fraud and corruption in all forms.”

Today Amazon controls one-fifth of the delivery market and is on track to overtake UPS and even the US Postal Service (USPS) according to data from the logistics firm Pitney Bowes.

Data released in Sept. shows the e-commerce giant has now unseated FedEx as the third-largest US package courier—and it’s trailing just behind UPS the only private business that still delivers more parcels than Amazon.

Amazon used to rely heavily on FedEx and UPS to deliver packages to its customers. But the company shifted its strategy after a disastrous 2013 holiday shopping season in which the delivery services failed to keep up with the torrent of gifts US shoppers ordered from Amazon leading to widespread delays. The next year Amazon accelerated the construction of its own distribution centers and began amassing fleets of semi-trucks cargo planes and delivery vans. Ever since Amazon has been steadily shifting more of its deliveries away from FedEx and UPS and toward its in-house logistics operation.

So far the e-commerce giant has focused on delivering its own packages. But the explosive growth suggests Amazon may soon enter the delivery market. Analysts believe Amazon is primed to launch a standalone delivery service in the US within months. The new unit would compete with UPS and FedEx delivering packages for outside businesses applying further pressure to make two-day or same-day delivery routine.

Amazon Logistics poised for explosive growth

Amazon Logistics the e-commerce company’s delivery division has already grown large enough to meet most of the company’s internal needs; it now handles two-thirds of Amazon package deliveries. But even so Amazon has dramatically increased its spending on logistics infrastructure. It’s buying dozens of cargo planes opening multibillion-dollar freight handling facilities and hiring 125000 new delivery drivers and warehouse workers in the US.

In the eyes of Morgan Stanley analysts that’s strong evidence Amazon’s delivery business will launch within 18 months. Indeed Amazon is already quietly handling some packages for the US Postal Service its largest competitor in the US delivery market.

If Amazon opens its delivery services to more outside businesses the company can leverage billions of dollars in in-house logistics investments—just as it did when it spun off Amazon Web Services into a wildly profitable subsidiary.

So far Amazon Logistics has failed to catch up to its US package delivery rivals in terms of revenue. But that may only be because it offers below-market rates to its primary customer its parent company Amazon. Amazon Logistics collects about $4.28 in revenue for every package it delivers compared to $12.19 for UPS and $17.95 for FedEx according to Quartz’s analysis of Pitney Bowes data.

Since its marketplace business subsidizes its delivery infrastructure it can afford to keep prices low while raking in profits. Assuming Amazon raises shipping prices for outside customers the e-commerce behemoth may itself in the market leader in yet another industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3dqbGEuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYWxsLWJsYWNrcy1uZXctemVhbGFuZC1uYXRpb25hbC1ydWdieS10ZWFtLXVzYS1lYWdsZXMtZmVkZXgtZmllbGQtaGlzdG9yaWMtZ2FtZS13YXNoaW5ndG9uLWRjLXNhdHVyZGF5LW9jdG9iZXItMjMtMjAyMdIBlgFodHRwczovL3dqbGEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FsbC1ibGFja3MtbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtbmF0aW9uYWwtcnVnYnktdGVhbS11c2EtZWFnbGVzLWZlZGV4LWZpZWxkLWhpc3RvcmljLWdhbWUtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1kYy1zYXR1cmRheS1vY3RvYmVyLTIzLTIwMjE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Zealand's All Blacks dominate US National Rugby team at FedEx Field,"The All Blacks – The New Zealand National Rugby Team is arguably the most famous and one of the best in the world.

The All Blacks and USA will be playing for the 1874 cup which references the year rugby was first played in the U.S. This is the biggest international rugby match our area has ever seen. City officials are hoping it will help jump-start interest in the sport as our area vies to host the men’s rugby world cup in either 2027 or 2031 and the women’s event in 2029.

""We know the feeling locally is pretty excited about this game and for many of playing at this stadium at pretty iconic group its going to be these are the things the guys really enjoy. We’re excited for the game can’t wait and we're really appreciative of the support and the welcome we’ve been getting"" All Blacks Head Coach Ian Foster said before the match began.



As for the game itself let's just say a mercy rule would have come in handy.

New Zealand posted a record 16-try 104-14 win against an under-strength Eagles team in front of more than 40000 fans. After two matches in which their attack struggled against the stifling defense of South Africa the All Blacks were able to thrive again and scored their first try after 28 seconds.

United States Rugby has just announced an ambitious goal to host the Rugby World Cup in 2027. A rare bright point for the Eagles was when scrumhalf Nate Augspurger became the first man to score a try for the U.S. against New Zealand. The try came just before halftime when the Eagles already were trailing 59-0.

The crowd cheered the Star-Spangled Banner flew . . . and New Zealand scored many tries.

That was predictable and USA Rugby and perhaps World Rugby are thinking bigger-picture. Through the rosiest spectacles possible this was a fleeting taste of things to come. It was also if more like a training video than any sort of contest a showcase of pure All Black attack.

USA Rugby reckoned on an attendance of 50000 – and got about 10000 less than that. Nonetheless most of the fans came from a flourishing American subculture proudly wearing the colours of school college club or even service academy. In a fierce curtain-raiser Army beat Navy 24-17.

The pre-game ceremonials part of any international were touched by still-fresh grief. From the Americans there was silence for Kathy Flores a great player and coach who died this week. From the All Blacks before the haka there was a pause of 11 seconds to honour the Maori wing Sean Wainui killed in a car crash at just 25. Bryce Campbell the US captain laid a No 11 shirt on the grass.

After that Campbell’s Eagles covered every blade … while chasing All Black shadows.

Because the game was outside the autumn Test window the Americans could not field players employed by overseas clubs. It was not surprising that a team entirely selected from Major League Rugby could not contain an All Blacks outfit with 374 caps and four World Cup winners’ medals on the bench. Dane Coles Sam Cane TJ Perenara Anton Lienert-Brown and Beauden Barrett twice world player of the year. All came on and did their bit for the havoc. Three Eagles had not played a single Test. So it goes.

As it happens the writer who made that fatalistic phrase his own Kurt Vonnegut once reported on rugby at Cornell University. He called it “a damned good game faster than football and harder than soccer”. Making the best of things the All Blacks did their best to prove him right.

The flanker Luke Jacobson scored the first try within 30 seconds of kick-off. The pack set the ball up the backs moved it and the full-back Damian McKenzie slipped the Eagles defence. The procession proceeded from there.

Which tries to pick out? There were too many the Eagles pulled out of shape a tackle missed the line left open. The sixth try before 25 minutes were up might’ve been the best: the fly-half Richie Mo’unga chipped and the wing Will Jordan caught it and passed the ball back to Mo’unga. Half-tackled he drunk-waltzed his way to the line.

The slightly bizarre ease of it summed up the unfolding mismatch. So did the try the eighth which brought up 50 points. A slashing break from Jordan a gallop home by Angus Ta’avao … the tighthead prop.

There were more tries of course even as the All Blacks took their foot off the gas.

“The reality” said their coach Ian Foster “is a bit of looseness came into our game particularly trying too much.”

They still passed 100 points.

Oh to have such problems. In the circumstances the US did well to stick at it and to score twice themselves either side of half-time. Just before the break a bit of confusion near a ruck was enough for Nate Augspurger the scrum-half to zip through and beat McKenzie to score. In the second half the wing Ryan Matyas did well to ride Jordan’s tackle – which pulled his shorts half-down – for five points in the corner.

Gary Gold the Eagles coach was understandably downcast but ready to reach for such positives.

“I choose to be a person that will look for the good in what we’ve done” he said. “And I think they were passages where there was some good stuff and we’ll take a little bit of encouragement that you know for those small passages of play we were able to put some pressure on them and ultimately score two tries.”

They were the first ever by American men against New Zealand. They may be the last for a while."

The range of services can be very wide and includes e-commerce social media internet search mobile phone hardware and software ride hailing and telecommunications.

Big Techs have recently entered financial services and have rapidly gained prominence (Frost et al. 2019). In Figure 1 Panel A shows that financial services make up more than 10% of Big Techs’ revenues on average. They have a substantial footprint in the payment systems of several advanced economies and across a wider spectrum of financial services in emerging market and developing economies. In China two Big Techs jointly account for 94% of the mobile payments market and play a significant role in other financial services such as digital credit. At the global level Big Techs extended or facilitated more than $500 billion of credit in 2019 (Cornelli et al. 2020) and there are early indications that such credit grew further during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. By developing their activities Big Techs like Google Apple Facebook Amazon in the US and Alibaba and Tencent in China have market capitalisations that far surpass those of the largest banks (Figure 1 Panel B).

Why have they got so large? Big Tech business models rest on enabling direct interactions among a large number of users. This may be in (1) e-commerce such as Alibaba Amazon or Mercado Libre; (2) social media such as Facebook Tencent or Kakao; (3) telecommunications such as Safaricom or MTN; or (4) search such as Google or Baidu. An essential by-product of their business is the massive user data they generate and collect on their platforms. They exploit natural network effects generating further user activity and data which can be leveraged to improve their product offering. As an example payment services generate transaction data network externalities facilitate the interaction among users and all this helps serve the Big Techs in their other activities (such as credit or wealth management) generating more engagement with existing users and attracting new ones.

But these activities generate further data and fuel a data–network–activities feedback loop. This has been called the DNA of big techs (BIS 2019). This DNA loop is a source of significant benefits to users and the financial system. For example Big Techs’ business model can be very powerful at enhancing efficiency and financial inclusion particularly in weakly contestable markets with dominant financial incumbents. Moreover the use of detailed user data from other business lines may reduce the need for costly collateral for loans (Gambacorta et al. 2020). At the same time if left unchecked the DNA loop can engender new risks for privacy and consumer protection market contestability and eventually financial stability.

In a recent paper (Feyen et al. 2021) we analyse the entry of Big Tech firms into financial services and how this impacts the existing trade-offs among public policy objectives across: (1) financial stability and market integrity (2) efficiency and competition and (3) data privacy and consumer protection. We can elaborate such trade-offs around a policy triangle adapted from Petralia et al. (2019) and Carletti et al. (2020).

Let’s start with the ‘traditional’ stability–competition trade-off (red arrow in Figure 2). Regulators have long debated the relationship between competition and financial stability. There are broadly two schools of thought. One emphasised that greater competition was not always optimal or conducive to financial stability because more competition reduces banks’ profits and overall franchise value (Keeley 1990). A second school of thought argues that greater market entry in the financial sector is desirable. Greater contestability fosters beneficial competition (by increasing innovation and efficiency) and reduces incumbents’ market power (Claessens 2009). The relationship may depend on other features including regulation (Beck et al. 2013).

The entry of Big Tech into finance may change these paradigms due to the DNA feedback loop. Companies with market dominance in their core business could translate that dominance into complementary financial services making entry a source of increased concentration and market power. Such control may also generate conflicts of interest and potential market abuse when big tech platforms become the main distribution channel for their competitors (e.g. banks).

An example of how competition in payments may evolve is given by merger and acquisition activity by digital platforms (Big Techs and card networks). Figure 3 shows how vertical and horizontal integration trends have developed in recent years. Some of the largest deals have been horizontal acquisitions such as the acquiring of direct competitors (blue dots). In other cases vertical acquisitions have taken place (red dots). These deals allow payment firms to increase their efficiency and perform ‘in-house’ activities for which they previously used partners or vendors. The trend towards larger dots lower on the graph shows that smaller companies may be acquired before reaching a critical mass of users (Kamepalli et al. 2020).

Notes: 1 For 2020 data up to 31 January 2021. The figure divides forms of vertical integration in red and horizontal forms of integration in blue. The size of the bubble represents the market capitalisation of the acquiring company while the height in the graph represents the deal size. Each dot represents a merger and acquisition (M&A) deal by Ant Financial Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) FISERV Global Payments Mastercard PayPal Square or Visa as collected by PitchBook and Refinitiv Eikon. This excludes divestitures and intra-company operations. M&A deals are classified as ‘vertical’ when the acquiring and the target firm operate at different stages along the same payment chain as determined by company reports. In ‘horizontal’ deals the acquiring and target firm are direct competitors in at least one key business line. The size of each dot is proportional to the acquiring company market capitalisation on the day of the deal or in the case of Ant Financial the valuation of Ant Financial as of end-2018 multiplied by changes in the market capitalisation of Alibaba Holdings relative to end-2018.

While competition and more efficient solutions may often benefit consumers trade-offs between efficiency/competition and privacy/consumer protection arise. This is represented by the blue arrow in Figure 2. In many jurisdictions Big Tech providers may not be subject to regulatory oversight that protects financial services consumers. Big Tech mobile money competes with bank payments services on price and availability dimensions but more personal data might be exposed to mobile money providers than to banks.

As data become an even more important source of market power there are tensions around the ownership and use of data. Data can in principle be used many times and by any number of firms simultaneously without being depleted – this is the so-called ‘non-rivalry’ characteristic of data (Carrière-Swallow and Haksar 2020 Haksar et al. 2021 World Bank 2021). Credit bureaus operate on this principle. However unrestricted sharing of data can also harm individuals. For example open access to personal data represents a loss of privacy and can allow for identity theft reputational damage and the manipulation of behavioural biases to sell consumers products that are not in their own interests. On the other hand allowing data producers to maintain a monopoly over the data presents challenges as well. It could impede consumers from switching providers or enable price discrimination or algorithmic exclusion.

Big Tech companies are also very efficient in pricing given big data. They can divide a customer population into very fine subcategories – each charged a different price representing the maximum price each individual is willing to pay. By extracting more of the consumer surplus from those willing to pay more prices can also be reduced for those able to pay less potentially creating a more inclusive offering. Yet such fine price discrimination may overlap with protected categories such as gender or race. Regulators need to balance innovation and efficiency with consumer protection that might dampen certain innovations.

Data sharing can alleviate problems of asymmetric information and adequate data are crucial for monitoring financial stability and integrity. This potentially introduces a new trade-off between privacy (and consumer protection more generally) on the one hand and financial stability and market integrity on the other. This trade-off is represented by the green arrow in Figure 2.

For example in the credit market there is ample evidence that more data can improve stability. Credit reporting systems allow safe lending to borrowers who had previously been priced out of the market resulting in higher aggregate lending (Pagano and Jappelli 1993) and furthering financial inclusion. In the case of credit reporting the data can only be accessed by licensed entities and only upon customer consent and only for authorised purposes. In the case of Big Techs the data they capture are far more granular and touch several aspects of personal life so it is important to have safeguards for privacy. At the same time detailed information on all parties in a transaction could be helpful to reduce illicit activity and preserving market integrity. Anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) practices could benefit from machine learning applications on big data. Balancing privacy and integrity goals will require societal dialogue and likely legislation.

Conclusions

The rise of Big Techs underscores how rapidly digital innovation can disrupt markets and put competitive pressure on incumbents. This brings efficiency and financial inclusion particularly in emerging market and developing economies but also new concerns for policy. This column highlights new trade-offs between public policy objectives: (1) financial stability and market integrity (2) efficiency and competition and (3) data privacy and consumer protection.

The current framework for regulating financial services follows an activities-based approach where providers must hold licences for specific business lines. There is scope to address the new policy challenges by developing specific entity-based rules as proposed in several key jurisdictions – notably the EU China and the US (Carstens et al. 2021).

But the new trade-offs between the policy objectives in the triangle also call for more coordination. At the domestic level there is need for more coordination between national authorities overseeing competition financial regulation data and consumer protection. Finally as the digital economy expands across borders there is a need for international coordination of rules and standards in the public interest.

The battery life of wireless models has improved a lot over the years but it’s still far from perfect and those wide headbands provide the perfect surface for a sheet of solar cells to provide continuous charging.

Urbanista isn’t the first company to attempt to make good on this idea — JBL announced a pair of its own in 2019 that it was subsequently forced to delay due to the pandemic — but its Los Angeles are the first solar-powered headphones to have actually made it to market. Although the design is almost identical to the company’s existing Miami headphones a layer of Powerfoyle solar cells on the headband allows them to continuously suck up solar energy when exposed to light. Urbanista reckons the average listener should be able to go months without having to charge them up.

It’s an enticing idea one that has the potential to remove an item from the list of devices people have to charge on a regular basis but can it live up to the expectations? And even if it does are these $199 (£169 / €199) solar-powered headphones worth keeping charged in the first place?

Urbanista’s Los Angeles have a basic uninspired design that’s broadly in line with the company’s existing Miami headphones. My review sample was a fairly boring black but there’s also a more colorful “Sand Gold” option if you’re feeling more adventurous.

Where things get interesting are with the Los Angeles’ headband which has a layer of Powerfoyle material produced by Exeger for capturing the light that eventually gets turned into battery power. Unfortunately this material is black regardless of which color you opt to get the headphones in and from the press images I don’t think it looks great with the gold option.

Urbanista’s app shows exactly how much power is being gained and lost. Here the headphones were being used in direct sunlight playing music with ANC on and gaining power. Screenshot: Urbanista

For the most part the headphones’ solar charging capabilities aren’t something you need to actively think about. They’ll automatically charge regardless of whether you’re wearing them and listening to music or whether they’re turned off (although software caps their solar charging at 90 percent to protect the battery). But if you want to get a more in-depth idea of what’s going on under the hood Urbanista’s companion app offers a great interface that shows the headphones’ power draw versus its solar charging. There’s a lot of fun to be had messing around with the app seeing what impact turning ANC on and off has on battery drain or how much solar power you can gain from putting the headphones in the most direct sunlight you can find.

I think the benefit most people will get from the Los Angeles solar charging is as a metaphorical parachute slowing the battery drain so you don’t have to recharge them so often. How effective this parachute ends up being will differ a lot depending on whether you use them to listen to music inside at your desk or on the subway or whether you wear them while out and about in a sunnier part of the world. But as a baseline listening to them in a pitch-black room with ANC off should get you 80 hours of listening.

In my experience using them on cloudy fall days in the UK I generally saw Urbanista’s app reporting either minimal power drain or else adding an almost equal amount of power to the amount being consumed. It was less common for me to see the headphones actually gaining power as I used them but this did happen when I used them in direct sunlight (as you can see from the screenshot above).

The times when I saw the headphones gaining the most power from solar charging were when they were sitting unused in the sun. I’m sure you could get into the habit of leaving them on a sunny windowsill positioned so that the headband was pointing directly at the sun to maximize the benefit but if you’re going to make that effort then you might as well plug them in. The beauty of the Los Angeles headphones is that you don’t really have to think about it and obsessing over leaving them to charge in the sun feels like it’s missing the point.

The headphones can be snug on larger heads. This small logo is the only visible indicator of their solar-charging abilities.

After two weeks of listening for a couple of hours a day including while sitting at my desk next to a west-facing window as well as on the London Underground with ANC on Urbanista’s app reports that I’m still at 81 percent power. It’s an impressively small amount of battery drain even while I used them in situations with no natural light or in overcast conditions.

I don’t think anyone’s going to get away with never having to connect the Los Angeles headphones to a USB-C charger. But based on my experience I could see them lasting for a month or more of regular usage during winter and even longer if you’re using them in sunnier conditions.

I could see these headphones lasting for months without needing a charge

Apart from the solar cell-equipped headband the Los Angeles look and function like a typical pair of wireless noise-canceling headphones. Their controls will look familiar to anyone who’s used a pair of wireless headphones in the past five years. On the right earcup there’s a trio of buttons for volume up down and a middle playback control button that also turns the headphones on and off. On the left there’s a customizable shortcut button that responds to either a short or long-press to toggle noise cancellation transparency mode or a voice assistant.

It’s a sensible selection of buttons; I just wish the volume controls weren’t so stupidly close together. You can learn to live with them but just a little more spacing would make that pause button much easier to feel with your finger in a pinch. It would also have been nice for there to be a dedicated shortcut to put the headphones into pairing mode rather than having to manually disconnect from a previous device first.

Playback controls on the right and ANC and USB-C charging on the left. Branding on the headphones is minimal.

On the left earcup there’s a USB-C port for when the sun’s rays aren’t enough to keep these headphones charged but unfortunately there’s no 3.5mm jack for wired connections. Urbanista tells me it omitted the physical jack to keep the headphones’ power consumption as low as possible. In fairness the Los Angeles’ battery life is 30 hours higher than Urbanista’s Miami headphones which “only” deliver 50 hours suggesting that these power optimizations have worked. But a 3.5mm option would still be useful for in-flight entertainment or work calls where I don’t want to risk a Bluetooth disconnection and it’s a shame the Los Angeles don’t have this flexibility built in.

Away from the sunlight and into the bowels of London’s Underground network I was pleasantly surprised by the Los Angeles’ noise canceling performance which fairly successfully drowned out the screeching of the tube as it flew through subway tunnels. It’s not as capable as class leaders like the AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM4 but I think the level of ANC offered by the Los Angeles is good for the price.

A snug fit helps with noise cancellation

The ability of the Los Angeles to cancel out noise is helped by the fact that they fit snugly on your head while you wear them. They were initially so snug that they were uncomfortable to wear during my first few days of use. But as the headband softened over the course of two weeks the headphones turned from “uncomfortably snug” to just “snug” on my slightly large head. If you have a chance to try them on before you buy them I’d take it. Just to be safe.

The Los Angeles offer a rich rounded sound that has a lot of impact. Listen to techno like the recently-released 7 Songs by Humanoid and the thumping bass line has weight and impact but manages to stay just shy of becoming overwhelming. But switch to something more layered like Bloc Party’s We Are Not Good People and the limitations of this bass-first approach become more apparent. The Los Angeles just don’t leave that much space for the rest of the track to make itself heard and in the case of Bloc Party’s track you lose some of the definition and crackle of the overdriven guitars in the process.

The Los Angeles don’t sound bad by any means. Far from it — they’re a very listenable pair of headphones. But their sound has a weight to it that can squash more delicate parts of a track. There are far worse headphones around for this price but if you’re yearning to hear every last bit of detail in a song then the Los Angeles aren’t interested in providing it to you.

Inside the cups. The Los Angeles from the right.

Making a pair of headphones that can be charged by light without looking like they can charge by light is no small feat and the biggest compliment I can pay the Los Angeles is that they integrate this functionality so seamlessly that you basically forget they’re able to solar charge at all. That is until you look at their battery level after several days of use and discover it’s only gone down by 10 percent. The only significant compromise is the lack of a 3.5mm port for optional line-in listening. For some people this won’t be an issue. For others it’ll be a dealbreaker.

As a pair of headphones the Urbanista Los Angeles make a couple of missteps. Their controls could be clearer and more spaced out and their fit could be more comfortable on larger heads. But they ultimately succeed at being a very listenable pair of headphones even if their sound quality can’t compete with more expensive pairs from the likes of Sony and Sennheiser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVuZXdzZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGF0ZS9tY2NyYWNrZW4tb2ZmaWNpYWxzLWRlbnktcGVybWl0LWZvci1zb2xhci1mYXJtL2FydGljbGVfOWI1ODhlZDAtNTFmMy01MDdhLWE5YjktZjE1ZTliZWI4Yjc4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McCracken officials deny permit for solar farm | State News | thenewsenterprise.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

It’s been a heavy week for those of us who want to preserve life on earth. Somehow the latest greatest hope for a livable future is in the hands of one man—a senator not even a king! Given how few Americans voted for him it’s absurd that Joe Manchin has so much national influence. But when you factor in the scale of US power and its historic and current responsibility for the climate crisis it’s downright grotesque.

When Senator Ed Markey joined climate activists outside of the Capitol on October 7 he said “There’s no middle ground between a livable and an unlivable world.”

But there is a world in between—and we’re in it now. It’s a world where everything feels tenuous like if you touch anything it might all crumble. It’s one where you feel uneasy making plans months in advance because you can’t picture the future. Today coming up with a 10-year plan feels ridiculous—like building a house on quicksand.

As we careen from crisis to crisis it’s hard not to wonder whether the world is ending. But for the only species with a record for better or worse of intentionally changing the planet that’s a cop-out. The real question isn’t about what the world is doing it’s about what we’re doing. It’s not whether the world is ending or beginning. It’s whether we’re creating or destroying it. And the answer is of course both.

The climate crisis is a crisis of many things: science economics politics immigration. As the author Amitav Ghosh said “the climate crisis is also a crisis of culture and thus of the imagination.” To be clear that doesn’t mean innovation or invention—we’ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces we don’t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need those skills we also need so much more. When I survey the field it’s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.

We talk a lot about building a “livable future” but what does that really mean? Not much for those of us barely surviving today. Furthermore I don’t want a future that’s merely livable. I want a beautiful world. I’m sick of nightmares and I’m ready to dream again. Current Issue View our current issue

I’d like to introduce to everyone the concept of world-building. At its core world-building is what it sounds like: the process of creating an imaginary world for a work of fiction. It’s the practice of taking the ideas in your head the sensations from your imagination and allowing people to see what you see feel what you feel. It’s as much about creating new things as it is about destroying old structures and assumptions. It’s an art not a science.

World-building is often thought to be the domain of science fiction but any work of fiction or even nonfiction requires it. You have to build the world as your character sees it because as every novelist knows world-building is more about the characters than about the environment. And so it is in life: None of us experiences the world the same way so we live in our own little versions of it.

We need to apply world-building to the planet we live on. While artists might be the most accomplished at this they can’t do it alone this time. We’re all going to have to push our imaginations. Here’s one way to start: Close your eyes and think of the world as you see it. Remember that world-building begins with the main character. (That’s you!) So ask yourself: Who are you and what do you stand for? And now what do the people around you stand for?

Picture your surroundings. Observe everything that’s beautiful and everything that’s ugly scary uncertain: the storms the fires the injustices the screaming the gnashing of teeth. As you consider your surroundings—including the laws of society and mores of culture—take note of how you feel in them how you interact with them. Think about what you can change and what you can’t. Open your eyes. Breathe.

Now close your eyes and imagine the world you want to live in. You’re starting with the same main character. (Still you!) But maybe the people around you have changed. What do they value in this world? How do they treat each other? What’s important in this new world and what isn’t? What does power—not just electricity—look like? How does the air feel on your skin? What does it smell like? In my world there’s laughter and lightness in the air and it’s not weighed down with those noxious chemicals that make my nose burn. Memorize your version—every detail every sensation. You’ll need to keep coming back here until you make it real.

When you open your eyes ask yourself: Is there something from that world I can bring into this one? That’s your job now. If we’re going to make the world over let’s do it right. Let’s make a masterpiece.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L3NtZS1zZWN0b3Ivd2h5LWluZGlhcy1zb2xhci1wb3dlci1zZWN0b3ItbmVlZHMtYW4taW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1kcml2ZW4tdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODcyMTk2MjQuY21z0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9zbWFsbC1iaXovc21lLXNlY3Rvci93aHktaW5kaWFzLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLXNlY3Rvci1uZWVkcy1hbi1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWRyaXZlbi10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODcyMTk2MjQuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why India's solar power sector needs an innovation-driven transformation,India aims to achieve 100GW of solar power production by 2022. At first such an ambitious project may seem like a herculean task. But on the other hand it may not be too difficult for the country to achieve its long-term energy goals. India aims to achieve 450 GW Renewable energy capacities by 2030 of which about 280 GW is expected to be solar energy . There is a huge potential in the country for solar power due to the geographical location and terrain of the country. This gives the country an edge over other nations. Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan is the largest producer of solar power plants with a capacity of 2245 MW. Currently in India 90% of the current solar photovoltaic (PV) panel installations are based on crystalline silicon which maxes out at about 22% efficiency. There are other technologies being developed such as ‘perovskite crystal coated panels’ which can bring up this efficiency to about 27%. Also efficiency improvements led to price reductions to such levels that PVs acquired the most dominant position on the world energy stage. Global investment in new renewable energy capacity in the past decade was over $2.5 trillion with more solar power capacity installed than other generation technologies according to the Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2019 report published by the UN Environment Programme.Floating solar plants are also something worth observing; the cooling effect of the surrounding water allows floating panels to produce up to 10% more electricity and slows module degradation. Floating solar plants currently being developed in India are as follows:· Omkareshwar Dam floating solar farm. Capacity – 600MW. Estimated investment – Rs 30 bn Kayamkulam solar project . Capacity – 105MW. Estimated investment – Rs 3.43 bn· NTPC Ramagundam solar power plant . Capacity – 100 MW. Estimated investment – Rs 4.32bnThat said India has already proven itself a leader in solar development having achieved its previous 2022 target of 20 GW – way earlier than expected. The country also hopes to leverage the latest technologies to establish a solar template. However managing and maintaining large-scale solar facilities could be a challenge for the country as there are several electrical components required which India currently imports from its neighbour China and other countries. A hurdle for India is its current dependence on imports to a large degree for solar modules. Another hurdle is financing rates for loans etc. in the renewable sector which is around 12-14% which discourages companies from investing in solar projects. Thus it needs to gauge the availability of technical components manpower and site selection carefully before taking the process to such magnitude.The solar industry is now exploring how digital tools can help them unlock more of the sun’s potential – amid the restrictions and challenges. The solar industry in India has received considerable support from the government during the pandemic. Initiatives such as reducing repo rate making solar plant O&M an essential service removing tariff caps for solar tenders PLI scheme among others are some of the steps the government has taken to help the sector.Earlier this year the IREDA invited bids from solar module manufacturers to set up manufacturing units in India offering them benefits under the PLI Scheme. This is a huge step towards reducing dependency on imports when it comes to solar modules. This will reduce dependency on oil-producing companies and even bring down fuel imports.As countries around the world look on India has a huge opportunity to tap its resources bring in the latest technology in use and use the geological advantage to become the global manufacturing hub for renewable energy. A policy framework encompassing both tariff and non-tariff barriers to boost domestic solar manufacturing is needed.Solar PV tariff dipped to Rs 2.44 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) from about Rs 15 / kWh in the past decade in India. The current decade will be accompanied by more innovations and developments as the country has already learned the art of installing power plants with capacities going up to thousands of megawatts. Here is how technology is playing its part in setting up solar structures and can make it a more efficient process. With the rise in demand storage will become a critical part when it comes to renewable energy. The inclusion of monitoring through the Internet of Things and automation will make plants flexible for fluctuating demand. Silicon-based solar cells for example are well-established technology. They may however be taken over by perovskite solar cells — synthetic hybrid organic-inorganic compounds.Asset and demand-side management will be key and data analytics and digitization of storage could play a major role here. There are immense opportunities for innovation in the field of solar and renewable energy. The innovation in the design of solar plants and maintaining grid stability will also help in changing regulations and standards as solar continues to gain currency. It will be interesting to see how India leverages these changing technologies in the face of several challenges it faces in the energy sector. Digitization delivers unmatched improvements in efficiency and modern technology is helping to drive down development costs.India imports roughly 85% of its solar cells and modules from nearby China. However it plans to make 36 GW of solar components domestically within the next few years. Moreover it has enough IT talent that can help in cultivating IT-based solutions. If India continues to build on technological gains it will be able to achieve long-term renewable energy targets easily.The writer is Managing Director Salasar Techno Engineering Ltd.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9kdC5jby5uei9yZWdpb25zL3dhbmFrYS9oZWxwaW5nLWFjaGlldmUtZW1pc3Npb25zLXRhcmdldHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Helping to achieve emissions targets,"Eric Pyle is the director of public affairs and policy for solarZero.

Wanaka has long summer days but in winter it averages just 120 hours of sunshine for the month of June.

At first glance it might not be the best suited location for solar energy installations but it could soon become New Zealand’s first solar powered town.

From 2016 to 2019 the Queenstown Lakes district grew by nearly 40% making it the fastest growing district in New Zealand and the increasing demand for energy was starting to put a strain on the electricity network owned by lines company Aurora Energy.

Aurora Energy called for registrations of interest for alternatives that would defer the need to upgrade its power lines from Cromwell to Wanaka and save the company millions of dollars in new infrastructure.

In January this year the company announced it had entered into a partnership with solarZero the country’s only all-in-one solar power company.

Since May subcontractor Infinity Energy has been installing the solarZero solar PV and battery hardware smart management system and real-time monitoring in homes and businesses across the Wanaka and the Upper Clutha.

SolarZero director of public affairs and policy Eric Pyle said the smart Panasonic battery was the game-changer as it allowed stored power to be accessed even when the sun was not shining.

‘‘We have never been able to vary demand very much people come home and want to cook their dinner and they are not going to wait until 9 o’clock at night’’ Mr Pyle said.

‘‘But with smart batteries we can start to shift the power demand around and massively reduce the evening peak power demand which is what Aurora were interested in.’’

In July the Electricity Authority released a discussion paper on how to support a low emissions economy.

Authority chairwoman Dr Nicki Crauford said the key to a successfully transition and to meet the Government’s targets was investment in new generation and innovation.

‘‘Distributors are at the centre of this’’ she said.

The decades-old electricity supply model dominated by large scale and specialised electricity businesses was changing.

New technologies that generated stored or managed energy (known as distributed energy resources or DER) were giving households businesses and industrial consumers more options and control and transforming distribution networks.

This increase in distributed energy resources — including generation batteries EV charging and demand response — would help lower emissions Dr Crauford said.

It could help drive down costs as DER and other services were not like monopoly distribution networks and the competition could lead to more choice of a suppliers and services for consumers.

A cost-benefit analysis by Sapere (commissioned by the Electricity Authority) estimated if DER realised its potential the net benefit from 2021 to 2050 could be $7.1billion in present value.

Of this $2.3billion would be accrued to consumers and $4.8billion would go to owners and operators of the DER.

DER can be owned by consumers but can also be owned and or operated by third parties or distributors.

This was the business model for solarZero which charged the consumer or householder a monthly rental fee.

SolarZero communications spokeswoman Angela Hayes said their subcontractor was installing about three to five solarZero systems a week in the Upper Clutha and was on target to connect 150 homes in the first year of the project.

She said after the North Island power blackouts in August solarZero had a 54% more inquiries through its website ‘‘so having backup power is really important’’.

Mr Coates said Aurora and solarZero staff worked together to design and implement the control systems for new technologies used to generate store and manage energy and were aiming to be fully operational by April next year."

Commentary

The General Assembly doesn’t seem to understand that its job isn’t to limit women’s options for pregnancies nor to require everyone in Ohio to pack heat.

Instead Ohio’s state senators and representatives are supposed to be Brush Hogs hacking and thinning Ohio’s bureaucratic thicket. Too bad they aren’t.

A good place to start would be Ohio’s bloated K-12 bureaucracies. Ohio ranks No. 34 among the 50 states in geographic size. Ohio has 609 school districts not counting vocational districts. Texas ranks No. 2 (after Alaska) among the 50 states in geographic area. Texas has 1029 school districts according to the Texas Association of School Boards.

Thomas Suddes:Ohio Legislature's sleight of hand reaches everything from sports betting to environment

There’s a lot not to like about Texas whose Legislature makes Ohio’s General Assembly look like a chapter of Mensa. But does anyone honestly think Ohio whose population isn’t really growing needs 609 school boards?

Likewise if COVID-19 has taught Ohio anything (besides the fact vaccines don’t magnetize the human body) it’s that Ohio’s public health laws need a rewrite. Their basic framework was hammered together in 1919 by a General Assembly that rural Ohio then dominated. Health boards and their staffs should be regionalized at least which is about the best you can expect of a Legislature that thinks Ohio’s Health Department is a dictatorship in waiting.

Thomas Suddes:'Forgetful' lawmakers focus on 'magnetic vaccines' and keep quiet as Ohioans continue to pay coal plant bailouts

Then there is the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio which depending on the day of the week either plays helpless bystander when electric and gas companies raise rates or cheers them on.

Opinion:Costly debacle shows why PUCO should be reformed to protect Ohioans from corrupt utilities

The panel created just before World War I is even older than Ohio’s health boards. Its real purpose is to insulate governors and the Legislature from the consequences of pro-utility favors legislators pass and governors sign. In that respect the PUCO deserves a smidgen of sympathy for taking punches that should land elsewhere.

After all it is the Legislature not the PUCO that is sitting on major pro-consumer legislation such as Senate Bill 117 which would abolish one huge vestige of House Bill 6 the scandal-pocked nuclear power plant bailout law.

Legislators repealed some parts of HB 6 but not all. They left this part of the bill in place: Ohio electricity consumers are paying extra every month to subsidize three Ohio electric utilities that are among owners of two coal-fueled power plants one in Indiana.

House Bill 6:Lobbying push by lawyers others on FirstEnergy Solution's team detailed in filing

According to the Office of Consumers’ Counsel Ohio electricity consumers have paid American Electric Power AES/DP&L and Duke Energy more than $153 million so far in coal plant subsidies. SB 117 to repeal them is languishing in a Senate committee. The subsidy repeal’s sponsors are Sens. Mark Romanchuk an Ontario Republican and Hearcel Craig a Columbus Democrat.

Meanwhile the Legislature also is dawdling over a bill to abolish Ohio’s no-refund legal policy in instances when Ohio’s Supreme Court overturns a PUCO-approved rate boost That bill’s sponsors are Reps. Laura Lanese a Grove City Republican and Dan Troy a Willowick Democrat.

The legal rigmarole behind that rule which dates to a Cincinnati Bell rate case in the 1950s is kind of like what the British diplomat Palmerston said about a complicated German-Danish dispute: Only three people understood it he said: One died one went mad and the third Palmerston himself had “forgotten all about it.” But utilities’ lawyers haven’t forgotten the Keco case as it’s known which is why utility refunds are comparatively rare.

Any legislator who says he wants Ohio’s utility consumers to get a fair break – but won’t support the Romanchuk-Craig and Lanese-Troy bills – is being … economical … not with ratepayers’ money but with the truth.

Correction

Rep. Haraz Ghanbari a Perrysburg Republican voted “no” on House Bill 175 now in the Senate which would end Ohio’s regulation of ephemeral streams “surface water … that flows or pools only in response to precipitation such as rain or snow” the Legislative Service Commission reports.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency which answers to Gov. Mike DeWine opposes the bill as does a raft of environmental groups. My Oct. 10 column incorrectly said Grove City’s Lanese was the only House Republican to vote “no.”

In fact demand for Bucks jerseys increased 2530% in the hours after the team's Game 6 victory over the Phoenix Suns July 20 according to the sports betting site Sidelines.

Now if you purchase a couple more items or maybe just one more (who doesn't want to support the champs these days?) you can get a photo Saturday with the Larry O'Brien Trophy at the Bucks Pro Shop at Fiserv Forum 1111 Vel R. Phillips Ave.

Yes the same trophy that went home with Giannis Antetokounmpo after the Bucks defeated the Suns in Game 6 to win the team's first NBA championship in 50 years and then traveled to Chick-fil-A the next morning and even Greece in the following weeks.

You just have to spend $50.

A quick check of the online team store shows that buying a couple shirts or a single sweatshirt will put you over that $50 mark pretty quickly. A jersey will put you over the mark and then some.

The promotion runs from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Customers are asked to bring their own camera.

The Bucks who received their championship rings on Tuesday continue their three-game road trip Saturday with a game against the San Antonio Spurs.

As per a letter sent to Rane Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) has requested the minister to reach out to Ministry of Heavy Industries headed by Mahendra Nath Pandey for a mediation in the matter.

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

On September 9 Ford Motor Company decided to end its manufacturing operations followed by a phasing out of sales operations of its existing models due to ""huge accumulated losses and lack of growth in a difficult market"". This left Ford’s dealers high and dry.

As per FADA around 170 Ford dealers (with more than 300 dealership) have been impacted because of this sudden exit decision leading to loss of employment of around 40000. Dealers have collectively invested around Rs 2000 crore in setting up infrastructure required for the dealerships.

Ford’s exit has been the biggest so far from India in terms of job loss and shutting of dealerships. This is followed by the 2017 exit of General Motors which saw 142 dealers getting affected and a loss of employment of 15000.

In the letter addressed to Rane Vinkesh Gulati President FADA said “We humbly request your Ministry to speak to Ministry of Heavy Industries for an intervention in the matter.""

FADA wants the ministry to create a taskforce which takes day to day update from Ford India to monitor the compensation plan for automobile dealers and dealership employees instruct Ford India to keep FADA in loop for dealership related issues and compensation structure initiate a formal discussion on Automobile Dealers’ Protection Act and its importance to protect small and medium enterprises their skilled employees and the customers and make sure that Ford India indemnifies dealers from various consumer and civil cases both under pendency and against any future cases that may arise directly or indirectly out of Ford’s restructuring announcement.

FADA claims that Ford India is forcing its dealers to first sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before any discussion about future or compensation package is worked out. Many Ford dealers have directly or indirectly requested FADA to take up the matter for amicable resolution.

“Such coercive efforts on Ford's part to get their channel partners to sign an NDA under economic duress is not the right approach and adversely impacts dealer interests” Gulati said.

Ford invested about USD 2.5 billion at its Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and Sanand (Gujarat) plants after setting foot in India after mid-1990s. The company which made models like the Endeavour EcoSport and Figo has accumulated operating losses of around USD 2 billion in India in the last ten years.

Ford approached several automakers to sell its India plants before it decided to shut them down. These offers however were made during the peak of the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL29jdC8yNC93aHkteW91ci11c2VkLWZvcmQtZm9jdXMtY291bGQtYmUtd29ydGgtbW9yZS10aGFuLWEtbmV3LW9uZdIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL29jdC8yNC93aHkteW91ci11c2VkLWZvcmQtZm9jdXMtY291bGQtYmUtd29ydGgtbW9yZS10aGFuLWEtbmV3LW9uZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why your used Ford Focus could be worth more than a new one,"It used to hold that only classic cars were an investment but now the same is true if you own a Ford Focus.

Shifting secondhand motors is now a “nice little earner” as Cockney wheeler dealer Arthur Daley would have put it in the TV show Minder with prices surging 30% in the past year thanks to the ongoing shortage of computer chips stalling new car production according to figures from the website Motorway.

And last month one in six nearly new cars (aged up to 12 months old) were priced higher than the brand-new version separate data from the Auto Trader marketplace shows.

The traditional rules of motoring including that a car starts to shed value as soon as you drive home from the dealership no longer hold true as the supply of new cars dries up said Motorway’s chief executive Tom Leathes. “The numbers are massively reduced” he said. “The biggest reason is the chip shortage which means it is very difficult for car makers to manufacture in any volume so there are huge waiting lists.”

As a result the Motorway data shows big rises in the secondhand value of popular models such as the Ford Focus. Last month the average Focus as driven by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and singer Lily Allen sold for £13309 on the site which is £3346 – or 34% – more than a year ago. The value of a Nissan Qashqai another family choice had risen by nearly a quarter to £11525.

Last week data from the Office for National Statistics showed that used car prices were up by more than a fifth since April stoking inflation at a time when many Britons are worried about their household finances.

The increased cost of buying a car is not the only pressure facing motorists as in the wake of panic buying that emptied the country’s forecourts fuel prices are close to record highs.

Leathes said the shortage of new cars meant people who would normally buy brand new were opting for secondhand adding: “That means there’s more demand on used cars than ever before and there’s less of them particularly the nearly new stuff so that’s causing prices to go up significantly. We’re in unprecedented times – a used car is typically a depreciating asset.”

The squeeze is highlighted by industry data that shows the collapse in new car sales. Just 215000 new cars were registered last month the lowest figure since 1998. The numbers were a third down even on a weak 2020 when Covid restrictions hindered buying and selling and down almost 45% on the 10-year average before the pandemic.

With secondhand prices soaring Auto Trader figures show that in September one in six nearly new cars cost more than the new version.

The industry’s ruptured supply chain means the average waiting time for a new car is between four and six months but is up to 12 months for models such as the Land Rover Discovery Sport. Last week Jaguar Land Rover’s Halewood factory on Merseyside was forced to temporarily close because of the chip shortage.

“There have always been more than 100000 cars in the UK at any moment that consumers could get hold of with virtually immediate delivery” explained Ian Plummer Auto Trader’s commercial director. “No one has a good take on what that number is now but based on the evolution of available new cars on Auto Trader over the last six months or so it’s probably come down two-thirds.”

Demand is high as consumers look to buy or upgrade their vehicle using money saved during the lockdowns or as they switch away from public transport to get to work.

“I don’t think many people in the industry thought a 12-month-old car would ever be sold at a higher price than the new equivalent” said Plummer who added that the rate of secondhand price growth was still accelerating. Figures for the week before last show the average price of a used car was 23.9% higher than a year ago with Plummer adding: “At some point it has to start bottoming out but at the moment the fundamental drivers of the situation are nothing more than simple economics.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQyNzU3L2ZvcmQtYW5kLXRveW90YS1ib3RoLWhhdmUtaHlicmlkLXRydWNrLWVuZ2luZXMtbm93LXRoZS1wYXRoLXRoZXJlLXdhcy1hLXdlaXJkLW9uZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford and Toyota Both Have Hybrid Truck Engines Now. The Path There Was A Weird One,"Akio Toyoda the grandson of Toyota's founder Kiichiro Toyoda ascended to his role as president of Toyota in June of 2009. Thanks to the Great Recession he was saddled with the recovery from Toyota’s biggest loss in its history: $4.4 billion for the fiscal year. Before he could make a dent in that staggering number he faced a public relations firestorm starting when a 2009 Lexus sedan accelerated out of control and crashed killing all four people inside.

Toyota's unintended acceleration crisis and related tragedies that followed resulted in the recall of millions of vehicles. Clawing out of the ashes Toyota decided to “stop everything” and reduce fixed costs including R&D expenses according to the Toyota Times in 2020. A partnership opportunity with Ford took shape and in August of 2011 Ford and Toyota triumphantly announced a collaboration to develop a new hybrid system for light trucks and SUVs.

Today both companies have 3.5-liter V6 hybrid truck engines. But not thanks to that teamup. Let's unpack how that happened.

Touted as an equal partnership the stated goal was to accelerate the process and deliver better fuel efficiency for rear-wheel-drive vehicles. This made sense because Toyota was the undisputed king of hybrid technology and Ford was fighting its own battles post-recession. Maybe these two behemoths could ride the wave of a recovering economy by pooling resources and knowledge. At first it seemed like a winning strategy that would benefit customers above all. On the outside it looked a little like a “you show me yours and I’ll show you mine” exchange; indeed once each player compared notes the partnership saw the beginning of the end.

In the early stages of the flirtation then-Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally said: “By working together we will be able to serve our customers with the very best affordable advanced powertrains delivering even better fuel economy. This is the kind of collaborative effort that is required to address the big global challenges of energy independence and environmental sustainability.""

On the other side Akio Toyoda said “Toyota is extremely proud to join Ford in developing a hybrid system for pickup trucks and SUVs. Not only is this tie-up clearly one aimed at making automobiles ever better it should also become an important building block for future mobility in the U.S. By building a global long-term relationship with Ford our desire is to be able to continue to provide people in America automobiles that exceed their expectations.”

Eighteen months later the breakup was official. In July 2013 Toyota announced via press release that they completed their feasibility study for collaboration with Ford on the development of a new hybrid system for light trucks and SUVs and they agreed to develop hybrid systems individually. It's a little murky which manufacturer benefited more or if they spun away from each other with fresh ideas.

What is clear is the at the end of the brief dalliance each company took its toys and went home. Now with the launch of the 2022 Tundra people are talking about the fact that the 2021 F-150 has a twin-turbo hybrid V6 and so does the 2022 Tundra. Coincidence? In fact yes.

Tundra's new iForce Max V6 hybrid Toyota

Ford's 2021 hybrid F-150 mates a 44-hp electric motor (and 221 pound-feet of torque) to its 394-hp 492 pound-foot 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 EcoBoost engine. In total the output maxes out at 430 hp and 570 lb-ft of grunt. In contrast Toyota’s brand-new 2022 Tundra tops Ford with an extra seven horsepower for a total of 437 generated by its 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 hybrid and bests the F-150 in torque by 13 for a total of 583 pound-feet.

When it comes to towing Ford has the edge: with the max tow package the 2021 F-150 with a 3.5L V6 EcoBoost can tow up to 14000 pounds. Toyota's iForce Max tops out at 12000; and by the way that's a jump of 2000 pounds more than the previous generation.

Comparing battery power the F-150 mounted a 1.5-kWh lithium-ion battery under the bed while Toyota opted for a 1.5-kWh nickel-metal hydride battery stowed under the rear seat. Ford marketed the generator features of the 2021 F-150 and its ability to power several electric tools or even a whole house.

Even the displacement is different: the F-150’s V6 EcoBoost is 3497 cubic centimeters and the Tundra’s V6 iForce Max is 3445 cubic centimeters. The compression ratio of the EcoBoost is 10.5:1; iForce Max is 10.4:1.

For those who claim Toyota is copying Ford's engine Toyota execs set the record straight.

""The i-Force and i-Force Max do share some basic architecture with the Lexus LS 500 twin-turbo V6 but the engineering team had to make significant changes so it can stand up to the higher average duty cycle demands placed on truck powertrains"" said Toyota Product Communications Senior Analyst Josh Burns. ""That means things like greater cooling capacity superior oil cooling capability and even greater oil volume will help support a full-size truck application and its payload and towing demands as well. The core concept was to increase performance and efficiency over the previous generation but at the end of the day it needs to be a no-compromise engine. Our engineers met this demand with flying colors.""

Toyota's Joe Moses said the company's data shows that Tundra buyers tend to be more active-outdoor enthusiast types than the work-truck customer of Ford's F-150 and they're distancing themselves from any similarities. For instance Toyota’s Chief Engineer for the Tundra Mike Sweers told me they discovered their customers don’t want the extra cost for adding a generator to the truck (like Ford does for its full-size truck). For less money he said Toyota’s customers can buy their own generator and use it where and when they want.

Kevin McCauley/capturingthemachine.com

If the brand is reading the room properly it should have a decent uptake on the V6 hybrid but expect more of its truck buyers to choose the gas-only V6 iForce for now.

In any case both engines have larger towing capacity and the gas-only V6 has better fuel economy than before so they seem to be on the right track. Just a couple of days ago Toyota put an exclamation point on its electrification commitment with an announcement that it will invest about $3.4 billion in automotive batteries in the U.S. through 2030.

Toyota

Currently electrified vehicles account for nearly 25 percent of Toyota’s U.S. sales volume. The company expects that number to rise to nearly 70 percent by 2030. To meet the growing demand Toyota continues to steadily expand its lineup of electrified vehicles (including hybrid plug-in hybrid fuel cell and battery electric vehicles) from 55 models to about 70 models by 2025.

“Look at the marketplace and where it’s going” Burns said. “We’re all moving in the same direction of emissions and fuel economy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvYXV0by9hdXRvLW5ld3MvZm9yZC1pbmZ1c2VzLW92ZXItcnMtNTAwMC1jcm9yZS1pbi1pbmRpYW4tdW5pdC10by1tYW5hZ2UtZXhpdC1jb3N0cy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NzIxMzkwMC5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2F1dG8vYXV0by1uZXdzL2ZvcmQtaW5mdXNlcy1vdmVyLXJzLTUwMDAtY3JvcmUtaW4taW5kaWFuLXVuaXQtdG8tbWFuYWdlLWV4aXQtY29zdHMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg3MjEzOTAwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford infuses over Rs 5000 crore in Indian unit to manage exit costs,"

US automaker Ford Motor Co has infused more than Rs 5000 crore in its Indian subsidiary just weeks into announcing its exit from this market.The funds have been infused in two tranches — Rs 2175 crore in September and Rs 2900 crore this month totalling Rs 5075 crore according to financial data sourced through business intelligence platform Tofler.The reason behind the fund infusion in the Indian subsidiary is not known but it is likely to be used for settling outstanding payments with dealers and vendors and providing separation packages to employees.An email sent to Ford India did not elicit any response till press time Friday. Ford India’s spokesperson could not be contacted over the phone.At the time of announcing its exit from India last month Ford had said it was expected to take a pre-tax special item charge of about $2 billion — about $0.6 billion in 2021 $1.2 billion in 2022 and the balance in subsequent years. Of this the cash charges total about $1.7 billion and will be paid primarily in 2022 towards settlements and other payments it had said.With close to $2 billion of accumulated loss and falling volumes in India Ford Motor was compelled to pull the shutters down on its subsidiary here. The decision has impacted more than 4000 employees across its manufacturing facilities and corporate offices.The company is talking to multiple parties to sell manufacturing facilities in Chennai and at Sanand in Gujarat.Within a month of pulling the plug on the Indian operation Ford India managing director Anurag Mehrotra had exited the company and joined Tata Motors.There are speculations on Tata Motors acquiring Ford's manufacturing facility in Chennai. The Indian company’s executives have met government officials in Tamil Nadu over the matter.Under new CEO Jim Farley Ford Motor has taken hard decisions as it tries to compete hard with global rivals. Under Farley the company had decided to cease manufacturing operations in Brazil earlier this year.Ford India said in September that it would cease manufacturing vehicles for sale in India immediately.

By Vinkesh Gulati

On September 9 2021 Ford India announced it is ‘restructuring’ its domestic operations. This means discontinuation of all models it used to sell closing manufacturing plants in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and for all practical purposes a clear exit from the Indian automobile market. There have been enough debates on what this means for the industry and the hardships it will create for dealerships in terms of loss of jobs livelihood and economic security. But it is equally important to discuss the repercussions on one of the most important stakeholders in this chain the Indian consumer.

This announcement came a day before Ganesh Chaturthi (which marks the beginning of the festive season a period considered auspicious for buying cars gold property etc). But for Ford dealers and buyers this Ganesh Chaturthi was anything but auspicious. Dealers were left to deal with angry and confused customers who were cancelling bookings asking for refunds and refusing to take delivery. Most vehicle purchases happen through financing and consumers look at price brand fuel efficiency after-sales support and resale value before buying a car. From the distress that followed Ford’s announcement it is clear that most consumers would not have decided to buy a Ford car if they knew the company was shutting shop but are now stuck with a product whose future is uncertain and which has been bought at a major financial cost.

The concerns of Ford consumers stem from the past experience of similar exits by other automakers from India. In spite of assurances by General Motors post their exit in 2017 the availability of GM spare parts and its service centre network have dried completely. Consumers pay road tax on vehicles for 15 years so it is fair to expect service support and availability of spare parts for at least that duration. The lack of after-sales support has a negative effect on a consumer’s car-owning experience and may encourage the fake auto parts industry having direct consequences for road safety. Such exits also have a knock-on economic effect since the resale value of cars plummet sharply after a manufacturer’s exit.

Ford’s exit can also lead to a situation where a consumer may not have a clear legal recourse in case there are issues related to product liability or warranty. Unfortunately in such cases consumers often tend to take legal action against dealers the only face of the brand left on the street. In one case a dealer of United Motorcycles had to deal with a consumer complaint that arose out of manufacturing defects which should clearly be under the manufacturer’s ambit. In Ford’s case too the manufacturer’s exit may lead to onerous legal burden on the dealer while also leaving the consumer with no certain solution.

In fact Ford’s exit leaves everyone in a bad position—around 170 dealers with 391 outlets are staring at a loss upwards of Rs 2000 crore in sunk investment costs. Around 40000 employees working at these dealerships are facing loss of livelihood and over 10 lakh Ford customers in India have a product whose future performance and value is uncertain. Ford was setting up new dealerships in India till at least a few months before this announcement and dealers who had been kept in the dark were taking bookings till a day before the exit was announced. While companies should be able to exit the market based on economic considerations it is also important that all affected stakeholders have their interests safeguarded.

We do not currently have provisions that protect the interests of dealers and consumers in the same manner. The enactment of an automobile dealer’s protection Act can be helpful in this regard. It can ensure there is clear and defined responsibility in the case of product liability and warranty infringement creating a pathway for the consumer in terms of legal recourse. Most consumers will never directly interact with OEMs and their ownership experience will largely depend on their interaction with dealers. Hence an Act that guarantees the obligations of OEMs towards dealers will provide a degree of assurance to the consumer as well. The creation of a clear structured delineated framework can help alleviate the anxiety and uncertainty related to an exit while ensuring that the exit leads to minimal disruption in the market.

“I can’t stress this enough. It’s not about left or right not who’s conservative or liberal. Last time I checked everyone regardless of political persuasion is coming down with this” Cavuto told Howard Kurtz on Fox News’ media program “MediaBuzz” on Sunday. “Take the political speaking points and toss them! For now I’m begging you toss them! And think of what’s good not only for yourself but those around you.”



Cavuto has a long public history of health issues including multiple sclerosis and a compromised immune system making him particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. During the remote interview he noted that recent COVID-19 reports show that around half of the breakthrough cases of COVID among vaccinated individuals are of immunocompromised people.

“There are many like that all around us and mine is not secret at Fox. But there are plenty of people around you Howie at Fox and all types of business environments who are susceptible to this kind of thing” he said.



While Fox News has not issued a vaccine mandate for its workers parent company Fox Corporation revealed last month that 90% of its employees across all its divisions have been vaccinated. Fox workers who are not vaccinated must take regular COVID-19 tests.



Yet the network has come under fire for its pundits’ attacks on the Biden Administration and other state and local governments that have implemented such mandates on government employees and requirements to show vaccination or negative COVID test proof to enter businesses and public events.

The issue has even divided contributors at the network. Hours prior to Cavuto’s “MediaBuzz” segment Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe said on “Unfiltered with Dan Bongino” that she will not get vaccinated in protest of the Biden Administration. Meanwhile Fox News medical expert Dr. Nicole Saphier criticized those who cited the COVID-related death of former State Sec. Colin Powell to challenge the efficacy of vaccines.



While Cavuto says he understands his viewers’ sentiments on mandates he urged them to think about how their actions affect the most vulnerable. “Life is too short to be an ass. Life is way too short to be ignorant of the promise of something that is helping people worldwide” he begged. “Stop the deaths. Stop the suffering. Please get vaccinated. Please.“



Watch Cavuto’s segment on “MediaBuzz” in the clip above.

The all-weather channel will become a competitor to The Weather Channel and Accuweather but will be available free on OTT systems and platforms.

""If you're asking about climate change climate change is part of our lives"" Sharri Berg the Fox executive who will head the division told Variety.

""It's how we live. It's not going to be ignored. We will be reporting facts.""

It's inevitable that questions would be asked about how the fledgling network will handle the controversial subject of climate change given Fox News Channel's long history of discounting it reports The Washington Post.

Many of the new network's early hires are saying the network will have more of a focus on climate science including Emmy-award-winning weather forecaster Amy Freeze from New York's ABC affiliate and Shane Brown a former senior weather product expert from The Weather Channel.

“From hiring decisions to this rhetoric from their CEO to this need to have a safe space for advertisers it does suggest that they could very much embrace climate change in their programming” Allison Fisher the director of the climate and energy program at Media Matters a liberal media watchdog group told The Post.

But if Fox Weather does allow more focus on climate change the network is running a risk of alienating core Fox News watchers and advertisers she said.

""There is a line that they are going to have to walk to keep advertisers feeling like their brand is safe there but not going too far away from their base"" said Fisher. ""If something major happens like a hurricane or a heatwave all eyes are going to be looking to them to see how they are characterizing it.""

Fox News controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch has long allowed his outlets to cast skepticism on climate change claims and initiatives that would limit traditional carbon-based fuels.

But that editorial viewpoint appears to be changing.

As Murdoch's sprawling Australian media empire faced the possible loss of millions of dollars in ad revenue for not signing on to a liberal climate change agenda his outlets did a 180-degree pivot.

In September the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Murdoch’s media companies were launching a campaign to promote the benefits of a carbon-neutral economy and back Australia’s zero-emissions goals set for 2050.

The pro-global warming policy is expected to reach Murdoch's other properties as well including Fox News The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post according to media experts.

The newfound emphasis on climate change may put Fox Weather at odds with Fox News’ traditional conservative base many of whom harbor strong doubts as to the causes of global warming and potential remedies.

A 2019 Pew study found that 45% of conservative Republicans believed that climate change was a function of natural earth cycles and another 39% believed humans only played “some” role in the phenomena.

Even more editorial changes could come at Fox when Murdoch now 90 passes and leaves control to James Murdoch his son who has been a strong supporter of climate change initiatives.

Fox Weather will be an ad-supported streaming service that is reporting national and regional weather as well as regular forecasts and will rely on news reporting from Fox News Channel and from meteorologists from television stations owned by Fox nationwide.

Weather Channel owner Byron Allen said he's not concerned about competition from Rupert Murdoch who he considers ""one of the best of the best as far as media moguls.""

Fox has invested more than $10 million into its new weather venture which will include a staff of more than 100 people including 40 meteorologists and contributions from another 120 meteorologists from Fox's network of television stations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGNoZXN0ZXJtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbGlmZS1zdHlsZS93ZXN0Y2hlc3Rlci13b21lbi1idXNpbmVzcy0yMDIxL9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGNoZXN0ZXJtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbGlmZS1zdHlsZS93ZXN0Y2hlc3Rlci13b21lbi1idXNpbmVzcy0yMDIxLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Westchester’s Women in Business in 2021 Are Making an Impact,"Photography by Toshi Tasaki | Shot on location at The Opus Westchester Kanopi BLT in White Plains

MEGHANN HONGACH

General Manager

Ridge Hill

Retail executives coping with the pandemic must be smart creative and resilient. Meghann Hongach general manager of the Ridge Hill shopping center in Yonkers is all of those things.

Hongach has been involved with Ridge Hill since the very start taking a job with the mall’s developer Forest City Ratner in 2006. “This was an amazing opportunity to see a project through from planning to construction” Hongach says. Eventually transitioning to operations she says she “wore many different hats and as Ridge Hill grew so did I.”

And grow it did. Opening in 2011 the outdoor mall designed to resemble a small-town Main Street sits on an 82-acre hillside site overlooking the NY Thruway and offers some 1.3 million square feet of retail and office space. But in 2020 COVID-19 changed almost everything.

“Many retail properties experienced vacancies. Ridge Hill was no different” Hongach says. To adapt Ridge Hill embraced its outdoor environment by offering a community garden farmer’s market concerts open-air movies and additional seating. “We’ve closed our streets allowing for space to spread out” Hongach explains. “These efforts have brought traffic back to prepandemic levels which is a really positive sign and a key step to filling what vacancies remain.”

Brick-and-mortar retail will never go away “but customers need new reasons to visit stores” Hongach adds. “We want people to come to Ridge Hill to enjoy themselves. We want to present them with a beautiful place where there is always something going on.”

Dr. Tania Dempsey is a 1996 graduate of The Johns Hopkins Medical School and was practicing medicine in a busy and successful practice when something began to nag at her.

“I became frustrated with traditional medicine. I couldn’t spend the time I wanted with my patients” she says. “You could never get to the root of their symptoms so instead we just put Band-Aids on things.” At a time when doctors sought out big practices and mergers to combat the demands of managed care Dempsey did the opposite by launching her own small fee-for-service practice. She admits it was scary at first but that she was committed and believed in what she was doing.

“I ran into someone whom I worked with at my old practice and he said that I would not succeed on my own” she recalls.

Not only did Dempsey succeed she actually outgrew that modest Armonk practice and moved to a larger facility in Purchase. Her practice has grown from just a handful of patients ten years ago to more than 5000 today. But Dempsey wasn’t done just yet. She moved into the realm of entrepreneur when she launched her own line of nutraceutical supplements AIM for Optimum Health which is sold in her office and in her online store (aimstore.net). She currently has more than 100 products in her product line along with roughly 600 other products including herbs specialty vitamins and food.

“I love my job and the work I do to help my patients. My office is like a second home. I spend so much time there it’s really more like my first home.”

DENISE MANANAS

St. John’s Riverside Hospital

Overseeing marketing communications and business development for Yonkers’ St. John’s Riverside Hospital and its community network for almost 30 years has been very gratifying for Denise Mananas senior director of external affairs.

The Yonkers native says she sees “a real purpose in servicing and serving a community that I grew up in and that I’m very fond of” noting that her duties have grown along with the organization one which now encompasses three hospital locations off-site physician’s offices a detox-and-rehab facility four outpatient rehab sites one nursing school and two medical residencies.

Having opened its doors back in 1869 the hospital has a long history in Westchester. Mananas coordinated its successful rebranding campaign 12 years ago with the tagline “St. John’s Riverside Hospital is Community Strong.” During the COVID surge last year that sentiment was unmistakably apparent with “an outpouring of love from people who came to support the hospital” Mananas recounts “as well as from the community of employees who were here for them… it was something to marvel at.” Many locals showed up with food and PPE donations while police fire department ambulance corps and even schoolchildren stepped up to help the effort — something that resonated deeply with Mananas who has a deep commitment to the hospital network and its place in the community.

“I’ve always chosen to work for a non-for-profit” she says “because I really feel very connected to the mission of the organization. I see such value in the services we provide.”

MASHA TURCHINSKY

Long before Masha Turchinsky took the reins as director and CEO of the Hudson River Museum (HRM) the Yonkers institution was already close to her heart. “The Hudson River Museum is one of the first museums I visited” recalls Turchinsky. “My parents and I have been going there my entire life and I credit the HRM with giving me the tools to have the confidence to explore the world at large.”

Prior to her work at the HRM Turchinsky spent 19 years advancing at New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. At HRM Turchinsky led a complete rebranding of the institution pioneered a unique diversity initiative forged new partnerships with organizations such as Art Bridges and Bloomberg Philanthropies and managed to retain all HRM staff while creating a lively roster of virtual programming during the pandemic. In addition Turchinsky also broke ground on the museum’s new $12.3 million wing.

In 2017 Turchinsky became one of only 111 female museum directors in North America to have been inducted into the Association of Art Museum Directors and was honored the following year with a Women of Distinction Award by the Yonkers City Council and elected to the National Board of Trustees of Art Table.

For Turchinsky inclusion lies at the heart of all these efforts. “Museums really are at their best when people feel welcome and reflected in some way during their visits” she explains. “This can be a warm greeting when you walk in seeing a work of art that depicts someone who looks like you or a speaker or program you can relate to. No one should have to step inside the door without feeling embraced.”

DEBORAH NOVICK

Director

Entrepreneurship & Innovation Westchester County

As director of Entrepreneurship and Innovation for Westchester County Deborah Novick hasn’t let the grass grow under her feet. Appointed to her new post right as the coronavirus slammed Westchester in March of 2020 Novick hit the ground running having initiated multiple programs designed to help both startups and established businesses pivot and even grow. She was also instrumental in launching the third cohort of the county’s highly successful business incubator program Element 46 in addition to creating and overseeing Launch1000 which is providing 1000 Westchesterites the opportunity to start their own businesses.

One of Novick’s most impressive accomplishments however was launching the Westchester County Biosciences Accelerator program. Now in its third year the Biosciences Accelerator readies academic and corporate spinouts inventors and first-time founders to be successful entrepreneurs in the biotech industry. As Westchester continues to emerge as a cynosure of biotech in New York State and beyond it’s a virtual certainty that Novick will be at the heart of it.

Prior to her current role Novick made a name for herself as the director of New York Medical College’s BioInc which specifically designs turnkey wet labs dry labs offices and more to support early-stage companies and high-potential entrepreneurs within the biotech and medtech sectors.

“Deborah is highly respected across the county for her depth of expertise in business strategy development and execution” says Bridget Gibbons director of economic development for Westchester County. “She has had a profound impact across the business community with her seemingly limitless capacity to create and execute impactful programs that result in success for startups and mature businesses alike.”

Luisa DeCicco did not shy away from the challenges that the pandemic presented to DeCicco Supermarkets and her workers. Before information about the virus was widespread DeCicco had devised ways to keep her employees safe and protected while continuing to serve the community. She not only secured PPE for her employees a scarcity at the time but also set up a mobile testing unit that was free to employees. Hot meals were provided every single day and are still free for staff. “The most important thing was keeping our employees safe” says DeCicco. “They are the company. We want them to feel like family.”

DeCicco has become accustomed to adapting and problem-solving. Having earned a PhD from Columbia University in engineering just a few years after emigrating from Italy (where she also holds a high engineering degree) DeCicco uses that experience and training in her new role. “A team is like a puzzle: Everyone has a strength that they add and when put in the right places they fit perfectly” she says. When she created the HR department for the supermarket chain she was a staff of one overseeing the two stores at the time. Since then DeCicco has been integral in growing the business to nine locations and 1100 employees. For DeCicco every success and setback are learning moments. “Every time you get up you get up stronger.”

Miriam Risko was singing before she could talk. She always knew the important role music played in the world and that she wanted to share her gifts with others. “If you have a voice use it. And I happen to be a singer” says Miriam. “Music is what makes the world a better place.”

When the Mike Risko Music School was founded in 1995 she was integral in its growth and development. With Miriam at the helm what started out as a small studio that could only support a few lessons at a time has evolved into a 3000-square-foot building that houses the music school on top and their retail store below it.

When the pandemic began the arts sector took a huge hit. For Miriam shutting the doors on her students was never an option. She created an entirely virtual division of every part of their business in addition to running a fully virtual music-theater program. Giving back during this time was very important to her so she organized free outdoor music classes singing telegrams to benefit healthcare workers and provided free music entertainment during fundraisers. “It’s all about the ability to give back to the community that supports us” Miriam says.

Mike Risko Music has been named one of the top music retailers in the world by the National Association of Music Merchants for the past eight years and Miriam has been invited to speak at their convention on her expertise in implementing hybrid music programs. Yet through all her success Miriam is still looking to the future. “It’s never been about ‘making it’; it’s always been about affecting people.”

The agency supports cancer patients and their families in many ways from grants for transportation to emotional support to navigating the complex healthcare system. Her commitment to help the community brought her to the agency’s board of directors who wound up turning to her when the executive director position became vacant. It wasn’t long before both Weiss and everyone else realized it was a perfect fit.

“I knew it was now or never” says Weiss of the move acknowledging her small-business career as the foundation of her success with the Cancer Support Team. “The ability to forecast the environment set goals and manage and nurture a staff were and are central to the position” she says. All of that was put to the test in the last 18 months when the agency was challenged to reach people despite all of the pandemic-related restrictions.

“We met with people electronically visited them on their porches on park benches and in cars parked side-by-side. We did whatever it took” she says.

Weiss cites her attention to detail and patience as central to her ability to lead — along with a more philosophical outlook. “Try to love what you do never stop learning and do things that really make you feel like you’re making a difference.”

That mission is to address the needs of those facing a life-limiting illness with dignity and compassion by offering a medical director nurses home health aides spiritual care pain management emotional support and bereavement services. And “thanks to a very generous donor” says Spengler “massage reflexology art therapy and music therapy.”

Despite the pandemic Spengler was able to keep HOW’s staff employed and the organization running accommodating patients where they reside (private homes nursing or assisted-living facilities) just as it always has. “The most common message we hear is that families wish they had learned about us sooner” she says. “To some hospice is a taboo concept and I want to get the message out that hospice helps patients and families achieve their end-of-life goals; people should explore the hospice concept and not be afraid of it.”

As the first woman corporate officer for FUJIFILM in the United States Judy Melillo is helping to change the face of legal counsel in the county and the country. In fact in September Melillo was named to Profiles in Diversity Journal’s 2021 list of “Women Worth Watching” and considering her array of accomplishments this is likely sage advice.

Leading a talented team of more than 40 compliance safety internal audit and environmental health professionals Melillo is tasked with managing the legal affairs of FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation as well as its 23 subsidiaries in North America and Latin America. Melillo has also spearheaded many mergers and acquisitions including that of Kalon Biotherapeutics and the integration of FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies which today crafts vaccine products to fight COVID.

Giving back is also vitally important to Melillo who in 2019 served as chair of the American Heart Association’s Westchester “Go Red for Women” campaign leading fundraising and community outreach to help raise awareness and money to fight heart disease.

For Melillo this effort is all part of her mission to elevate the next generation of change makers. “It’s really important to focus on defining what success means for you and not letting others define that” shares Melillo. “You have to keep redefining that because you are not going to be the same person you are now through your whole career. Take the risk to say no to opportunities but also take the risk to say yes to them.”

Tatiana Diaz resident experience manager with the Ginsburg Development Companies (GDC) is very good at her job. She works to enhance the lives of residents in the company’s nine luxury rental properties in Westchester building community along the way. That sense of community has even spilled over into romance. “At least six couples met at our events got married and started families” Diaz says.

Since joining GDC in 2018 Diaz has planned happy hours barbecues book clubs paint-and-sips mommy-and-me classes and more. When the pandemic hit last year Diaz worked harder holding many events virtually. She also staged concerts that residents could view from their private balconies. “It was great to see people out there dancing sipping cocktails and having fun safely” Diaz says. She helped local businesses and the needy during the pandemic as well arranging online cooking classes with Westchester chefs and Takeout Tuesdays in which nearby restaurants made special menus for GDC residents. GDC management matched 10% of sales from this promotion donating nearly $3000 to Feeding Westchester Diaz says.

Giving back to residents and the community is simply good business adds Diaz noting that a majority of the activities are free paid for through her department’s budget. Leasing agents tell her these perks seal deals. “My goal was to make us really stand out from other developments” Diaz says. “Yes you pay a premium for some of these rental units but it comes with so much.”

The Arc Westchester provides services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families including education career training and recreation. Some 2000 individuals a day make use of these programs and 240 individuals live in 45 The Arc Westchester residences throughout the county.

The money needed to provide this support is largely provided through government funding but not completely. This is where The Arc Westchester Foundation comes in says its executive director Nancy Patota. “In order for The Arc Westchester to continue to be a leader in our field we have to innovate and enhance programs” she explains. “We close the gap between state funding and what it really costs to ensure the best outcomes for our individuals.”

Patota is passionate about fundraising and it shows. She joined The Arc Westchester Foundation in 2014 and under her leadership the foundation has raised well over $14 million. When the pandemic hit she quickly raised $400000 for a Covid Emergency Relief Fund. Her foundation also manages investments for the long-term financial health of the organization.

“Anyone who says a nonprofit doesn’t have to apply business acumen is clueless about what it takes to run a foundation” says Patota who has the credentials to back up her claim. Armed with an MBA from Iona College she is now an adjunct professor with the MBA program there.

That said successful fundraising often comes down to maintaining strong personal relationships as Patota explains. “We really get to know our families and our donors. We form deep connections. That’s how we change lives.”

Dr. Xenia Frisby is first a clinician who diagnoses and treats individual patients — but she has always been interested in the bigger picture as well. Assessing the quality of a hospital’s systems and its overall culture has provided her a chance to make an even greater impact on patient outcomes. “It brings me back to why I originally got into medicine as a first-generation physician” Frisby says “which was to help as many people as possible.”

As associate chief quality officer and hospitalist director at Bronxville’s NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital Frisby monitors quality metrics and patient safety with the goal of improving processes ensuring high-quality care and lowering costs. “I am particularly proud of our work on the enterprise-wide mortality goal” she says “where we look at the rate in the hospital and see how we can make it better from bedside care to improving documentation.”

Frisby’s organizational oversight became especially important after the hospital began treating so-called “patient zero” identified as Westchester’s first confirmed COVID-19 case.

From there she worked as a project manager for the NYC Parks Department managing the funding for green infrastructure and creating the first green infrastructure maintenance protocol for the city. With a multitude of successfully completed projects under her belt and a deep understanding of the importance of green spaces Bayley founded Plan It Wild.

The company has a very simple mission with a global impact: to transform residential and commercial landscapes into better environments by putting biodiversity back into the ecosystem expanding the population of pollinators and creating homes for wildlife. “We can help restore nature in our own private yards” explains Bayley. “The monarch butterfly can only land on milkweed. If we don’t have that plant we don’t have butterflies. So not only is it beautiful it’s also functional.”

The landscaping sector is a $105 billion industry that is overwhelmingly male-dominated. “You’ve got so few women running these businesses and it’s not a very environmentally sound industry” says Bayley. “It’s already an uphill battle.” But Bayley shows no signs of balking at the speed bumps and has plans to (literally) expand her grassroots environmental crusade with for example a mindful maintenance division which will mow your lawn with an electric machine.

For Bayley creating “the now” also means building a better future for county wildlife even if it’s one yard at a time. “I love seeing a planting years after it’s been completed” she says “because it’s functioning as it’s supposed to.”

The games had record viewership and highlighted the potential success for the league this season.

Here is a look at 7 stocks to watch during the 2021-22 NHL season.

1. Walt Disney: One of the big winners from a strong NHL season could be the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney landed a deal with the NHL to bring games back to ESPN for the first time in 17 years.

Disney is paying a reported $400 million annually to be the lead television partner for the NHL. The seven-year contract sees Disney and Turner Sports an AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) unit splitting the coverage of NHL games that was previously aired with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).

Disney secured the rights to air 103 exclusive NHL games on ESPN ESPN+ ABC and Hulu. The deal also includes over 1000 out of market games to air on ESPN+. Disney will have the rights to the Stanley Cup Finals for four of the seven years including the current season.

Disney reported that it is mostly sold out of advertising slots for the 2021-22 season and could hit $100 million in sales for the season.

“We are very very well sold” Disney advertising sales President Rita Ferro told Front Office Sports. “We have a couple of positions left mostly in the playoffs and finals.”

The opening night doubleheader had average viewership of 884000 viewers during the five plus hours of coverage. The night marked the highest season opener doubleheader on record. The first game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Pittsburgh Penguins was the most viewed opening game on cable of all-time. The later 10:30 p.m. ET game between the Seattle Kraken and Las Vegas Golden Knights was the second most viewed regular season NHL game to begin after 9 p.m. ET in the league's history across cable and broadcast television.

2. AT&T: As mentioned above Turner Sports is the other major television partner for NHL content. Turner is paying a reported $225 million annually on the seven-year deal with the NHL.

The first two NHL games to be shown on Turner’s TNT this season averaged 817000 viewers and 522000 viewers averaging 670000 for the double header. The viewership from the NHL games topped the WNBA Finals a U.S. Men’s Soccer World Cup qualifier and NBA Preseason game on other networks. One of the two games was the most watched NHL game ever to air on the second night of a new NHL season.

3. Madison Square Garden Sports: Publicly traded Madison Square Garden Sports (NYSE:MSGS) is the owner of several sports teams including the NHL’s New York Rangers. The company also owns the NBA’s New York Knicks.

The Rangers are one of the few sports teams that are publicly traded and have a strong NHL season for viewership fan attendance and overall demand could be a catalyst for MSGS shares.

Sportico values the Rangers as the second most valuable NHL franchise at $1.87 billion only trailing the $2 billion Toronto Maple Leafs. The value is split as $1.4 billion for the team and $470 million for the business and real estate division.

Sportico sees the Rangers posting revenue of $243 million in the 2021-22 season an increase from $91 million last season and from the $229 million in 2019-20 which featured a full slate of fan attending games prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. Madison Square Garden Entertainment: The owner of the namesake Madison Square Garden is Madison Square Garden Entertainment (NYSE:MSGE).

The company owns the arena that will enjoy a financial boost from the return of fans for Rangers games. MSGE is also the parent company of MSG Network and MSG+ two media channels that air Rangers games and other sports content.

6. Super Group: Sports betting company Super Group which is merging with Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp (NYSE:SEAH) has a multiyear partnership with the NHL. The company’s Betway brand’s first sports league partnership is with the NHL.

The company launched an advertising campaign centered on the partnership during the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs and will likely try to grow brand awareness during the 2021-22 NHL season.

Betway will have a corner-in-ice brand position during the biggest NHL events of the year including the All-Star Game and Winter Classic.

7. Sinclair Broadcast Group: Media company Sinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ:SBGI) acquired the regional sports networks formerly owned by Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) in a purchase deal with Disney. The company has the rights to air many NHL teams locally throughout the country. The company has also explored launching a direct-to-consumer streaming platform.

NHL teams covered by the Sinclair Broadcast properties include the Los Angeles Kings Anaheim Ducks Arizona Coyotes Dallas Stars St. Louis Blues Columbus Blue Jackets Carolina Hurricanes Nashville Predators Tampa Bay Lightning Florida Panthers and Detroit Red Wings.

“I can’t stress this enough. It’s not about left or right not who’s conservative or liberal. Last time I checked everyone regardless of political persuasion is coming down with this” Cavuto told Howard Kurtz on Fox News’ media program “MediaBuzz” on Sunday. “Take the political speaking points and toss them! For now I’m begging you toss them! And think of what’s good not only for yourself but those around you.”



Cavuto has a long public history of health issues including multiple sclerosis and a compromised immune system making him particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. During the remote interview he noted that recent COVID-19 reports show that around half of the breakthrough cases of COVID among vaccinated individuals are of immunocompromised people.

“There are many like that all around us and mine is not secret at Fox. But there are plenty of people around you Howie at Fox and all types of business environments who are susceptible to this kind of thing” he said.



While Fox News has not issued a vaccine mandate for its workers parent company Fox Corporation revealed last month that 90% of its employees across all its divisions have been vaccinated. Fox workers who are not vaccinated must take regular COVID-19 tests.



Yet the network has come under fire for its pundits’ attacks on the Biden Administration and other state and local governments that have implemented such mandates on government employees and requirements to show vaccination or negative COVID test proof to enter businesses and public events.

The issue has even divided contributors at the network. Hours prior to Cavuto’s “MediaBuzz” segment Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe said on “Unfiltered with Dan Bongino” that she will not get vaccinated in protest of the Biden Administration. Meanwhile Fox News medical expert Dr. Nicole Saphier criticized those who cited the COVID-related death of former State Sec. Colin Powell to challenge the efficacy of vaccines.



While Cavuto says he understands his viewers’ sentiments on mandates he urged them to think about how their actions affect the most vulnerable. “Life is too short to be an ass. Life is way too short to be ignorant of the promise of something that is helping people worldwide” he begged. “Stop the deaths. Stop the suffering. Please get vaccinated. Please.“

The all-weather channel will become a competitor to The Weather Channel and Accuweather but will be available free on OTT systems and platforms.

""If you're asking about climate change climate change is part of our lives"" Sharri Berg the Fox executive who will head the division told Variety.

""It's how we live. It's not going to be ignored. We will be reporting facts.""

It's inevitable that questions would be asked about how the fledgling network will handle the controversial subject of climate change given Fox News Channel's long history of discounting it reports The Washington Post.

Many of the new network's early hires are saying the network will have more of a focus on climate science including Emmy-award-winning weather forecaster Amy Freeze from New York's ABC affiliate and Shane Brown a former senior weather product expert from The Weather Channel.

“From hiring decisions to this rhetoric from their CEO to this need to have a safe space for advertisers it does suggest that they could very much embrace climate change in their programming” Allison Fisher the director of the climate and energy program at Media Matters a liberal media watchdog group told The Post.

But if Fox Weather does allow more focus on climate change the network is running a risk of alienating core Fox News watchers and advertisers she said.

""There is a line that they are going to have to walk to keep advertisers feeling like their brand is safe there but not going too far away from their base"" said Fisher. ""If something major happens like a hurricane or a heatwave all eyes are going to be looking to them to see how they are characterizing it.""

Fox News controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch has long allowed his outlets to cast skepticism on climate change claims and initiatives that would limit traditional carbon-based fuels.

But that editorial viewpoint appears to be changing.

As Murdoch's sprawling Australian media empire faced the possible loss of millions of dollars in ad revenue for not signing on to a liberal climate change agenda his outlets did a 180-degree pivot.

In September the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Murdoch’s media companies were launching a campaign to promote the benefits of a carbon-neutral economy and back Australia’s zero-emissions goals set for 2050.

The pro-global warming policy is expected to reach Murdoch's other properties as well including Fox News The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post according to media experts.

The newfound emphasis on climate change may put Fox Weather at odds with Fox News’ traditional conservative base many of whom harbor strong doubts as to the causes of global warming and potential remedies.

A 2019 Pew study found that 45% of conservative Republicans believed that climate change was a function of natural earth cycles and another 39% believed humans only played “some” role in the phenomena.

Even more editorial changes could come at Fox when Murdoch now 90 passes and leaves control to James Murdoch his son who has been a strong supporter of climate change initiatives.

Fox Weather will be an ad-supported streaming service that is reporting national and regional weather as well as regular forecasts and will rely on news reporting from Fox News Channel and from meteorologists from television stations owned by Fox nationwide.

EXECUTIVE

MEGHANN HONGACH

General Manager

Ridge Hill

Retail executives coping with the pandemic must be smart creative and resilient. Meghann Hongach general manager of the Ridge Hill shopping center in Yonkers is all of those things.

Hongach has been involved with Ridge Hill since the very start taking a job with the mall’s developer Forest City Ratner in 2006. “This was an amazing opportunity to see a project through from planning to construction” Hongach says. Eventually transitioning to operations she says she “wore many different hats and as Ridge Hill grew so did I.”

And grow it did. Opening in 2011 the outdoor mall designed to resemble a small-town Main Street sits on an 82-acre hillside site overlooking the NY Thruway and offers some 1.3 million square feet of retail and office space. But in 2020 COVID-19 changed almost everything.

“Many retail properties experienced vacancies. Ridge Hill was no different” Hongach says. To adapt Ridge Hill embraced its outdoor environment by offering a community garden farmer’s market concerts open-air movies and additional seating. “We’ve closed our streets allowing for space to spread out” Hongach explains. “These efforts have brought traffic back to prepandemic levels which is a really positive sign and a key step to filling what vacancies remain.”

Brick-and-mortar retail will never go away “but customers need new reasons to visit stores” Hongach adds. “We want people to come to Ridge Hill to enjoy themselves. We want to present them with a beautiful place where there is always something going on.”

TANIA DEMPSEY MD

Founder/CEO

AIM Center for Personalized Medicine

Dr. Tania Dempsey is a 1996 graduate of The Johns Hopkins Medical School and was practicing medicine in a busy and successful practice when something began to nag at her.

- Advertisement -

“I became frustrated with traditional medicine. I couldn’t spend the time I wanted with my patients” she says. “You could never get to the root of their symptoms so instead we just put Band-Aids on things.” At a time when doctors sought out big practices and mergers to combat the demands of managed care Dempsey did the opposite by launching her own small fee-for-service practice. She admits it was scary at first but that she was committed and believed in what she was doing.

“I ran into someone whom I worked with at my old practice and he said that I would not succeed on my own” she recalls.

Not only did Dempsey succeed she actually outgrew that modest Armonk practice and moved to a larger facility in Purchase. Her practice has grown from just a handful of patients ten years ago to more than 5000 today. But Dempsey wasn’t done just yet. She moved into the realm of entrepreneur when she launched her own line of nutraceutical supplements AIM for Optimum Health which is sold in her office and in her online store (aimstore.net). She currently has more than 100 products in her product line along with roughly 600 other products including herbs specialty vitamins and food.

“I love my job and the work I do to help my patients. My office is like a second home. I spend so much time there it’s really more like my first home.”

DENISE MANANAS

Senior Director of External Affairs

St. John’s Riverside Hospital

Overseeing marketing communications and business development for Yonkers’ St. John’s Riverside Hospital and its community network for almost 30 years has been very gratifying for Denise Mananas senior director of external affairs.

The Yonkers native says she sees “a real purpose in servicing and serving a community that I grew up in and that I’m very fond of” noting that her duties have grown along with the organization one which now encompasses three hospital locations off-site physician’s offices a detox-and-rehab facility four outpatient rehab sites one nursing school and two medical residencies.

Having opened its doors back in 1869 the hospital has a long history in Westchester. Mananas coordinated its successful rebranding campaign 12 years ago with the tagline “St. John’s Riverside Hospital is Community Strong.” During the COVID surge last year that sentiment was unmistakably apparent with “an outpouring of love from people who came to support the hospital” Mananas recounts “as well as from the community of employees who were here for them… it was something to marvel at.” Many locals showed up with food and PPE donations while police fire department ambulance corps and even schoolchildren stepped up to help the effort — something that resonated deeply with Mananas who has a deep commitment to the hospital network and its place in the community.

“I’ve always chosen to work for a non-for-profit” she says “because I really feel very connected to the mission of the organization. I see such value in the services we provide.”

MASHA TURCHINSKY

Director & CEO

Hudson River Museum

Long before Masha Turchinsky took the reins as director and CEO of the Hudson River Museum (HRM) the Yonkers institution was already close to her heart. “The Hudson River Museum is one of the first museums I visited” recalls Turchinsky. “My parents and I have been going there my entire life and I credit the HRM with giving me the tools to have the confidence to explore the world at large.”

Prior to her work at the HRM Turchinsky spent 19 years advancing at New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. At HRM Turchinsky led a complete rebranding of the institution pioneered a unique diversity initiative forged new partnerships with organizations such as Art Bridges and Bloomberg Philanthropies and managed to retain all HRM staff while creating a lively roster of virtual programming during the pandemic. In addition Turchinsky also broke ground on the museum’s new $12.3 million wing.

In 2017 Turchinsky became one of only 111 female museum directors in North America to have been inducted into the Association of Art Museum Directors and was honored the following year with a Women of Distinction Award by the Yonkers City Council and elected to the National Board of Trustees of Art Table.

For Turchinsky inclusion lies at the heart of all these efforts. “Museums really are at their best when people feel welcome and reflected in some way during their visits” she explains. “This can be a warm greeting when you walk in seeing a work of art that depicts someone who looks like you or a speaker or program you can relate to. No one should have to step inside the door without feeling embraced.”

DEBORAH NOVICK

Director

Entrepreneurship & Innovation Westchester County

As director of Entrepreneurship and Innovation for Westchester County Deborah Novick hasn’t let the grass grow under her feet. Appointed to her new post right as the coronavirus slammed Westchester in March of 2020 Novick hit the ground running having initiated multiple programs designed to help both startups and established businesses pivot and even grow. She was also instrumental in launching the third cohort of the county’s highly successful business incubator program Element 46 in addition to creating and overseeing Launch1000 which is providing 1000 Westchesterites the opportunity to start their own businesses.

One of Novick’s most impressive accomplishments however was launching the Westchester County Biosciences Accelerator program. Now in its third year the Biosciences Accelerator readies academic and corporate spinouts inventors and first-time founders to be successful entrepreneurs in the biotech industry. As Westchester continues to emerge as a cynosure of biotech in New York State and beyond it’s a virtual certainty that Novick will be at the heart of it.

Prior to her current role Novick made a name for herself as the director of New York Medical College’s BioInc which specifically designs turnkey wet labs dry labs offices and more to support early-stage companies and high-potential entrepreneurs within the biotech and medtech sectors.

“Deborah is highly respected across the county for her depth of expertise in business strategy development and execution” says Bridget Gibbons director of economic development for Westchester County. “She has had a profound impact across the business community with her seemingly limitless capacity to create and execute impactful programs that result in success for startups and mature businesses alike.”

LUISA DECICCO

Director of Human Resources & Events and Cuisine

DeCicco Supermarkets

Luisa DeCicco did not shy away from the challenges that the pandemic presented to DeCicco Supermarkets and her workers. Before information about the virus was widespread DeCicco had devised ways to keep her employees safe and protected while continuing to serve the community. She not only secured PPE for her employees a scarcity at the time but also set up a mobile testing unit that was free to employees. Hot meals were provided every single day and are still free for staff. “The most important thing was keeping our employees safe” says DeCicco. “They are the company. We want them to feel like family.”

DeCicco has become accustomed to adapting and problem-solving. Having earned a PhD from Columbia University in engineering just a few years after emigrating from Italy (where she also holds a high engineering degree) DeCicco uses that experience and training in her new role. “A team is like a puzzle: Everyone has a strength that they add and when put in the right places they fit perfectly” she says. When she created the HR department for the supermarket chain she was a staff of one overseeing the two stores at the time. Since then DeCicco has been integral in growing the business to nine locations and 1100 employees. For DeCicco every success and setback are learning moments. “Every time you get up you get up stronger.”

MIRIAM RISKO

Founder Voice Teacher

Mike Risko Music School

Miriam Risko was singing before she could talk. She always knew the important role music played in the world and that she wanted to share her gifts with others. “If you have a voice use it. And I happen to be a singer” says Miriam. “Music is what makes the world a better place.”

When the Mike Risko Music School was founded in 1995 she was integral in its growth and development. With Miriam at the helm what started out as a small studio that could only support a few lessons at a time has evolved into a 3000-square-foot building that houses the music school on top and their retail store below it.

When the pandemic began the arts sector took a huge hit. For Miriam shutting the doors on her students was never an option. She created an entirely virtual division of every part of their business in addition to running a fully virtual music-theater program. Giving back during this time was very important to her so she organized free outdoor music classes singing telegrams to benefit healthcare workers and provided free music entertainment during fundraisers. “It’s all about the ability to give back to the community that supports us” Miriam says.

Mike Risko Music has been named one of the top music retailers in the world by the National Association of Music Merchants for the past eight years and Miriam has been invited to speak at their convention on her expertise in implementing hybrid music programs. Yet through all her success Miriam is still looking to the future. “It’s never been about ‘making it’; it’s always been about affecting people.”

TANIA WEISS

Executive Director

Cancer Support Team

Tania Weiss believes her background as an Emmy-winning TV producer was the ideal training ground for her position as executive director of Purchase’s Cancer Support Team.

“I really learned in a very unique way how powerful storytelling is in reaching people” says Weiss. The agency supports cancer patients and their families in many ways from grants for transportation to emotional support to navigating the complex healthcare system. Her commitment to help the community brought her to the agency’s board of directors who wound up turning to her when the executive director position became vacant. It wasn’t long before both Weiss and everyone else realized it was a perfect fit.

“I knew it was now or never” says Weiss of the move acknowledging her small-business career as the foundation of her success with the Cancer Support Team. “The ability to forecast the environment set goals and manage and nurture a staff were and are central to the position” she says. All of that was put to the test in the last 18 months when the agency was challenged to reach people despite all of the pandemic-related restrictions.

“We met with people electronically visited them on their porches on park benches and in cars parked side-by-side. We did whatever it took” she says.

Weiss cites her attention to detail and patience as central to her ability to lead — along with a more philosophical outlook. “Try to love what you do never stop learning and do things that really make you feel like you’re making a difference.”

But what I enjoy even more is crafting a really persuasive piece of legal writing.” Hamerman was able to focus on this skill joining Yankwitt LLP in White Plains in 2010 to write briefs for the firm. “It seemed like a dream come true back then” she reflects. Now executive director and partner at the red-hot law firm Hamerman credits her success to supportive mentors. “It’s my turn to pay it forward” she adds.

“I was young when I had kids; now I feel I have something to give back to those going through the same thing” Hamerman says. “I hope that I can be a resource for the women at my firm to help them achieve a feeling of balance and peace of mind… success in all aspects of their lives.”

Chia-Chia Yeh has been betting on herself for years. A 10-year veteran of MGM Resorts she has overseen thousands of employees and dozens of restaurants simultaneously. In 2017 she was sent to Bellagio Shanghai for its grand opening to manage the daily operations of the restaurant LAGO by Julian Serrano. The P&L budget she was tasked with managing was prodigious and that allowed her leadership skills and initiative to shine.

When Yeh came to Empire City in 2019 she navigated the business through a tough transitional period going from a family-owned establishment to an MGM-acquired casino. She implemented new standard operation procedures created innovative training for all food-service employees and stratified the best practices for the business.

Guiding patients and families through the most difficult time of their lives takes a team effort. At Hospice of Westchester (HOW) in White Plains CEO Mary Spengler leads a group of professionals who lend support to individuals in need of end-of-life care while offering comfort to their loved ones.

With a master’s in nursing Spengler spent 32 of her 40 years in healthcare working at White Plains Hospital in nursing and administrative roles before taking the helm at HOW in 2011. “Though many don’t like to say it we are here for those who are dying in our community both adults and children” she says “and my role is to see that those who deliver that care are supported and are able to achieve our mission.”

That mission is to address the needs of those facing a life-limiting illness with dignity and compassion by offering a medical director nurses home health aides spiritual care pain management emotional support and bereavement services. And “thanks to a very generous donor” says Spengler “massage reflexology art therapy and music therapy.”

Despite the pandemic Spengler was able to keep HOW’s staff employed and the organization running accommodating patients where they reside (private homes nursing or assisted-living facilities) just as it always has. “The most common message we hear is that families wish they had learned about us sooner” she says. “To some hospice is a taboo concept and I want to get the message out that hospice helps patients and families achieve their end-of-life goals; people should explore the hospice concept and not be afraid of it.”

In fact in September Melillo was named to Profiles in Diversity Journal’s 2021 list of “Women Worth Watching” and considering her array of accomplishments this is likely sage advice.

Leading a talented team of more than 40 compliance safety internal audit and environmental health professionals Melillo is tasked with managing the legal affairs of FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation as well as its 23 subsidiaries in North America and Latin America. Melillo has also spearheaded many mergers and acquisitions including that of Kalon Biotherapeutics and the integration of FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies which today crafts vaccine products to fight COVID.

Giving back is also vitally important to Melillo who in 2019 served as chair of the American Heart Association’s Westchester “Go Red for Women” campaign leading fundraising and community outreach to help raise awareness and money to fight heart disease.

For Melillo this effort is all part of her mission to elevate the next generation of change makers. “It’s really important to focus on defining what success means for you and not letting others define that” shares Melillo. “You have to keep redefining that because you are not going to be the same person you are now through your whole career. Take the risk to say no to opportunities but also take the risk to say yes to them.”

She works to enhance the lives of residents in the company’s nine luxury rental properties in Westchester building community along the way. That sense of community has even spilled over into romance. “At least six couples met at our events got married and started families” Diaz says.

Since joining GDC in 2018 Diaz has planned happy hours barbecues book clubs paint-and-sips mommy-and-me classes and more. When the pandemic hit last year Diaz worked harder holding many events virtually. She also staged concerts that residents could view from their private balconies. “It was great to see people out there dancing sipping cocktails and having fun safely” Diaz says. She helped local businesses and the needy during the pandemic as well arranging online cooking classes with Westchester chefs and Takeout Tuesdays in which nearby restaurants made special menus for GDC residents. GDC management matched 10% of sales from this promotion donating nearly $3000 to Feeding Westchester Diaz says.

Giving back to residents and the community is simply good business adds Diaz noting that a majority of the activities are free paid for through her department’s budget.

The Arc Westchester provides services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families including education career training and recreation. Some 2000 individuals a day make use of these programs and 240 individuals live in 45 The Arc Westchester residences throughout the county.

The money needed to provide this support is largely provided through government funding but not completely. This is where The Arc Westchester Foundation comes in says its executive director Nancy Patota. “In order for The Arc Westchester to continue to be a leader in our field we have to innovate and enhance programs” she explains. “We close the gap between state funding and what it really costs to ensure the best outcomes for our individuals.”

Patota is passionate about fundraising and it shows. She joined The Arc Westchester Foundation in 2014 and under her leadership the foundation has raised well over $14 million. When the pandemic hit she quickly raised $400000 for a Covid Emergency Relief Fund. Her foundation also manages investments for the long-term financial health of the organization.

“Anyone who says a nonprofit doesn’t have to apply business acumen is clueless about what it takes to run a foundation” says Patota who has the credentials to back up her claim. Armed with an MBA from Iona College she is now an adjunct professor with the MBA program there.

That said successful fundraising often comes down to maintaining strong personal relationships as Patota explains. “We really get to know our families and our donors. We form deep connections. That’s how we change lives.”

Dr. Xenia Frisby is first a clinician who diagnoses and treats individual patients — but she has always been interested in the bigger picture as well. Assessing the quality of a hospital’s systems and its overall culture has provided her a chance to make an even greater impact on patient outcomes. “It brings me back to why I originally got into medicine as a first-generation physician” Frisby says “which was to help as many people as possible.”

As associate chief quality officer and hospitalist director at Bronxville’s NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital Frisby monitors quality metrics and patient safety with the goal of improving processes ensuring high-quality care and lowering costs. “I am particularly proud of our work on the enterprise-wide mortality goal” she says “where we look at the rate in the hospital and see how we can make it better from bedside care to improving documentation.”

Frisby’s organizational oversight became especially important after the hospital began treating so-called “patient zero” identified as Westchester’s first confirmed COVID-19 case.

From there she worked as a project manager for the NYC Parks Department managing the funding for green infrastructure and creating the first green infrastructure maintenance protocol for the city. With a multitude of successfully completed projects under her belt and a deep understanding of the importance of green spaces Bayley founded Plan It Wild.

The company has a very simple mission with a global impact: to transform residential and commercial landscapes into better environments by putting biodiversity back into the ecosystem expanding the population of pollinators and creating homes for wildlife. “We can help restore nature in our own private yards” explains Bayley. “The monarch butterfly can only land on milkweed. If we don’t have that plant we don’t have butterflies. So not only is it beautiful it’s also functional.”

The landscaping sector is a $105 billion industry that is overwhelmingly male-dominated. “You’ve got so few women running these businesses and it’s not a very environmentally sound industry” says Bayley. “It’s already an uphill battle.” But Bayley shows no signs of balking at the speed bumps and has plans to (literally) expand her grassroots environmental crusade with for example a mindful maintenance division which will mow your lawn with an electric machine.

For Bayley creating “the now” also means building a better future for county wildlife even if it’s one yard at a time. “I love seeing a planting years after it’s been completed” she says “because it’s functioning as it’s supposed to.”

“We are very very well sold” Disney advertising sales President Rita Ferro told Front Office Sports. “We have a couple of positions left mostly in the playoffs and finals.”

The opening night doubleheader had average viewership of 884000 viewers during the five plus hours of coverage. The night marked the highest season opener doubleheader on record. The first game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Pittsburgh Penguins was the most viewed opening game on cable of all-time. The later 10:30 p.m. ET game between the Seattle Kraken and Las Vegas Golden Knights was the second most viewed regular season NHL game to begin after 9 p.m. ET in the league's history across cable and broadcast television.

2. AT&T: As mentioned above Turner Sports is the other major television partner for NHL content. Turner is paying a reported $225 million annually on the seven-year deal with the NHL.

The first two NHL games to be shown on Turner’s TNT this season averaged 817000 viewers and 522000 viewers averaging 670000 for the double header. The viewership from the NHL games topped the WNBA Finals a U.S. Men’s Soccer World Cup qualifier and NBA Preseason game on other networks. One of the two games was the most watched NHL game ever to air on the second night of a new NHL season.

3. Madison Square Garden Sports: Publicly traded Madison Square Garden Sports (NYSE:MSGS) is the owner of several sports teams including the NHL’s New York Rangers. The company also owns the NBA’s New York Knicks.

The Rangers are one of the few sports teams that are publicly traded and have a strong NHL season for viewership fan attendance and overall demand could be a catalyst for MSGS shares.

Sportico values the Rangers as the second most valuable NHL franchise at $1.87 billion only trailing the $2 billion Toronto Maple Leafs. The value is split as $1.4 billion for the team and $470 million for the business and real estate division.

Sportico sees the Rangers posting revenue of $243 million in the 2021-22 season an increase from $91 million last season and from the $229 million in 2019-20 which featured a full slate of fan attending games prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. Madison Square Garden Entertainment: The owner of the namesake Madison Square Garden is Madison Square Garden Entertainment (NYSE:MSGE).

The company owns the arena that will enjoy a financial boost from the return of fans for Rangers games. MSGE is also the parent company of MSG Network and MSG+ two media channels that air Rangers games and other sports content.

If this year has shown us anything it’s that decentralized finance (DeFi) has grown into one of the most relevant emerging ecosystems of today and is likely to have a huge impact on the operation of banks in the future.

The spike in popularity of smart contract platforms has brought in a huge influx of new users and platforms are doing what they can to attract as many of them as possible.

Ethereum’s market share is slowly slipping away

New platforms such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have rushed in and taken the industry by storm by capitalizing on the flaws of popular platforms such as Etheruem. BSC has successfully focused on lowering transaction costs and providing a space for users to easily create decentralized apps (DApps) and DeFi products. With initial funding of only $100 million BSC managed to attract over 100 million new DeFi users to its platform.

It came as no surprise then when it was recently revealed that Binance - the world’s leading blockchain ecosystem and cryptocurrency platform - recently received a $1 billion growth fund for BSC to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology.

Ethereum built using the Solidity programming language is still by far the most well-known smart contract platform. Although it will likely remain that way for a while it’s becoming increasingly clear that it now has actual contenders - and many of them might even work better.

Ethereum comes with its own set of problems which are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. It is slow it is expensive and to be blunt it is not very useful outside of high-value DeFi transactions.

As a result it is becoming increasingly clear that newer platforms such as Solana Avalanche and BSC are working hard to take its place by attracting users by offering faster and cheaper transactions to users - and they’re succeeding.

How do multichains actually work together

Essentially a ‘multichain’ just refers to many different chains. Like a blockchain a multichain is an immutable ledger. But unlike a blockchain which is made up of blocks of data from a single protocol it contains data from multiple blockchain protocols.

As a result it creates a block that is made up of multiple other blocks. If a project is deployed on a multichain this means that it must be deployed on at least two chains. These chains could include Ethereum BSC Avalanche Solana Polkadot etc.

What are the benefits of multichains?

Although multichains are likely to be widely rejected by a large proportion of the Ethereum community because of their different ethos and lack of security guarantees multichains have very practical user applications.

In order for assets to flow between independent chains a “cross-chain” solution must be used. Essentially this is just a tool that enables the transfer of assets between Ethereum and other chains. This optimizes the ability to synthesise between chains.

An increasing number of companies are beginning to see the potential of this. For instance Composable Finance recently announced that it is building a cross-chain interoperable solution on Polkadot - the platform that has regularly been dubbed the “Ethereum-killer” (make of that what you will).

This will ultimately allow smart contracts to communicate and collaborate on all levels and will remove the need for bridging (this is essentially a connection that allows the transfer of tokens and data from one chain to another) which is what Polkadot currently requires.

So far Composable has been a quiet success and recently closed a $7m funding round in June 202. More recently the team joined forces with Polygon in order to integrate Polygon’s scaling solution into its layer 2 bridge link.

The main benefit of multichains is that they shift what was previously a very fragmented complex series of chain to chain movements to a seamless uninterrupted process. The process will become so seamless that the end user will become unaware of which chain they are operating on. Right now this is almost unimaginable.

Another example of a multi-chain solution is Rubic a multi-chain protocol which allows users to swap any token between different blockchains in seconds and in just one click. The swap process is quite simple so the users don't have to witness and take a part in endless transactions in order to get their desired asset. Also cooperating with lots of DEXs for expanded exchange options allows Rubic to choose the best rates for their users so they rest easy getting the lowest possible transaction fees.

The ability to use multichains would have huge implications for blockchain technology - in particular the DeFi industry. Interoperable blockchains for instance would enable the transfer of data between banks not only possible but a secure fast process. Given how relevant DeFi has become within such a short space of time - let alone how much more relevant it will become in the future - this is huge.

Ultimately multichain solutions have the potential to remove many of the existing blockchain complexities and to transform blockchain technology from what it is today into an essential high-growth industry.

A look to the future of the multichain universe

If the rise of multichains reveals anything about blockchain technology it’s that it isn’t a “winner takes all'' world. Many of these solutions aren’t competitors to Ethereum as much as they are compatible with Ethereum.

The increasing popularity of multichain solutions have made it more obvious than ever that interoperability is necessary. In order to build collaboration with one another it is vital that disparate datasets can cooperate.

By creating community around their products and facilitating successful partnerships with key supporters entrepreneurs can leverage the so-called “multichain universe” in order to feel empowered and accelerate their blockchain projects.

)* Penulis adalah adalah seorang pengajar hubungan internasional di Universitas Melbourne di Australia. Ia mengkhususkan diri pada isu-isu hak asasi manusia di Indonesia selain politik dan sejarah Indonesia. Twitter: @OliviaTasevski

Ketika Joko Widodo yang lebih dikenal sebagai Jokowi menjadi presiden Indonesia pada tahun 2014 ia berjanji untuk meningkatkan layanan sosial di provinsi Indonesia yang bergolak Papua Barat dimana gerakan pro-kemerdekaan telah berlangsung sejak 1960-an. Pada saat itu Jokowi mengklaim bahwa begitu perbaikan ini terjadi “ketegangan politik [di Papua Barat] akan berkurang.”

Itu tidak terjadi. Pada kenyataannya ketegangan hanya makin meningkat sejak Jokowi terpilih terutama setelah pemilihannya kembali pada tahun 2019. Gerakan pro-kemerdekaan dan anti-rasisme Papua makin subur memperdalam perpecahan antara pemerintah Indonesia dan orang Papua juga dengan sekutu Indonesia mereka.

Jokowi telah mencoba untuk menjawab keluhan orang Papua melalui peningkatan pembangunan infrastruktur di provinsi itu dan tidak seperti pendahulunya dengan secara teratur mengunjungi Papua Barat. Awal bulan ini misalnya ia muncul pada saat pembukaan Pekan Olahraga Nasional Indonesia yang diadakan tahun ini di Papua Barat di mana dalam acara yang tidak diragukan lagi diatur secara hati-hati ia bermain sepak bola dengan anak-anak Papua yang mengenakan pakaian merah-putih warna bendera Indonesia. Tetapi tawaran ini tidak dapat menyembunyikan fakta bahwa pada masa jabatan kedua Jokowi telah ditandai dengan kebijakan yang semakin otoriter terhadap Papua Barat yang kemungkinan akan meningkatkan gerakan pro-kemerdekaan yang sudah mendapatkan momentumnya.

Pada tahun 1949 ketika Indonesia secara resmi memperoleh kemerdekaan dari penjajahnya Belanda negara Eropa itu juga tidak melepaskan kendali atas wilayah kolonial terdekatnya West New Guinea (sekarang dikenal sebagai Papua Barat). Tetapi presiden pertama Indonesia Sukarno menganggap West New Guinea bagian dari negaranya karena pengalaman bersama mereka tentang pemerintahan kolonial sebagai bagian dari Hindia Belanda. Pemerintahannya kemudian melancarkan kampanye untuk menguasai wilayah tersebut.

Di bawah tekanan dari Amerika Serikat pada tahun 1962 Belanda melakukan negosiasi dengan Indonesia tanpa keterlibatan orang Papua. Dengan demikian Perjanjian New York lahir di mana Belanda berjanji untuk mentransfer kendali West New Guinea ke PBB dan kemudian ke Indonesia.

Setelah Indonesia menguasai wilayah tersebut pada tahun 1969 ia mengadakan referendum palsu untuk menentukan apakah orang Papua ingin Papua Barat diintegrasikan ke dalam Indonesia atau menjadi negara merdeka. Ironisnya bernama Act of Free Choice referendum yang melibatkan kurang dari 1 persen orang Papua yang dipaksa untuk memilih mendukung integrasi.

Sejak itu orang Papua terus berjuang untuk kemerdekaan melalui protes-protes damai dan perjuangan bersenjata meskipun Indonesia sering sulit membuat perbedaan diantara keduanya. Orang Papua yang pro-kemerdekaan memandang pemerintahan Indonesia atas Papua Barat sebagai bentuk kolonialisme dan berpendapat bahwa Papua Barat harus merdeka karena perbedaan etnis dan agama: Sementara orang Indonesia mayoritas Muslim Sebagian besar orang Papua beragama kristen. Mereka juga mengidentifikasi dirinya sebagai orang Melanesia tidak seperti kebanyakan orang Indonesia. Gerakan kemerdekaan juga dimotivasi oleh pelanggaran hak asasi manusia yang dilakukan oleh tentara Indonesia dan pasukan keamanan lainnya di Papua Barat sejak 1960-an termasuk pembunuhan penyiksaan pemerkosaan dan pemenjaraan. Banyak anggota tentara dan pasukan keamanan lainnya belum diadili karena keterlibatan mereka dalam pelanggaran hak asasi manusia ini.

Masa jabatan pertama Jokowi sebagai presiden ditandai dengan beberapa perkembangan yang menjanjikan bagi Papua Barat. Pemerintahnya membebaskan setidaknya 32 tahanan politik Papua termasuk aktivis kemerdekaan terkemuka Filep Karma yang telah menjalani 10 dari 15 tahun hukuman penjaranya karena mengibarkan bendera Bintang Kejora bendera gerakan kemerdekaan Papua yang dilarang. Selama masa jabatan pertamanya Jokowi juga berjanji untuk menghapus larangan berkepanjangan yang membatasi akses wartawan asing ke Papua Barat.

Namun setelah Jokowi terpilih Kembali pada Mei 2019 dengan gelagat yang mengganggu dari sikapnya yang tidak peduli terhadap hak asasi manusia di Papua Barat ia menunjuk lawannya saat Pilpres mantan Letnan Jenderal Prabowo Subianto sebagai menteri pertahanan di Oktober – meskipun ada fakta bahwa Prabowo telah terlibat dalam beberapa pelanggaran hak asasi manusia termasuk membunuh warga sipil di Papua Barat pada tahun 1996.

Tiga bulan setelah Jokowi terpilih kembali di kota Surabaya Indonesia kaum nasionalis Indonesia dan tentaranya seperti terekam kamera menyebut mahasiswa Papua di kota itu sebagai monyet (kata Indonesia untuk monkey) istilah rasis yang lama digunakan oleh orang Indonesia untuk membingkai orang Papua sebagai primitif dan terbelakang. Rekaman insiden ini menyebar luas di media sosial dan sebagai tanggapan terjadi protes besar-besaran anti-rasisme dan pro-kemerdekaan oleh orang Papua dan dihadiri oleh warga Indonesia di seluruh Papua Barat dan wilayah lainnya di Indonesia. Kebanyakan berlangsung damai tetapi dalam beberapa kasus pengunjuk rasa merusak infrastruktur.

Pemerintahan Jokowi kemudian mengirim 6.000 tentara ke Papua Barat memotong koneksi internet di provinsi itu melarang warga negara asing dan tidak menghiraukan permintaan oleh diplomat asing dan Kantor Komisaris Tinggi PBB untuk Hak Asasi Manusia untuk mengunjungi Papua Barat. Pemerintah mengklaim bahwa langkah-langkah ini diperlukan untuk memungkinkan Indonesia memulihkan “keamanan dan ketertiban” di Papua Barat dan untuk memastikan bahwa orang asing tidak dirugikan sebagai akibat dari “situasi keamanan” di provinsi tersebut.

Tindakan Jokowi yang berusaha untuk meredam gerakan pro-kemerdekaan Papua kemungkinan akan menjadi bumerang.

Argumen ini menimbulkan tanda tanya. Tindakan pemerintah justru merupakan upaya untuk mencegah pengawasan internasional terhadap situasi hak asasi manusia dan untuk membenarkan pembatasan kebebasan berekspresi orang Papua dan pembatasan pers di Papua Barat.

Selain itu Jaksa Agung Indonesia menonjolkan proses hukum terhadap tujuh orang Papua karena berpartisipasi dalam protes. Pemerintah meminta hukuman penjara hingga 17 tahun untuk setiap orang beberapa di antaranya merupakan pemimpin gerakan damai dalam organisasi pro-kemerdekaan yang utama Persatuan Gerakan Pembebasan Nasional untuk Papua Barat. Pada tahun 2020 pengadilan Indonesia menghukum mereka hingga 11 bulan penjara karena dituduh mengkhianat.

Para pengunjuk rasa itu hanyalah segelintir dari 48 orang Papua yang pada Desember lalu dipenjara karena terlibat dalam perlawanan tanpa kekerasan terhadap negara Indonesia. Meskipun Jokowi berjanji untuk membebaskan semua tahanan politik Papua pada tahun 2015 tampaknya semakin tidak mungkin bahwa ia akan melakukannya karena pendekatannya terhadap Papua Barat semakin tanpa kompromi.

Demikian pula janji Jokowi bahwa wartawan asing akan dapat bebas masuk ke Papua Barat belum juga terwujud. Wartawan masih mengalami kesulitan ketika hendak memasuki provinsi itu. Mereka yang berhasil masuk gerak-gerik mereka dibatasi dan dipantau oleh aparat keamanan Indonesia yang membuat kemampuan mereka untuk melaporkan pelanggaran hak asasi manusia terbatas.

Yang mengkhawatirkan awal tahun ini Menteri Koordinator Bidang Politik Hukum dan Keamanan Indonesia Mahfud MD melabel semua separatis dan individu Papua yang berafiliasi dengan mereka sebagai teroris di bawah undang-undang kontra-terorisme Indonesia yang memungkinkan seseorang bisa dipenjara hingga tiga minggu tanpa proses hukum. Ketika dia membuat pernyataan ini Mahfud berpendapat bahwa menggunakan kekerasan yang menyebabkan “kerusakan atau kehancuran” juga merupakan terorisme. Penunjukan ini sangat signifikan. Ini kemungkinan akan digunakan untuk menahan orang Papua karena terlibat dalam perlawanan sipil secara damai – terutama penghancuran infrastruktur – atau bahkan terhadap mereka yang hanya mengadvokasi kemerdekaan secara damai. Ini juga membantu pasukan keamanan Indonesia dalam upaya mereka untuk membenarkan langkah-langkah luar biasa dan ekstrem yang mereka gunakan terhadap orang Papua yang pro-kemerdekaan dengan alasan bahwa mereka seolah-olah menimbulkan ancaman keamanan.

Selama masa jabatan keduanya Jokowi telah melipatgandakan kebijakan keamanan menanggapi perjuangan Papua dengan menambah militer ke Papua Barat dan terjadi pelanggaran yang makin meningkat terhadap hak-hak sipil dan politik orang Papua. Tindakan ini yang bertujuan untuk meredam gerakan pro-kemerdekaan Papua kemungkinan akan menjadi bumerang. Tindakan demikian hanya akan memperkuat gerakan perlawanan dan makin memperbesar permusuhan Papua terhadap pemerintah Indonesia.

Bahkan pendekatan non-keamanan Jokowi yang bertujuan menghilangkan sentimen pro-kemerdekaan tidak akan cukup untuk memadamkan gerakan tersebut. Misalnya pemerintahannya berusaha mempercepat pembangunan ekonomi di wilayah itu – sebuah kebijakan yang juga pernah diusahakan oleh para pendahulunya – dengan membangun infrastruktur dan menyediakan keuangan mikro. Meskipun Papua Barat merupakan rumah bagi tambang emas terbesar di dunia dan tambang tembaga terbesar kedua – yang dijalankan oleh Freeport-McMoRan sebuah perusahaan pertambangan AS dan pembayar pajak terbesar di Indonesia – Papua Barat adalah provinsi termiskin di Indonesia. Namun fokus Jokowi pada pembangunan ekonomi di provinsi ini tidak mungkin bisa menghilangkan tuntutan kemerdekaan Papua yang berada jauh lebih dalam daripada kebijakan ekonomi Indonesia terhadap wilayah tersebut.

Di kancah internasional pemerintahan Jokowi telah melakukan penyangkalan dalam menjawab tuduhan adanya kasus-kasus pelanggaran hak asasi manusia terhadap orang Papua Barat dan orang Indonesia yang mendukung rakyat Papua. Misalnya pada tahun 2019 sebagai tanggapan atas kritik PBB terhadap penganiayaan pemerintah terhadap pengacara hak asasi manusia Indonesia Veronica Koman misi permanen Indonesia di PBB berpendapat bahwa informasi yang diposting Koman secara online tentang pelanggaran hak asasi manusia dan rasisme terhadap orang Papua adalah “berita palsu.” Demikian pula pada sidang Majelis Umum PBB pada tahun 2020 setelah Vanuatu meminta agar Indonesia menangani dugaan pelanggaran hak asasi manusia di Papua Barat perwakilan Indonesia untuk PBB Silvany Austin Pasaribu mengecam Vanuatu karena membahas “masalah hak asasi manusia yang tidak faktual.”

Vanuatu bagaimanapun adalah salah satu dari sedikit negara yang mendukung gerakan kemerdekaan Papua. Amerika Serikat Australia negara-negara di Asia Tenggara dan banyak negara lain mendukung pemerintahan Indonesia atas Papua Barat dan ragu-ragu untuk mengutuk pelanggaran hak asasi manusia ini karena mereka memprioritaskan hubungan mereka dengan Indonesia sebagai negara terpadat keempat di dunia dan pasar terbesar di Asia Tenggara.

Pada awal masa kepresidenannya Jokowi menyatakan bahwa dia ingin “pendekatan di Papua berubah” dan tidak lagi menjalankan “pendekatan keamanan yang represif.” Terlepas dari retorika ini Jokowi telah memilih jalan represif yang telah juga ditempuh dengan baik oleh sebagian besar pendahulunya – dan bahwa ia kemungkinan akan terus menjalankan pola pendekatan itu selama sisa masa kepresidenannya kecuali ia memutuskan untuk akhirnya mematuhi janji yang pernah dibuatnya selama kunjungan ke Papua Barat pada tahun 2014 untuk “mendengarkan suara rakyat [Papua].”

The sprinter will not be attempting a repeat of his 2021 goal of winning a stage at each Grand Tour in the same season he said and will instead look to build his season around peaking for the Worlds in late September.

Ewan who heads into his fourth season with Lotto Soudal next year built up to the Leuven Worlds after leaving the Tour de France after three stages after sustaining a broken collarbone in the early crashes but didn't finish the 268-kilometre race as Australia failed to compete in the final.

He confirmed to WielerFlits that Wollongong – just over an hour south of his hometown of Sydney – is his main aim for 2022.

""The World Championships will take place in Wollongong in Australia next year. I can win there"" Ewan said. ""In the second half of the season I will mainly focus on that race.

""The Vuelta will probably not be the best preparation for it. My program is not fixed yet but for now I would say that I won't start there.

""Not next year I think"" he added when asked about the prospect of another bid at the Grand Tour 'stage win triple'.

This year Ewan looked on course to achieve his goal to become the first man to do so since Alessandro Petacchi in 2003. He took two stage wins at the Giro d'Italia before pulling out early to focus on the Tour but was forced to leave the race on stage 3.

He returned two months later and added a stage win at the Benelux Tour to take his season win tally to six but didn't race the Vuelta in a bid to peak for the Worlds. At March's Milan-San Remo he repeated his 2018 second place winning the bunch sprint just behind winner Jasper Stuyven. Another shot at the sprinter's Classic is the goal next spring Ewan said.

""Of course there are races where I want to perform at the beginning of the season but the big goal is Milan-San Remo. It's the only Monument I can win so it's logical for me to go for it. As I've shown in previous editions it's definitely a race I can win.""

Ewan added that there have been years where he's been dropped a long way before the final adding that teammates like Philippe Gilbert are good to have in the team in that case.

""It's up for discussion but on the other hand I've also had editions where I left the peloton on the Cipressa"" he said. ""There's less pressure on me if there are teammates who can ride for a result if I don't have a good day. It's a long way off now but by then we'll see who's in good shape.""

Despite the road season having just finished – Ewan's last race was the Worlds – he was already talking about meeting up with his team again including new teammates Victor Campenaerts Rüdiger Selig and Michael Schwarzmann who could merge into his lead out train next season.

""Some strong riders will be added to the team"" Ewan said. ""We have two more training camps before we race together so I'll get to know them there.

""Normally it takes a few races before everyone is well matched but I think with a good program – with a lot of sprint opportunities – that should happen quickly. Then we can move on to bigger races.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Amid talks of advanced technology that will be onboard the jet speculation about which engine will power the stealthy multi-role fighter aircraft is rife.

Going Local

India was a part of the joint Russo-Indian Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) program to manufacture a new aircraft based on the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jet which would replace a fleet of aging fighters including the SEPECAT Jaguar and Dassault Mirage 2000.

However in 2018 India withdrew from this proposed multi-billion-dollar project after the Indian Air Force (IAF) expressed strong reservations regarding its high cost and technology transfer extent.

Most of the force’s concerns were centered around the Su-57’s stealth performance and production issues related to its Izdeliye 30 engine.

Moreover the FGFA partnership became an impediment for India in the context of the nation’s aim to build up its domestic defense industry as part of the government’s ‘Make in India’ campaign. Under this and other similar initiatives the government has identified boosting indigenization in the defense sector as one of its top priorities.

India has already earmarked 63% of its military’s capital budget for FY 2021-22– INR 70221 crore — for procuring locally produced weapons and systems. For the AMCA the IAF has decided to go a step further in terms of technology.

India’s 5th-Gen Aircraft

At the Aero India-2021 expo held in February then-IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria was quoted as saying that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is looking at integrating sixth-generation technologies into AMCA.

He added that there was a possibility of equipping AMCA with directed energy weapons superior anti-missile systems advanced missile approach warning systems and teaming it with unmanned systems.

As a fighter with “sixth-generation characteristics” the AMCA’s avionics suite will be equipped with a suite of advanced radars and electronic warfare systems.

The aircraft is expected to have a very low radar cross-section for greater stealth performance along with the integration of specific AI-based systems and an advanced cockpit display with a touch screen interface.

For superior maneuverability the AMCA will reportedly have thrust-vectoring engines. Information about the AMCA’s armaments is not available in plenty. However it has been reported that weapons will be carried entirely in an internal weapons bay to preserve and maximize stealth performance and deep penetration capability of the jet. The fighter will flaunt Beyond-Visual Range missile targeting capability in addition to having typical standoff weapons air-to-air missiles and guided bombs on board.

These technologies aside the question of which engine will power the AMCA still lingers.

Powering The AMCA

British firm Rolls Royce the French Safran Engines and US-based General Electric (GE) Aviation are the frontrunners for being the power behind the Indian fighter jet.

In an article for Indian Aerospace and Defence Bulletin Group Captain Anupam Banerjee (retd) noted that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) one of the developers of AMCA and Rolls Royce agreed to expand their current partnership at Aero India 2021.

Even at present Rolls Royce has a solid ground to stand on as the Indian Armed forces already use around 750 Rolls-Royce engines of 10 engine types.

The significant ones in use are the Adour Mk811 powering India Air Force’s Jaguar Adour Mk871 placed in Hawk AJT AE2100 engine of the C-130J Super Hercules strategic airlift aircraft and AE3007 engine for VIP and Surveillance aircraft Embraer ERJ145.

Any company with this kind of footprint in a country will in the normal course be interested to increase such engagements.

As EurAsian Times had recently reported the British company has already shown interest in working with India to co-develop and manufacture engines for AMCA even offering the country ownership of the Intellectual Property rights for the same.

On the other hand HAL’s Executive Director (Corporate Planning) D Maiti and Safran Aircraft Engines’ CEO Pierre Dickeli also signed an MoU at the Aero India expo. The stated aim was to explore opportunities for strategic business cooperation.

The MoU’s scope includes the maintenance repair and overhauling (MRO) of M88 and other engines transfer of key manufacturing technologies and manufacturing alongside development and production of high thrust aero-engines.

Like its European rival Rolls Royce Safran also has skin in the game. It is one of the main contributors to the 36 Rafales that India acquired in 2016.

The inertial navigation systems produced by Safran are equipped in over 500 fighter aircraft used by the IAF and the Indian Navy. The Sigma 95N navigation systems built by the firm are used in the Sukhoi 30 Tejas MiG-27 MiG-29 Jaguar and Hawk fighter planes.

Additionally with more than 1500 helicopter engines in service the Safran Group is also the leading supplier of turbine engines for the Indian armed forces’ choppers.

Meanwhile the American corporation GE is the supplier of F404IN20 engines for the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas Mk-1. The company’s F414-INS6 engines were also selected to power the MK-2 version of the LCA. To boot the company’s CFM56 engines power the Indian Navy’s P-8I while the CT7-8 engines power the Indian Air Force’s VVIP squadron of AW101.

Like Safran GE Aviation also supplies integrated systems and technologies. These are used in combat aircraft military transport and helicopters besides being fitted in land vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Various Indian platforms like the Hawk Mk 132 SEPECAT Jaguar (Shamsher) P-8I C130J and HJT-36 Sitara deploy GE’s systems.

Early in 2019 The Week had reported that the AMCA will be powered by the GE F414 engine with a thrust of over 90kN. This was to be an interim setup till a higher-thrust 110kN engine is finalized. It was reported that the plan involved flying the AMCA with the F414 engine for the first six to seven years using this “interim engine”.

The situation regarding this isn’t clear yet. In the meanwhile as Banerjee suggests it might be easier to find a solution if “[r]ather than looking at the whole process of engine manufacturing as a problem statement or challenge[…]it is broken down into smaller sub-parts of various problem-solving statements which can be derived at by identifying the critical technology challenges that we have encountered in our years of service put into this field.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Create Niche Pages on TikTok

""One side hustle that is extremely lucrative and has the potential to grow beyond a side hustle is creating niche pages on TikTok and growing an audience that can be monetized through sponsorships "" said Kyle Dulay co-founder of Collabstr an online marketplace to find and hire content creators on TikTok Instagram and YouTube. ""The idea is pretty simple you pick a niche that is interesting to you and post consistently until you build your audience over 10000 followers. The great thing about TikTok is that it's much easier to grow on there compared to other platforms like Instagram or YouTube. I personally accumulated over 100k users across two pages in less than 12 months. As you grow it will become much easier to make money off of your page. At first you may have to reach out to brands manually and pitch them on a potential sponsorship but as you grow you'll begin to get more deals coming inbound.""

Oli Welsh has already shared his first impressions but for Digital Foundry the preview was a chance to get up close and personal with the technology to get some idea of how the new Xbox consoles are put through their paces and crucially to see how the game may scale across systems.

Scalability is key to Forza Horizon 5 for several reasons. First of all it's a Horizon game supports more platforms than it ever has before. In addition to PC (with scalability challenges of its own) and two quite different Xbox Series consoles there's Xbox One as well not to mention Xbox One X. The preview code we had only worked on the new machines so quite how Playground intends to run the game on Xbox One remains to be seen but perhaps there are some clues when looking at Series code principally because both quality and performance modes are included. Intriguingly whether you're running on Series X or its junior counterpart both of them run at the same resolution: 3840x2160 or 1920x1080 respectively albeit with potential hints of dynamic resolution scaling in play on the performance mode (truth is it's quite hard to tell).

With the code we have available Xbox Series X running in quality mode is clearly the top tier experience we were able to sample. Frame-rate is pegged at 30fps (more on this shortly) allowing for the most dense rich and expansive Forza Horizon experience we've seen yet. The signature Horizon intro drive begins with the 2021 Ford Bronco arriving by plane (!) at the top of an active volcano where we get our first look at the kind of intense detail Playground is aiming for along with some sublime lighting. Sunlight bisects the view cutting through the smoke rising from the lava. One curve later and we're in full sunlight where environmental density ramps up still further working in combination with more expansive vistas - a coherent view from the car right out to the horizon with no sign of object LODs - meaning no 'pop' whether on geometry or textures. It's capped off with a couple of high altitude jumps that are simply breathtaking.

A high speed run into a dust storm follows showcasing Playground's new particle and volumetrics systems before we take a detour into the jungle - the most detail-rich biome and also the most technologically challenging owing to the lavish amounts of trees and foliage all of which still runs flat-out at target frame-rate regardless of which mode you choose. The final race takes you out into the desert for a final high-speed run to the Horizon festival bringing a satisfying conclusion to the game's introduction but really this just sets the scene for what is to come.

The question of how this phenomenal experience scales down the chain of Series consoles and graphics modes perhaps gives us some insight into how the game will adapt to less powerful kit. That begins with performance mode on Series X which doesn't compromise on resolution (bar potential dynamic resolution scaling) but is clearly a different experience. First of all it's got to be said that the 30fps implementation in quality mode is remarkable: motion blur shutter speed is judged perfectly frame-rate never wavers while the game still seems highly responsive. Maybe there's more to it than that but the combination of the implementation and the enriched visuals is going to give gamers an interesting choice. It may not be 60fps but it still looks a great deal better than a 30fps update may suggest.

Performance mode still manages to capture a great deal of the game's richness and density but a layer of post-process realism is peeled back along with some effects and crucially some detail. Less crucial environmental elements such as rocks and vegetation are absent shading quality looks to be reduced in select areas while motion blur is significantly less reined. The effect of Mexico's stunning vistas isn't diminished that much though as far-off detail seems very similar to the fully unleashed game. However perhaps the most noticeable compromise is that the nigh-on flawless shift in level of detail transitions in the quality mode is less robust in performance mode. What's curious here is that the LOD popping seems to adjust according to the density of the scene - easily noticeable in the jungle not really an issue at all in the desert for example. There's the sense here that we're not looking at global presets roughly adjusted according to the mode chosen but perhaps something more dynamic. This would not be too surprising bearing in mind that Forza titles on PC have offered dynamic settings adjustment (to the point where we got Forza Horizon 3 running flat-out at 4K30 on a GTX 970 using the dynamic/high setting).

Those looking for further examples of scalability from Series S may emerge none the wiser because evidence from a couple of hours' play suggests that the only major difference between Series X and Series S comes down to resolution. Both quality and performance modes are still included with the same differences between them: effectively with the 1080p60 mode you're trading a pristine 1080p30 experience for a more 'game-like' image with strategic nips and tucks on detail levels shading quality and again most noticeably in motion consistency owing to visible pop-in during the densest scenes. In all modes across both Series consoles frame-rates were perfect in all the content we had available to test.

Ray tracing? Yes it's also available in the preview build. As announced already by Playground Games RT is only available in the Forza Vista area of the game and only with the game set to the quality mode to boot. Basically you visit the in-game garage where you can take a close-up look at the vehicles at their highest fidelity level. Those hoping for a Control-style reflections showcase may be disappointed. In fact you may not quite understand how RT is deployed at all until you take a closer look at the screenshot gallery below (and even then use the full-image switch to see how it works) but essentially RT embellishes the existing reflections which are already pretty impressive. The vehicle detail itself is traced into the reflections as opposed to full reflections from the surrounding environment and vehicle self-reflections. RT is more functional here then adding an extra layer of realism. We'd like to see this in-game for the quality mode but the existing reflections still look impressive enough to the point where many believed that they were produced via ray tracing.

Xbox Series X Quality Mode (RT On) Xbox Series X Performance Mode (RT Off) Ray tracing is only available in quality mode in the garage. Existing reflection technology is augmented with ray-traced self-reflections. Subtle in many scenarios but a worthwhile and intelligent add-on to an already impressive effect.

The Forza Horizon 5 press preview delivered much while leaving the vast majority of the game locked away from view - leaving us hungry for more. Nothing we've seen so far suggests that the Xbox Series versions will be anything other than excellent while the quality and performance modes each shine in their own ways. Typically it's hard to recommend anything other than 60fps or better but the sense is that Playground Games has finely honed the 30fps quality mode to the point where it's actually very different to choose between the two. We're going to be fascinated to see which way players go with this one - when we put together the video we actually needed to have a short discussion to decide which mode to use for b-roll gameplay shots (we opted for the quality mode). But beyond that did we learn much more about how Xbox One is going to get anywhere near the level delivered by the Series consoles? The truth is the best information we have on this matter still comes from what Forza Horizon 5 creative director Mike Brown told us during E3:.

""While Forza Horizon 5 was built to showcase the abilities of X|S consoles in order to provide best-in-class experiences on a wide range of PCs as well as Xbox One we've invested in a number of scalable technologies such as dynamic resolution scaling (DRS) variable draw distances and a robust levels of detail (LOD) system"" he said. We've got some idea now of how those systems work thanks to the graphics and performance mode differences seen in the Xbox Series code we had to play - and it'll be fascinating to see how much further these systems scale. Forza Horizon 5 launches on November 5th and we'll do our level best to deliver the best possible PC and console coverage closer to launch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS10ZWNoL2FydGljbGUvNTQ1NTcvMS93aHktYXJlLWdlbi16LWNvbGxlY3RpbmctMjAteWVhci1vbGQtaXBvZHPSAWpodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXplZGRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UtdGVjaC9hcnRpY2xlLzU0NTU3LzEvd2h5LWFyZS1nZW4tei1jb2xsZWN0aW5nLTIwLXllYXItb2xkLWlwb2RzP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why are Gen Z collecting 20-year-old iPods?,"Two decades on from the Apple product’s launch Y2K fashion and streaming fatigue are fuelling a fascination with the retro Apple gadget

Text James FitzGerald

“I got addicted to finding good deals on eBay” says 25-year-old Zach Goodwin explaining how he ended up building a collection of 100 iPods. “I liked the idea of buying old toys and electronics that were popular when I was younger and couldn’t afford” adds the schoolteacher from New Jersey. Apple’s classic music player is turning 20. Celebrities from Ronaldo to Real Housewives cast members and Ricky Gervais are still using their ageing iPods – and they’re certainly not the only people doing so. These gizmos of yesteryear hold the interest of a global community of obsessives. One subreddit has nearly 18000 members who are dedicated to collecting and using iPods – as well as modifying them to add mind-blowing new features. And many of them aren’t old enough to remember the debut of the first iPod on October 23 2001. “We reject where tech is going” writes a 19-year-old from Australia who goes by the identity Yuuiko on Reddit. “It’s not an art anymore its losing soul.” This seems to be a typical view. For Yuuiko and others the iPod embodies a “simpler time”. Before the likes of Spotify overwhelmed us all with endless choice carefully curating your own music library felt like a mindful activity.

So it’s a mistake to assume all of Generation Z is wedded to streaming services. As Yuuiko sees it: “with an iPod your music is in your hand. Not in some abstract cloud kept and controlled by a robot you pay.” Many in the community want to keep their audio-playing functions separate from their phones saying they prefer to relax and disconnect from the world while listening to their tunes. The vogue for iPods is further explained by teens’ and twentysomethings’ fixation on Y2K fashion - and by the wider renaissance of ‘legacy’ media. For Joe Hughes a 21-year-old university student from Manchester a collection of 26 iPods sits nicely alongside his vinyl records cassettes and CDs. He tells Dazed that he’s not “anti-streaming” but he prefers to own his media. There are many possible reasons why Gen Z have become not just iPod fans but collectors too. Lots of them remember envying their parents’ music-players and can now cheaply acquire second-hand models or just inherit them. 20-year-old Santiago Rivera from Guadalajara Mexico has a model that his father bought in 2001 – supposedly the first iPod purchase in his hometown.

Some started building their stashes after noticing their cars had old-school ports that were begging to have iPods plugged into them. Others found collecting to be a helpful distraction during the pandemic. And then there are those who just obsess over the device’s iconic click wheel. Classic Mini Shuffle Nano. Many varieties many colours: iPods were designed to be collected. But some fans don’t stop there. Jon Maier 20 from Illinois buys iPods that have been engraved with corporate logos from Coca-Cola to Nike. “Whether they were event giveaway items or given to employees at a Christmas party they show something most people would never see.” Similarly for Zach Goodwin in New Jersey buying pre-owned iPods is about more than just acquiring electronics. “It’s a fun game to see what’s on them” he explains. “There was one which had all the American Idol songs on it. Another had a lot of Disney Channel songs.” Collecting iPods is not a new pastime. Late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld is said to have owned 300 and to have employed a ‘nanny’ to look after them. But that was back when the devices were new and plentiful. Now it’s getting harder to get hold of the rare models. In recent years mint-condition original iPods have been listed on eBay for more than £14000 according to reports. It’s on Reddit and Discord that a collective of students musicians designers and even ex-Apple employees come together to trade buying tips and photos of their Frankenstinian creations. Old iPods are seen being cracked open and revivified with Bluetooth tech and massive storage drives.

Influencer figures are emerging - posting YouTube videos about rare finds or how to tinker with iPods. The elusive DankPods is the daddy of them all but other content creators are managing to reach captive audiences as well. Guy Dupont went viral with a video explaining how he modified a 17-year-old iPod to hook up to the internet and run Spotify. The device also hosts other quirky or nostalgic features - including the Game Boy classic Pokemon Red. “There’s something very comforting in the idea that I can buy something and then – if it’s not exactly what I need – I can manipulate it to be the thing I actually want without having to buy another thing” says Dupont a software developer from Massachusetts who aspires to be an inventor. Tech companies face growing criticism for making devices that seem impossible to mend when they break. But iPods are from a time when gadgets didn’t smash if you dropped them – or were at least easy to repair if you did. Compared to newer Apple products they’re simple to open up and fiddle with. “It’s really helping me at a high level to understand how things work” Dupont adds. Amy Avdic from the US state of Georgia has gained devotees with a TikTok channel about retro tech. In one popular post she subverted the popular ‘unboxing’ video. Rather than show the opening-up of a brand-new product Avdic filmed herself removing an ancient iPod from its box. Avdic recognises that she’s “smashing a stereotype” as one of the relatively few women who’ve built a following in the genre. “I collect a lot of old tech and work with computers from the ’80s and ‘90s and I find myself to be one of the few 20-year-old females interested in that field.” Even those who aren’t iPod obsessives can see the device’s legacy all around them. It’s right there in the word ‘podcast’. Surprisingly this was not Apple’s invention. Technologist Ben Hammersley hastily coined the term while writing an article for the Guardian in 2004. Back then it just made sense to link a revolution in audio blogging with a revolutionary new audio player.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vYXBwbGVzLWlwb2QtY2FtZS1vdXQtdHdvLWRlY2FkZXMtYWdvLWFuZC1jaGFuZ2VkLWhvdy13ZS1saXN0ZW4tdG8tbXVzaWMtd2hlcmUtYXJlLXdlLWhlYWRlZC1ub3ctMTY5Mjcy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple's iPod came out two decades ago and changed how we listen to music. Where are we headed now?,"On October 23 2001 Apple released the iPod — a portable media player that promised to overshadow the clunky design and low storage capacity of MP3 players introduced in the mid-1990s.

The iPod boasted the ability to “hold 1000 songs in your pocket”. Its personalised listening format revolutionised the way we consume music. And with more than 400 million units sold since its release there’s no doubt it was a success.

Yet two decades later the digital music landscape continues to rapidly evolve.

A market success

The iPod expanded listening beyond the constraints of the home stereo system allowing the user to plug into not only their headphones but also their car radio their computer at work or their hi-fi system at home. It made it easier to entwine these disparate spaces into a single personalised soundtrack throughout the day.

There were several preconditions that led to the iPod’s success. For one it contributed to the end of an era in which people listened to relatively fixed music collections such as mixtapes or albums in their running order. The iPod (and MP3 players more generally) normalised having random collections of individual tracks.

Then during the 1990s an MP3 encoding algorithm developed at the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany allowed unprecedented audio data compression ratios. In simple terms this made music files much smaller than before hugely increasing the quantity of music that could be stored on a device.

Then came peer-to-peer file-sharing services such as Napster Limewire and BitTorrent released in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively. These furthered the democratisation of the internet for the end user (with Napster garnering 80 million users in three years). The result was a fast-changing digital landscape where music piracy ran rife.

The accessibility of music significantly changed the relationship between listener and musician. In 2003 Apple responded to the music piracy crisis by launching its iTunes store creating an attractive model for copyright-protected content.

Meanwhile the iPod continued to sell year after year. It was designed to do one thing and did it well. But this would change around 2007 with the release of the touchscreen iPhone and Android smartphones.

Computer in your pocket

The rise of touchscreen smartphones ultimately led to the iPod’s downfall. Interestingly the music app on the original iPhone was called “iPod”.

The iPod’s functions were essentially reappropriated and absorbed into the iPhone. The iPhone was a flexible and multifunctional device: an iPod a phone and an internet communicator all in one — a computer in your pocket.

And by making the development tools for their products freely available Apple and Google allowed third-party developers to create apps for their new platforms in the thousands.

It was a game-changer for the mobile industry. And the future line of tablets such as Apple’s iPad released in 2010 continued this trend. In 2011 iPhone sales overtook the iPod and in 2014 the iPod Classic was discontinued.

Unlike the Apple Watch which serves as a companion to smartphones single-purpose devices such as the iPod Classic are now seen as antiquated and obsolete.

Music streaming and the role of the web

As of this year mobile devices are responsible for 54.8% of web traffic worldwide. And while music piracy still exists its influence has been significantly reduced by the arrival of streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube.

These platforms have had a profound effect on how we engage with music as active and passive listeners. Spotify supports an online community-based approach to music sharing with curated playlists.

Based on our listening habits it uses our activity data and a range of machine-learning techniques to generate automatic recommendations for us. Both Spotify and YouTube have also embraced sponsored content which boosts the visibility of certain labels and artists.

And while we may want to bypass popular music recommendations — especially to support new generations of musicians who lack visibility — the reality is we’re faced with a quantity of music we can’t possibly contend with. As of February this year more than 60000 tracks were being uploaded to Spotify each day.

The experience of listening to music will become increasingly immersive with time and we’ll only find more ways to seamlessly integrate it into our lives. Some signs of this include:

Gen Z’s growing obsession with platforms such as TikTok which is a huge promotional tool for artists lucky enough to have their track attached to a viral trend

new interactive tools for music exploration such as Radio Garden (which lets you tune into radio stations from across the globe) the Eternal Jukebox for Spotify and Instrudive

the use of wearables such as Bose’s audio sunglasses and bone-conduction headphones which allow you to listen to music while interacting with the world rather than being closed off and

the surge in virtual music performances during the COVID pandemic which suggests virtual reality augmented reality and mixed reality will become increasingly accepted as spaces for experiencing music performances.

The industry is also increasingly adopting immersive audio. Apple has incorporated Dolby Atmos 3D spatial audio into both its Logic Pro music production software and music on the iTunes store. With spatial audio capabilities the listener can experience surround sound with the convenience of portable headphones.

As for algorithms we can assume more sophisticated machine learning will emerge. In the future it may recommend music based on our feelings. For example MoodPlay is a music recommendation system that lets users explore music through mood-based filtering.

Some advanced listening devices even adapt to our physiology. The Australian-designed Nura headphones can pick up information about how a specific listener’s ears respond to different sound frequencies. They purport to automatically adjust the sound to perfectly suit that listener.

Such technologies are taking “personalised listening” to a whole new level and advances in this space are set to continue. If the digital music landscape has changed so rapidly within the past 20 years we can only assume it will continue to change over the next two decades too.

From Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie to Jessica Alba and Angelina Jolie the A-listers of this era were often spotted in tabloids captured leaving clubs late at night and dared to wear the lowest of low-rise jeans on red carpets. Of course this was the pre-digital era; there was some semblance of privacy still to be found. Today’s It girls have evolved to be always on strategically sharing glimpses of a carefully curated life on social media working with stylists to hone a red carpet aesthetic and plotting their career paths with longevity in mind. Like the It girls before her 19-year-old Chiara Aurelia is blazing her own trail and is doing so with a uniquely Gen Z point of view.

We caught up with Aurelia at the tail end of summer syncing up via Zoom days before she wrapped her latest project Luckiest Girl Alive. Against an austere hotel room background Aurelia somehow manages to look radiant illuminated by the natural light. It may come as some surprise that the actress looks nothing like her character Jeanette Turner from Hulu hit Cruel Summer the role that catapulted her into the spotlight. With her hair swept back in a bouncy ponytail and wearing a silk newsprint Dior blouse she scored on The RealReal Aurelia is every bit the modern-day ingenue—a vision her ’90s teen character could never have conjured.

Incidentally Aurelia has become the queen of surprises drawing attention not only for her work in Cruel Summer (the 10-episode first season ended in July and was immediately renewed for a second) but also for her role in Fear Street Part Two: 1978 which premiered a week earlier. Fortunately she’s a fan of suspense or at least she knows how to play the role of a good sport. ""I love surprises” she gushes. ""I mean when it comes to personal life not as much but being able to be on the edge of your seat when you’re invested in a story or a movie that you’re watching or a script that you’re reading that’s super fun.” There’s an important difference however between the thriller and horror genres (she would know; she’s already done both) with one feeling more timeless and the other best consumed around Halloween. ""All of the gore murders and chaos [of horror] can be super fun to work on but they’re a little bit more terrifying for me to watch” she confesses.

Fortunately Luckiest Girl Alive is poised to be another thrilling sensation. Jessica Knoll the author of the best-selling 2015 mystery novel who Aurelia describes as a ""close friend and a genius” adapted the story for the big screen and put together an incredible cast (including Mila Kunis and Connie Britton) to bring it to life. Although Aurelia’s role has yet to be confirmed by Netflix Knoll sang her praises in a late-summer Instagram post. ""[Aurelia] blew us all away” reads a caption of a photo of the two hugging below the neon sign of Fanelli Cafe in SoHo. ""She captured her spunk her wit and her devastation. Oh god I can’t wait for you to see what I’ve seen.” Hint: If you haven’t already read the book here’s your chance. Then feel free to wager which character Knoll is referring to—Aurelia’s lips remained sealed.

Based on her recent successes Aurelia’s predilection for stories of a darker nature seems like a smart path to pursue. But it would be remiss to pigeonhole this young actress into the thriller genre or any genre for that matter. In fact her dream role is an unexpectedly classic choice: Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz a childhood favorite. ""The Wizard of Oz was a huge touchstone for me when I was younger” Aurelia explains. ""It captured all of the things that I loved about the film industry. Plus the singing and dancing and incredible acting it was so advanced for its time.” In fact Aurelia and her friends still enjoy watching the 1939 movie together despite the endless options available via today’s streaming services.

Like Judy Garland the original Dorothy Aurelia’s look is timeless. As an actress she has already played teenagers in the ’70s and ’90s and will presumably take on the role of a present-day 20-something in Luckiest Girl Alive. As an individual Aurelia is also a chameleon whose personal style is equally at home in the vintage ’90s Steve Madden boots she kept from Cruel Summer and her present-day styling of that early ’00s Dior blouse. ""I’m into some of the ’90s fashion trends… the mom jeans low-rise pants butterfly clips and platform shoes. Honestly there’s so much to love” she reflects.

A card-carrying member of Gen Z Aurelia is embracing the high-low aesthetic as she figures out what feels right for this moment in her career scoring gems on The RealReal and getting inspiration from a variety of stylists. ""I’m still finding out who I am in terms of the way that I want to look and how I want to portray myself but I’m having a lot of fun mixing and matching high-fashion brands with vintage clothing and consignment stores” she shares.

Before we wrap up we ask Aurelia what’s up next after a busy and extremely successful summer. ""As long as I’m working with such incredibly talented people I look forward to discovering my next projects and exploring further as time unfolds. I’m very lucky to be walking on this path” acknowledges the burgeoning It girl paving her own yellow brick road of sorts.

We already know that Chiara Aurelia is uniquely talented but only time will tell if she’s actually the luckiest girl alive. We can’t wait to find out!

Made by what was long ago Chrysler Defense (presently part of General Dynamics) and first used in 1980 the machine is still described as the “most sophisticated tank on the market.”

The massive contraption – it weighs between 60 and 70 tons depending on version – takes its power from a Honeywell (Lycoming in the older days) turbine engine that is capable of generating 1500 shaft horsepower and is controlled by means of an Allison transmission with four forward and two reverse gears.The thing is simply huge and because of this it can only travel at speeds of just up to 45 mph (72 kph) and for as much as 310 miles (500 km) before running out of fuel.The tank must be an absolute horror in the eyes of the enemy and plenty of them in countries like Iraq have got to experience its force first hand. For the rest of us the Abrams remains a distant and discreet machine. Until you come across something like the short video attached below.It shows an Abrams during a live fire exercise at an undisclosed location. It’s one of the M1A2 variety meaning the one in production since the early 1990s. This one is the heaviest of the bunch at 68.4 short tons and is equipped with a Rheinmetall-made 120 mm gun.This tank also uses a two-axis Raytheon gunner’s primary sight which according to the guys that posted the video Military in Action  allows the chances of first round hit to be increased through faster target acquisition and improved gun pointing.Oh and the sound the main gun makes when fired is simply terrifying and it’s probably even more so for the people at the receiving end of the shells.",,,,,,

And she's not the only one who sees it that way.

""There's no regulatory bubble around it"" Robak said.

There's still debate about just how much carbon farmers can intentionally draw from the air and deposit into the soil a process called carbon sequestration.

Robak is working that frontier. She helps farmers change some practices and measure the impact on their soils as they join a new carbon marketplace backed by corporate partners including Land O'Lakes and General Mills.

How do carbon markets work?

Agricultural carbon markets pay farmers to draw greenhouse gases namely carbon dioxide from the air and keep it locked in the soil to fight climate change. Plants do this naturally through photosynthesis; farmers encourage it by limiting their tilling grazing livestock in crop fields and planting cover crops in the off season or between row crops.

Corporations pay for those credits through brokers to offset their carbon pollution.

By the end of August voluntary carbon market transactions were near $750 million globally for the year according to an Ecosystem Marketplace Insights Report putting 2021 on track to set a new annual record since the Ecosystem Marketplace launched in 2005. The trading of greenhouse gas emissions dates back to the early 1990s but it has accelerated this year due to a rapid increase of net-zero carbon neutral and other climate change-related commitments from corporations.

Consumers are demanding more sustainable practices as the effects of climate change are increasingly visible and catastrophic. Countries around the world are working to meet goals set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement and keep global temperature rise this century below 1.5 degrees Celsius when compared to pre-industrial levels. That's about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.

In Minnesota average temperatures have risen 1 degree Fahrenheit to 3 degrees Fahrenheit depending on the part of the state. Farmers are being recruited here to help combat climate change by capturing carbon even as the science and policy of carbon markets is unsettled.

What's the risk?

In late August Robak stepped through a field lush with new pea shoots kale clover and sorghum sudangrass. All are cover crops planted as part of a pilot program that will pay farmers if their soils show a marked increase in carbon.

Farmers plant different cover crops to add nutrients to the soil absorb excess nutrients or produce something their livestock can eat. Radishes for example can absorb nitrogen from the soil which is good for water quality.

Robak lead nutrient management specialist and certified crop advisor for Centra Sota Cooperative in Little Falls is helping enroll producers into a carbon market pilot. The costs to make the changes are covered by the member-based nonprofit running the market called the Ecosystem Services Market Consortium or ESMC.

""Right now in the world of carbon markets everyone seems to have their own offer out there"" said Robak. ""There is no really good regulation set around it. There's no USDA farm programs around it nothing like we have in the crop insurance world.""

And there is no consensus on how to best assess soil for carbon gains.

""It's very difficult and expensive to do"" said Danny Cullenward policy director for CarbonPlan a nonprofit that analyzes climate solutions. ""That means a lot of these efforts are either trying to confront the fact that it would be very expensive to carefully measure the outcomes in these efforts or maybe they want to cut corners and find ways not to directly measure or measure cheaply.""

Big companies governments and environmental groups are willing to bet on agriculture and other working lands like forests to sequester excess carbon that's been released into the atmosphere primarily through combustion of fossil fuels.

Planting cover crops could sequester 6.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in Minnesota according to a January report from The Nature Conservancy. Reducing tillage practices and improved management of fertilizers and nutrients could reduce emissions by more than 4 million metric tons.

That is the hope.

""I do think that we run the risk of really losing credibility in the eyes of the public if these markets fail. Because the hype has been so high"" said Anna Cates Minnesota's state soil health specialist. ""That's where I see the greatest risk.""

What are farmers saying?

Jen Wagner-Lahr likes that her family's Cold Spring farm will contribute data and useful information to a fledgling carbon market program.

Her husband Larry Lahr grows crops and raises about 450 cattle on more than 500 acres and they're enrolled in the ESMC pilot. They planted their first cover crops this fall. They've been limiting their tilling already a practice touted for keeping more carbon in the soil because there's less disturbance to the soil's microbiome.

""It's really kind of a unique opportunity in this region. That a pilot is here where we can actually contribute to that verification aspect"" Wagner-Lahr said.

Her husband likes that there's a financial incentive to ""do the right thing.""

""We prefer to do our practices in a more environmentally responsible way with sustainability in mind"" Lahr said. ""It's turning out we can do that without necessarily sacrificing the ability to make a living off the farm.""

Jason Lorenz is another farmer in the pilot program who signed up for the soil improvements that come with practices tied to carbon sequestration and carbon markets. He’s been using cover crops to some extent for a few years and sees improvements on his farm near Little Falls. He has 40 acres enrolled in the ESMC pilot.

""It just makes your soil healthier"" Lorenz said of cover crops. ""You take care of the soil the soil takes care of you.""

Using cover crops brings increased yields for many farmers who try them and can bring cost savings on gasoline and fertilizer. Cover crops also help reduce erosion and allow farmland to hold more water which will make that land more resilient to the challenges that come with climate change.

The trouble with testing soil for carbon

The Ecosystem Services Market Consortium is halfway through a three-year pilot program. They take a soil sample when they enroll a new farm plug it into a model and retest the soil after a few years.

Caroline Wade ESMC deputy director says customers are demanding legitimate climate solutions.

""The pressure is on more and more and it's consumer driven"" Wade said. ""Consumers want to know that the products they're purchasing have been produced sustainably and are not having negative impacts on the environment.""

ESMC is making changes throughout the pilot as it gathers feedback and is trying to be thoughtful and methodical with its pilot and eventual launch said Project Manager Stacy Cushenbery.

Farmer Jason Lorenz holds a handful of soil from a field he farms Aug. 31 near Little Falls. Dave Schwarz/dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com

There's a lot of pioneering and a lot of market runners have jumped right in Wade said. ""We are working toward where we think the puck will be not necessarily where the immediate uncertain opportunity is.""

Soil has a lot of potential to sequester carbon but carbon test results can vary depending on the depth of the sample where it was taken on a field and the history of land use for that particular section of earth.

The question is not whether cover crops and no-till practices draw in atmospheric carbon but ""how much can we really do"" said Angelyca Jackson Hammond manager for carbon scientific communications with Indigo which has an agricultural carbon market program.

""We have some data it's not perfect but we can't wait for another 50 or 100 years until we have the perfect data set"" Jackson Hammond said.

Soil health practices like using cover crops and limiting tillage have shown improvement in the structure of soil but there isn’t a lot of evidence that they increase the amount of carbon held in it.

""We haven't found a way besides growing a prairie or growing a forest that really builds carbon"" Cates said. ""Farming practices can change carbon levels. And in some cases they are just maintaining carbon levels and preventing loss not building new carbon. Should that be a credit? You know I don't know. That's kind of a market question more than a science question.""

Many agricultural activities release carbon dioxide (CO₂) methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) to the atmosphere. Some store carbon in plants and soil. CRS

The very existence of the market allows big companies to continue emitting greenhouse gases while claiming those emissions are offset by agricultural or forestry practices — even while the jury is still out on whether those practices truly sequester carbon for the long term.

There's little oversight and carbon market companies often police themselves by paying third-party verifiers to back them up which Cullenward sees as a conflict of interest.

""They all say when you buy a credit you've caused a farmer or a forest manager to change the way that they're running their practices"" he said. ""They're making the claim that a small trickle of income is the difference between a project surely doing nothing good and absolutely doing something very very positive.""

The problem with the price of credits in carbon markets

The incentives are moving in the wrong direction Cullenward said. There's pressure among carbon markets to keep prices down and provide a lot of credits.

Robak the Little Falls agronomist thinks the price for carbon should be higher. And she’s not alone.

Brad Doyle an Arkansas farmer and vice president of the American Soybean Association says the price needs to increase to make it worth farmers’ time and effort — whether it's private companies or governments paying the bill.

""They're not going to change their current practices with the economics such as they are with $15 (per credit)"" Doyle said. ""It's going to have to be $35 or more $40 or more.""

The economics need to be there Doyle said. It is not enough to improve soil health and offer a small payment for it.

Assistant Extension Professor Anna Cates speaks during a Soil Stewardship and Nutrient Management Field Day on Sept. 1 near Albany. Dave Schwarz/dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com

Cates sees potential in stacked benefits. Farmers could generate a credit for a positive contribution to water quality on top of a credit for sequestering some carbon however difficult that is to measure.

""The carbon market should be the sprinkles"" she said. ""It should not be the primary reason that you're doing it.""

Farmers are motivated to enroll for myriad reasons and cover crops look different on every farm depending on the soil geography and primary crop.

The bottom line is a factor for many but not for all.

""I ain't farming to get rich. I'm farming because I like it and that's what God put me here for to take care of it"" said Little Falls farmer Jason Lorenz. ""I want to leave it better than I found it.""

Among them are a coterie of mixed-media works by Jacob Jackmauh that echo the menagerie one might find at a playground or a theme park including an owl with opaque binocular eyes and a snail shell with a coin slot.

McGinn and Jackmauh’s outdoor exhibition takes its title from singer Earl Grant’s 1958 ballad “(At) the end (of a Rainbow)” in which the crooner silkily intones phrases that turn precipitously from auspicious to foreboding: “At the end of the river / The water stops its flow / At the end of a highway / There’s no place you can go.” The sculptures also revel in a cheery pessimism. McGinn’s scaled-up grotesques interrogate these treacly cereal “charms” which look more like colorful shapeless blobs than rainbows or shooting stars. The nostalgia that surrounds this childhood treat vanishes after that hit of sugar causes one’s body to crash. Jackmauh’s works—including an oversized water spigot and a crocodile whose open mouth contains a fixture resembling a bathtub drain a shower spout or even the receiver of a kiddie phone—likewise deflate those objects of youthful play and diversion. Sadly they only appear functional—the viewer is held in anticipation of something that will frustratingly never arrive.

McGinn and Jackmauh’s spunky humorous critiques of mass-produced juvenilia parallel theorist Sianne Ngai’s writing on the late capitalist underpinnings of minor aesthetic categories such as “cute.” Ngai understands “cuteness” as an index for consumption which elicits affective responses that can vary from tenderness to aggression. Such reactions prompt one not only to consume the object but also to identify with it. The artists’ sculptures are an indictment of this brand of false advertising; the Lucky Charms rainbow does lead to a pot of gold but for General Mills and no one else alas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsdWVyaWRnZW5vdy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzI0L21pbGxzLXJpdmVyLXRvd24tY291bmNpbC1lbGVjdGlvbi1icmlhbi1raW1iYWxsLzg1MjczNTQwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mills River Town Council election: Brian Kimball,"Incumbent Brian Kimball faces James Cantrell in the race for the Mills River Town Council District 2 seat in the Nov. 2 municipal general election.

Dennis Grass who also filed for the District 2 seat and is on the ballot has since withdrawn from the race.

Incumbent Brian Caskey faces challenger Sandra Goode in the District 1 race. Shannon Gonce is running unopposed for the District 3 seat after Mayor Chae Davis decide not to seek re-election.

Other races on the ballot are Hendersonville mayor and Fletcher mayor along with council seats in Hendersonville Fletcher Flat Rock and Laurel Park.

Kimball Caskey Goode and Cantrell were sent questions from the Times-News. Kimball's answers are below.

Why did you decide to run for a seat on council?

I was born and raised in Mills River and have seen many changes over the years. I believe it is the duty of all town leaders to bring their community together serve residents and plan the future of their town.

While growth may change the landscape of Mills River it does not have to change the values of what our community represents.

As a council we need to identify future issues and address them before they negatively impact the community. If we are honest that is something council has not done with great success in the past. I am devoted to ensuring Mills River does not become another small town that is a casualty to unmanaged growth and a lack of foresight.

I believe council must be engaged with the public constantly working to preserve our community and representing those who elected us. I want to ensure this becomes the future legacy of Mills River’s town councils.

If elected what will your top priorities be?

Since the town’s creation candidates have conducted campaigns under the banner of either being pro-agriculture from the agriculture community or in favor of farmland preservation. Yet to date there is not a town sponsored program that allows for a landowner to protect their farmland to ensure future agriculture use. After 18 years of talking it’s time to act.

Approximately six months ago Councilman Austin and I started the process to create such a program. We have developed the foundations for a voluntary program that compensates a landowner who chooses to conserve their land for agriculture use.

This program retains our agriculture history and helps to maintain the rural character of our landscape. If elected I will continue this work to ensure it is implemented.

I am also committed to creating a program consisting of “town hall” style public engagement sessions. These meetings will venture outside of our regular council meetings and allow for residents to connect with elected officials.

Residents will be able to share their concerns ask questions and get updates on upcoming events. It should be the priority of all elected leaders to serve their community by making themselves available to residents on a routine basis.

What do you believe are the main issues impacting Mills River residents? What do you want to do to address those issues?

The main issues impacting Mills River residents are growth and services. Mills River is centrally located between Asheville Hendersonville Brevard and Fletcher. This makes Mills River one of the most desirable places to live and do business.

Over the last 10 years we have seen significant growth and the town is projected to grow by 33% in population over the next 25 years. As a town we cannot stop change and growth but we can do a better job of managing it and attracting the type of businesses that bring services and character to our town.

The most common question I hear from residents is “What does the town actually do for me?” Mills River has a low tax rate but if we are not solving problems for the community or providing the residents with services then we are still not offering a valuable representation in return for the taxpayers. We have to step up as a town and start providing value to our residents.

Why should voters choose you?

I have served on the Planning Board for nine years and understand the issues facing Mills River and the tools we must use to solve them. During my time on the Planning Board I was elected to serve as both vice chairman and chairman. In May of 2020 I was unanimously appointed by Town Council to fill out the remainder of the abdicated District 2 seat on council.

In the year and half that I have been on council I have advocated for the completion and adoption of the town’s 2040 comprehensive plan. This plan was the result of two years of public input. It also involved work by the town’s Comprehensive Plan Steering Committee Parks Committee Agriculture Advisory Committee Town Council and the Planning Board.

I also initiated the town’s first partnered project with N.C. DOT to have a guardrail installed on Butler Bridge Road between Hollabrook Farms and the Glens of Aberdeen subdivisions to ensure resident safety.

Some of my work on council serves inside the organization as I also developed the foundations for the town's formal first written review process for our town manager’s yearly evaluation that can be used for years to come.

If elected what are your plans to handle growth and development as well as the housing crisis?

First the town must be proactive in identifying land use issues and the positive or negative impacts they will have on our residents' lives. Second council must be committed to making decisions for the betterment of the community while understanding they may not always be popular.

We are a community of many people and we must represent all members not just the loudest or those from one sector of our community.

Lastly we must start recruiting the types of development that we want in our areas where growth is going to occur instead of just watching it happen.

During my time on the Planning Board we sent several requests to previous councils over a nine-year period to address the “workforce/affordable” housing issue. Due to inaction in the past by the town a limited inventory of land with both water and sewer connections and various watershed/floodplain regulations we will have to look to other options besides higher density.

Even if the town were to offer incentives Mills River cannot support that independently. This is a regional problem. Therefore we will have to work with other local governmental bodies and third parties to create these opportunities.

Any additional comments?

I am running for the District 2 seat to serve promote and preserve our wonderful community. Mills River is rapidly changing and is projected to grow tremendously. It is my commitment to manage inevitable change and prevent overdevelopment in our agriculture and rural areas.

As a town we are blessed to have a strong professional staff that serves our residents and it's time to have a professional council that does that as well. That process all starts with selecting qualified candidates.

I graduated from Western Carolina University in May of 2000 with a degree in business management and have served on the Planning Board for nine years. I was appointed to Town Council for the last year and half and have attended numerous N.C. School of Government classes. Our town will need this level of experience to navigate our future.

The upcoming election will be one of the most important in the history of our town. It is my commitment to set aside personal agendas represent the community as a whole and take a passionate responsibility for our future.

With the spike in the demand for the finished textile goods due to coal shortage and increase in prices of chemicals several mill owners during a meeting of the SGTPA in the first week of October suggested they will have to shut the mills for a month in November.

The final decison on the keeping the mills shut was not taken in the meeting and SGTPA president Jitubhai Vakhariya had said it will be deicided in the meeting on October 23.

During the meeting on Saturday the mills owners suggested not to keep the units closed.

One of the major issues raised by the mill owners was that there might be problem of migration of labourers from Surat to other states and the coal issue had been solved upto some extent.

The mill owners pointed out that there is a good demand of textile finished goods across the country due to the Diwali festival marriage season and Pongal festival which will last for the next three months.

SGTPA president Jitubhai Vakhariya said “Our meeting concluded with the decision not to keep the mills shut for one month. We will call our next meeting on November 15 to discuss the increase in work charges by 15 per cent. Presently the payment structure by textile traders to mill owners varies from 7-30 days. We have decided to bring uniformity and a fixed period for the payments.”

Textile mill owner Sanjay Saraogi said “The lignite coal supply has been presently streamlined to an extent and we have got stock of lignite coal for the next 15 days. The monsoon season has also ended and we hope that after Diwali the supply will smoothen to an extent. “

“Our association is also carrying out discussions with GMDC (Gujarat Minerals Development Corporation) and we are hopeful of a positive response. If the mills remain shut for one month all the machinery will get jammed and it would take five days to restart the machines and the mill owners wil have to spend lakhs of money. The major issue was if the mills remain shut for one month the labourers may migrate to their native places ” he added.

Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) president Ashish Gujarati also said that if the mills remain shut for one month different segments in the textile industry like powerloom sector trading sector embroidery will be affected.

“It would be difficult for the labourers to survive in Surat as they have to regularly pay their rents” the SGCCI president added."

Hummer EV truck shows it can compete with its gas-powered rivals

""Attack the grade here. Now mash the brake and modulate the throttle"" Al Oppenheiser the chief engineer of GMC's Hummer EV guided me as I carefully steered the 9000-lb. truck up a steep rocky incline.

Oppenheiser and I were driving an early prototype of the $112595 pickup truck along a course designed to test its on-road and off-road capabilities at General Motors' proving grounds in Milford Michigan.

Oppenheiser a longtime GM employee and former chief engineer of the Camaro dedicated nearly three years to building the all-electric Hummer. The leviathan conquers off-roading meccas nimbly handles tight corners and illustrates how internal combustion engines are relics of the past.

Customer deliveries of the Hummer EV Edition 1 begin in December. First-year production is completely sold out though a GM spokesperson declined to say how many are being built. The next Hummer EV a sport utility vehicle launches in the first quarter of 2023.

The Hummer EV's engineers tested the truck's off-roading capabilities in Moah Utab and on the famous Rubicon Trail. GM

The Hummer EV which debuted a year ago already has formidable competition in the red-hot EV truck market: Tesla's Cybertruck Rivian's R1T the Ford F-150 Lightning the Fisker Alaska Bollinger's B1 and B2. In January GM will also introduce an all-electric Sierra pickup truck built with the same Ultium battery-pack technology as in the Hummer. Seeing GM and Ford workers pull up to production plants in brawny diesel and V8-powered trucks motivated Oppenheiser to develop a hardcore electric pickup.

""I would ask myself 'Why would these people buy an electric truck?'"" Oppenheiser said. ""A truck is a truck in our opinion. The off-roading world has been waiting to see what EV trucks can do.""

GM has invested billions in its third-generation EV platform and is targeting annual global EV sales of more than 1 million by 2025. Battery cells will be mass-produced at a $2.3 billion plant GM is building with its partner LG Chem in Lordstown Ohio. The Ultium system could offer driving ranges of up to 400 miles on a full charge and 0 to 60 mph acceleration of 3.0 seconds according to the Detroit automaker.

The Hummer EV gets an estimated range of 350 miles and the truck's three electric motors make 1000 horsepower and 11500 lb-ft of torque. Top speed is 106 mph.

""You're buying this vehicle for lots of reasons. One of them is 1000 hp"" Oppenheiser said.

It took engineers 117 weeks to complete the development of the Hummer EV. GM

Ed Kim an analyst and vice president at AutoPacific has his doubts that traditional die-hard truck owners are ready to shift to EVs. Power and torque -- key features on any EV -- matter greatly to this core group of buyers but he argued truck owners can be averse to change.

""The Hummer won't have [Ford] F-Series volume here"" he told ABC News referring to the top-selling truck in the U.S. for 44 straight years. ""But GM does not have to sell a ton of Hummers for it to be a success. There are plenty of people out there ready to pay six figures for a high-image vehicle.""

He went on ""Every automaker has decided there is gold to be found in electric trucks. We're seeing a saturation in truck EV space ... there are too many too soon in the short term.""

AutoPacific forecasts U.S. EV sales to total 440000 units this year up from 262000 in 2020 and 253000 in 2019. That number will keep rising as consumers realize EVs are not disruptive to their daily habits Kim said.

""Every year we see range going up better performance ... there is a rapid level of learning among automakers"" he noted. ""We'll still see battery hiccups here and there. Everyone is having growing pains. Battery chemistry is new to automakers and engineers are still figuring it out.""

GM's engineering teams seeking to maximize power and range in upcoming EVs are hard at work on the next iteration of cell chemistries according to Kevin Robinet assistant chief engineer of GM's battery electric propulsion systems.

""We're already talking about battery improvements for mid-decade"" he told ABC News. ""It's an evolving tech. As energy density improves batteries will weigh less and so will the vehicles.""

The Ultium platform is the foundation of GM's EV strategy including the battery cells modules and pack plus drive units containing electric motors and integrated power electronics. GM

K.C. Colwell Car and Driver’s deputy testing director expects the Hummer to be a big part of GM's ambitious EV product plan.

""This is a halo product for GMC and for the Ultium battery technology"" he told ABC News adding ""GMC has not had a halo product since the Typhoon"" a high-performance SUV that GM produced from 1991 to 1993.

And the reborn Hummer a shell of its boxy gas-guzzling former self may finally win over the environmentalists who once decried its hefty carbon footprint.

""It behaves more like a supercar than a pickup truck"" Colwell said. ""GM is going after a completely different audience -- the early adopters the Tesla buyers.""

The Hummer EV's top speed is 106 mph and the truck's three electric motors produce 1000 horsepower. GM

At the proving grounds the Hummer EV tackled each drill with finesse performing a full-turning circle (""You'd never be able to do this in a solid rear-axle truck"" Oppenheiser declared) maneuvering like a crab on dirt slaloming through serpentine cones and accelerating instantaneously in ""Watts to Freedom"" launch control mode.

Getting Americans aboard the EV bandwagon will be a daunting task for legacy automakers like GM. But Oppenheiser a ""high-performance car guy"" with over 2000 hp in his garage said the Hummer will convince others like himself that it's possible.

""It's pretty damn cool"" he said with a laugh.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlYXJwYXRyb2wuY29tL2NhcnMvYTM4MDAyMzg1L2dtYy1vZmYtcm9hZC1zdXYtZGVzaWduL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GMC Almost Built a Bronco-Fighting SUV. Was This Going to Be It?,"As we all know by now Ford has capitalized on the vintage off-roader nostalgia with the new Bronco a badass body-on-frame SUV that can go tire-to-tire with the still-iconic Jeep Wrangler. General Motors however took a different route; even though the old-school K5 Blazer is currently having its moment with prices skyrocketing over the past year on Bring a Trailer Chevy gave the Blazer nameplate to a road-going crossover.

There was apparently a plan to do more however. GM reportedly had a midsize SUV to combat the Bronco Wrangler and Toyota 4Runner in the works which would have been a standalone SUV for GMC. But according to Muscle Cars & Trucks the project was reportedly nixed in a 2018 product reshuffling. Now however the General Motors Design Instagram page has published a design sketch — from 2018 — providing what seems to be a look at what that SUV that never was could have looked like.

The GMC SUV depicted is more muscular than an Acadia with a body-on-frame architecture true big tires short overhangs for optimal off-roading and a rooftop cargo carrier suggesting some form of outdoors or overlapping application. It looks like it would have been fun.

The fact that GMC isn’t building this Bronco-fighting off-roader well stinks. However the vehicle’s absence does not mean GMC abandoned off-roading entirely. Instead of coming at the Wrangler and 4Runner GMC is firing above them with the new flagship Hummer EV SUT and Hummer EV SUV.

When the Hummer EVs arrive they will be pretty much the most capable factory off-roaders on the planet. The Hummer EV SUT will deliver up to 1000 horsepower from a tri-motor powertrain and offer up to 15.9 inches of ground clearance. It will have better approach breakover and departure angles than a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon. If the driver is so inclined the trucks will also accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 3.0 seconds in Watts to Freedom mode.

If you do prefer your off-roaders conventionally powered and…well less Hummer-like GMC may also have some awesome ideas on the way for its midsize pickup. The super-cool Canyon AT4 OverlandX concept may provide a glimpse into future GMC product planning.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vYXV0b21vdGl2ZS8yMDIxMTAyMy9nbS1yZWludmVudGluZy1jYWRpbGxhYy1icmFuZC13aXRoLW5ldy1maW5hbmNpbmctYXJtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM reinventing Cadillac brand with new financing arm,"The tires on the 2023 Cadillac Lyriq are aerodynamic with black coverings embedded in the rims to help with airflow around the area. Cadillac's first electric vehicle was shown off to the media at the General Motors Warren Technical Center in Warren Michigan on September 2 2021.

General Motors' luxury brand Cadillac will soon get its own financing arm for customers as it continues to head toward a future of all-electric vehicles.

Cadillac Financial an arm of GM Financial is expected to launch around the middle of next year Cadillac spokesman Michael Albano said and as was reported earlier by Automotive News.

Cadillac dealers have been requesting it for a long time and Cadillac leaders now recognize that the financing arm will be key to Cadillac's profits as it goes all-electric and caters to a customer who will expect to be able to handle most of the purchase online.

For Cadillac buyers it means more services to make buying and owning a car easier. For GM employees it means new job opportunities GM leaders said.

""This is far beyond a rebranding exercise it's an ecosystem approach to deliver a frictionless seamless experience that is fully connected predictive and highly personalized"" said Mahmoud Samara Cadillac North America vice president of Sales Service and Marketing in a statement. ""Cadillac Financial is a key enabler to growing the business profitability for both Cadillac and our dealers by delivering a world-class luxury customer experience.""

Cadillac concierge

Cadillac Financial will offer similar financing deals to that of GM Financial but it will provide Cadillac buyers with more services to make buying and owning a Cadillac an ""enhanced"" experience Samara said.

Cadillac Financial features will include:

—A dedicated and ""highly-skilled"" luxury concierge team able to resolve customer issues fast.

—A dedicated Cadillac-Certified customer experience team.

—A new brand website called CadillacFinancial.com.

—An improved online payment experience and added digital tools such as a mobile app and chat function to make buying and owning a Cadillac easy.

""We will provide Cadillac customers with a streamlined luxury finance offering driving deeper brand awareness and relevance and increasing loyalty through seamless integration that will align with Cadillac's soon-to-be reimagined world-class luxury experience"" said Kyle Birch President of North America Operations for GM Financial in an internal September memo obtained by the Detroit Free Press.

Cadillac up for change

GM has said it will bring 30 new EVs to market by 2025 with Cadillac being the first of its four brands to offer a full electric lineup by the end of the decade. The 2023 Cadillac Lyriq SUV will be the brand's first EV that starts production in March and goes on sale next fall starting at $59990.

""Cadillac has been focused the last couple of years on reinventing our business and that doesn't stop at the retail portfolio"" Albano said.

Cadillac's launch of Cadillac Live two years ago for example is part of that reinvention he said. Cadillac Live is a digital showroom that lets shoppers take a one-on-one guided tour of any Cadillac car.

Also Cadillac has reconfigured its dealer network. Cadillac bought out about 20% of its 870 U.S. Cadillac dealerships last year that did not want to invest $200000 in tools and training to sell all-EVs.

""Every part of our business is up for re-evaluation and that goes to the financial end too"" Albano said. ""We're trying to make the car buying experience as frictionless as possible.""

Dealers demanded it

There are many carmakers that already have their own finance arms presently that support separate financing arms for their luxury brands. Ford Motor Credit for example supports Lincoln Automotive Financial Services.

It's partly for that reason that Cadillac dealers have been asking for a financial unit for years said Ed Williamson owner of Williamson Cadillac-Buick-GMC in Miami and a member of Cadillac National Dealer council.

""Dealers have talked about it for quite a while but the current leadership is big proponents of it"" Williamson said. ""In those instances where customers need to call Cadillac Financial the experience will be first class and they only deal with one person who is empowered to help them. It's customer interface driven.""

Williamson said if his customers are happier that's good for a dealership's business.

New jobs

Cadillac will start a pilot program for Cadillac Financial nationwide this year to test certain features of it such as the concierge center Albano said. The full program will be rolled out across the country next year.

Beyond customer benefits Cadillac Financial will also open up new jobs for GM Financial employees ""at all levels of the company"" Birch said in the memo.

When asked if those would be new hires or jobs filled from within GM Financial spokeswoman Lane Borrello said ""Cadillac Financial could potentially create new job positions along with expanded career development opportunities for GM Financial team members.""

""While our initial focus is on the Cadillac customer's luxury experience and marketing channels we continue to talk with Cadillac leadership and dealers to determine what other opportunities or value may exist"" Birch said.

In the memo he said GM Financial will share more details about the Cadillac Financial brand and how it will operate within GM Financial as it gets closer to the expected launch next year.

Cadillac's first electric vehicle was shown off to the media at the General Motors Warren Technical Center in Warren Michigan on September 2 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhZ2VydHkuY29tL21lZGlhL29waW5pb24vMTk3Ny1jYWRpbGxhYy1zZXZpbGxlLWdtLWtub2Nrcy1pdC1vdXQtb2YtdGhlLXBhcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1977 Cadillac Seville: GM knocks it out of the park,"Today we will be discussing one of my favorite Cadillacs the svelte elegant 1976–79 Seville. The right car at the right time—for GM and the Cadillac Motor Division—and a success by any standard. As the advertisements once said “Best of all it’s a Cadillac.” And while there’s a lot of disinformation and conjecture about these cars they truly were Cadillacs.

The first Seville was the Eldorado Seville sibling to the topless Eldorado Biarritz. The Eldorado Seville was available from 1956–60 and was one of the first American postwar cars with a vinyl roof. Starting in 1961 the Eldorado returned to the convertible-only model it had been from 1953–55 and remained so through the 1966 model year. But I digress.

One of the most widely circulated “facts” in certain circles regarding the 1976–79 Seville is that it was just a tarted up Nova. Um … no. Not at all. Or those folks know darn well that it’s bull or exaggerated by perhaps 90 percent but persist in saying it because they hate the car or the idea of the car or maybe just General Motors in general (no pun intended) Why? Who knows.

Yes the Seville’s basic hard points did originate vis-a-vis that middle-America favorite the Chevrolet Nova. But that was just what they started with. Once Cadillac had gotten the Seville to the point it wanted it was so heavily revised and stretched that it was basically a new car. Its own entity answerable to no other General Motors rolling stock.

It was indeed so substantially changed that GM designated the 1976 Seville as the K-body not the X-body that the Nova Ventura Omega and Apollo were using. It didn’t hurt that it was a beautiful car either. Honestly I’ve always thought of them as an American Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. Not ostentatious not overdone. Just simply elegant. And timeless even today.

Cadillac certainly changed a lot between let’s say 1960 and ’70. Heck times were changing! Another trick certain types of bloggers and online folk like to pull is the “darned old stupid cheap GM” schtick. Not just the Seville but Cadillac in general. Decontenting less chrome more plastic etc. Now it is true that trim and upholstery started seeing some cost cutting in the late ’60s and ’70s. It began around 1969–70.

Interiors lost the aluminum and real wood trim instrument panels became less ornate and had more plastic and/or padded foam. But most of this was safety regulations. As you would expect it is far preferable to bounce one’s head off of a foam-rubber-padded instrument panel or door panel than bonking said head off a leather covered metal trim piece. And with some of the vitriol online folks sometimes show you’d think Federal regulations and safety implementations were optional for the automakers. They were not.

The 1971 Cadillacs were all-new from the least expensive Calais coupe to the top-trim “owner-driven” Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham. But Broughamage was creeping in at the same time on the less-prestigious GM lines. Caprice Grand Ville Delta 88 Royale and Centurion all added more and more Broughamy touches to the middle-priced full-sizers. And this made the Cadillac seem somewhat less prestigious less fancy. At least to a certain extent.

The 1971–76s were also gigantic keeping with Cadillac tradition. In fact they were the biggest Cadillacs ever produced with the Series Seventy-Five limousines the absolute biggest. Not too long after the ’71 B- and C-bodies debuted General Motors realized this and made plans to shrink its biggest offerings starting with the next generation.

But what to do prior to the downsized ’77 Fleetwood/de Ville’s debut date? I can imagine the brain trust in Detroit hashing things out over martinis. Or perhaps gimlets. “Well people are paying more money than a Cadillac for those little Mercedes-Benzes! How about that? They’re smaller too. The seats aren’t cushy; they’re firm. They still have wind-up windows the air conditioning hangs down below the dash like a secondhand 1963 Chevy II and people are paying through the nose for them!”

“Well Bob we could do something like that. We have the money. We have the technology and we have some of the best people in the business working for us. So why not give it a shot?”

Yes starting in the early ’70s well-to-do folks nationwide were starting to see the merits of a certain European manufacturer with a three-pointed-star. And Cadillacs were getting relatively cheaper than their 1960s forebears (in order to chase more sales volume; Cadillac set a production record in 1973). The wreath and crest was perhaps not quite as special as it once had been to certain sects of the upper-crust automotive clientele. And folks who still loyally bought Cadillacs were harping about how big some of their models had been getting. What to do?

Solution: offer a smaller Cadillac. Customers had been asking for a smaller more manageable Cadillac for a while well before certain German luxocruisers became the latest must-have. So remember this ladies and gentlemen. The Seville was a response to queries for a smaller Cadillac. It was a bonus that the smaller Cadillac was more in line with contemporary Mercedes-Benzes.

There had been a short-deck Cadillac in 1961 partly in response to wealthy Cadillac owners whose mansions had somewhat short 1920s-era garages. It lasted through the 1963 model year but never sold in significant numbers.

The customers asked Cadillac answered and no one picked up on it for some reason. But by the mid-’70s the time was right to give it another try. And this wouldn’t be a standard Cadillac with a shorter trunk. Not this time. It would be a completely different animal. A completely different Cadillac.

It was thought (correctly as it turned out) that a smaller version would be popular with not only women who were not particularly enamored with parallel-parking a Nimitz-Class Fleetwood Brougham or Sedan de Ville but also as a way of offering a more Mercedes-like Cadillac. A win-win situation.

Thus the Seville came onto the scene in 1975 as an early ’76 model. It proved popular and Cadillac made money on every one as it was priced at the top of the range–including the venerable Fleetwood Brougham. Only the Series Seventy-Fives were pricier. I have to tell you I think it was a beautiful car. Always have and always will. It was readily identifiable as a Cadillac yet had a hint of Mercedes-Benz and Rolls Silver Shadow as well.

And it sold well. Remarkably well despite (or perhaps because of) its price. These cars were well made comfortable and solid. It had rather advanced engineering for a Cadillac too with Bendix fuel injection—a feature which sadly was sometimes troublesome. But despite some of the possible issues these were every inch a Cadillac despite the X-body starting point. They took the X and went far far beyond to make a true Cadillac. Don’t let anyone tell you any different.

Were they fast? Well not exactly. You want fast get a Ferrari BB512. Were they heavy? You bet! A plush ride and absolute silence when underway were much more crucial to Cadillac customers despite what some of the glossy car magazines suggested. If they had utilized less sound insulation today you’d be hearing about how noisy and rattly they were not how their 0–60 mph times were less than exciting. We could talk all day about how most post-1974 U.S. cars were slugs—at least when compared to their ’60s forebears.

A ’76 Seville would hit 60 in about 13 seconds—not great but consider all the then-primitive emissions devices on the things not to mention the 4179-pound shipping weight. It was still about 800 pounds lighter than a ’78 Eldo and 140 lighter than a downsized ’78 Fleetwood Brougham.

The 1976–79 Seville also ushered in Bill Mitchell’s “sheer look” with cliff-face nose tail and roofline. This styling would take the GM lineup by storm being added to our beloved B-body and C-body GMs in 1977. It would soon become a bit of a cliché appearing on the mini-Seville 1980-up A/G-body sedans as well but that was later. In ’76 it was fresh new and attractive.

So the Seville was a success. Its new tidier dimensions and sheer-faced style previewed what was to come on future Cadillacs. It sold well it was well made and it started a nameplate that lasted all the way to 2004. Or 2011 if you count the succeeding 2005+ STS since said acronym originally was short for Seville Touring Sedan.

Was it perfect? No. But it was the 1970s. New federal regulations were coming one wave after the other. Safety emissions the whole nine yards. And it showed in everything from shoddily assembled LTDs to rust-prone Honda Civics to cracker-box Datsun 510 Honeybees.

The Bendix fuel injection system on the Seville’s Oldsmobile 350-cubic-inch V-8 was problematic. Despite being touted as “international sized” it still had a bench seat and column-shifted Turbo Hydra-Matic.

Now many Cadillac owners and even Seville buyers probably liked the bench seat and column shifter but it still would have been nice to have an optional bucket-seat-and-console-shift option. Not that it hurt sales any.

Perhaps handling to match contemporary Mercedes-Benz S-Classes and the big BMW sedans could have been a boon. But again most folks plunking down serious cash on a new Seville just wanted a contemporary classy smaller Cadillac. And in that the Seville delivered.

Today’s featured example a 1977 Seville is finished in heavenly Naples Yellow with matching yellow Sierra grain leather and padded vinyl roof.

It was duly spotted by my friend Jayson Coombes at the Cadillac-LaSalle club Grand National meet held in San Marcos Texas. There were a number of very gorgeous Cadillacs on display including the ’53 Fleetwood Sixty Special I wrote about in 2020 and a ’58 Eldorado Biarritz that I wrote about last month.

And there are many more I intend to share with all you fine folks.

Jayson knows very well that I am infatuated with the 1976–79 Seville. And that I also love yellow Cadillacs. So you can imagine my reaction when he posted a couple of pictures of this fine automobile on my Facebook page a couple of years back. I believe the term “Klockau bait” was bandied about.

When I saw this sensational Seville I was simply smitten. Triple yellow (paint top and leather interior) factory wire wheels and an Astroroof?! I immediately messaged him and kind of ordered him to please please please take more pictures. And the man delivered! God bless him. The owner is clearly a gentleman of taste—and also extraordinarily lucky.

Simply put the original Cadillac Seville was the right car at the right time and GM had a hit. A profitable hit. Now was the Hooper-inspired 1980 second-generation version a hit? Perhaps not. It may have been a little baroque for those 1976–79 Seville owners though I love those cars too. At any rate it’s all water under the bridge now. But make no mistake: The original “small Cadillac” was a resounding success. I want one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2F1dG8vY2hldnJvbGV0LW1vc3QtcG93ZXJmdWwtdjgtZW5naW5l0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vYXV0by9jaGV2cm9sZXQtbW9zdC1wb3dlcmZ1bC12OC1lbmdpbmUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevrolet unveils its biggest most powerful V8 engine ever ahead of electric push,"Chevy's V8s are going out with a big bang.

The Chevrolet Performance division has revealed the biggest and most-powerful naturally aspirated V8 engine it has ever built even as General Motors accelerates its transition toward electric power.

The 632-cubic-inch ZZ632/1000 crate engine was designed for drag racing builds and not meant to be used on the street. The 10-liter mill is rated at 1004 hp and 876 lb-ft of torque on pump gas without the use of any supercharging.

Chevy's current top offering is the ZZ572/740R Deluxe which is rated at 727 hp and 680 lb-ft.

The iron-block ZZ632/1000 was designed with a redline of 7000 rpm and features electronic port injection fed through symmetrical ports built into its CNC-machined aluminum head forged aluminum pistons along with a forged steel crank and connecting rods.

The World Trade Organisation is in tatters the IMF and World Bank are struggling for relevance and tarnished by scandal and no one can agree on global rules to govern technology.

There is an exception to this dismal picture: the global payments system that underpins the dominance of Western currencies particularly the dollar. Over the past year one of its main networks SWIFT  carried $140trn of transactions a record level and the equivalent of about 150% of global GDP . It is an impressive sum but more must be done to modernise the payments architecture if its pre-eminence is to last.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY2Vwci5vcmcvdm94ZXUvY29sdW1ucy9wb2xpY3ktdHJpYW5nbGUtYmlnLXRlY2hzLWZpbmFuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A policy triangle for Big Techs in finance,"Big Techs are large companies whose primary activity is digital services (FSB 2019 BIS 2019). The range of services can be very wide and includes e-commerce social media internet search mobile phone hardware and software ride hailing and telecommunications.

Big Techs have recently entered financial services and have rapidly gained prominence (Frost et al. 2019). In Figure 1 Panel A shows that financial services make up more than 10% of Big Techs’ revenues on average. They have a substantial footprint in the payment systems of several advanced economies and across a wider spectrum of financial services in emerging market and developing economies. In China two Big Techs jointly account for 94% of the mobile payments market and play a significant role in other financial services such as digital credit. At the global level Big Techs extended or facilitated more than $500 billion of credit in 2019 (Cornelli et al. 2020) and there are early indications that such credit grew further during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. By developing their activities Big Techs like Google Apple Facebook Amazon in the US and Alibaba and Tencent in China have market capitalisations that far surpass those of the largest banks (Figure 1 Panel B).

Why have they got so large? Big Tech business models rest on enabling direct interactions among a large number of users. This may be in (1) e-commerce such as Alibaba Amazon or Mercado Libre; (2) social media such as Facebook Tencent or Kakao; (3) telecommunications such as Safaricom or MTN; or (4) search such as Google or Baidu. An essential by-product of their business is the massive user data they generate and collect on their platforms. They exploit natural network effects generating further user activity and data which can be leveraged to improve their product offering. As an example payment services generate transaction data network externalities facilitate the interaction among users and all this helps serve the Big Techs in their other activities (such as credit or wealth management) generating more engagement with existing users and attracting new ones.

But these activities generate further data and fuel a data–network–activities feedback loop. This has been called the DNA of big techs (BIS 2019). This DNA loop is a source of significant benefits to users and the financial system. For example Big Techs’ business model can be very powerful at enhancing efficiency and financial inclusion particularly in weakly contestable markets with dominant financial incumbents. Moreover the use of detailed user data from other business lines may reduce the need for costly collateral for loans (Gambacorta et al. 2020). At the same time if left unchecked the DNA loop can engender new risks for privacy and consumer protection market contestability and eventually financial stability.

In a recent paper (Feyen et al. 2021) we analyse the entry of Big Tech firms into financial services and how this impacts the existing trade-offs among public policy objectives across: (1) financial stability and market integrity (2) efficiency and competition and (3) data privacy and consumer protection. We can elaborate such trade-offs around a policy triangle adapted from Petralia et al. (2019) and Carletti et al. (2020).

Let’s start with the ‘traditional’ stability–competition trade-off (red arrow in Figure 2). Regulators have long debated the relationship between competition and financial stability. There are broadly two schools of thought. One emphasised that greater competition was not always optimal or conducive to financial stability because more competition reduces banks’ profits and overall franchise value (Keeley 1990). A second school of thought argues that greater market entry in the financial sector is desirable. Greater contestability fosters beneficial competition (by increasing innovation and efficiency) and reduces incumbents’ market power (Claessens 2009). The relationship may depend on other features including regulation (Beck et al. 2013).

Figure 2 Policy trade-offs from digital transformation in finance

Source: Feyen et al. (2021). Adapted from Petralia et al. (2019) and Carletti et al. (2020).

The entry of Big Tech into finance may change these paradigms due to the DNA feedback loop. Companies with market dominance in their core business could translate that dominance into complementary financial services making entry a source of increased concentration and market power. Such control may also generate conflicts of interest and potential market abuse when big tech platforms become the main distribution channel for their competitors (e.g. banks).

An example of how competition in payments may evolve is given by merger and acquisition activity by digital platforms (Big Techs and card networks). Figure 3 shows how vertical and horizontal integration trends have developed in recent years. Some of the largest deals have been horizontal acquisitions such as the acquiring of direct competitors (blue dots). In other cases vertical acquisitions have taken place (red dots). These deals allow payment firms to increase their efficiency and perform ‘in-house’ activities for which they previously used partners or vendors. The trend towards larger dots lower on the graph shows that smaller companies may be acquired before reaching a critical mass of users (Kamepalli et al. 2020).

Notes: 1 For 2020 data up to 31 January 2021. The figure divides forms of vertical integration in red and horizontal forms of integration in blue. The size of the bubble represents the market capitalisation of the acquiring company while the height in the graph represents the deal size. Each dot represents a merger and acquisition (M&A) deal by Ant Financial Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) FISERV Global Payments Mastercard PayPal Square or Visa as collected by PitchBook and Refinitiv Eikon. This excludes divestitures and intra-company operations. M&A deals are classified as ‘vertical’ when the acquiring and the target firm operate at different stages along the same payment chain as determined by company reports. In ‘horizontal’ deals the acquiring and target firm are direct competitors in at least one key business line. The size of each dot is proportional to the acquiring company market capitalisation on the day of the deal or in the case of Ant Financial the valuation of Ant Financial as of end-2018 multiplied by changes in the market capitalisation of Alibaba Holdings relative to end-2018.

While competition and more efficient solutions may often benefit consumers trade-offs between efficiency/competition and privacy/consumer protection arise. This is represented by the blue arrow in Figure 2. In many jurisdictions Big Tech providers may not be subject to regulatory oversight that protects financial services consumers. Big Tech mobile money competes with bank payments services on price and availability dimensions but more personal data might be exposed to mobile money providers than to banks.

As data become an even more important source of market power there are tensions around the ownership and use of data. Data can in principle be used many times and by any number of firms simultaneously without being depleted – this is the so-called ‘non-rivalry’ characteristic of data (Carrière-Swallow and Haksar 2020 Haksar et al. 2021 World Bank 2021). Credit bureaus operate on this principle. However unrestricted sharing of data can also harm individuals. For example open access to personal data represents a loss of privacy and can allow for identity theft reputational damage and the manipulation of behavioural biases to sell consumers products that are not in their own interests. On the other hand allowing data producers to maintain a monopoly over the data presents challenges as well. It could impede consumers from switching providers or enable price discrimination or algorithmic exclusion.

Big Tech companies are also very efficient in pricing given big data. They can divide a customer population into very fine subcategories – each charged a different price representing the maximum price each individual is willing to pay. By extracting more of the consumer surplus from those willing to pay more prices can also be reduced for those able to pay less potentially creating a more inclusive offering. Yet such fine price discrimination may overlap with protected categories such as gender or race. Regulators need to balance innovation and efficiency with consumer protection that might dampen certain innovations.

Data sharing can alleviate problems of asymmetric information and adequate data are crucial for monitoring financial stability and integrity. This potentially introduces a new trade-off between privacy (and consumer protection more generally) on the one hand and financial stability and market integrity on the other. This trade-off is represented by the green arrow in Figure 2.

For example in the credit market there is ample evidence that more data can improve stability. Credit reporting systems allow safe lending to borrowers who had previously been priced out of the market resulting in higher aggregate lending (Pagano and Jappelli 1993) and furthering financial inclusion. In the case of credit reporting the data can only be accessed by licensed entities and only upon customer consent and only for authorised purposes. In the case of Big Techs the data they capture are far more granular and touch several aspects of personal life so it is important to have safeguards for privacy. At the same time detailed information on all parties in a transaction could be helpful to reduce illicit activity and preserving market integrity. Anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) practices could benefit from machine learning applications on big data. Balancing privacy and integrity goals will require societal dialogue and likely legislation.

Conclusions

The rise of Big Techs underscores how rapidly digital innovation can disrupt markets and put competitive pressure on incumbents. This brings efficiency and financial inclusion particularly in emerging market and developing economies but also new concerns for policy. This column highlights new trade-offs between public policy objectives: (1) financial stability and market integrity (2) efficiency and competition and (3) data privacy and consumer protection.

The current framework for regulating financial services follows an activities-based approach where providers must hold licences for specific business lines. There is scope to address the new policy challenges by developing specific entity-based rules as proposed in several key jurisdictions – notably the EU China and the US (Carstens et al. 2021).

But the new trade-offs between the policy objectives in the triangle also call for more coordination. At the domestic level there is need for more coordination between national authorities overseeing competition financial regulation data and consumer protection. Finally as the digital economy expands across borders there is a need for international coordination of rules and standards in the public interest.

While their size is key to their identity it also means they lack the resources of larger counterparts. Technology and adoption of digital capabilities are critical to their ability to react and thrive in the constantly changing consumer landscape.

Businesses adapt to keep up

At the onset of the pandemic SMBs were hit particularly hard by changes in customer behaviour physical distancing restrictions and sudden cash flow issues. Two-thirds said that the crisis strongly affected their operations and one-fifth risked shutting down permanently within three months2. It became clear these businesses needed to adapt.

Digital tools such as touchless payments and curbside pickup have become resources for survival. The recent Visa Back to Business Study found that 68 per cent of global consumers said that the pandemic has permanently changed the way they pay – it’s clear the world is going digital like never before3. “Delivering support to help small businesses increase their digital skills is crucial” says Mike Cherry national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. “The pandemic is making this even more of a priority.”

SMBs are generally optimistic about this shift – nearly half viewed the last year as an opportunity to focus on new products and expand sales channels4 proving how important it is that key players who have networks with size and scalability such as Visa get involved.

“We’re committed to helping businesses around the globe find their footing again by doing what we’ve always done” says Visa’s Mary Kay Bowman global head of buyer seller core and platform products. “Anticipating the next chapter of the digital commerce journey leading the industry forward and innovating payment systems has a transformative impact and provides greater access to the digital economy for everyone everywhere.”

Cross-border inclusivity matters

As one of the largest payments networks in the world Visa is at the centre of the global digital money movement.

Digitisation of commerce can transcend borders while increasing digital equity and inclusion. It means shop owner can expand their potential customer base to people thousands of miles away rapidly growing their ability to scale regardless of borders. At a time of turbulence this can mean the difference between success and failure.

A recent survey of SMBs in the United States by the Visa Economic Empowerment Institute found that firms which embraced digital capabilities before and during the pandemic have generally weathered the crisis better than those that did not. Over 80 per cent of businesses reported that online sales drove improvements in revenue and cash flow and almost 50 per cent reported gains in exports to new markets5.

Visa Direct the company’s real-time payments capabilities platform provides access to five billion cards and accounts across 200 geographies and 160 currencies. It also supports governments and banks with disbursement programs to rapidly get individuals and businesses the relief they need.

In Guatemala for example the government’s Bono Familia program enabled by Visa helped affected people such as hair salon owner Nancy Gomez who registered through a simple text process: “I got a code I could use at any store or I could get the money from any ATM. It was fast it was easy.""

It is what ultimately saved her salon.

The journey to digital transformation

Secure and affordable payment systems facilitated by digital tools democratise the ecosystem and help provide greater access to the digital economy and create more financial inclusion especially for the minority- and women-owned companies who have been hit the hardest.

In the U.S. Visa has disbursed more than $1m in hyperlocal grants to SMB owners with an emphasis on Black women-owned businesses. This builds on a $200m five-year commitment from the Visa Foundation made at the start of the pandemic in 2020 to support women’s economic advancement.

Looking forward to a digital future

The shift to digital commerce has clearly affected the health of SMBs. It is in the best interest of the global economy that these businesses are supported in implementing the crucial technologies that will increase resilience in the future. Digital commerce solutions in addition to resources such as global payment networks will provide the essential armour to protect those so integral to economic stability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEwLTI1L2JpdGNvaW4tYW5kLW90aGVyLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmNpZXMtbmVlZC1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLXRvLXN1Y2NlZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies Need Regulation to Succeed,"Why did this happen?

It was March 2020 and Zimbabwe had just retreated into its first coronavirus lockdown. Hove 65 is the primary caretaker for her grandchildren ages 10 15 and 17. She sold secondhand clothing at a market but like so many forms of commerce that was no longer allowed.

But six years earlier Bulawayo officials had granted Hove five vegetable beds in the community garden near her home in the suburb of Emakhandeni. There about 60 families tend to their patches with water from a borehole wide-brimmed hats shielding them from the unforgiving sun.

In her 5-by-1-meter (16-by-3-foot) beds Hove grew basketfuls of choumoellier — a type of kale — and other leafy greens. The harvest mainly fed her family though she’d usually sell at least 85 Zimbabwean dollars’ (ZWL) ($1) worth of vegetables a day. But during the lockdown Zimbabweans were banned from traveling more than 5 kilometers (3 miles) to buy food medication and household goods. Many people could no longer go to vegetable markets in the city center.

Suddenly Hove’s yield was no longer a side hustle. “Because people were restricted from traveling to the city center community gardens became their vegetable shop” she says. Hove started selling as much as 5950 ZWL ($70) worth of vegetables a day — more than she’d made selling clothing.

As the pandemic stretched on Zimbabwe lifted coronavirus restrictions then reimposed them. Hove’s profits dipped but not by much. While Bulawayo officials don’t tax or track sales at community gardens they say that anecdotally beds across the city have turned into moneymakers.

Fortune Moyo GPJ Zimbabwe The vegetable beds at the Emakhandeni community garden in Bulawayo are reserved for the area’s most financially vulnerable residents.

The transformation was as surprising to the community gardeners as it was welcome. Many urban areas in the region are dotted with collective fields partly as a response to breakneck growth. In Zimbabwe their widespread adoption coincided with the country’s economic freefall in the 2010s according to a study in the Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities which is published by the National University of Malaysia.

In Bulawayo Zimbabwe’s second-largest city officials launched community gardens to give financially vulnerable people access to fresh tomatoes onions nuts sweet potatoes and choumoellier. More than 800 residents till land across eight city-run fields says city council spokesperson Nesisa Mpofu. Far more gardens run by churches and nongovernmental organizations green the landscape.

It’s not easy to cultivate city crops. Gardeners can’t readily access natural fertilizers such as cow manure and artificial ones are often expensive. In Bulawayo Mpofu says donors usually pitch in to buy supplies gardeners can’t afford.

Thieves and vandals also ruin harvests; choumoellier is among the most popular vegetables in part because it regrows quickly. To combat mischief at the Emakhandeni garden a committee patrols it at night says Edmore Majama who oversees the beds.

“Because people were restricted from traveling to the city center community gardens became their vegetable shop.” Gardener

Before the pandemic community gardeners primarily stocked their own pantries. According to a recent survey by the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee 19% of urban Zimbabweans grew their own crops but only 1% said selling vegetables was their main source of income.

“Initially the community gardens were meant to sustain families at household levels” says Pilate Moyo a Bulawayo councilor. “The pandemic has surprisingly showed us that the gardens also have the capacity to address poverty alleviation in the community.”

Local families needed the help. In 2019 close to 40% of Bulawayo household heads were unemployed according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network a United States government initiative to track food insecurity. A quarter of household heads worked in the informal sector as street vendors for example.

The pandemic walloped these residents; few had money saved and they faced higher prices for water electricity maize and vegetables the famine warning network report says. People stood in long lines to collect water. They stoked fires to stay warm. They skipped meals. But many gardeners were spared economic strife.

“Urban agriculture has helped in poverty alleviation for low-income families and those from vulnerable groups” says Winston Babbage vice president of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union.

An Emakhandeni gardener Duduzile Mpofu long struggled to pay school fees for her children ages 6 and 12. The lockdown scuttled her business selling bananas and oranges but her community vegetable bed kept her afloat; some days she made three times as much selling spinach and tomatoes as she did before the pandemic. “I have managed to pay my children’s tuition fees for two terms” the 38-year-old says.

Because the gardens are convenient for suburban shoppers local officials expect them to remain viable businesses after the pandemic abates says council spokesperson Mpofu.

“Communities have begun to appreciate community gardens and the fact that they do not have to travel to the city center to get fresh vegetables.”

Success prompted Hove to diversify her harvest with tomatoes and onions. She also bought six goats with her earnings — a herd that has since multiplied to 15. Once the pandemic ends Hove plans to sell clothing again but she expects most of her money will still sprout from the soil."

(AP) When it was over Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson used one word to describe it: ''Wow!''

Sam Hartman threw for a career-high 458 yards and five touchdowns in a big-play display and ran for another score and No. 16 Wake Forest defeated Army 70-56 on Saturday to remain unbeaten in front of a sellout crowd at Michie Stadium.

''It felt like whoever had the ball last was going to win'' Clawson said. ''That was about as clean a performance as I've ever seen. Every time we had to make a play we made a play. We found a way to win.''

Army (4-3) which lost its third straight and had its 13-game winning streak at Michie Stadium snapped had not defeated a ranked opponent since a 17-14 victory over Air Force in 1972. Still the Black Knights made Wake Forest (7-0) earn this one matching them on the scoreboard until a costly turnover.

Hartman was unstoppable and rarely pressured completing 23 of 29 passes and hitting touchdown passes of 41 54 and two of 75 yards as he matched the Michie Stadium record for scoring passes. Jaquarii Roberson had eight catches for 157 yards and three touchdowns and A.T. Perry had six catches for 146 yards and one score.

Army never led and a costly interception return for a touchdown in the third quarter gave the Demon Deacons the breathing room they needed.

''Guys made plays and you make the throws and it works like that'' Hartman said. ''That's how this offense is supposed to do.''

Two touchdown passes by Army's Jabari Laws a 21-yarder to Isaiah Alston late in the third and a 25-yarder to Tyrell Robinson midway through the fourth made it a one-possession game again until Hartman scored on an 8-yard run with 6:57 left.

''The room for error is very small and that can cost a ballgame'' Alston said. ''Proud of my guys. We put everything on the line ... and just came up short.''

Army rushed for 416 yards and finished with 595 yards offensively as the teams combined for 1233 yards in a game that featured just one punt and was the second-highest scoring game involving an Atlantic Coast Conference team according to Elias Sports after Pitt's 76-61 win over Syracuse in 2016.

''Yeah it was frustrating'' Army coach Jeff Monken said. ''If I was a fan of football and just watching that's a fun offense to watch. I hate I had to watch it from our sideline.''

It was a one-possession game until the third quarter after Army knotted the score at 28-all on Jakobi Buchanan's 1-yard touchdown run.

Hartman came right back quickl y hitting Roberson over the middle for a 75-yard score.

The Black Knights then drove deep into Wake Forest on the ensuing possession and tried some trickery on a fourth-and-5. It backfired big-time when quarterback Cade Ballard in his first play of the season lined up as the holder and his pass into the left flat was intercepted by Traveon Redd and he returned it 83 yards for a touchdown and a 42-28 lead.

''I saw green grass and I just took it'' Redd said.

But the big plays just kept coming.

Anthony Adkins raced 71 yards for an Army score and Hartman responded with a 75-yard strike to Ke'Shawn Williams.

Army matched the Demon Deacons on the scoreboard in the first half until Christian Beal-Smith scored on a 13-yard run up the gut of the Army defense with 35 seconds left in the second quarter to give Wake Forest a 28-21 halftime lead.

Hartman guided the Demon Deacons to two quick scores in the first quarter hitting Perry for 50 yards down the middle and three plays later connecting with Roberson for a 41-yard score and a 14-7 lead.

After Buchanan's 3-yard scoring run knotted the score at 14-all early in the second quarter Hartman connected on a 54-yard scoring pass to Perry who was free and clear after Army defender Cam Jones fell.

Army tied it at 21-21 on Tyhier Tyler's 24-yard run up the middle with 3:17 left in the second. Army had failed on a fourth-and-2 play but after a video review by the officiating crew Wake Forest was penalized for having too many players and Tyler took advantage.

RECORD FALLS

Hartman broke the Michie Stadium record for passing yards set in 2014 by Buffalo's Joe Licata who threw for 401 yards in Monken's first game as Army coach. The Black Knights won that one 47-39.

THE TAKEAWAY

Wake Forest: With Hartman at the controls the Demon Deacons are a force but the defense didn't measure up against Army and they face a huge test in November in the race for the Atlantic Division title in the Atlantic Coast Conference with consecutive games at North Carolina home against NC State and at Clemson.

Army: The Black Knights have demonstrated that they can play with the best programs in the country. They rushed for a season high and threw for three touchdowns a good sign going forward.

UP NEXT

Wake Forest returns to ACC action to host Duke next Saturday.

Army has a break before it faces a Commander-in-Chief's Trophy matchup against service academy rival Air Force on Nov. 6 at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas. It's the first neutral-site game in the series since 1965 at Soldier Field in Chicago.

(AP) — A change in San Diego State’s defensive scheme helped the Aztecs slow down Air Force’s run-heavy offense.

Matt Araiza kicked two field goals Kaegun Williams and Chance Bell ran for touchdowns and No. 22 San Diego State withstood Air Force’s comeback bid to win 20-14 on Saturday night.

The Aztecs kept Air Force’s top-ranked running attack in check by frequently using a fourth linebacker instead of a defensive back.

“Everybody knows what they do” Aztecs linebacker Michael Shawfroft said. “They run the ball really well. They’re a really tough team to play. It was just something that we game-planned really well this week. Our coaches made it simple for us and just let us play our game. It was just see ball get ball.”

San Diego State (7-0 3-0 Mountain West) beat Air Force for a ninth straight time. Air Force (6-2 3-2) had its four-game winning streak snapped.

“Instead of having another DB in there we really felt our linebackers — and that’s a really good group they’re well-coached — it put some bigger bodies out there on the field that are really athletic also” San Diego State coach Brady Hoke said.

The Aztecs led 13-0 at half with Williams’ 1-yard TD run between Araiza’s field goals of 22 and 51 yards following Air Force turnovers.

“We had too many mistakes on our part” Air Force defensive lineman Jordan Jackson said. “They’re a great team and we couldn’t afford to make mistakes like we did. I think that was the deciding factor.”

San Diego State added to the lead on its first possession of the second half. Bell broke a 32-yard run before scoring from 3 yards out to make it 20-0.

“If you go out there and fight every play eventually something’s going to happen some big play is going to come something is going to work out and that’s exactly what we trust in” Bell said.

The Falcons got on the board late in the third quarter on Warren Bryan’s 13-yard pass to Dalton King on fourth down. Initially ruled incomplete the call was overturned on review when it was determined King had possession when he crossed the goal line before the ball came out on the hit by Patrick McMorris.

Air Force pulled to within six after Dane Kinamon took a fourth-down pitch from Bryan and ran 3 yards for a touchdown with 3:59 left.

The Falcons got the ball back with 2:18 to play and punted after a fourth-down conversion was negated by a penalty. San Diego State ran out the final 1:35.

Araiza who also punts for the Aztecs got off an 81-yarder in the first quarter. It was the second consecutive week Araiza had an 80-plus yard punt and a 50-plus yard field goal. He had an 86-yard punt and a 53-yard field goal in the Aztecs’ double overtime victory over San Jose State last week. GOING LONG

Araiza had a 67-yard punt to go with his 81-yarder and now has 14 punts of 60 or more yards on the season tying him with Texas A&M’s Braden Mann (2018) for the most in a season in FBS history.

THE TAKEAWAY

San Diego State’s top-ranked rushing defense bottled up Air Force’s ground game most of the game. The Aztecs held the Falcons to 192 rushing yards well under Air Force’s average of 336.4 per game.

Air Force dropped to 4-19 against Top 25 opponents under coach Troy Calhoun. The Falcons’ last win over a ranked team was in 2016.

POLL IMPLICATIONS

The Aztecs stand out as the lone unbeaten team in the Mountain West and figure to improve their ranking.

Two aging black bears are living out their days in the lush loamy rainforests of northern Vancouver Island thanks to Bryce Casavant. Six years ago the former conservation officer refused an order to kill the bears. They were infants at the time weighing a little over 10 pounds apiece. He called the male Jordan and the female Athena – for his two-and-a-half-year-old daughter who had been born profoundly ill. The ginger-haired former military officer was fired for declining to kill the cubs.

Media across the globe ran with the story. Comedian Ricky Gervais mounted a campaign to get this “honourable man” his job back and 300000 people petitioned the government to reverse course. The backlash over his dismissal roundly embarrassed B.C.’s Liberal government and enraged some of his colleagues within the conservation service but a lot of regular citizens on the West Coast considered Mr. Casavant a hero.

His actions prompted British Columbians to confront questions once confined to the realm of science: Is it necessary – or ethical – to kill an infant bear? What is our duty of care to predators topping 300 kgs.? Is there a better way to reconcile their needs with ours? B.C.’s conservation service may not want to acknowledge it but the conversation Mr. Casavant launched could ultimately see the coastal province rethink some of the ways it has been managing wildlife for the last century.

For six years Mr. Casavant a high-school dropout from a working-class Metis family has declined to share his story with media. He couldn’t risk it.

He’d been dismissed from his job as a conservation officer and given a desk job in the ministry of forests as a compliance officer a disciplinary transfer. The agreement stipulated it would be revoked if he spoke publicly of the bear cubs.

Mr. Casavant needed the paycheque. He says his relationship didn’t survive the imbroglio – all the stress and sleepless nights. His daughter was in and out of hospital. So he clammed up.

Then in 2019 he resigned from the public service and took the Conservation Service to court.

A year ago the B.C. Court of Appeal unanimously ruled in favour of Mr. Casavant nullifying his firing. Mr. Casavant who has no legal training argued the case before the high court himself. Because he held an appointment as a special constable this was a policing issue not a labour issue the appellate ruling found. Senior bureaucrats and arbitrators had no role in the dispute and should never have involved themselves in it. The verdict ordered the two sides to hash out the consequences. But when Mr. Casavant wrote Chief Conservation Officer Doug Forsdick asking to return to work he was told there was “no position” for him.

In February Mr. Casavant petitioned the B.C. Supreme Court to reaffirm his status as an employee and declare him entitled to back pay. Ministry officials including Chief Conservation Officer Doug Forsdick won’t discuss what happened that day and decline to answer questions about Mr. Casavant. He has decided it’s time to share his story.

It all began on a blistering hot July day in 2015 with a complaint from a resident of a mobile home park at the north end of Vancouver Island. The caller said that a female bear and her two cubs had been coming onto his property eating salmon and deer meat he’d stored in an outdoor freezer. The sow had also wandered into his trailer through an open door left ajar in the heat.

Within minutes of the call Mr. Casavant’s iPhone buzzed. He was the sole conservation officer stationed in Port McNeill where he was attached to the local RCMP detachment. He was supervised remotely by Sgt. Mike Newton who was stationed in Black Creek 265 kilometres to the south. Sgt. Newton was ordering him via e-mail to kill all three bears.

A wildfire had been raging just outside the nearby community of Port Hardy. Mr. Casavant was coming off an 18-hour shift helping the RCMP oversee an evacuation order. Just after midnight on July 5 he arrived at the trailer to deal with the bears. After speaking with the complainant and two other witnesses he says it became clear to him that only the mother bear had eaten meat and garbage not her cubs.

Mr. Casavant set a trap then left to get some rest. Just after 4:30 a.m. he returned to the trailer. The sow had been trapped. He destroyed her but couldn’t see her cubs – it was still dark out. The sow’s breasts were swollen he noted. She was still nursing.

When Mr. Casavant returned a few hours later he found the cubs hiding in a tree. He radioed the firefighters he’d been working with asking them to send over a ladder truck when they took a break. The cubs were too small to be darted. Using the ladder Mr. Casavant netted the bruins tranquillized them by syringe then loaded them into the barrel of his truck. While they were sleeping off the sedative he called his boss.

By then he had exchanged multiple emails with Sgt. Newton and the provincial vet Helen Schwantje. Both urged him to euthanize the infant bears despite what he was telling them: that North Island policy dictated that all orphaned cubs had to be delivered to a vet for a medical and behavioural assessment. That the bears were still nursing and were neither garbage nor human habituated. “I have looked inside their mouth I have looked at their tongue looked down their throats with a flashlight I have smelled them” he told investigators. (The Globe and Mail obtained a transcript of the interview.) “I am telling you there is nothing in their claws. There were no little baby bite marks in any of the plastic bags or garbage. There is no human health and safety risk and there is nothing within policy that would give me that authority to [kill them].”

Sgt. Newton’s reply was terse: “Whose funding do you think that is going to come out of?” he asked in an e-mail. Money doesn’t factor into the equation Mr. Casavant replied. “Within the conflict matrix they have not posed a risk to public safety and do not fall within the destruction category.”

“You are removed from this [file] effective immediately” Sgt. Newton told him. “You do not have the authorization needed to transport those bears.”

Mr. Casavant brought the cubs to a vet in Port Alberni taking back roads to avoid the conservation officer sent to remove the bears.

The vet felt the cubs made good rehab candidates. The next day they were delivered to the North Island Recovery Centre in Errington. Founder Robin Campbell noted the bears showed “zero signs of habituation.” After emerging from hibernation one year later they were released into the forests of the North Island. They were tracked for a year until their collars fell off. In that time neither bear encountered a human ate garbage or engaged in problematic behaviour of any kind.

It’s often assumed that Mr. Casavant is an animal lover who couldn’t stand to gun down two baby bears. Mr. Casavant says he is “no animal rights activist” nor anything like it and never had a problem destroying problem animals. This was about one issue only he says: Killing the cubs went against Ministry policy.

The Globe and Mail obtained the policy enacted in 2009 for the North Island region. It indeed required “all” rescued cubs “to be delivered to a veterinarian for a medical evaluation to determine whether the bear is suitable for rehabilitation.” Mr. Casavant told investigators these and other policies were routinely ignored: “Current practice is to kill all cubs – all big game animals regardless of what policy says regardless of what the decision matrix supports or the public complaints that come from it” he said. “If there is conflicting information … you write the file up to justify it.”

In an affidavit Chief Conservation Officer Doug Forsdick said the service had “ceased applying” the 2009 policy four years prior to the bear cub incident. “A redraft is under way” Sgt. Newton said in an e-mail to Mr. Casavant after he destroyed the sow. The policy was rescinded on November of 2015 four months after Mr. Casavant’s firing records show. The new policy gives conservation officers discretion to destroy yearling bears on their own without medical or behavioural assessments.

In the last 10 years conservation officers in B.C. have killed 5383 black bears 214 grizzly bears and 884 cougars according to provincial data. This practice has become increasingly controversial particularly in First Nations communities where bears are often revered for their strength and courage and in places where they tend to wander in uninvited – Squamish Whistler North Vancouver Coquitlam among them. It’s led to increasing conflict between conservation officers and members of the public including allegations of officer assaults on citizens. In some First Nations communities it’s now standard practice not to call in conservation officers when big game predators appear according to bear guide Mike Willie a member of the Kwikwasut’inuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation on northern Vancouver Island. In 2020 in a widely publicized case the Mamalilikulla First Nation took a stand refusing to allow the Conservation Service to kill a male grizzly known as Mali in their traditional territories in the Broughton Archipelago ultimately forcing its relocation.

B.C.’s Conservation Service relocates a relatively small number of large carnivores: 76 grizzlies and 198 black bears in the last 10 years (they do not relocate cougars). According to the province’s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy “Bears and cubs that are habituated to humans or conditioned to non-natural food sources are not candidates for relocation or rehabilitation – the risk to public safety is simply far too great.” Michael Badry wildlife-conflict manager for B.C.’s Conservation Service has said that bears taken outside their home ranges seldom adjust well. They have to “fight it out” in food zones where other predators are already established or run long distances in unfamiliar territory seeking hunting grounds of their own he says. It is also “expensive” and “time consuming.”

Expensive is a matter of perspective says Nicholas Scapillati executive director of the Grizzly Bear Foundation: “What’s the value of returning a keystone species to an ecosystem? The grizzly population in B.C.’s North Cascades has been completely eradicated. They wouldn’t need to fight other grizzlies because there aren’t any left.”

Mr. Casavant argues that Mr. Badry is relying on studies from the 1970s and ignoring modern research showing that relocation is an effective alternative particularly for young bears.

Questions about relocation and the destruction of big game predators are especially salient in B.C. The province is among North America’s last havens for grizzly bears wolves and cougars the reason biologists and scientists here are arguing for a more restrained approach to lethal force. The problem was until Mr. Casavant came along they were having trouble getting the public to care.

Mr. Casavant who was born to a teenaged mother and raised primarily by his grandparents on Vancouver Island didn’t set out to become a conservation officer. He grew up loving airplanes. After leaving home at 17 he hung out in hangars hoping to talk his way into a job that would get him near a plane. An Iranian immigrant who ran an aircraft maintenance facility staffed by new Canadians in the Lower Mainland eventually took pity on him and hired Mr. Casavant to wash his planes later allowing him to apprentice as an aircraft mechanic. Mr. Casavant says he was never happier than during the days he spent tinkering on aircraft engines under the yellowed hangar roof. Then came 9/11.

Four months after his 21st birthday he signed up to fight in Afghanistan joining the military police. He spent years in tiny villages outside the wire in Kandahar helping train a nascent national police force in areas that had seen heavy fighting losing friends to a “never-ending string of attacks.”

After retiring from the Forces in 2010 he launched a consultancy in human security training officers in counterterrorism. All that ended when his daughter Athena was born in 2012 with lymphatic and immune problems and no function in her left hand. Mr. Casavant didn’t want to be away from the little girl who spent the following five years in and out of hospital undergoing numerous surgeries. He took the job as conservation officer largely because it allowed him to work near his Vancouver Island home.

From the start Mr. Casavant has said that he never disobeyed the order to kill the cubs. What he did he says was “respectfully decline an unlawful order to discharge a service weapon.” There’s no smirk on his lips when he says this. Mr. Casavant is punctilious to a fault. A “hall monitor” is how his partner Lesley Fox describes him with a sigh.

Officers like soldiers have a moral and legal obligation to not obey unlawful orders he explains. It’s been this way since the judges at the Nuremberg trials that followed the Second World War determined that ‘following orders’ was not a valid defence to the commission of war crimes. This is drilled into recruits during training and spelled out in B.C.’s Police Act and the Queen’s Regulations and Orders those governing Canada’s Armed Forces.

Mr. Casavant argues that Sgt. Newton’s kill order was unlawful in two ways. It deviated from the service’s standing policy for yearling cubs. Beyond that an officer can’t be ordered to use lethal force whether on a human or animal. That irreversible decision like its consequences belongs to an officer alone.

The government has never addressed this issue which lies at the heart of the dispute: Was Sgt. Newton’s kill order lawful or not? And was Mr. Casavant justified in declining it? Justice Lauri Ann Fenlon of the appellate court noted that as “an office holder” a constable has a degree of independence in their decision making. They are “not the servant of anyone” she wrote and are “answerable to the law and to the law alone.”

An investigation by the ministry instead centred on two questions: In not abiding by Sgt. Newton’s order to kill the cubs was Mr. Casavant guilty of discreditable conduct and neglect of duty? He was found guilty of both. “We could never trust that if you disagreed with the direction given by a supervisor that you would follow the direction” Chief Conservation Officer Doug Forsdick wrote in his letter of dismissal.

None of the myriad officials who weighed in on Mr. Casavant’s dismissal including arbitrators bureaucrats and B.C.’s Labour Relations Board had any jurisdiction over it the B.C. Court of Appeal ruled. Ministry policy “clearly provides” that complaints against conservation officers “are subject to a process mandated by the Police Act” Justice Fenlon wrote. In declaring Mr. Casavant’s firing a nullity she acknowledged the “tangled knot” created by this “flawed procedure” and left it to “the parties to sort out the consequences.” That’s where things are now stalled. The two sides can’t agree on what those consequences should be.

While Mr. Casavant is keen to return to work lawyers for the province argue that his dismissal was not a constabulary issue. In their response to his petition they asked the lower court not to follow the appellate ruling an extraordinary demand. They argue his decision not to kill the cubs related to the performance of his duties as a conservation officer not a constable.

Mr. Casavant’s dismissal was due in part to a report prepared by psychologist Keith Forshaw he was told. The government barred him from seeing it for years until he unearthed it via a Freedom of Information request. The three-page report says Mr. Casavant was “poorly matched” for the job and should never have been hired. Mr. Forshaw wrote that “concerns” with Mr. Casavant “first became evident” during training.

The Globe and Mail has obtained the 29 reviews made of Mr. Casavant during his six-week training in 2015. All are effusive in their praise. His final assessment concluded that Mr. Casavant set “a high standard for fellow recruits” and was a “highly intelligent individual motivated by his desire for excellence in all he encountered.” His classmates who voted him “top shot” for his perfect score on the shooting range were no less fulsome in their praise of a colleague they clearly admired. In 2014 Mr. Casavant won a provincial competition for Detective Sergeant a senior role and a significant promotion for an officer with less than two years on the job.

In 2017 the B.C. College of Psychologists initiated an investigation into the report after Mr. Casavant complained about its veracity. They found that it was both unreliable and improperly obtained and sanctioned Mr. Forshaw.

Mr. Scapillati says the ongoing dispute is about more than just bear cubs. When it comes to big game animals B.C.’s conservation services has tended to work on a them-or-us paradigm. For decades B.C. has considered a bear that has eaten garbage even once a dead bear he says. The approach may have worked 100 years ago but with B.C. adding some 10000 kilometres of roadways to the wilderness each year there is so little wildlife left that most bears are in fact human habituated.

Mr. Scapillati believes B.C.’s Wildlife Act badly needs updating. He says that a habituated bear is actually “a pretty good bear” because “it knows how to live with humans” – primarily how to avoid us. And eating fish guts left on a porch doesn’t mean a bear is habituated adds Chris Darimont science director of the Raincoast Foundation and a professor of conservation science at the University of Victoria. He calls black bears “omnivorous opportunists”: When they’re hungry they take more risks. “Human foods are the riskiest of all foods.” His research has shown that human-grizzly conflicts spike in B.C. in years when salmon runs are low.

Although classed in the order carnivora the highly exploratory and inquisitive black bear mostly eats plants which make up as much as 80 per cent of its diet says Mr. Darimont. Bears are misunderstood in other ways says Marc Bekoff professor emeritus of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder. These are intelligent social gentle animals he says. They feel empathy and embarrassment. They judge. They get bored. They grieve.

And yet a public reappraisal of the value of wildlife can happen sometimes very quickly. In Europe a change in attitudes has allowed for the return of wolves bears lynx and wolverines. Italy Austria and France have begun reintroducing grizzlies to parts of their former range. Faint signs of change can be seen in B.C.

Two years after Mr. Casavant’s stand B.C. ended the wildly controversial trophy hunting of grizzly bears which claimed some 300 bears a year. First Nations leadership are finally being allowed to play a role in wildlife management at least in their traditional territories and bring a markedly different perspective to the table. The opaque decision-making of B.C.’s Conservation Service is being examined by academics. A report last spring criticized the service for a lack of restraint and independent oversight. Officers are given far too much discretion to kill large carnivores the report by the University of Victoria’s Environmental Law Centre found.

But while the conversation on these issues appears to be changing the data shows the work of the conservation service is not. In the last three years officers relocated fewer than half as many grizzlies as the three years prior to 2018: 19 compared with 31. In that time they destroyed twice as many grizzlies (99 versus 42) and roughly the same number of black bears (1691 versus 1713) and cougars (233 versus 287) as in the three years prior.

Mr. Casavant who recently completed a doctorate in social sciences awaits yet another decision on his case – the sixth in as many years. The waiting is the worst part says his partner Ms. Fox whom he met in 2016. “For months and months it overshadows everything. You can’t move forward or plan or hope or dream. You’re frozen and your destiny is tied to what others decide.”

Even the name of the shop the Loose Leaf Tea Loft had a playful double meaning signifying both the steeped teas and the stationery products for sale there.

Her brief stint as a restaurateur provided a distraction from a tumultuous time in her family ― as well as a challenging real-world lesson in business that would later inform her political work.

Before she was a lawyer or a city councilor or a mayoral candidate before she was a wife or mother Michelle Wu was the owner of a literary-themed café in Chicago.

Notebooks and journals lined the walls along with books of fiction stacked in crates that Wu and her sisters had coaxed from the owners of wine shops.

“I remember Michelle driving us around in the family minivan to different liquor stores and having to go in and beg them ‘Can I please just have one wine crate? Could I have two is that possible?’” recalled her sister Sherelle Wu. The furniture was haphazardly acquired on Craigslist creating a vibe she described as “a mix and match funky retro bar.”

It was 2008 and just a few months earlier Wu had been a 23-year-old on top of her game in Boston. A recent Harvard graduate living in the North End she had landed a job at the prestigious Boston Consulting Group. Her boyfriend Yale film studies graduate Conor Pewarski was about to embark on an internship in Hollywood.

Opening a tea shop in Chicago was not part of Wu’s plan. Instead it was the “retirement” fantasy of Wu’s mother who had stayed home to raise her four children and imagined opening a community space as an empty nester. Yu-Min Wu — then 51 and separated from her husband Han Wu — still had two daughters at home when her tidy suburban life began falling apart.

She would later be diagnosed with late-onset schizophrenia but at first no one knew what was happening.

Wu’s father a chemical engineer had landed an opportunity with Swatch Watch and was working in Switzerland when her mother began to have trouble managing. Wu and her brother Elliott were already off at college. Her mother Sherelle and youngest sister Victoria briefly moved to Switzerland to join their father.

“It was an attempt to sort of stabilize the family by having us all together” said Sherelle Wu.

But it didn’t prove helpful. “We all realized that moving to a foreign country where you don’t speak the language is not a stabilizing move” Sherelle Wu said. So Yu-Min and the girls returned to Barrington Ill. where her symptoms began to worsen. Months later Sherelle Wu made a panicked call to Boston: Their mother had started hearing things that other people couldn’t hear.

“Growing up she always told us if you see someone in trouble don’t just turn the other way” Michelle Wu recalled. “She started hearing people crying out for help. In the middle of the night she was going out trying to help” Wu said.

Wu rushed back to Illinois to help her mother and help care for her sisters then 11 and 17. Together they began trying to get their mother diagnosed and then treated — a tough process with a patient who was both stubborn and suffering from paranoia. It became clear this wouldn’t be a quick visit.

With her savings from her consulting gig — and her boyfriend who gave up that internship — Wu left behind her new grownup life in Boston. She moved back to her childhood home where she was vaulted into preternatural maturity.

“Almost overnight” she said “I became a mom to two girls.”

Between the emergency room dashes with her mother and the school trips with her sisters — the “blur of day-to-day survival” as she put it — the tea shop of her mother’s dreams emerged as a fanciful notion. Wu had imagined opening a business that her mother would take over when she recovered. But her mother she now realized would never be well enough for that.

Rather than a long-term retirement project for her mother the Loose Leaf Tea Loft became a pleasant family diversion from the chaotic tension of the moment.

“The tea shop in some ways was the little spot of joy for all of us” Wu said. “We could be talking about the decisions we needed to make how we would create space that was truly welcoming to everyone.”

Wu rented the space a former antique shop near but not in a newly hip area of the city and set to work on the fledgling family business. Wu with her sisters boyfriend and sometimes her mother chose colors painted the walls and tasted dozens of teas to choose the selection for the shop. They ranked the teas by aroma taste and other factors and named their selections recalled Sherelle Wu. Their younger sister named a tea for herself “Victoria’s Garden.” Sherelle favored “Puck’s Pleasure” a reference to the fairy’s love potion in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

“It was really fun. It was sort of like this side project that we could all work on as a way to distract ourselves” said Sherelle Wu.

“Michelle came up with a timeline a budget a whole business plan and delegated age-appropriate tasks to Tori and to me” said Sherelle Wu who was interested in psychology at the time. “I was looking into what color should we paint the walls and what color plates should we buy. What makes a coffee shop or a restaurant feel cozy?”

It wasn’t easy. Though their projected business timeline had seemed straightforward inspections and permits were repeatedly set back. “It just became delay after delay after delay” Wu said remembering how she “had to go beg our local alderman for assistance.”

Plans to open in the summer were pushed back to fall. But after finally opening they fell into a groove with Sherelle Wu often working the cash register. Loose Leaf would host monthly poetry readings dubbed the “Poetry Love-In” as well as open mic nights and entrepreneurship classes.

“I loved it. Once we actually got it open it was beautiful” Wu said. “It really felt like creating a space that was welcoming people into our home. We were able to find and become part of the local arts scene.”

Wu who took food safety training before opening the restaurant would make dumplings and “whatever cookies I felt like making that day” she said. Though she didn’t perform at the poetry slams she would play the café keyboard at quiet moments. (“That’s what I would do for a little refuge from the storm swelling” she said.)

The gathering storm was her mom’s illness. When it became clear that Yu-Min Wu would not be able to handle the tea loft on her own Wu began planning its sale and her return to Boston. After the many legal and regulatory hurdles she’d experienced she was drawn to the study of law and applied to Harvard Law School.

And so they came to Boston. Wu became Tori’s legal guardian in 2010 a few months before her father filed for divorce from her mother. (He’s now remarried in Florida where he works as director of technology for a battery company.)

Sherelle Wu now 30 and an employment attorney in Boston lives in Jamaica Plain with her husband and Tori. Wu and Pewarski married in 2011 and now have two sons of their own; Wu’s mother lives the lower unit of the duplex they bought in Roslindale.

Wu brought back with her the real-world business lessons she learned by opening the tea loft. She was able to channel her frustrations with Chicago’s inspection process into a revamp of Boston’s while working as a law fellow in the “urban mechanics” program of former mayor Thomas M. Menino’s administration. There she created a streamlined online tool kit for restaurant and small business owners to follow in addition to creating a city approval process for food trucks to operate in Boston. As a city councilor Wu authored the “Acoustic on Main” ordinance that lets restaurants and other small businesses offer live music poetry improv or other performances without having to obtain an entertainment license.

In city government she tries to remember how it felt on the opposite side of the regulatory counter during her brief seven-month stint operating a business.

“It’s figuring out how to serve your community in a different way” she said. “Entrepreneurs are resourceful resilient and make such a difference in anchoring our neighborhoods.”

1 — Does it matter if we ever figure out who Satoshi really is or was?

It doesn’t matter until it does. In other words it may become material if/when we find out who Satoshi is/was.

In the meantime not knowing who Satoshi is/was is interesting for the adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) because it provided a neutral starting point for adopters to co-create the Bitcoin narrative and use case — as a decentralized collective.

I imagine Satoshi must be watching this anthropological experiment unfold somewhere in the world.

2 — What does decentralization mean to you and why is it important?

Decentralization to me means the distribution of power. There are lots of reasons why decentralization is important but the one general point I’d like to mention here is that it invites everyone to participate in whatever is being decentralized. This ends up activating more people and potential than is possible with centralization.

3 — Which people do you find most inspiring most interesting and most fun in this space?

I find the mental workings of Balaji Srinivasan Michael Saylor and Robert Breedlove most inspiring most interesting and most fun in this space. I appreciate the theoretical and philosophical discussions of crypto and these guys just crush it.

Balaji’s predictive abilities are otherworldly. Saylor’s application of thermodynamics to Bitcoin is pure brilliance. And Breedlove’s What is Money? philosophical discussions are critically important to our time.

I thank the great interviewers too who are asking meaningful questions.

4 — Think of your favorite poem or song lyric. What is it and why does it speak to you?

Talk about rabbit holes! There’s rarely a time in the day when I’m not listening to music whether it’s classical (I’m listening to Chopin while typing this) rock hip-hop or electro — and everything in between. So lots of favorite song lyrics immediately rush to mind but here’s the first:

“Go With The Flow” by Queens of the Stone Age: “I want something good to die for to make it beautiful to live.”

As for poems one of my favorite quotes is from Thoreau: “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run.” Though I also appreciate the widely circulated more concise variation of it: “The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.”

The beauty of poems and lyrics is that they are left to interpretation and fit snuggly with the interpreter’s journey.

5 — What is the book that influenced you the most? Why?

Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet has influenced me the most because he masterfully touches and teaches on all facets of life. Further every word within the book is potent and powerful. I’ve read this book several times and have realized something new each time.

I super appreciate minds that can create construct and communicate value in a thoughtful tightly crafted and artful way. The classics broadly speaking do this — zero fluff or filler. And this is important because of the Thoreau quote referenced above.

6 — If you didn’t need sleep what would you do with the extra time?

Not needing sleep would be an absolute superpower. I’m one of those people who needs a solid eight hours of sleep each night while I always wished I only needed five or six hours per night. Those additional hours have mega compounding potential. I’d do more of everything that contributes to evolution: work read write listen to podcasts get together with friends exercise travel — all the things.

Not needing sleep would also make international travel way more manageable. And as someone who loves to adventure the world this would be a game changer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMTAvMjQvc29jY2VyL2JhcmNlbG9uYS1jYW1wLW5vdS1mdW5kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barcelona members support debt plan to revamp Camp Nou,"FC Barcelona members have voted in favor of raising additional funds to revamp its ailing Camp Nou stadium.

The Catalan club asked members to support raising as much as €1.5 billion ($1.74 billion) to renovate and further develop facilities at the iconic Camp Nou — a project known as Espai Barca.

The plan involves renovating the stadium — Europe’s biggest with a capacity of 105000 fans — as well as another venue used for other sports like basketball. Both facilities are in a precarious condition forcing the club to fund regular repairs and pay fines for not meeting European competition requirements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW5iYXNlLmNvbS9ibG9nL2RpZ2l0YWwtYXNzZXQtcG9saWN5LXByb3Bvc2FsLXNhZmVndWFyZGluZy1hbWVyaWNhcy1maW5hbmNpYWwtbGVhZGVyc2hpcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Asset Policy Proposal: Safeguarding America's Financial Leadership,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.coinbase.com/blog/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW5iYXNlLmNvbS9ibG9nL2RpZ2l0YWwtYXNzZXQtcG9saWN5LXByb3Bvc2FsLXNhZmVndWFyZGluZy1hbWVyaWNhcy1maW5hbmNpYWwtbGVhZGVyc2hpcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

This shark-tooth-sharp comedy which has swum relatively seamlessly down to the West End from the 2019 Edinburgh Festival is an enjoyable three-hander about the near-disasters behind the scenes in the film’s final sequence. We find ourselves trapped on a boat with actors Roy Scheider (Demetri Goritsas) Richard Dreyfuss (Liam Murray Scott) and Robert Shaw (Ian Shaw) as they struggle with ego clashes cocaine and whisky highs and malfunctioning animatronic sharks.

It’s part of the story of this production that actor and co-writer Ian Shaw is Robert’s real son (Joseph Nixon is the other writer) and he brings him astonishingly to life in his mordant charismatic performance. With memorable lines like “Fame is the shit of art” and “Remember what WC Fields said about water? You should avoid it. ‘Fish fuck in it’” he is the downbeat foil to Scott’s neurotically insecure Dreyfuss and Goritsas’ geeky Scheider.

By the end of filming Jaws was more than twice over its initial US$3.5m budget scenes were still being written and the movie as a whole was under threat from the constant shark breakdowns (there were three all named Bruce after Spielberg’s lawyer). At the age of 27 Spielberg was still an unproven film director; through the interaction between the three characters we see how perilously thin the line was between Jaws being cinema’s first ever blockbuster or sinking deeper than the Mariana Trench.

Guy Masterson’s production is memorably enhanced by Nina Dunn’s video design (pictured below) which projects a shifting sea and vast skies that subtly convey the passage from day to night to day. As Dreyfuss Shaw and Scheider bicker the script leans heavily on hindsight to sharpen its humour. At one point Scheider wonders aloud whether there will ever be a more immoral president than Nixon. At another – after explaining that sharks have survived five mass extinction events – he speculates on how climate change might provoke the next.

The three actors complement each other well; Goritsas’s dry delivery provides a good contrast to the more mercurial trajectories of Scott and Shaw. One running joke is that each actor considers himself to be the movie’s star and the bickering increases with the levels of inebriation. Shaw is the whisky-dependent alcoholic who has hidden bottles liberally around the set. As the inhibitions drop away he hits more and more mercilessly at Dreyfuss’s insecurities – in another joke enhanced by hindsight he drily mocks the actor’s aspirations that he might ever appear in a Shakespeare.

The timing of the transfer of course gives the script new resonance. As the UK sprints ahead of the rest of Europe in Covid infections we are all grimly aware of Boris Johnson’s blithe comparisons of his attitude to that of Jaws’ profit-over-safety politician Mayor Vaughn. In 1975 it was an example of a cavalier attitude that was upstaged by events and others’ ragged heroism. Today it’s an example of the decadence that makes Western democracy a laughing-stock to those lining up to challenge it.

It brings a strange poignancy to the rantings of three men who for all their flaws and doubts were on the brink of extraordinary success. Life we all now know wasn’t so bad when all you had to worry about was the wayward if expensive antics of some animatronic sharks. Thanks to the writing and performances there are plenty of laughs on offer here. But it’s also somewhat sobering to reflect that the murderous shark was the product of a brief moment when it seemed that individualism and democracy had won; now that Western politics has - well - jumped the shark who knows what new predators await us?

By Ronni Newton

The sidewalks of West Hartford Center and Blue Back Square and the front lawn of West Hartford Town Hall were packed with thousands of costumed characters Saturday morning for the annual Moms & More Halloween Stroll – returning this year after being canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On a picture-perfect morning pint-sized ghosts and goblins pumpkins and skeletons super heroes ghouls and animated characters strolled through West Hartford collecting candy from generous merchants that set up stations on the sidewalk. There were also plenty of parents and quite a few dogs decked out. Other dogs rescues available for adoption through Dog Star were also at the Halloween Stroll.

“It was great to see so many families out and about and smiling” said Robyn Rifkin general manager of Blue Back Square. West Hartford lifted its indoor mask mandate as of Friday and Rifkin said she thought that may have helped people feel even more comfortable attending an outdoor event such as he Halloween Stroll.

Sumner Street in Hartford.

It was October 12 2021 when WashingtonCountyInsider.com first reported Culver’s would be moving from its old site across the road 1570 E. Sumner Street which burned to the ground September 11 2021.

Details included in the landscape plans courtesy Kimley Horn:

the property includes 114 regular striped parking stalls and 6 handicapped accessible striped parking stalls for a total of 120 striped parking stalls

the subject property is located at the southeast corner of E. Sumner Street and Plaza Drive.

the existing building is 7929 square feet

the existing structure (formerly Ponderosa) will be removed

proposed Culvers is 4648 square feet

The design below shows a double drive thru on the east side of the building.

a 1123-square-foot outdoor patio is proposed for the west side of the building

two driveways are proposed off Novak Street

Justin Drew is the City of Hartford Director of Community Development. He said there could still be some significant changes to the designs based on final submission.

The zoning committee plan commission or common council would also express comments/concerns about the final submission.

Jeff Liegel and his company S & L Properties West Bend LLC purchased the Culver’s in Hartford for $2.4 million.

“This new location will give us enough room for a double drive thru increased dining room and parking” said Liegel. “Our new location will be open in six to seven months.”

The 1.7-acre parcel 1285 E. Sumner Street was sold July 1 2021 for $950000 to DMD Hartford Appleton Wisconsin. The property had been assessed at $1196600.

On Wednesday October 20 2021 Hartford Fire Chief Paul Stephans said the cause of the Sept. 11 2021 Culver’s fire remains under investigation.

“The building will be made safe next week and then investigators will be able to get in and take a look” said Stephans.

The fire investigators will include Stephans a member of the Washington County Sheriff’s Department and the insurance fire investigator.

The team stressed the importance of details throughout their panel letting fans know they not only worked directly with Lucasfilm to make the Rancor screen accurate but they traveled to Lucasfilm to scan the original prop for all the exact specifications. How detailed is the paint job? Fans can expect an over 900 art deco count which is 9 times more than a normal Black Series figure.

Want to add this Rancor to your collection? The Black Series Rancor HasLab is currently live on the Hasbro Pulse website. Fans interested in backing the project are looking at a price tag of $349.99. The campaign is currently accepting orders until December 6th at 11:59 PM EST and needs a total of 9000 backers. As with previous HasLab projects there are stretch goals and the first two are at 11000 backers and 13500 backers. At the time of this post there are already over 1600 fans backing the project so it looks like this HasLab is well on its way to be successful as the two previous campaigns with Jabba’s Sail Barge and the Razor Crest from The Mandalorian.

For those that missed our report from yesterday during this year’s Hasbro Pulse Con 2021 a teaser was shown as part of the Ghostbusters presentation giving us our first look at the pack.

As evident by some of the details and unique characteristics that can be seen on the pack it appears that Hasbro’s Proton Pack replica will be based on its appearance in Ghostbusters: Afterlife.

The Proton Pack will be part of a HasLab campaign. HasLab is Hasbro’s crowdfunding platform that helps bring dream products into the hands of fans.

Pricing and regional availability are still unknown but we hope to update you when the reveal takes place on October 27th.

First of many for Logan Hutsko! pic.twitter.com/gWIB7i8whF — Charlotte Checkers (@CheckersHockey) October 23 2021

NOTES

UP NEXT

The rematch between Charlotte and Hershey was a tight low-scoring affair that saw the Checkers earn a point in the standings but ultimately fall thanks to a late overtime winner by the Bears.The visitors drew things to a 1-1 tie with a late tally in the third period sending the Checkers to overtime for the first time this season. The extra frame was a thrilling one featuring over four-and-a-half minutes of near constant chances for each side. The game seemed destined for a shootout until a quick shot from Hershey’s Lucas Johansen snuck through to clinch the win for the Bears with just 23 seconds left on the clock.Logan Hutsko’s red-hot start to his rookie year rolled on tonight as the young forward crashed the net and potted his first pro goal early on in the middle frame to put Charlotte on the board. That would be the lone offensive breakthrough for the home side though as they outshout the Bears 28-26 but couldn’t solve netminder Zach Fucale beyond that.In his first start of the season Antoine Bibeau turned in a stellar performance against a formative Hershey offense making 24 saves to help earn the Checkers a point in the standings.I thought we played a really good hockey game. I thought we limited their chances. They’re obviously a high-end team but the effort was there and I thought it was the most organized game we’ve played and obviously we got good goaltending.It’ll be a little bit of a learning curve for us but moving forward we want to get that killer instinct. That next goal is critical for us because you want to go up two and keep your foot on the gas but I thought we handled it fine. We had that power play where you want to have that killer instinct and then they come back right after end up getting a bounce and it ends up going in the back of the net. Overall I was very proud of the effort.We had a lot of travel so he ended up going back to Allen and then we recalled him right away so he spent two days in the car and hadn’t practiced a lot. He had a couple of good practices here with Leo Luongo and the “dig in” was pretty impressive.I like those types of goals. Second and third (chances) in front of the net in the blue paint. He loves traffic and he’s very good in there so it was definitely a reward for his work.We’ve got to know them pretty well here early in the season. We were just trying to get pucks deep and play in the offensive zone but obviously came up short.I missed a couple of chances here early in the first couple of games so finally getting one in tonight felt really good. It definitely helped to get it out of the way.The crowd was great tonight and it was really fun playing in front of them. I wish we could have gotten the win but we’ll come back next weekend and be ready go to.After dropping their opener against Hershey the Checkers have points in each of their last three games (2-0-1) … Hutsko now has five points (1g 5a) in his first four AHL games … He and Alexander True are the only Checkers to record at least one point in each game … At the game’s conclusion True led the AHL in scoring with seven points (4g 3a) in seven games and also had a league-best plus-8 rating … Hutsko was tied for fourth among rookie scorers … Forwards Karch Bachman and Zac Dalpe missed the game due to injury … Forward Henry Bowlby defenseman Frank Hora were healthy extras.The Checkers head back out on the road for a three-in-three next weekend beginning with a Friday matchup in Providence.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pbnF1aXJlci9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1kZW5uZXktb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzExMjkwMjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Denney Obituary (1932 - 2021) - Hershey Mills PA - The Philadelphia Inquirer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/inquirer/name/robert-denney-obituary?id=31129020 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pbnF1aXJlci9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1kZW5uZXktb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzExMjkwMjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTMyMzk20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surgery has survival benefits for male Stage IV breast cancer patients who are receptive to systemic therapy,"With increasingly effective treatments available best practices for male breast cancer patients need to evolve as they have for female breast cancer patients in recent years according to new study findings

Key takeaways

Men with Stage IV breast cancer who are receptive to systemic therapy benefit from surgical intervention.

Patients also benefitted who received trimodal therapy consisting of systemic therapy surgery and radiation compared to just receiving systemic therapy.

The authors hope their findings prompt reconsideration of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for this group of male breast cancer patients which now recommends systemic therapy with surgical intervention only to be used as a palliative measure.

CHICAGO: Men with Stage IV breast cancer and known estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status benefit from surgical intervention and from trimodal therapy (systemic therapy surgery and radiation) according to a study presented at the virtual American College of Surgeons (ACS) Clinical Congress 2021.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines to treat men with Stage IV breast cancer recommend systemic therapy with surgery to be used to minimize symptoms such as ulcerations pain or bleeding said first author Kelly A. Stahl MD a surgical resident at Penn State College of Medicine Hershey. However new study findings show that surgery does have survival benefits for men with Stage IV breast cancer she said.

“We need to re-examine the notion that Stage IV breast cancer in men is so dire that there is no survival benefit to surgical intervention” said Daleela G. Dodge MD FACS a general surgeon at Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey PA and a co-author of the study.

“For this subgroup of patients who are responsive to systemic therapy and do not have a lot of metastatic burden we’d like there to be a reconsideration of best practices.”

Breast cancer in men accounts for less than 1 percent of all breast cancer cases whereas one in eight women get breast cancer compared to one in 1000 men Dr. Dodge said. As a result public awareness of breast cancer in men is low.

“We have a whole month devoted to breast cancer awareness for women but it’s not well known that men can get it too and that some men even have a genetic predisposition to getting it” Dr. Stahl said.

Unfortunately low public awareness has contributed to the fact that 6 percent of women compared with 10 percent of men are not diagnosed until they have Stage IV cancer. In addition 40 percent of male breast cancer patients do not get diagnosed until Stages III or IV even though breast cancer is easier for male patients to detect on their own said Dr. Dodge. She added “Men have a worse prognosis based on late diagnosis so awareness is important.”

About the study

The authors were surprised at how many patients they were able to find that fit the parameters of their study crediting the extensive dataset in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). The researchers identified 539 Stage IV breast cancer patients with known ER/PR status from 2004-2017 in the NCDB. Chi-square tests examined subgroup differences between the treatment modalities received. Overall survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models examined factors associated with survival.

A noted survival advantage

The researchers found a survival advantage noted in patients who received trimodal therapy compared with patients who received systemic therapy alone. ER positive patients who received trimodal therapy or systemic therapy and surgery had an improved 5-year overall survival rate when compared with systemic therapy. PR positive patients who received trimodal therapy or systemic therapy and surgery had an improved 5-year overall survival rate when compared with systemic therapy. The sequence of treatment was significant with the greatest survival advantage noted in ER positive patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who received adjuvant chemotherapy.

“We’re trying to catch up to better tailor our treatment of men with breast cancer and this study shows how treatment can be tailored in Stage IV disease” Dr. Dodge said.

Whereas the old styles of cybersecurity were conceived to cover data on the original front enterprise cybersecurity strategies are designed to guard data as it travels between distant wireless bias and onto pall waiters.This means that enterprise cybersecurity involves guarding your company’s on- premise and pall- grounded structure as well as vetting third- party providers and securing the expanding number of endpoints connected to your network via the Internet of Effects (IoT).Each across the marketable artificial healthcare education and government sectors cybersecurity has come a principal concern among directors and directors. Due to cybersecurity vulnerabilities numerous businesses have been targeted by hackers or been subject to data breaches. Consider the following intimidating statistics from cyberthreat reports and data breach studiesNearly one-third ofU.S. businesses reported passing a breach within this once time.The average cost per data breach in 2017 was in excess of$ 3 million USD — with the average number of compromised records per breach rising to.In a check of nearly IT professionals further than 75 percent reported that they didn't have a homogenized plan within their association for responding to a cybersecurity breach.In 2017 the average time it took an association to identify a data breach was a little over six months 191 days to be precise.With so important at stake in terms of your company’s security finances and character it's pivotal to have an enterprise cybersecurity program in place to guard vital data.The Major Key Players in the Market:SymantecMcAfeeTrend MicroAvast SoftwareESETBitdefenderFortinetF-SecureG DATA SoftwareAviraQihoo 360KasperskyTencentQuick HealComodoMicrosoftRisingCheetah MobileAhnLabDownload Complete Report atContact Us+ 1 888 391 5441sales@deepresearchreports.comDeep Research Reports is digital database of syndicated market reports for Global and China industries.

Kimpton Fills A Unique Market Position

Kimpton IHG’s smartest acquisition was purchased to fill a mid-market gap with modern hotels and a cool factor reminiscent of W Andaz and Edition. Kimpton focuses on design and plays to a young affluent crowd though many of their properties are rather affordable. W Hotels is a lot more money for a similar product Andaz too but the latter is just a little less loud than W. Kimpton has the design and for lack of a better word sass of W without the hefty price point.

Kimpton is a small chain (just 1.2% of IHG’s portfolio) upmarket of Indigo but more accessible than the newly acquired Six Senses.

IHG Is Just Terrible

For all of its faults IHG has identified its market gaps: luxury lifestyle resort – and has worked to bring brands in to fill those gaps. For the top end of the market Regent was acquired by the hotelier to compete with Park Hyatt Waldorf-Astoria (Hilton) St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton (Marriott.) At the time it the 51% stake was purchased Regent was just six properties; IHG intends to grow it to 40 hotels. For one of the world’s largest chains (6031 hotels worldwide) a six property entrance into the $60bn luxury hotel market sums up the brand’s approach nicely.

Intercontinental Hotel Group cannot be trusted with the long-term survival of a meaningful loyalty program. Kimpton developed its own Inner Circle with great perks and a unique culture. They promoted a “secret word” its members could say at check in that would deliver a Kimpton Inner Circle gift; both the perks and secret word changed quarterly keeping members engaged.

Meanwhile IHG doesn’t offer late guaranteed 4 pm checkout free breakfast nor confirmable upgrades to its most loyal IHG Rewards Club customers amassing 75 or more stays in a calendar year. To get some (but not all) of those benefits you’d need to apply and pay $200 – and that only corresponds to Platinum status.

IHG Rewards Club points have devalued its redemptions over the last few years from 50000 points as the highest category to trying to sneak in a hike to 120000 during the pandemic. They ultimately retreated following substantial vitriol from members. The credit card delivers little value when compared with competing brands and they don’t seem to care. It doesn’t help to earn IHG Rewards points if they devalue faster than other programs for hotel stays you rarely want to book anyway.

As much as I dislike Marriott Bonvoy even that program is more trustworthy and delivers more value than IHG and would be a better home for the brand.

IHG hates its elites. Even as a Business Edge IHG Rewards member I found little value in the program and virtually no access to Rewards Club Customer Care Center help for large bookings of many guests for an extended period of time.

Why IHG Should Sell Kimpton

IHG has helped Kimpton grow from a few dozen properties to 75 in 50+ cities. Is there a more perfect time to sell? IHG has been able to acquire the brand add customers (whether they are a good fit or not more on that below) add value and now can sell a far more mature brand with greater reach.

The reason why other brands are able to grow and build a following with their premium brands is that their offerings are broader. Premium brands at SPG represented a far larger percentage of its portfolio. Hyatt also has a significant amount of their brand coming in above select service categories (Hyatt Place Hyatt House) and Marriott does a better job of this than IHG. Here’s a great example as to why:

A premium guest who spends time at Intercontinental properties for work in major cities wants to relax on vacation with her family. In Hawaii for example there are just two properties – none of them full service. In Barcelona all of the choices for IHG are sub $100/night with the exception of the Intercontinental a Kimpton and a Hotel Indigo. We find the same limited offerings outside of select service in Rome. A premium business traveler does not want to stay in the Holiday Inn Express Waikiki.

It doesn’t fit with the rest of their brand because it doesn’t fit with their customer base. The majority of customers are Holiday Inn customers (I’m not throwing shade it was the best hotel in a city I worked in extensively and I earned Spire status because of it) but those are rarely willing to pay the premium for Kimpton. That said some Kimptons are priced below where they could be with a more premium customer base and marketing that works for those brands.

Conclusion

I really enjoy Kimpton hotels. Each one I have visited delivers a cool factor worthy of a premium. If they were part of a loyalty program where I had a broader range (both up and down lines) I’d be far more likely to choose them as often as possible. The reason I don’t is because there aren’t enough of them to make them my primary chain and there’s simply not enough other quality brands in a loyalty program that returns value to me. For IHG’s part they have built up the brand and can turn a profit on the larger product but Kimpton just doesn’t fit in with the rest of its customer base.

What do you think? Should IHG sell Kimpton? Should it keep the brand and grow it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZWRpYW9mZmljZS5hYnVkaGFiaS9lbi90b3VyaXNtL2RvdWJsZXRyZWUtYnktaGlsdG9uLWFidS1kaGFiaS15YXMtaXNsYW5kLXJlc2lkZW5jZXMtc2V0LXRvLW9wZW4tdG8tZ3Vlc3RzLWluLW5vdmVtYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DoubleTree by Hilton Abu Dhabi Yas Island Residences Set to Open to Guests in November,"Miral Abu Dhabi’s leading curator of magnetic experiences in collaboration with Hilton announced today that the DoubleTree by Hilton Abu Dhabi Yas Island Residences will open its doors to guests on 17 November 2021.

The Sanford City Council on Oct. 19 annexed a 169-plus acre tract of land near the end of Valley Road on which a multi-use subdivision has been proposed.

With new industries coming to Lee County and existing ones preparing to ramp up their hiring over the next few months Sanford is poised for an unprecedented period of growth. Already 4500 new housing units are either under review or already approved along with another 1250 apartments that will change the character and size of the city.

Before its 6-0 vote (Councilman Chas Post was absent) to annex the land the council heard concerns raised by neighboring landowners about the new housing development which if approved would feature up to 404 single family homes 272 apartments and some limited commercial usage. The proposed development which is bordered by Boone Trail Road Valley Road and Forestwood Park Road would be called Brookshire. Pinnacle Partners LLC a Raleigh-based real estate firm asked the city for the annexation and to assign the property a zoning status which would allow the high density construction (click here to see a map of the proposal).

Scott Osborne of Valley Road represented many of the adjoining homeowners in his remarks during the public hearing. Osborne said the Brookshire plan was developed without regard for the SanLee land use plan and zoning ordinances and without respect for the land and its natural resources that have been cared for and preserved by adjacent landowners.

“With all of the high salaries associated with new industries in Lee and surrounding counties being touted by local governments SAGA and public officials I just cannot believe that there is no market for developments offering home buyers an option to buy a house with more acreage than what is proposed here” he said.

Osborne said the development plan proposed by Pinnacle was long on promises but short on specifics. He pointed out that the plan contained no information on the exterior appearance of the housing to be constructed no details on how stream and wildlife mitigation would be accomplished and lacked information on how noise and light pollution would be contained within the boundaries of the development.

April Stone of Forestwood Park Road told the council that the roads surrounding the proposed development are already in poor condition and the increased traffic of a predicted 7000 more vehicles per day would forever alter the character of the community.

“We live in the country. We like to shoot our guns. We like to have our freedom. If you annex this what are we going to do?” she asked.

Another member of the community Mary Griffin believes the Sanford Police and Fire Departments are already stretched to their limits and adding another development into their service areas might be too much for them to handle.

After an hour of comments during the annexation public hearing the council voted unanimously to annex the property into the city limits. A second public hearing on the question of how the development should be zoned went on for another hour and 15 minutes with the adjoining property owners advocating for a classification that would reduce the density of housing that would be permitted.

Osborne argued that apartments and commercial development should not be permitted within the tract that there should be requirements in place to offset damages to streams and wildlife habitat that details of potential shrub or tree plantings or fencing should be included and that measures to alleviate potential flooding resulting from increased stormwater should be required.

“As I routinely read of where what kind and how dense some of the recent developments are that have been approved in our county” Osborne said “it troubles me that too many are leaning to become clones of developments to our north in Chatham Wake Harnett and Johnston counties.”

As the second hearing began to wind down Osborne told the council this group of property owners had not attended the meeting to hold a ‘Not in My Back Yard’ protest but instead to highlight the problems that can be created when the pace of development begins to outrun the means by which it can be monitored.

“Some may say ‘what does it matter if we lose 100 plus acres in an area to development?’” he said. “I contend that every parcel that is incompatible with existing and planned use should be carefully examined before we lose natural landscapes that are irreplaceable as a result of high-density development.”

The city’s Planning Board will present its recommendations on the matter to the council at its next meeting on November 2 when a final vote will be taken on how the development will be zoned for usage.

I couldn't even fit the entire skeleton horizontally in a shot because it was so ginormous! Here's the majestic skeletal beast in its glory (but where are its ""LifeEyes""?!):

Walmart announced its corporate employees will return to the office during the week of Nov. 8 the company said Friday.

“We had a way of working before the pandemic and we developed an effective way of working during the pandemic. Now I’m excited about our new more flexible way of working” Donna Morris chief people officer said in a statement Friday.

Walmart with nearly 1.6 million US employees is the nation’s largest private retailer. The majority of the company’s employees work in its warehouses and brick-and-mortar stores. Many of those in-store employees who have to follow President Joe Biden’s mandate requiring people who work for businesses with more than 100 employees get vaccinated or do weekly testing.

“As part of our ongoing efforts we made the decision to have vaccinations as a condition of employment for all campus office associates and field leaders (or have an approved religious or medical accommodation)” a Walmart spokesperson said.

Walmart’s global tech team of about 10000 is excluded from the return-to-office plans. In May Walmart announced its tech workers would continue working remotely even post-pandemic.

Morris said all campus associates will be “fully vaccinated or have an approved accommodation in November.” And in late July the company announced all campus office associates and regional should be vaccinated by Oct. 4 unless they have an approved exception. In early October Walmart said “the overwhelming majority” have been vaccinated.

Morris said employees will hear from their leaders soon on expectations.

The company is headquartered in Bentonville Arkansas and is currently building a new campus in the city. Walmart also has offices in Hoboken NJ as well as San Bruno and Sunnyvale CA.

“We also never imagined the playbook for being back on campus together would be adjusted so many times throughout the various waves of the pandemic” Morris said in the statement.

Walmart’s announcement is a break from other big-box retailers’ plans for their corporate employees. Earlier in October Amazon said it would allow individual teams to decide on a return-to-office policy.

“We expect that there will be teams that continue working mostly remotely others that will work some combination of remotely and in the office and still others that will decide customers are best served having the team work mostly in the office” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a note to employees.

Target told employees in August it will not require office workers to return until 2022.

The pandemic has made companies rethink how they approach work life. PricewaterhouseCoopers the accounting and consulting giant said in October it will allow all its 40000 US-based service employees to work virtually from anywhere in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vY29udGVudC9kb2ctd2FzaC1zdGF0aW9uLWluLWxhdW5kcnktcm9vbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Secret to a Cleaner Home Is This Laundry (or Mudroom) Addition,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

All dog owners have experienced the “it’s too late” moment. Your pup comes running through the back door after a whirl around the yard and before you even have time to think: Should I check his feet? the living room rug is peppered with muddy paw prints. The only logical next step is to reluctantly drag your pooch into your bathroom shower with you—and nobody’s happy about that. Luckily there is one small laundry room (or mudroom) renovation that can spare everyone the stress: building a dog-washing station.

Having a dedicated grooming setup in your home sounds like a luxury but it’s actually a practical addition that doesn’t soak up a ton of space. Example A: Birmingham Alabama–based design blogger Leslie Davis was able to squeeze one into her 10-by-6-foot laundry room right next to the stacked washer and dryer with no problem. Ahead get the lowdown on this game-changing update that’ll keep you and your pup on good terms.

The Dimensions

In order to still fit a small countertop area for folding clothes and a custom-built drying rack in her narrow space Davis mapped out a plan for her dog wash that took advantage of every square inch. The structure’s base measures 43 inches wide and 18 inches high making it totally suitable for her Irish Doodle Freddie to comfortably jump in and move around. The side and back walls are 27 inches high. “I wish I could say he loves this addition to our laundry room but he does not” she says. “He does however love going for hikes. This is where we end up afterward for a good foot washing at a minimum.”

The Finishes

Go ahead and splurge on textured zellige tiles for your own shower and focus instead on affordable subway options (Home Depot sells versions starting under $2 per square foot) and mosaic penny tiles. The latter (as seen in designer Ami McKay’s laundry room above) are inexpensive and easy to keep clean. Davis opted for a similar-looking tile for the base of her shower while the walls are swathed in an unpolished stone. Another way to keep costs low? Cap off the entry ledge with leftover surface material from a past project (kitchen and bathroom renovations often leave you with surplus scraps!).

The Mood

It takes time to get your pup squeaky-clean so make the room one you want to be in. Dina Bandman’s soothing example revolves around de Gournay’s hand-painted A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains wallpaper (the Delft-inspired colorway led to the glossy navy 2-by-8 bath tiles from Country Floors). The bathing zone was designed for ease: You can sit on the wide ledge while holding your dog with one hand and hosing her down with the other."
HON,Honeywell,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9ob25leXdlbGxzLWZvcm11bGEtZm9yLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaW4tY2hpbmEtMTE2MzQ5NzIxNzk5NjguaHRtbNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9ob25leXdlbGxzLWZvcm11bGEtZm9yLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaW4tY2hpbmEvYW1wLTExNjM0OTcyMTc5OTY4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honeywell’s formula for success in China | Mint,"How can an American company thrive in China at a time when tensions between the two countries are running high?

For Honeywell International Inc. the 115-year-old Charlotte N.C. aerospace and industrial conglomerate a strategy that deeply entrenched its local unit in Chinese life has been critical.

The architect of the strategy was Shane Tedjarati who took over Honeywell China in 2004 and has spent nearly two decades transforming the once-moribund unit. In that time Honeywell China’s revenue has grown along with the nation’s economy from $360 million to more than $6 billion last year—a sixth of Honeywell’s global revenue. His approach was to fully immerse the company in Chinese business and culture—and not shy away from helping Chinese companies achieve strategic goals set by Beijing.

“Little by little we had this Chineseness in our bones"" said Mr. Tedjarati.

Over the past two decades China has become an essential market for most U.S. multinationals providing much of their global growth. While operating within China’s authoritarian system has always presented companies with practical and ethical challenges those have grown far more acute in recent years as U.S.-China ties have frayed placing companies at risk of being caught in the middle.

Just this month for instance Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn said it would close the Chinese version of its site due to the country’s “challenging operating environment.""

Mr. Tedjarati moved to China three decades ago and committed to learning the language fluently at the outset he said at a time when foreign executives typically parachuted into the country for two or three years without engaging deeply with its culture people or customs. The Canadian has since served as a visiting professor at Shanghai’s China Executive Leadership Academy an elite school that provides leadership training to the Communist Party’s rising stars. He received a Chinese green card a decade ago making him one of the first few dozen foreigners to obtain one.

Building personal relations with local officials was important to shielding Honeywell from the choppy U.S.-China politics of the past few years he said.

“I have a very very close relationship with Chinese officials. We have intimate discussions often without interpreters"" said Mr. Tedjarati 58 years old who is to retire at the end of 2021 as Honeywell’s chief executive for high-growth regions such as Africa Latin America and Eastern Europe. He continued to oversee China and live in Shanghai after his promotion to the global role in 2012.

Mr. Tedjarati is to be succeeded by Ben Driggs a Honeywell veteran who has spent his career in the U.S. and Brazil except for three years he spent in Shanghai a decade ago. A team of local executives currently led by a Shanghai native runs the China business day to day.

Today Honeywell is everywhere in China with facilities in over 30 cities employing 13000 people. It makes avionics in Shanghai heating systems in Suzhou medical sensors in Nanjing industrial control systems in Tianjin and car turbochargers in Wuhan. It has supplied everything from the broadcast system for Beijing’s “Bird’s Nest"" stadium to the fire-safety equipment for the Terracotta Warriors museum in Xi’an.

It supplies components including flight-control and navigation systems for the Comac C919 China’s first commercial jetliner designed to rival Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. In 2018 it agreed to help a string of state-owned industrials including Sinochem Corp. and China Baowu Steel Group Corp. to modernize by digitizing and automating their factories. And it is helping to build a new petrochemical-processing complex in eastern China as the country overhauls its industrial infrastructure.

Honeywell was a pioneer in a localization approach that has since become something of a template for a number of other multinationals doing business in China according to James McGregor the head of consulting firm APCO Worldwide’s China business.

Numerous U.S. multinationals grew stronger in China even as the broader Beijing-Washington relationship crumbled during the Trump years of trade war and efforts to pry apart the two economies.

Walmart Inc. began a major China expansion in 2019. Starbucks Inc. opened over 500 Chinese stores last year. Comcast Corp.’s Universal Studios pressed ahead with building a $6.5 billion Beijing theme park which opened in September.

In some cases Honeywell has advanced in China in areas that might have proved controversial back home.

A decade ago it helped Huawei Technologies Co.—now subject to U.S. sanctions—build three gas pipelines linking western China and Central Asia. Building on that partnership the two companies said in 2017 that they would collaborate globally on smart-building technology.

It also set up a branch in Xinjiang where the rounding up of Uyghur Muslims in camps has prompted severe U.S. sanctions. In one of its deals there Honeywell agreed in 2017 to supply security services with protective equipment.

Honeywell has since wound up both its Huawei and Xinjiang activities for commercial reasons said Mr. Tedjarati. No U.S. or Chinese officials have ever told him the company should do or should avoid doing specific things in China he said.

The company has also openly supported China’s Belt and Road Initiative an ambitious global infrastructure program that is viewed with suspicion in the West and has run a program to help Chinese companies expand abroad.

Those partners have rewarded Honeywell’s support with lucrative contracts including recent deals to supply a range of technologies to a new port complex in Saudi Arabia and a petrochemicals facility in Brunei.

It is becoming harder for multinationals to avoid controversy. “What looks good in China may look bad in the U.S. It’s a minefield"" said APCO’s Mr. McGregor.

“There’s one bipartisan issue in Washington right now and only one"" he added. “The idea that China’s a bad actor.""

As an industrial supplier rather than a consumer company Honeywell is relatively insulated from the kind of public backlash that has hit foreign brands including Burberry Hennes & Mauritz AB and Tesla Inc. in China in recent months though in 2019 it appeared in jeopardy when the People’s Daily the Communist Party’s official news outlet named Honeywell as one of several U.S. companies that faced possible blacklisting by Beijing over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.

Honeywell which had supplied engines for tanks protested that it had delivered equipment directly to the US government and had no control over the Taiwan deal. It was omitted from a subsequent list of sanctioned US defense companies that China published a year ago.

Honeywell has generally managed to retain its status as a kind of corporate exemplar in both countries.

When he toured a Honeywell plant in Phoenix in May of 2020 former President Donald Trump praised the company for making face masks on U.S. soil. That same month China’s premier spoke highly of Honeywell after it opened a new research-and-development facility in Wuhan helping the city normalize several months after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“I shouldn’t do any commercial promotion for any company"" the premier Li Keqiang said in his once-a-year press briefing. “But I highly appreciate this move.""

Honeywell was a peripheral player in China when Mr. Tedjarati previously a consultant for Deloitte first took charge.

On his first day “I got into the office—there was about a half inch of dust on my desk"" Mr. Tedjarati recalled. That air of neglect extended to the bottom line: Honeywell’s local revenues were barely budging at a time when the Chinese economy was growing at 10% or more a year and “nobody knew if we were profitable or not"" he said.

Managers were targeting only a small share of the China market and the company was plagued by knockoffs. One Honeywell unit Garrett Motion which produced vehicle turbochargers was being especially targeted by Chinese copycats. “In 2004 we had 100 Garrett look-alikes we had Carrett Farrett Parrett Tarrett—you name it"" he recalled. “All at 40% of our cost and 50% of our capability. And they sold well.""

Mr. Tedjarati decided that rather than resorting to the standard practice of legal action Honeywell would instead copy the copycats.

He saw that local rivals weren’t just mindlessly replicating Honeywell’s technology; they were producing local versions in response to feedback from Chinese businesses that bought the equipment. “I realized those guys would go and sit with the clients"" Mr. Tedjarati said. “We would do desktop research; they had a desk at the client’s factory.""

So Mr. Tedjarati asked his local team to develop a no-frills version of its turbocharger that was roughly half the price of the company’s global equivalent. It was disastrous for the imitators. “Of those 100 local players only three survived and they became our suppliers"" he said.

Such experiences led Honeywell to stop viewing China as an outsourcing base but rather as a market in its own right. Mr. Tedjarati began benchmarking Honeywell’s performance against Chinese rivals rather than against other multinationals. “We studied the locals and we said we’re going to do better than them"" he said. “The company became energized.""

Overhauling Honeywell’s sales team was another urgent task.

Salespeople were put through a rigorous recruitment process but most interviews were conducted over the phone by American executives. “So naturally the people who made it were the ones with better English but they had no idea about industrial sales."" Mr. Tedjarati eliminated English as a job requirement and ensured that all interviews were conducted in Chinese.

Some U.S. executives initially resisted but eventually accepted the change—when “our sales productivity went through the roof"" he said.

Mr. Tedjarati acknowledged that the business environment has become “more constricted"" amid sour U.S.-China ties though he doesn’t think multinationals’ heyday in the country is over. Provided both American and Chinese politicians focus on the benefits of cooperation U.S. companies that stay committed to China can still reap huge rewards he said.

U.S. companies have a significant role to play in helping China to address societal problems he argued. “China’s climate challenge is huge"" he said. “China’s food-security challenge is huge.""

He also dismissed criticism that U.S. companies should refrain from supporting strategic programs like the C919 jetliner. There’s no stopping a country of China’s scale from building its aerospace capabilities once it chooses to do so he said and U.S. companies should participate and share in the rewards rather than excluding themselves on principle. That is safe so long as they are careful to protect their intellectual property he said. Honeywell’s work on the C919 has supported hundreds of high-quality jobs at the company’s facilities in Arizona and Kansas Mr. Tedjarati said.

He said that while Honeywell’s success in China may have benefited the Chinese the biggest winners have been its mostly American shareholders. “We went from a $20 billion market cap to a $160 billion market cap and China played a big role in that"" Mr. Tedjarati said.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

However chip shortage and supply crunch have somewhat dented their plans to make a significant mark to date.

According to industry experts the issue with smartphone makers entering the laptop category is two-fold.

The first one is a massive supply crunch in the laptop component market and only big brands are able to get volume and supplies.

The other factor is that the traditional players are very strong in the consumer laptop market. Top 3 players control more than 70 per cent of the market and strong portfolio distribution and channel reach as well as brand marketing has helped them massively.

""New brands can surely make a dent in the consumer laptop market but are challenged by supply issues right now. Watch out for them in 2022 as and when supply situation eases up"" Navkendar Singh Research Director Client Devices & IPDS IDC India told IANS.

Dominated by HP Inc Lenovo and Dell the traditional PC market (inclusive of desktops notebooks and workstations) in India continued to be robust as the shipments grew by 50.5 per cent year-over-year (YoY) in the second quarter (Q2) according to IDC.

Notebook PCs continue to hold more than three-fourth share in the overall category and grew 49.9 per cent YoY in 2Q21 reporting a fourth consecutive quarter with over 2 million units. Desktops also indicated a recovery as shipments grew 52.3 per cent YoY after recording the lowest shipments of the decade in 2Q20.

According to Prabhu Ram Head Industry Intelligence Group CMR driven by the pandemic and the associated accelerated pivot to remote work learn and unwind culture PCs have been witnessing heightened demand.

""Despite the current supply chain constraints PCs are here to stay in the new never normal. In the run-up to the festive season established PC market leaders will continue to leverage their brand salience and gain market share"" Ram told IANS.

""On the other hand there is a niche market for those new market entrants that are able to differentiate themselves from the competition in terms of features and value.

""Alongside they would need to back it with strong brand messaging to create awareness and recall amongst the target consumers"" Ram added.

HP maintained its lead in the India PC market with a 33.6 per cent share as its shipments grew 54.2 per cent annually. Dell Technologies continued to hold the second position with a 22.1 per cent share and an impressive 86.1 per cent YoY growth in 2Q21.

Lenovo maintained the third position with a share of 17.8 per cent in 2Q21.

Arvind Suraj Research Fellow Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said that there is always a trust issue with new brands.

""You won't buy a laptop in 6 or 7 months just like smartphones. In this case we often go for existing players. Brands like Lenovo HP ASUS and Acer have already gained our trust"" he said.

New Delhi: Escorts Limited founded by Har Prasad Nanda operates in the sectors of agricultural machinery construction machinery material handling and railway equipment. Headquartered in Faridabad Haryana it was once a takeover target of London-based non-resident Indian (NRI) businessman Lord Swaraj Paul. But Paul's attempts of getting control of Escorts were thwarted by HP Nanda who fought a long-drawn legal battle against the government which was at that time run by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and RBI with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh being at the helm of it. Although Paul won the court case he later sold Escort shares which he had bought in 1983 with an intention to take control of the company back to HP Nanda. Here is how the story goes.

In the 1982-83 Budget then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced that NRI investors (both individuals and companies) could buy shares of Indian companies subject to certain provisions. It was done with the intent to attract investment from wealthy NRIs.

During those times many promoters were owning less than 10% stake in their company with a major chunk being held by state-owned entities like LIC and GIC. So Escorts was no different. HP Nanda was running the company with a stake of 7.5% and nearly 56% of the company's shares were owned by state-owned entities. Taking benefit of this Swaraj Paul bought nearly 10% stake in Escorts. A similar attempt was also made by Paul to take control of DCM.

Realising that this game was being played at a higher level and Paul can not do this alone without the government's support HP Nanda sought out everyone of influence in Delhi: Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee. P.C. Alexander. L.K. Jha and M. Narasimham secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs. But officials said that there was no evidence that NRIs were doing the buying. Most important Mukherjee also assured that none of the PSU entities are selling Escorts' shares to NRIs but he refused to consider suggestions to limit NRI investment in shares of Indian companies or to deny them voting rights suggestions that the industrialists had made. ""You can't expect me to make a U-turn on this"" he told Nanda at one of several meetings.

Nanda then realised that other measures were necessary to stop the hostile takeover. He called an emergency meeting of the Escorts board of directors which armed itself with the power to refuse to register the transfer of share ownership to Paul.

This was possible under Escorts's articles of association as well as under the Companies Act and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act for specified reasons. Nanda then went on to make a public offer to buy his company's shares from any shareholder who was tempted to sell his holdings as Escorts' share price nearly doubled to Rs 70 at that time.

Also to reduce speculation in his shares he asked that his shares be traded only against instant cash payments ruling out forward transactions which at that time permitted delaying payment up to a maximum of 90 days. Finally he told Escorts's 3000 ancillary units and equally numerous dealers that they might have to give him support by buying Escorts shares. Nanda said he did not have the capacity to compete with Paul in a price war. But he built this company. ""And when the wolf is at my throat I will fight with all the resources I have"" he said.

At that time Paul was buying shares of Escorts in the names of companies he used to run in Britain. Government policies allowed share investments by overseas companies that are 60% owned by non-residents; Paul at that time had more than 60% ownership in some of his companies. In his budget on Frebruary 28 1983 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee announced sweeping tax concessions that virtually made the country a tax haven for non-residents of all hues. The income tax was slashed to a flat 22.5% and complete exemption was provided from wealth and gift taxes. Paul however started buying shares of Escorts a month earlier in January. At that time a question was raised by industrialists to which there was no answer: did Paul know of the budget measures in advance?

A memorandum was then circulated by both DCM and Escorts: ""Black money - whether emanating from under-invoicing over-invoicing or otherwise - could flow back into India under the guise of non-resident investments.... Control of Indian companies can be secured by various kinds of illegal operators and even sometimes foreign governments through agencies such as CIA.""

Legal pundits then argued that by terming even people with foreign passports as ""non-resident Indians"" the government had flouted various laws notably the foreign Exchange Regulations Act (FERA) which does not distinguish between foreign foreigners and Indian foreigners.

Delegations of industrialists including such heavyweights as J.R.D. Tata K.N. Modi and FICCI President Ashok Jain put their view across to the finance minister after they were denied a meeting with Indira Gandhi.

The campaign was pursued through every available forum. The press was briefed members of Parliament raised the issue and demanded clarifications and even overseas Indians were roped into the act. In London a newly formed International Forum for Overseas Indians (an obvious rival to Swraj Paul's Indo-British Association) organised a meeting where influential non-residents criticised destabilising take-overs.

Finally after hectic lobbying by Nanda and other industrialists Paul backed out. Pranab Mukherjee in his book The Turbulent Years 1980-1996 wrote “Finally in early 1986 Finance Secretary S. Venkitaramanan; Additional Secretary in the PMO Gopi Arora; and Minister of State for Defence (and a good friend of Rajiv’s) Arun Singh mediated between the concerned parties and persuaded Swraj Paul to sell his shares back to the Shri Rams and the Nandas at a mutually agreed price.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvc2hpbWxhL3RocmVlLXRyZWtrZXJzLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1ocC1yZXNjdWUtb24tZm9yLTEwLTc1ODg1Mjcv0gFqaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NpdGllcy9zaGltbGEvdGhyZWUtdHJla2tlcnMta2lsbGVkLWluLWhwLXJlc2N1ZS1vbi1mb3ItMTAtNzU4ODUyNy9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three trekkers killed in HP rescue on for 10,"Three trekkers from Mumbai and Goa died at Barua village of Kinnaur district on Sunday.

The U.S. ice dancers maintained their lead from Saturday’s rhythm dance and won the first Grand Prix of the figure skating season with a total of 209.54 points. They edged teammates and training mates Madison Chock and Evan Bates who were second both days to take the silver with 208.23.

“I couldn’t be happier with the performance today” Hubbell said. “Some days you take inspiration from different things whether it be the work you put in at home or that my mom is in the stands. Something clicked this morning and I really wanted to skate for myself and be there with Zach.

“I think we both accomplished that goal and in doing so accomplished the other goal of taking home the gold.”

Russia’s Alexandra Trusova won Skate America's women's event in dominant fashion and needed only one quadruple jump to do so.

Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Sorenson got bronze (190.13) in ice dance just as they had at both their Grand Prix assignments two seasons ago; the Canadians did not have any Grand Prix opportunities last season due to the pandemic.

The top four teams including Spain’s Olivia Smart and Adrian Diaz (189.69) are coached by Marie-France Dubreuil Patrice Lauzon and Romain Haguenauer at the Ice Academy of Montreal.

Hubbell and Donohue fourth at their Olympic debut four years ago have vowed this will be their final season meaning they will retire from competition after either the Beijing Olympics in February or the world championships in March.

They are the only ice dance team to medal at each of the last three world championships and are among the favorites to reach the Olympic podium.

Their win at Orleans Arena is their fourth in a row at Skate America tying them with 2014 Olympic champions and fellow Americans Meryl Davis and Charlie White for the longest ice dance win streak in the event’s history.

Trusova started the Olympic season with the greatest margin of victory in the women’s event in 13 years. Her total of 232.37 points was more than 15 ahead of countrywoman Daria Usacheva the 15-year-old taking silver at her Grand Prix debut.

“I’m pleased with my performances here in this competition but obviously I would like to have a higher degree of difficulty in both my short and free programs” Trusova said through a translator.

Trusova has included three four or five quads -- a jump practically unheard of for women a handful of years ago - in every other free skate in her career as a senior skater.

She joked that doing only one quad in this program for the first time felt like a day of rest.

“When I came to this competition we wanted to skate three quads but it didn’t really work because of my injury and we lost a lot of practice time.”

Her next competition is NHK Trophy Nov. 12-14 in Tokyo where a strong finish would qualify her for December’s Grand Prix Final.

Korea’s Young You the 2020 Four Continents silver medalist was third at 216.97 points and Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto 2018 Four Continents champion was fourth with 215.93.

They held off a potential Russian sweep as Kseniia Sinitsyna who was third after Saturday’s short program finished fifth with several under-rotated jumps.

Amber Glenn was the top American in sixth after reigning U.S. champion and 2018 Olympian Bradie Tennell withdrew last week with injury.

Known as a “quad queen” the 17-year-old Trusova is dealing with a foot injury and included just one of the impressive jumps in her “Cruella” free skate still winning with ease.

Why are these two still wrapped up with each other anyway?

Nowhere else in America does a charity like Bremer Trust own a bank like Bremer Financial. Meanwhile at a time of fast sweeping change in how people use banks Bremer Financial's ability to adapt seems constrained by the trust's ownership.

But the bank's top executives don't mind. Aided by the Minnesota Attorney General's Office the bank has spent $20 million over the last two years arguing to a state judge against the trust's attempt to sell it.

""I'd always heard that Bremer can never be sold"" Jeanne Crain the bank's chief executive said in testimony at an evidentiary hearing that concluded Friday.

The relationship ties up Bremer Financial in another way. Because it's obligated to deliver profits to the trust the bank has less capital on hand to make acquisitions of its own. And it can't raise capital in the stock market the way a publicly listed bank could.

The two entities were formed by the same entrepreneur Otto Bremer a German immigrant who used the fortune he made as a co-owner in the Schmidt Brewing Co. in St. Paul to buy stakes in rural banks in the 1920s and 1930s.

The childless Bremer decided in the late 1940s to create a foundation that would inherit his bank interests — which sprawled across Minnesota Wisconsin North Dakota and Montana — and give the profits to charities in those places.

""This relationship is an important part of Bremer's identity it's one of our differentiators and we are proud of it"" Bremer Financial said in a statement.

""Bremer Bank is an asset to its communities and has been an important part of the work of the trust over the last 75 years"" the trust said in a statement. ""As was extensively documented in the hearing we did not go looking for the circumstances we find ourselves in.""

In the 1944 document establishing the foundation Otto Bremer wrote that trustees could sell the bank holdings under ""unforeseen circumstances"" that they determined but he gave no further guidance. He appointed three colleagues in his original bank to be trustees of the charitable foundation and gave them the right to pick their successors.

Today Otto Bremer Trust is led by three descendants of the original trustees — Charlotte Johnson Brian Lipschultz and Daniel Reardon. Their attempt to split the trust from the bank is akin to what happens when second- and third-generation descendants of a family-run business gain control. Often less interested in the original business children and grandchildren of company founders will sell it off take the money and try something else.

The trust's own growth prospects are constrained by the connection to the bank. Bremer Financial is the trust's largest asset accounting for more than 90% of its total. The trustees' attempt to monetize the bank by forcing a sale in 2019 resulted in the current court case.

With the evidentiary hearing now complete Ramsey County District Judge Robert Awsumb is likely to take a few months to decide whether to remove the trustees from their jobs as the Attorney General's Office is seeking.

No matter what he does the fundamental tension and mutual constraints in the Bremer relationship are likely to continue.

In 2014 trustees renamed what had been known as the Otto Bremer Foundation to the Otto Bremer Trust. They sought a more direct connection to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis which oversees banking in the Upper Midwest and tried to assert a greater role in the affairs of the bank.

The newest trustee Lipschultz a grandson of one of the original trustees took a particularly aggressive tack after joining the trust in 2012. Testimony and documents in the court hearing showed he worried that Bremer Financial which has about 80 bank branches wasn't large enough to absorb growing technology costs.

And when Crain notified the trustees in spring 2019 that Great Western Bancshares a South Dakota bank nearly Bremer's size expressed interest in discussing a merger of equals Lipschultz quickly started talking to advisers about selling the bank outright.

Brian Lipschultz front and Daniel Reardon both Bremer Trust trustees in a file photo taken near the start of the 18-day evidentiary hearing at the Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul.

""You can be absolutely sure they will never open the door to an outright sale. But we will"" he texted an investment banker shortly before the Bremer Financial board first heard of the trustees' intention to do just that.

Congress tried to eliminate interference by the descendants of business founders and their associates with the Tax Reform Act of 1969. The law required foundations to sell controlling interests in companies or lose their tax-exempt status.

For decades business founders and their families used such foundations to prevent their investments from being taxed and abuses grew. For instance in the late 1940s a New York University alumnus donated a pasta company to the school which then tried to apply its tax-exempt status on the business.

""Ford Rockefeller Kellogg and a whole raft of others got caught with these single holdings in their foundations"" said Paul Olson former president of the Blandin Foundation the Grand Rapids Minn. charity started by paper mill owner Charles K. Blandin. ""They wanted to maintain control of the company while they got the charitable deductions and could direct where the money went.""

After the federal law passed the Otto Bremer Foundation tried to sell its stake in Bremer Bank but it found no buyers. As early as 1976 Bremer executives — the foundation and bank were so intertwined at the time that one person led both — reached out to about 30 different prospective buyers. They ranged from banks in Canada Montana and Texas to investor groups in Taiwan and the Middle East documents in the current hearing showed.

In 1989 when the government deadline for compliance with the 1969 tax law arrived Bremer executives alighted on a different strategy. They created two classes of stock a maneuver used by tech startups and other firms so founders can retain voting control through one class while using the other class to raise capital.

Bremer flipped that structure. Because the 1969 law forbade the trust from exerting control over the banking business the trust got all of the non-voting shares and 20% of the voting ones. Together the two classes left the trust with a 92% ownership stake in the bank. The attorney general and court monitor the trust under laws governing charities.

After that 1989 reorganization the balance of power in the relationship swung to the bank's executives responsible for its day-to-day operations and the profits that fueled the trust. In the three decades since Bremer Financial has delivered nearly $1 billion of its profits to the trust. The trust in turn has distributed nearly all of that to hundreds of charities.

But there have been several years since 2000 and as recently as 2016 when the bank didn't deliver the minimum level of profits needed by the trust for it to both maintain its asset base and comply with tax laws that require it to give away 5% of its asset value annually.

In court Crain and other executives showed forecasts that Bremer Financial would be able to meet those minimums through the 2020s.

Even so funding uncertainty is one reason the trustees are eager to diversify the trust's assets.

When the Great Western opportunity arose in 2019 the three trustees quickly began looking at various sale options for Bremer Financial. Just two months into their exploration they told Bremer Financial's board they would only accept an outright sale of the company because that would be most lucrative to the trust.

A sale however would likely mean the ouster of Crain other executives and employees throughout Bremer Financial. Just days after that ultimatum Bremer Financial hired takeover defense attorneys and battle lines quickly hardened.

In court attorneys never directly asked Crain why she was so opposed to a sale. But when questioned about the prospect that even the merger-of-equals with Great Western might lead to layoffs at the bank she replied that Bremer might not have done it for that reason.

Directors at family-owned and community banks often consider the effect on employees when looking at deals said Mike Iannaccone a Chicago-based investment banker who specializes in the banking industry.

""Most people would put investors first"" he said. ""But when this type of board is looking at it they're typically looking at customers first their employees second their communities third and then shareholders.""

The hearing revealed that Bremer Financial executives continued to receive interest from other prospective partners or buyers even while they were splitting with trustees in fall 2019.

One of them was TCF Financial which had merged with a Michigan bank earlier in 2019 and has since been acquired by Huntington Bancshares of Ohio.

Great Western the bank whose outreach led to the fracture of the Bremer entities last month agreed to a merger of equals with Montana-based First Interstate Bank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9MZWFkZXJzaGlwLU1pZGxhbmQtU3VwcG9ydGluZy1TcG9uc29ycy0xNjU1NjUwOC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leadership Midland Supporting Sponsors -- 2021 Program,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Leadership-Midland-Supporting-Sponsors-16556508.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9MZWFkZXJzaGlwLU1pZGxhbmQtU3VwcG9ydGluZy1TcG9uc29ycy0xNjU1NjUwOC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Jupiter Island - Christopher F. Smith age 86 living in Jupiter Island Florida and Yellville Arkansas died August 24 2021. Born in New York on June 15 1935 he attended Kent Preparatory School (1954) then Union College (1959).

After beginning his working career in New York Chris lived in Japan for 9 years Brussels Belgium for 11 years and Bellevue Washington for 9 years. He lived on Jupiter Island since 1990. Prior to his retirement he spent 10 years with IBM 18 years with ITT and 7 years with Microsoft primarily in computers software international management and startups.

Chris started his career with IBM developing the first computer monitor and developing the first computer graphics. Chris then joined ITT as VP of ITT Data Services then VP of ITT's Far East and Pacific division living in Tokyo then Director of Industrial Products and Computers living in Brussels.

The capstone of Chris' career was as VP of Microsoft International helping Microsoft expand its international presence working closely with William (Bill) Gates. This included opening and managing Microsoft offices and subsidiaries in Europe Asia the Far East the Pacific Central and South America Russia and the Middle East. Chris managed startups in 15 countries and managed most of the 30 countries that comprised Microsoft international.

Chris was very passionate about his beloved Jupiter Island (JI) serving his community in many ways after his retirement. He was the President of the JI Residents Association the chairman of the JI Board of Adjustment the VP of the JI Historical Society and served on the Hurricane Executive Committee for the Town of JI managing the town's computerized hurricane alert system. It was in this capacity that he became very well known by his nickname ""Hurricane Smith"". Sending out regular weather forecasting and hurricane alerts to the community ensuring everyone was prepared for potential storms nearing JI. In doing so he worked very closely with the Chief of Public Safety Bob Garlo and Mayor Whit Pidot both of whom he considered close friends. Chris also served on the board of the JI Impact Review Committee the board of the Hobe Sound Community Chest and on the board of the Hobe Sound Nature Center.

Security privacy and smart cities,"Sign up for our news brief today free.

As networks get speedier and devices become capable of more complex processing municipalities have seen a new application for technology: smart cities in which significant portions of the infrastructure are networked automated or both. Sensors artificial intelligence cameras and more can interconnect in a vast web that — in theory — eases the workload for humans takes the guesswork out of planning and makes communities safer. With new opportunities come new threats though. Security holes and the potential for privacy violations have some people convinced that caution is the smartest thing going.

Smart cities are a major element of the urban future. A recent study by Easy Park found at least 150 cities worldwide scored a 50 or above on its 100-point scale of intelligence. London Paris New York Singapore and San Francisco were among the leaders but even communities that didn’t make the list are now implementing smart features.

Las Vegas for instance is using digital twins paired with roadwork and augmented by artificial intelligence models to predict traffic jams before they happen. Police in Washington D.C. are turning to video and data analysis to detect cases that community resources might handle better while a traffic light system in San Jose spots emergency vehicles and turns the lights ahead of them green. Innovations like these can make a big difference to cities’ safety and efficiency.

They also have immense potential to create problems. Data and video analysis could constitute significant privacy violations and pairing them with law enforcement may be a recipe for trouble given recent revelations about bias and overreach in police departments. Hacking constitutes an even more immediate threat: The digital twin system managing Las Vegas traffic could produce rather than avoid traffic jams while San Jose’s automated traffic lights could be lethal if compromised. Power water and internet all are additional tempting targets for malicious users from terrorists to those making ransomware demands.

Many cities in their enthusiastic adoption of smart technology have left themselves unprepared for the concerns that it raises. An IBM Security report in 2018 revealed that passwords for devices such as traffic signals or sensors are often very easy for potential hackers to figure out and that remote connections for a significant number are completely unsecured. Some problems may have been resolved more recently but not all: The World Economic Forum reported in July that most digitally advanced cities have yet to designate central cybersecurity authorities.

As concern about security grows in the US and around the world organizations are increasingly considering ways to specifically address threats to smart cities. Representatives from the National Cybersecurity Center say that certification might be one step toward making cities of the future safer. Its potential system would evaluate both software and devices to spot potential entry points for hackers and the program would also give city officials configuration advice.

The balance between convenience and security has always been tricky. It’s a constant theme in the history of technology. The advances that make our lives easier often make malicious actions easier as well. With smart cities on the rise around the world governments and industry must move swiftly to ensure that safety gets enough weight on the scales this time.

AI Certification

For those interested in obtaining skills in the artificial intelligence (AI) field one option is to pursue an AI certification.

AI certification programs provide an overview of the major areas in artificial intelligence and a test to show competence. For employers an AI certificate provides third-party ratification of a candidate’s basic knowledge and skills related to AI development.

Most curriculums focus on the programming and math behind the fundamental topics within AI with a heavy emphasis on machine learning (ML) deep learning (DL) natural language processing (NLP) and their practical applications.

Certificate programs vary in the number of courses required to obtain certification experience required to participate prerequisites and specific topics covered. These differences may lead to some confusion about certificate types so those who obtain a certificate should be prepared to explain what it covers.

Artificial intelligence education currently lacks standardization but standards for AI definitions ethics and education have been proposed by the European Union Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and International Organization for Standardization.

Artificial Intelligence Certifications Today

To be successful in studying AI students typically need a fundamental knowledge in:

Python programming: most assignments will be to write programs in this language. most assignments will be to write programs in this language.

College calculus and linear algebra: especially multivariable derivatives matrix notation vector notation and common operations.

Probability theory: basic distributions basic functions and fundamental definitions such as expectation independence and dependence.

Organizations that certify in artificial intelligence fall into four main categories: vendors technology associations universities and education platforms. Each backs the credibility for their credentials in different ways and certifies different aspects of AI knowledge.

Vendors

Specialty certificates for specific platforms — such as Microsoft Azure Google Cloud and IBM Cloud — or for AI subcategories such as machine learning are available from several major AI companies.

See more: Machine Learning (ML) Certifications

Associations

Technology associations such as the Artificial Intelligence Board of America (ARTiBA) and the United States Artificial Intelligence Institute (USAII) do not teach classes. Instead they offer study guides and tests that allow those with a basic understanding of AI to pass a test and obtain a credential.

Universities

Many universities offer degrees and certifications in AI such as Stanford Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Northwestern University University of Oxford University of California Berkeley The University of Texas at Austin and more. These certificates cost significantly more than technology association certificates but they also offer classes student networking and access to professors.

Education Platforms

AI certifications are available at many online education platforms such as Coursera edX Google LinkedIn Learning Udacity and Udemy. The courses are run by various organizations. For example MIT runs a course on Emeritus.org Great Learning offers a course run by the University of Texas and Coursera features certificates by IBM Stanford and CertNexus.

Now I turn to the question of Chinese character output — monitors printers and related peripherals — where still more challenges confronted engineers seeking to render Western-manufactured personal computers and computer peripherals compatible with Chinese character text.

While we call them “peripherals” suggesting a sort of supporting role they are in fact at the very center of computing in Chinese from the extreme limitations that Chinese computing faced in the 1970s and 80s to the immense strides and successes it has experienced from the 1990s onward.

During the early rise of consumer PCs in the 1980s no Western-manufactured personal computer printer monitor operating system or other peripheral was capable of handling Chinese character input or output — not “out of the box” at least. To the contrary all of these devices exhibited the same kind of English-language and Latin alphabetic bias found in for example the early history of telegraphic codes and mechanical typewriters as I’ve explored in my other research.

During the 1980s what ensued in China and the Chinese-speaking world was a period of intense hacking and modding. Element by element engineers in China and elsewhere rendered Western-manufactured computing hardware and software compatible with Chinese. It was a messy decentralized and often brilliant period of experimentation and innovation.

When we turn our attention to this broader ecology of computing — on printers monitors and all of the other “stuff” needed to make computing work — part two of this series on Chinese computing spotlights two conclusions.

First the dominance of alphabet-based computing — “alphabetic order” as I call it — went far beyond the question of keyboards and computer memory. Like the typewriter before them computing devices languages and protocols were by and large invented first in English-language contexts and only later “extended” to other languages and to writing systems other than the Latin alphabet. To achieve even basic functionality Chinese engineers needed to constantly push against the boundaries of off-the-shelf computing peripherals hardware and software.

Second I’ll dismantle the oversimplified idea of Chinese “copycatting” and “piracy” that has dominated then as now Western accounts of Chinese computing during this pivotal period in the late 1970s and 1980s. When encountering programs such as “Chinese DOS” the knee-jerk reaction in the Western world has been to treat them as just more “Chinese knock-offs.” What this simplistic narrative fails to understand is that without the kinds of “forgeries” we will examine in this article none of these Western-designed software suites would have worked at all in the context of Chinese character computing.

Dot-matrix printing and the metallurgical depths of alphabetic order

The first peripheral we need to examine is the printer — specifically dot-matrix printers. From the standpoint of Chinese computing the politics of dot-matrix printing began with the then-dominant configurations of industry standard printer heads — the nine-pin printer heads found in practically all mass-manufactured dot-matrix printers during the 1970s.

These commercial dot-matrix printers were able to produce low-resolution Latin alphabet bitmaps with just one pass of the printer head. This was not by accident of course. Rather the choice of nine pins was “tuned” to the needs of low-resolution Latin alphabetic printing.

The same printer heads however were incapable of printing low-resolution Chinese character bitmaps in anything less than two full passes of the printer head. Two-pass printing dramatically increased the time needed to print Chinese as compared to English and also introduced graphical inaccuracies whether due to inconsistencies in the advancement of the platen uneven ink registration paper jams or otherwise.

Aesthetically two-pass printing could also result in characters with differing ink densities on their upper versus their lower halves. Worse in the absence of any mod all Chinese characters would be at least twice the height of English words no matter the font size being used. This created comically distorted printouts in which English words appeared austere and economical while Chinese characters appeared grotesquely oversized. Such printouts also wasted large amounts of paper with every document looking something like a large-print children’s book.

An example illustration of how these printer heads work is provided in this video courtesy of the author:

Latin alphabet-centrism ran deeper than one might initially expect moreover as illustrated in the work of early Chinese computing pioneer Chan Yeh. Setting out to digitize Chinese characters and basing his system on a bitmap grid of 18 by 22 Yeh’s initial idea was an obvious one: to reduce the diameter of the pins so as to fit more of them on the printer head. As he discovered however the solution would not be so simple.

The Latin alphabetic bias of impact printing he found was encoded within the very metallurgical properties of printer components. Simply put the metal alloys used to fabricate printer pins were themselves calibrated to nine-pin Latin alphabetic printing such that reducing their diameters to the sizes needed for Chinese would result in pin deformation or breakage.

To compensate engineers tricked Western-built printers into fitting as many as 18 dots in roughly the same amount of vertical space as nine normally spaced dots.

Their technique was ingenious and simple. Following standard two-pass printing an initial array of dots was laid down during the first pass of the printing head. Rather than laying down this second array of dots beneath the first however they tricked the printer into registering them in between the first set of nine dots almost like the teeth of a zipper fastening together.

To achieve this effect engineers rewrote printer drivers to hack the printer’s paper advance mechanism refining it so that it rotated at an extremely small interval (as small as 1/216th of an inch).

Pin configurations weren’t the only challenge. Commercially produced dot-matrix printers were also tuned to the ASCII character encoding system and thus unable to handle Chinese text as text. In English-language word processing printing was not an act of transmitting a raster image to the printer. Rather English-language text could be directly delivered via the printer driver as ASCII-encoded text which resulted in much faster printer speeds.

In order for Western-built dot-matrix printers to print Chinese characters however there was no way to use these printers’ “text” mode. Instead the printers once again had to be tricked this time in order to print Chinese characters using the graphics mode typically reserved for printing raster images.

For students of the Chinese language the irony here will be apparent: in order for Chinese characters to function on early Western-built dot-matrix printers Chinese characters had to treated as pictures or pictographs. Pictographs were something that Westerners had long assumed Chinese characters to be even though they are not (with few exceptions). But in the context of dot-matrix printing “pictographs” were indeed what they had no choice but to become.

Eventually a new family of impact printers began to be released on the commercial market: 24-pin dot-matrix printers featuring pin diameters of 0.2 mm (as compared to 0.34 mm on nine-pin printers). Unsurprisingly the leading manufacturers of these new printers were largely Japanese companies such as Panasonic NEC Toshiba Okidata and more. Given the need to print characters required by the Japanese language Japanese engineers needed to solve similar challenges as their Chinese counterparts.

Pop-up modernity: Chinese character monitors

Yet another domain within the ecology of Chinese computing was that of mass-manufactured computer monitors. In certain respects the politics of monitors were similar to those of printers particularly with regards to the issue of character distortion. Unavoidably even the lowest-resolution Chinese character bitmaps occupied upwards of twice the vertical and horizontal space of Latin alphabetic letters making the Chinese in bilingual texts appear comically oversized (such as can be seen in this story’s featured image).

Standard Western-manufactured computer monitors could also fit a far smaller number of Chinese characters on screen than Latin letters both in terms of line length (the number of characters per line) and depth (the number of lines per screen). Chinese language users could thus see only small portions of their texts at any one time.

Then there were challenges unique to Chinese character display: the pop-up menu. Because of the inherently iterative process of Chinese input in which users are constantly being presented with Chinese characters that fulfill the criteria provided by their keystrokes an essential feature of Chinese computing is a “window” — whether software-based or hardware-based — that enables the user to review these Chinese character candidates.

Although the pop-up menu is a ubiquitous feature of Chinese computing from the 1980s onward this feedback technique dates back to the 1940s. In a 1947 experimental Chinese typewriter designed by Lin Yutang there was a key component of the machine the inventor called his “Magic Eye”: in effect the first “pop-up menu” in history albeit a mechanical one.

With the advent of personal computers mechanical windows such as those found on the MingKwai Sinotype Sinowriter or otherwise were integrated into the computer’s main display. It became a software-governed “window” (or bar) on the screen rather than a separate physical device.

This pop-up menu placed further constraints on the already precious real estate of the computer monitor however. What we might term “pop-up menu design” became a critically important area of research and innovation within Chinese personal computing from its inception. Companies experimented with different menu styles formats and behaviors attempting to strike a balance between the requirements of input screen size and the preferences of users.

There were trade-offs to each option. Menus that displayed a larger number of character candidates at once increased the likelihood of more rapidly finding one’s desired graph but came at the cost of screen space. Smaller windows while less intrusive required the user to scroll through “pages” of character candidates if the user’s desired graph was not found amongst the top recommendations.

As a consequence of these strict limitations Chinese engineers and firms were constantly seeking next-generation monitors. While this was perhaps true for the global market at large — since higher resolution monitors represent something of an “inherent good” for consumers — nevertheless the motivating reasons for this hunger for high-resolution was dramatically different for the Chinese-language market.

Conclusion: No ESC

As brilliant as each of these mods might have been at the end of the day they remained just that: modifications. The autonomy and authority to create original systems — that is the systems that subsequently needed to be modified — was ultimately where power was concentrated.

While the practice of modding tended to lead to a wide array of systems it often came at the expense of interoperability. Modding required constant vigilance moreover — no one-time “set it and forget it” solution was possible.

With every new computer program released on the market — and every new version of every computer program — programmers in China had to “debug” them line by line insofar as programs themselves contained code that could set or reset parameters for the computer monitor for example.

For most English-language word processing programs for example the baseline assumption baked into such programs was a 25-by-80 character display format (zifu fangshi xianshi). Since this format was incompatible with Chinese character display engineers had to manually change every place in the program code where this 25-by-80 format was set. They did so tellingly enough using standard-issue “DEBUG” software. Through accumulated experience engineers steadily learned their way around the assembly code bowels of leading programs.

Once modded moreover underlying operating systems and programs could always change. Shortly after the development of CCDOS and other systems for example IBM announced its move to a new operating system: the OS/2. “China and Chinese-language have been thrown into turmoil” one article from 1987 wrote noting that no existing Chinese-language systems — whether in Taiwan or on the mainland — had yet to be adapted to it. “The race is on for developers to come up with the best match for IBM’s MS/DOS platform.”

From a historical perspective modders are vulnerable to misrecognition and erasure. In their time and place their work was often misrecognized as mere theft or piracy rather than as necessary acts of reengineering to render incompatible machines compatible with the Chinese language. In a January 1987 issue of PC Magazine for example one cartoonist lampooned Sinicized operating systems. “It Runs on MSG-DOS” the cartoon’s caption read.

As Western manufacturers slowly incorporated many of these Chinese mods into the core architectures of their systems (as well as Japanese and other non-Western ones) it is easy to forget that such changes were inspired by the work of engineers in China and the non-Western world. In sum it is all too easy to retroactively imagine that the Western-built computer has always been language-agnostic neutral and welcoming.

This critical period of computing history has gone completely unwritten and for a very simple reason. In the United States and the Western world more broadly none of these mods have been understood in terms of “experimentation” let alone “innovation.” Instead another set of words was — and continues to be — reserved for them: “copycatting” “mimickry” “piracy.” As Chinese engineers reverse-engineered Western-built dot-matrix printers enabling them to print Chinese characters; or retrofitted Western-designed operating systems to make possible the use of Chinese input method editors all that most Western observers could see was “theft.”"

The FDA’s September 21 2021 approval of ruxolitinib gave the dermatology community the first and only topical Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor in the United States for short-term non-continuous treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). It is approved for use by non-immunocompromised patients 12 years and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or if those therapies are not advisable wrote the FDA.2

“We have not had a real breakthrough in topical anti-inflammatories since hydrocortisone was introduced over 50 years ago--until now” said Zirwas noting that calcineurin inhibitors are immunosuppressive not anti-inflammatory.

Opzelura's approval gives physicians an alternative to steroids. That's particularly noteworthy at a time when patient concern about steroids' possible adverse effects (AEs) are impacting acceptance and adherence. Various recent studies have shown that anywhere from 31 to more than 97% of patients have some degree of steroid phobia.3

This novel topical also addressed a long-standing challenge. ""The complexity of prescribing high- medium- and low-potency steroids for the hands body and face respectively is a stumbling block to adherence"" Zirwas added.

Topical ruxolitinib can be used on the face hands and body. Zirwas pointed out that this one-stop-shop capability allows for a single treatment that works wherever AD is present simplifying the directions dermatologists need to give patients.

However these advances came with a caveat in the form of a black box warning outlining risks identified in an FDA review of the first-ever JAK inhibitor ever to receive FDA approval tofacitinib (Xeljanz Pfizer) which treats moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis.

The list of adverse effects (AEs) includes serious infection increased risk of heart attack or cardiac thrombosis cancer and pulmonary embolism.4

Zirwas pointed out that the reviews was based on an oral medication and that the warnings may be “overdone” for a topical. Zirwas noted that with a topical such as ruxolitinib about 6 to 10% of the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream an 80 to 90% reduction from the systemic absorption of ruxolitinib when given orally.

Because of that he added he doesn’t expect to see the risk of AEs such as thrombosis and infections seen with oral JAK inhibitors. He also said that ruxolitinib has been approved orally for a number of years for hematologic indications and for graft-versus-host disease.

“I could imagine it being the case that we'll find out 10 years from now that people who were using Opzelura had a really tiny increase in the risk of thrombotic events or a really tiny increase in in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or a really tiny increase in the rates of infection” he said.

“I could imagine that. I don't think it's going to be the case"" he added. ""I don't think there's enough systemic absorption that we're going to see any clinic clinically meaningful adverse AEs as a result but it is possible.”

We were able to exclusively get our hands on the first-ever benchmarks for Intel's upcoming Alder Lake mobility processors - which are going to go head to head against the Apple M1 Max processors clawing away market share as well as AMD's upcoming mobility chips. While we do not have the scores for AMD's next-generation mobility chips we do have the scores for the current generation x86 chips as well as the validated score for Apple's M1 Max.

Intel Core i9 12900HK mobility CPU benchmarked: faster than the Apple M1 Max 11980HK and AMD 5980HX

The Apple M1 Max is a fantastic chip and is going to push both AMD and Intel to perform at their very best. And while I doubt x86 architecture will ever beat ARM on power efficiency absolute power (within roughly comparable battery life) is another matter altogether. Geekbench has historically been a benchmark where Apple has reigned supreme (because it relies heavily on algorithmic optimizations) but it was still pretty awe-inspiring to see the Apple M1 Max score absolutely decimating everything x86 in-sight. It even managed to beat Intel's flagship desktop chip: the Intel Core i9 11900K.

Intel's upcoming Core i9 12900HK based on Intel 7 features an 8 + 6 Alder Lake architecture.

As tech enthusiasts would know Intel stumbled quite a bit on the 14nm process and has only recently recovered from this misadventure - meaning Apple chips for the past few years (and even AMD ones) have had a distinct node advantage. Beginning with Alder Lake however (which is built on Intel 7) this advantage is going to seriously diminish as Intel finally moves on to a sub 14nm node on its desktop side. The introduction of extremely power-efficient ""e-cores"" will further improve performance on the mobility side considering Alder Lake's big.SMALL design was purpose-built for mobility. Without any further ado here is the score of Intel's 12900HK Alder Lake Mobility flagship in Geekbench.

Intel Core i9 12900HK 'Alder Lake Mobility' Geekbench 5.4.1 Benchmark (Single-Core) Single-Core Score 0 400 800 1200 1600 2000 2400 0 400 800 1200 1600 2000 2400 Core i9 12900HK 1.9k Apple M1 Max 1.8k Core i9 11980HK 1.6k Ryzen 5980HX 1.5k

The Alder Lake's powerful p-cores effortlessly take the performance crown in the single-threaded benchmark with a score of 1851. To put this into perspective Apple's 5 nm-based M1 Max chip scores 1785 in single-threaded performance. The Core i9 11980HK (note: we found several overclocked and stock benchmarks for this processor on Geekbench but will be using 'stock' configurations considering our ADL score is also stock and makes for a like-for-like comparison) follows behind with a score of 1616 and AMD's best mobility chip clocks in at 1506. This means Intel has improved the single-threaded performance by 14.5% generation over generation.

Intel Core i9 12900HK 'Alder Lake Mobility' Geekbench 5.4.1 Benchmark (Multi-Core) Multi-Core Score 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 Core i9 12900HK 13.3k Apple M1 Max 12.8k Core i9 11980HK 9.1k Ryzen 5980HX 8.2k

Almost all of us expected Intel to win on the single-threaded front because of high clock rates and some serious architectural improvements but what is surprising is that they even beat the Apple M1 Max on the multi-threaded front. The Alder Lake Core i9 12900HK mobility processor gets an astounding 13256 score which is followed by Apple at 12753 points. The Intel 11980HK (stock) is further into the horizon at 9149 points and AMD clocks in at 8217 points. This is a generation over generation increase of almost 45% in roughly the same TDP - although not surprising because even though the ADL-P CPU only has 8 ""big cores"" the small cores have proven to be quite powerful as well.

Now keep in mind I have no qualms that Apple is still going to win on a power efficiency metric - they always have since the A11 - but Apple's reign as the fastest mobility chip ""period"" seems like it is going to be short-lived (we expect ADL-P to land in early 2022). Another important point to note here is that this benchmark was done using Windows 11 which allows Intel's brand new Thread Director technology to run - so some of these gains could be the result of better hardware scheduling as well.

In other words they won't work on Intel-powered Macs.



Differentiating the user experience like this isn't anything new to iOS users since each year the latest iPhone models boast features that aren't available on iPhones that Apple released the previous year.

Mac users on the other hand aren't so used to such fast-paced changes and the latest software-based depreciations could come as a shock to some. With the possible exception of Object Capture the following macOS Monterey features won't be available to anyone running the new software on an Intel Mac even if it was purchased from Apple only last year.



Portrait Mode in FaceTime

With Portrait mode in macOS Monterey you can blur your background during a FaceTime call so that the focus is on you rather than what's behind you. The feature is commonly used by other video conferencing apps like Zoom and Teams to obscure untidy domestic scenes and other sources of distraction or embarrassment. If you're using an Intel-powered Mac though it won't be an option.



Maps Interactive Globe

On Macs powered by M1 M1 Pro and M1 Max chips Apple has enhanced the Maps app to include a new globe view that allows you to spin the world around and zoom into different regions on Earth. In previous versions of macOS zooming out maximally in Maps would present you with a flat world map but the new globe view gives you a three-dimensional view of Earth from space that's a lot more fun to navigate.



More Detailed Cities in Maps



The globe also allows you to drill down into areas where you'll find more detailed information on vast geological features like mountain ranges deserts forests and oceans and more comprehensive maps in cities like San Francisco Los Angeles New York and London which includes details for elevation roads trees buildings landmarks and more. If you're using an Intel-based Mac this extra detail will be lacking.



Object Capture

Object Capture allows users to create a photo-realistic AR-optimized 3D object by stitching together a series of photographs. The technique is called photogrammetry which previously required specialized software to work out but with Monterey Apple has integrated its Object Capture API into macOS which makes the process faster and a whole lot easier when using an app that supports it.



For example using an app like PhotoCatch allows users to import a video or several photos of an object from several angles and with no additional effort turn them into a realistic 3D model of the object which can then be easily integrated into any AR app. All Apple Silicon Macs support Object Capture but it is only supported on Intel Macs that have at least 16GB of RAM and 4GB of VRAM.



Siri Text-to-Speech

The Text-to-speech feature in macOS allows users to select portions of text or highlight whole documents to be read out to them. Users of ‌Apple Silicon‌ Macs can use the text-to-speech voice feature in more languages than Intel-based Mac users including Swedish Danish Norwegian and Finnish.



On-Device Keyboard Dictation



With keyboard dictation you can dictate text anywhere you can type it and the feature improves the more you use it personalizing over time. On ‌Apple Silicon‌ Macs keyboard dictation now protects user privacy by performing all processing on-device meaning it's completely offline. And thanks to on-device dictation users can also dictate text of any length without a timeout. On Intel Macs however there's a time limit of 60 seconds.



Apple Speeds Up Its Transition Away From Intel



This is a unique period in the Mac's history as Apple is currently in the midst of a two-year transition from Intel processors to its custom Apple silicon chips in Macs with the changeover slated to be completed by WWDC 2022.

The transition began last November when Apple debuted the ‌M1‌ its first custom-designed chip in the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro MacBook Air and Mac mini followed by the 24-inch iMac in April. Just last week at its ""Unleashed"" event Apple unveiled new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by even higher performance ‌M1 Pro‌ and ‌M1 Max‌ chips.

Intel chips continue to be available in desktop machines that include the ‌Mac mini‌ ‌iMac‌ and Mac Pro but upgrades for all of those devices are in the works and expected next year so expect the next version of macOS to exclude Intel-based Mac users to an even greater extent than Monterey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZWwtYWxkZXItbGFrZS1jb3JlLWk1LTEyNjAway1iZW5jaG1hcmstcnl6ZW4tNS01NjAweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Claimed Intel Alder Lake Core i5-12600K Benchmark Score Trounces Ryzen 5 5600X,"



Time is running out on the bulk of Alder Lake leaks to spark speculation at least for whatever Intel has on tap for its first wave of CPUs. One of Intel's upcoming 12th Gen Core chips is the Core i5-12600K . Positioned as a mid-range chip a recent benchmark leak suggests it will deliver high-end performance punching above the typical Core i5's weight class.





Let's talk specs before we go any further. Built on what was previously known as Intel's 10-nanometer Enhanced SuperFin process (and now called Intel 7 ) the Core i5-12600K is tipped to be a 10-core/16-thread chip comprised of six high-performance Golden Cove cores with Hyper Threading support and four power-efficient Gracemont cores.





If past leaks are correct the Core i5-12600K will operate at a 3.4GHz base clock and up to a 4.9GHz Turbo frequency across one or two Golden Cove cores or 4.5GHz when all the cores are hammering workloads. It is also said to feature 20MB of L3 cache support DDR5-4800 and DDR4-3200 memory and have a 125W TDP.







As for the leaked benchmark in question APISAK (@TUM_APISAK) posted a CPU-Z screenshot with some details partially blurred out. Here's a look..













APISAK poses the possibility that this is representative of the Core i5-12600K though is not sure if the entry is ""real or fake."" If we assume it is legitimate it shows the Alder Lake part scoring at least 790 point s in CPU-Z's single-threaded test and at least 7200 points in the multi-threaded test (only the first two digits for both tests are untouched in the screenshot).





Meanwhile another prominent leaker (HXL or @9550pro) posted a CPU-Z screenshot that purportedly shows benchmark results for a Core i5-12600K running at stock settings. Here's a look...















This screenshot shows the Core i5-12600K mustering 746.2 in the single-threaded test and 7058.1 in the multi-threaded test. They are lower scores than the other purported benchmark run but still exceptional results especially if they do in fact represent stock clocks.







Click to Enlarge (Source: CPU-Z)







Exactly how good though? CPU-Z maintains a database of the fastest validated scores for a host of chips and according to those results the Core i5-12600K as depicted in these leaks is a beast. Using the scores from stock settings it wallops AMD's own mid-range darling the Ryzen 5 5600X beating it in the single-threaded test by 19.6 percent. It also bests every other Zen 3 chip and comes out ahead of Intel's Core i9-11900K by 9.4 percent.





For its roundup of multi-threaded results CPU-Z graphs processors separately based on thread counts. So rather than post a whole bunch of graphs here's a tidier look at some comparison data...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9pcy1uZXVyb21vcnBoaWMtY29tcHV0aW5nLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtYWktYS1sb29rLWF0LWludGVscy1uZXctbG9paGktMi1jaGlw0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly9tb2JpbGUuZW5naW5lZXJpbmcuY29tL2FtcC8yMjUxNy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Neuromorphic Computing the Future of AI?

Black Thursday commemorates Thursday Oct. 24 1929 a day when sellers traded close to 13 million shares in panic on the New York Stock exchange and endured $5 billion in losses. Early in the day 11% of the market's value was lost after heavy trading.

As so much trading was going on ticker tape reports were backed up and coming in late across the country and investors had no way of knowing right away what stocks were valued at which increased panic. There was a small reprieve but it was short-lived and the market continued to collapse the following week. Black Thursday is seen as being the start of what was the worst stock market crash in United States history which was followed by the Great Depression.

With the exception of Germany the study concluded that right-wing parties politicians news outlets and political commentators have received more traction on the website than that of left-wing tweets.

The study reports that Twitter's algorithm overall prefers tweets with a right-wing political affiliation. Additionally tweets about political content from elected officials received more exposure than those from non-elected officials.

""Establishing why these observed patterns occur is a significantly more difficult question to answer as it is a product of the interactions between people and the platform"" the company stated.

Kimpton Fills A Unique Market Position

Kimpton IHG’s smartest acquisition was purchased to fill a mid-market gap with modern hotels and a cool factor reminiscent of W Andaz and Edition. Kimpton focuses on design and plays to a young affluent crowd though many of their properties are rather affordable. W Hotels is a lot more money for a similar product Andaz too but the latter is just a little less loud than W. Kimpton has the design and for lack of a better word sass of W without the hefty price point.

Kimpton is a small chain (just 1.2% of IHG’s portfolio) upmarket of Indigo but more accessible than the newly acquired Six Senses.

IHG Is Just Terrible

For all of its faults IHG has identified its market gaps: luxury lifestyle resort – and has worked to bring brands in to fill those gaps. For the top end of the market Regent was acquired by the hotelier to compete with Park Hyatt Waldorf-Astoria (Hilton) St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton (Marriott.) At the time it the 51% stake was purchased Regent was just six properties; IHG intends to grow it to 40 hotels. For one of the world’s largest chains (6031 hotels worldwide) a six property entrance into the $60bn luxury hotel market sums up the brand’s approach nicely.

Intercontinental Hotel Group cannot be trusted with the long-term survival of a meaningful loyalty program. Kimpton developed its own Inner Circle with great perks and a unique culture. They promoted a “secret word” its members could say at check in that would deliver a Kimpton Inner Circle gift; both the perks and secret word changed quarterly keeping members engaged.

Meanwhile IHG doesn’t offer late guaranteed 4 pm checkout free breakfast nor confirmable upgrades to its most loyal IHG Rewards Club customers amassing 75 or more stays in a calendar year. To get some (but not all) of those benefits you’d need to apply and pay $200 – and that only corresponds to Platinum status.

IHG Rewards Club points have devalued its redemptions over the last few years from 50000 points as the highest category to trying to sneak in a hike to 120000 during the pandemic. They ultimately retreated following substantial vitriol from members. The credit card delivers little value when compared with competing brands and they don’t seem to care. It doesn’t help to earn IHG Rewards points if they devalue faster than other programs for hotel stays you rarely want to book anyway.

As much as I dislike Marriott Bonvoy even that program is more trustworthy and delivers more value than IHG and would be a better home for the brand.

IHG hates its elites. Even as a Business Edge IHG Rewards member I found little value in the program and virtually no access to Rewards Club Customer Care Center help for large bookings of many guests for an extended period of time.

Why IHG Should Sell Kimpton

IHG has helped Kimpton grow from a few dozen properties to 75 in 50+ cities. Is there a more perfect time to sell? IHG has been able to acquire the brand add customers (whether they are a good fit or not more on that below) add value and now can sell a far more mature brand with greater reach.

The reason why other brands are able to grow and build a following with their premium brands is that their offerings are broader. Premium brands at SPG represented a far larger percentage of its portfolio. Hyatt also has a significant amount of their brand coming in above select service categories (Hyatt Place Hyatt House) and Marriott does a better job of this than IHG. Here’s a great example as to why:

A premium guest who spends time at Intercontinental properties for work in major cities wants to relax on vacation with her family. In Hawaii for example there are just two properties – none of them full service. In Barcelona all of the choices for IHG are sub $100/night with the exception of the Intercontinental a Kimpton and a Hotel Indigo. We find the same limited offerings outside of select service in Rome. A premium business traveler does not want to stay in the Holiday Inn Express Waikiki.

It doesn’t fit with the rest of their brand because it doesn’t fit with their customer base. The majority of customers are Holiday Inn customers (I’m not throwing shade it was the best hotel in a city I worked in extensively and I earned Spire status because of it) but those are rarely willing to pay the premium for Kimpton. That said some Kimptons are priced below where they could be with a more premium customer base and marketing that works for those brands.

Conclusion

I really enjoy Kimpton hotels. Each one I have visited delivers a cool factor worthy of a premium. If they were part of a loyalty program where I had a broader range (both up and down lines) I’d be far more likely to choose them as often as possible. The reason I don’t is because there aren’t enough of them to make them my primary chain and there’s simply not enough other quality brands in a loyalty program that returns value to me. For IHG’s part they have built up the brand and can turn a profit on the larger product but Kimpton just doesn’t fit in with the rest of its customer base.

What do you think? Should IHG sell Kimpton? Should it keep the brand and grow it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd2hhdGN1bHR1cmUuY29tL3d3ZS9yeWJhY2std3dlcy1tYW5zb29yLWV4Y2hhbmdlLWhlYXRlZC10d2VldHPSAUpodHRwczovL3doYXRjdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9hbXAvd3dlL3J5YmFjay13d2VzLW1hbnNvb3ItZXhjaGFuZ2UtaGVhdGVkLXR3ZWV0cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ryback & WWE's Mansoor Exchange Heated Tweets,"WWE.com

In a case of social media beef few saw coming Ryback and Mansoor have had a fun little exchange on Twitter.

Completely out of left field the Big Guy decided to take a shot at Mansoor and proclaim how the current WWE product ""f**king sucks"".

. @VinceMcMahon you can give Mansoor @steveaustinBSR music and he still won’t be over. Holy s**t your product !*$% sucks. Advertisement October 23 2021

To be fair some would agree with Ryback's sentiments on the WWE product of today but it seems a tad random and a little odd to dig out Mansoor - even going as far as tagging Vince McMahon and Steve Austin.

In response Mansoor quite brilliantly put out a screenshot of the poll Ryback ran earlier this year. Said poll was asking fans which wrestling promotion they'd like to see the former Intercontinental Champion in with 72% of people preferring to see the one-time Skip Sheffield retire rather than head to AEW NXT or IMPACT Wrestling.

Last month saw Ryback state how he'll be returning to the squared circle soon after three years out of action although it remains to be seen if this will be on the independent scene or whether the powerhouse will end up in one of the bigger promotions out there.

(NYSE:IFF) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. This means that investors who purchase shares on or after the 25th of March will not receive the dividend which will be paid on the 6th of April.

International Flavors & Fragrances's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments International Flavors & Fragrances stock has a trailing yield of around 2.8% on the current share price of $107.42. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable and if the company is growing.

Check out our latest analysis for International Flavors & Fragrances

If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. International Flavors & Fragrances paid out more than half (73%) of its earnings last year which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 69% of its free cash flow as dividends within the usual range for most companies.

It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.

NYSE:IFF Historical Dividend Yield March 20th 2020

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut the company could see its value fall precipitously. So we're not too excited that International Flavors & Fragrances's earnings are down 4.5% a year over the past five years.

The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past ten years International Flavors & Fragrances has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops.

Final Takeaway

Is International Flavors & Fragrances an attractive dividend stock or better left on the shelf? While earnings per share are shrinking it's encouraging to see that at least International Flavors & Fragrances's dividend appears sustainable with earnings and cashflow payout ratios that are within reasonable bounds. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.

Jomhuri Eslami (Islamic Republic) one of Iran’s oldest newspapers in a commentary Saturday suggested Tehran had decided to join Russia in recognizing the Taliban’s ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’ despite the group’s history of ‘terrorism’ and religious intolerance.

Russia has suggested it would recognize the Taliban if it met several conditions including forming an ‘inclusive’ government and giving guarantees over human rights. Russia and other states including China have held off a decision while keeping diplomatic contact much as the United States did in reaching its 2020 agreement with the Taliban over US military withdrawal.

The 2020 US-Taliban agreement saw the Taliban commit not to allow operations by militant Sunni groups like the Islamic State (Isis-Daesh). Tehran is likewise concerned over possible infiltration by Sunni militants especially those linked to Isis and Baluchi separatists.

In a joint statement issued October 20 Russia China Iran India Pakistan and four central Asia republics – following a meeting of the ‘Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan’ established in 2017 – issued a statement viewing the Taliban as the new rulers ""irrespective of the official recognition of the new Afghan government by the international community.""

Taliban leaders at the Moscow conference on Afghanistan. October 20 2021

Reflecting disquiet in Tehran a senior official in the Iranian foreign minister criticized ""Russia's weak handling""of the Moscow Format talks and suggested the joint statement had not been agreed.

Jomhuri Eslami which has resisted those in Iran arguing Tehran must deal with Taliban whether it wants to or not in its commentary Saturday argued the Taliban would eliminate Persian as an official language and remove Shia religious jurisprudence from law and that it was forcibly evicting Shiite Hazaras from their lands and denying women the chance to study and work. All this the paper argued showed the Taliban was not ""worthy of recognition.""

For Iran which considers itself the leader of the Shiite world the suppression of Afghan Shiites is anathema. Human Rights Watch (HRW) this week said that since taking Kabul in August the Taliban had forcibly evicted thousands of Afghans from their lands.

Sunni-Shia war?

Last week Taliban Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid expressed hope in an interview with Iran's Hamshahri newspaper that Tehran would soon recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Mujahid said the new rulers in Kabul had good relations with Iran shared interests in trade and security and was receiving “Iranian delegations.” He dismissed as propaganda reports of discrimination against Afghanistan's Shiite minority including the Hazaras.

Nour News a website close to Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani in a commentary Wednesday said that ""acting on the United States' behalf"" Isis was trying to discredit Taliban declarations over security entice a negative reaction from Iran and fuel a Sunni-Shia war.

Nour cited the recent bombings at Shia mosques in Kunduz and Kandahar killing at least 90 people as evidence that Isis aimed at “heightening insecurities and causing ethno-religious conflicts.” Nour called on the Taliban “as promised” to offer support to Shiites taking on security for themselves.

The European Parliament adopted on Thursday a resolution taking the European Commission to task for not doing enough to combat money laundering tax evasion and tax avoidance in the member states and worldwide.

The resolution following the recent disclosures in the Pandora Papers was adopted by an overwhelming majority with 578 votes in favour 28 against and 79 abstentions (21 October).

The parliament identified the most urgent measures the EU needs to take to close loopholes that currently allow for tax avoidance money laundering and tax evasion on a massive scale. MEPs also called for legal action to be taken by the Commission against EU countries that do not properly execute existing laws.

Several member states are delayed in their implementation of existing rules intended to counteract money laundering and tax avoidance. These laggards should be pursued by the Commission according to the resolution.

The Commission is also asked to issue proposals regulating golden citizenship and residency schemes and to assess the effectiveness of the identification of politically exposed persons and the application of enhanced due diligence. The resolution mentions a number of former prime ministers and ministers of EU member states who were exposed in the Pandora Papers.

The most known persons are Andrej Babiš Czechia’s Prime Minister Nicos Anastasiades President of Cyprus Wopke Hoekstra Dutch Minister of Finance Tony Blair former British Prime Minister and John Dalli former Maltese Minister and EU Commissioner. Babiš was defeated in parliamentary elections earlier this month.

The resolution urges national EU authorities to launch thorough investigations of any wrongdoing revealed in the Pandora Papers involving their jurisdictions including audits on all individuals mentioned.

The Commission is asked by the MEPs to review the revelations to analyse whether further legislation should be proposed and establish if legal action against some member states is warranted. According to MEPs the European Public Prosecutor should also assess whether the revelations merit any specific investigations.

One year after the implementation deadline for an anti-money laundering directive nine member states had failed to establish public registers that can be used to identify ultimate beneficial owners especially in situations in which a network of shell companies is used; while others had imposed geographical access restrictions in breach of EU rules.

EU blacklist of tax heavens incomplete

In particular the Parliament levels heavy criticism against the current EU blacklist of tax havens which it describes as a “blunt instrument” unable to catch some of the worst-offending countries.

The Parliament deplored the fact that following the Pandora Papers revelations the Council of EU Finance Ministers decided to shorten the EU list of tax havens removing the Caribbean islands of Anguilla and Dominica as well as the Seychelles which featured in the Papers.

Two thirds of the shell companies in the Pandora Papers are located in the British Virgin Islands which has never featured on the EU blacklist and still are not included in the list.

The report calls for the granting of access for the UK financial sector to the Single Market for financial services to be made conditional on the respect by the UK of common tax and anti-money laundering standards.

For the first time the Parliament also condemned the role of the United States as a hub for financial and corporate secrecy. Some US states such as South Dakota Alaska Wyoming Delaware and Nevada have become hubs of financial and corporate secrecy as exposed by the Pandora Papers.

Nicholas Shaxson a researcher at the Tax Justice Network wrote recently in The New York Times that Britain is at the system’s heart. “Taken together with its partly controlled territories overseas Britain is instrumental in the worldwide concealment of cash and assets. It is as a member of the ruling Conservative Party said last week ‘the money laundering capital of the world.’”

“The UK’s network of overseas tax havens makes it easy for individuals and organisations to hide their wealth” commented MEP Sven Giegold MEP Greens/EFA spokesperson on financial and economic affairs.

“The Commission must link the access for the British financial sector to the EU’s Single Market with the UK’s alignment with our common standards on tax transparency and anti-money laundering. The Commission cannot continue to allow the UK and its tax havens to be a magnet for money laundering and tax evasion on our doorstep.”

“US states have become a global hub for financial and corporate secrecy and are enabling tax evasion avoidance and money laundering” he added. “We call on the US to once again show international leadership against financial secrecy by taking the automatic exchange of information to the next level.”

KYIV Ukraine -- It doesn't take long to buy a fake COVID-19 vaccine certificate in Ukraine. Just typing the words into Google brings up a slew of advertisements offering a certificate ""without visiting a doctor.""

A would-be customer sends their passport details address and a phone number through the Telegram messenger app and the next day a document showing fake proof of vaccination with Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine arrives in the post according to several people who have bought one of the fake certificates and who spoke to ABC News on condition of anonymity because the practice is illegal. They said prices for the certificates can vary anywhere from $20 to $200 (USD) with some fetching as much as $380.

The COVID vaccination certificate black market is becoming a growing concern in Ukraine which is suffering from a worsening third wave of the pandemic amid low vaccination numbers and as the government tries to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated. The number of people who have already bought fake certificates is unknown but some Telegram app channels advertising them have thousands of subscribers.

This is a sample paper certificate posted on a Telegram channel. Julia Drozd

Svitlana is one of them. She said she bought a fake certificate in September showing she was inoculated with Pfizer/BionTech's vaccine.

""I don't trust neither vaccines nor the government'' she told ABC News explaining her decision and declining to give her last name.

The demand for fake vaccine certificates exists despite the ease of getting a free COVID vaccine in Ukraine. As of late September there are over 11 million doses of different coronavirus vaccines in Ukraine now for a population of 44.1 million according to Ukraine's health ministry. The vaccine is free for all Ukrainians and in Kyiv walk-in vaccination centers are even open in some shopping malls.

But despite the availability of vaccines Ukraine is among one of the least vaccinated countries in Europe with only around 30.2% of the population having received one dose and 14.7% fully vaccinated according to a vaccine tracker published by Bloomberg. In late September the health minister Viktor Lyashko said 34000 doses of Pfizer would be dumped because they had expired.

The low numbers are the product of widespread vaccine hesitancy among Ukrainians: 56% don't plan to get vaccinated at all according to a poll from the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation a well-known independent think tank that conducts sociological studies.

""We observe this trend globally however in Ukraine misinformation about vaccination is extremely politicized and is spread both among the general public and the medical community"" Murat Shahin head of the UNICEF office in Ukraine told ABC News this month.

Another problem is lack of quality medical education on vaccination which leads to incorrect practices and confuses patients Shahin said.

""We also observe a suboptimal level of trust to state institutions"" he said. ""Meanwhile people trust their relatives local leaders and their doctors and nurses.""

Some of the social media channels offering fake vaccine certificates are part of that ecosystem pushing anti-vaccine sentiment sharing anti-vax information and news stories while urging people to buy fake certificates to avoid getting the shot.

According to the same Ilko Kucheriv Foundation poll some are reluctant because they are not sure about the safety of the vaccines. Some of those who spoke to ABC News said they resist just because they are forced to vaccinate.

There is no mandatory vaccination in Ukraine except for teachers and civil servants meaning there is little pressure to vaccinate. But some companies are pressing their employees to vaccinate threatening to cut salaries or reduce vacation days.

And a vaccine certificate is necessary to travel. Ukraine has created its own digital certificate in an app called Diya (""Action"") that is valid in EU countries.

Wanting to go abroad some Ukrainians are refusing the free shot of the real vaccine and instead are paying money for a fake certificate. On a site listing the phone number of one seller users reviewed the service.

""We've just crossed the border in Rava Russka [in Poland] our border service scanned the certificate and let us go without any problems"" one wrote. ""I took it to Germany. All worked"" another said.

Some services provide paper certificates. A fake official stamp is applied using the real names of doctors and clinics based on samples posted by some of the Telegram channels offering them.

The post translated from Ukrainian reads in part: ""After the second shot you can generate a certificate in Diya [official app] (we send a paper version with a wet stamp by post... No consequences/implications for you! The most important is that we dump the ampoule [with the number of the shipment]” Julia Drozd

Getting the digital proof of vaccination without being vaccinated is more difficult. It is still possible for a bribe according to some people ABC News talked to on condition of anonymity.

Some Ukrainians are simply paying doctors to sign off on their digital vaccine certificates by entering them as vaccinated in Ukraine's state vaccination register. After that a digital certificate appears in the official Diya app which is also valid in the EU.

Oleksiy Vyskyb Ukraine's deputy minister for digital transformation told ABC News that some doctors were charging a fee to falsely enter people's name into the state register showing vaccinated citizens.

One of the sellers confirmed that in a Telegram chat with an ABC reporter posing as a potential customer. ABC News did not actually purchase a fake certificate.

""We put the data into the register"" a person who identified themselves as a support manager responded when asked by the reporter how it would work.

Another channel said that the clinic where the false vaccination happens ""dumps"" two real doses of Pfizer and VaxZevria after pretending the client has received them.. They also offer ""to save"" these doses for the client to be vaccinated later if they change their mind before the vaccine expires two months later. Both options cost around $60.

According to some advertisements you can get a forged vaccination certificate even if you're a foreigner. It will cost a bit more than for a Ukrainian citizen -- $380 if you're abroad according to one ad.

Besides becoming part of a dangerous invisible pool of unvaccinated people that undermine restrictions and spread infection those buying fake certificates may be unable to get a real shot later on since they are already recorded as having received one in the state registry Shahin said.

Ukraine's authorities say they are now trying to crackdown on the practice. Ukraine's security service the SBU together with the country's cyberpolice said they have opened nearly 500 criminal proceedings relating to the selling of forged paper vaccination certificates and that more than 50 web resources have been blocked. So far only three cases have been opened against doctors for allegedly entering false information into the register. Those detained face up to six years in prison. But government says it wants to increase the punishment.

This week Ukraine imposed a full lockdown in four regions as Ukraine's daily numbers continue to worsen recently hitting its highest level since the country's second wave in the spring. Ukrainian authorities reported 22415 new confirmed infections and 546 deaths in the past 24 hours the highest numbers since the start of the pandemic. Most experts also believe the real number of cases and deaths are likely higher since not all are recorded with testing.

""People who use fake certificates create a dangerous space for others"" Maria Karchevych Ukraine's deputy health minister said at a press conference in Kyiv last week.

She said the fake COVID vaccine certificate industry also threatens Ukraine's international image since Ukraine was among the first non-European Union countries to have its national vaccine pass recognized by the EU for travel.

""EU countries expect transparency and honesty in using such documents"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3BzYmFsaXRhLmNvbS9wbnAtYWNhZGVteS1iYWdzLWNoYW1waW9uLWF3YXJkLW9uLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtY29uZmVyZW5jZS1vbi1wb2xpY2luZy1yZXNlYXJjaC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1wYXBlci1zdXBwb3J0cy1wY2FkZy10YWdhdGFndXlvZC1zdHJhdGVneS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PNP Academy bags champion award on International Conference on Policing Research Competition Paper Supports ...,"Jakarta INDONESIA. The Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA) made a legacy for winning the Top 3 places on the 2021 Porsimaptar International Conference on Policing Research Competition held at the Indonesian National Police Academy on October 19-22 2021.

The Philippine team for the scientific paper writing competition was composed of some the most brilliant 1st class cadets of PNPA ALAB KALIS Class 2022 namely: Cdt 1C Fidel E Triste III (Palo Leyte) Cdt 1C John Mark J Maandal (Lipa Batangas) Cdt 1C Lyndon G Mondragon (Tabontabon Leyte) Cdt 1C Zoe C Seloterio (Santa Barbara Iloilo) and Cdt 1C Maricar G Tapiru (Tuguegarao Cagayan Valley). On the other hand PLTCOL ROAN MARIE D BASCUGIN NUP Jezamine R De Leon Ph.D. and NUP Myrna Campomanes Ph.D. served as their research mentors.

Their study titled “Three-Factor Structure for Youth Engagement in Community Policing During the New Normal” topped twelve other research papers from various educational institutions worldwide – such as University of Leeds of United Kingdom Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha of Indonesia Korean National Police University and other service academies and universities globally. The entries of the University of Leeds United Kingdom and the Ganesha Educational University Indonesia landed on the second and third respectively.

Dr De Leon said the PNPA Team created the study to identify the factors that will lead the youth to engage in community policing during the New Normal as they play a vital role in leadership public safety and nation-building.

Findings of the said research paper highlighted a three-factor structure significant for engaging the youth to embrace community policing during the New Normal. These are the role of trust-building between the police and the youth knowledge-building/ awareness about community policing and the utilization of technology as a platform for community policing.

The results of their study which involved 427 youth also validated the reliability of the strategies employed under the Master Plan “TAGATAGUYOD” 2019 of the Police Community and Affairs Development Group; respondents confirmed the essentiality of strong trust between the police and the youth (as one of the stakeholders and prime movers) towards attaining better public order and safety.

Moreover findings highlighted that the growing trends and innovations in communications and technology is a key to enhance information development operations public information and community engagements. Technology plays an important role in actively engaging the youth to build knowledge about community policing.

Following their success the researchers are looking forward to the realignment of police initiatives with their thesis. “By making our findings known we hope that this will be the start of an era where all policies and standard procedures in public safety and crime prevention will all be based on concrete evidence of reliability and effectivity supported by empirical data” Cadet Maandal said.

Meanwhile Cdt 1C Crizaldo U Barcarse Jr (Ilagan Isabela) and Cdt 1C Augustine R Jaluague (Legazpi Albay) landed the Philippine flag on the 2nd and 3rd places respectively on the International Speech Competition which was also participated by the different member-countries of the Association of Police Training Institutions in Asia (APTA).

Investors will be watching closely for any changes with implications for them.

The ""new capitalism"" proposals of new Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida will help well-run companies stand out to public and private equity investors market observers believe.

However the new prime minister who worked closely with his two predecessors Shinzo Abe and Yoshihide Suga is unlikely to make drastic changes to the government's economic policies for example by walking away from Abenomics at least before the Bank of Japan's new governor takes office in April 2023.

Instead the market thinks Kishida’s proposals such as tax incentives for employers to increase wages and enhancing Japan’s competitiveness in key areas like chipmaking will make Japan more attractive to investors.

“We understand that the market consensus for the Kishida cabinet is that there will be no significant change in economic policies especially in both monetary and fiscal sides and is not seen as shifting away from Abenomics” said Kensuke Niihara Japan chief investment officer with State Street Global Advisors.

Kensuke Niihara State Street Global Advisors

Abenomics which refers to increasing the money supply and government spending to stimulate the economy has defined the Japanese economy since 2012.

“Kishida emphasises both redistribution and growth. The market was once concerned about a change in financial income tax to support redistribution but it was pulled down and the government showed no intention to change value-added tax (VAT). All in all the cabinet is expected to go with the existing framework” Niihara said.

“In the short to middle term the Japanese economy could be relatively supported by cyclical recovery due to better Covid-19 condition and Covid-related fiscal policies which would support the overall equity market” Niihara added.

SOMETHING NEW

After replacing Suga on Oct 4 Kishida has proposed “new Japanese capitalism” which seeks to alter the current neoliberal policies of the Liberal Democratic Party. The party has been in government for most of the period since the end of the Second World War.

One pillar of the “new capitalism” is to strengthen Japan’s economic security by sharpening Japan’s independent and dominant status in areas such as chip manufacturing. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has just announced it will build a new factory in Japan that will cost $7 billion in making.

“This is important in terms of making Japan's market more open and attractive to foreign firms and investors. Absorbing good foreign firms through reforming institutions system would be a critical challenge for Kishida's administration” said Yoshikazu Kato research fellow at Rakuten Securities Economic Institute based in Tokyo.

State Street’s Niihara also noted the policy discussions around economic security support for digitisation the reactivation of nuclear plants and multi-year budgeting. “However there is nothing confirmed yet and we expect limited impact on the markets for the time being” Niihara noted.

Tomo Kinoshita Invesco

Kishida will only be able to move forward with his economic agenda if the LDP wins the general election for the House of Representatives convincingly on Oct 31.

“All eyes will focus next on whether the LDP obtains the political capital it needs in order to push through industrial policies that may improve Japan’s productivity and growth potential in new areas such as renewable energy” said Tomo Kinoshita global market strategist at Invesco Japan.

“During his acceptance speech Kishida pledged a significant government stimulus worth around 30 trillion yen ($263 billion) before the end of the year. From an economic perspective Kishida’s robust pandemic-recovery package further supports the country’s rebound and may be positive for Japanese equities” Kinoshita said.

BOJ AND ETF

“Kishida is known to be a political centrist and viewed as being market-friendly. It’s unlikely that there will be any significant changes to Japan’s political economy framework and the Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policies should continue as the current term of the BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda lasts until April 2023” he stressed.

No one is sure if the central bank will taper its decade-long purchases of Japanese exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have made it the biggest investor in that market with assets of about 50 trillion yen ($439 billion).

Kenichi Hirayama Tokio Marine AM

The proportion of passive investments in Japanese equities are at record high levels which make up over 70% of publicly-offered equity investment trusts and over 80% of the equity portion of public pensions. ""This is highly inefficient"" noted Kenichi Hirayama chief investment officer at Tokio Marine Asset Management.

“If the BOJ is to cut purchase on domestic ETFs passive inflows will largely decrease into all companies” Hirayama said.

He thinks this could further widen the gap in corporate governance between well and poorly performing companies and create opportunities for active investors that can spot quality companies through active research of both public and private equity investments.

Corporate governance long-term stability and digital transformation will be the three main focuses of Japan’s future economic development Hirayama noted.

“Corporate governance is always a big thing under Abenomics. We see that continuing under Kishida. And the policy discussions into ‘new capitalism’ have also been covering this topic” Hirayama said.

BUSINESS AS USUAL

Hirayama does not think new policies will mean any changes for the country's public pension funds.

“From a political standpoint we don’t think Kishida will make any move towards asset owners. He is not expected to push for drastic increases in equity allocations for example. Looking at the big public pensions because of their size it means that they have to move quite slowly for any possible allocation changes” Hirayama said.

“We don’t see any big shift in Japanese asset owners’ asset allocation strategies” Hirayama said. “Both public and private pension funds will continue to gradually raise allocation to alternative assets” he said.

Invesco’s Kinoshita said he is also interested in how Japan’s relationship with China will develop under the new administration. “Kishida a former defense minister in Abe’s government is known as a foreign policy hawk and has emphasised the importance of strengthening the US-Japan alliance” he noted.

Market observers have interpreted the recent decision by the world’s largest pension fund Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) to exclude Chinese government bonds from its foreign bond portfolio as a political move.

Among them are a coterie of mixed-media works by Jacob Jackmauh that echo the menagerie one might find at a playground or a theme park including an owl with opaque binocular eyes and a snail shell with a coin slot.

McGinn and Jackmauh’s outdoor exhibition takes its title from singer Earl Grant’s 1958 ballad “(At) the end (of a Rainbow)” in which the crooner silkily intones phrases that turn precipitously from auspicious to foreboding: “At the end of the river / The water stops its flow / At the end of a highway / There’s no place you can go.” The sculptures also revel in a cheery pessimism. McGinn’s scaled-up grotesques interrogate these treacly cereal “charms” which look more like colorful shapeless blobs than rainbows or shooting stars. The nostalgia that surrounds this childhood treat vanishes after that hit of sugar causes one’s body to crash. Jackmauh’s works—including an oversized water spigot and a crocodile whose open mouth contains a fixture resembling a bathtub drain a shower spout or even the receiver of a kiddie phone—likewise deflate those objects of youthful play and diversion. Sadly they only appear functional—the viewer is held in anticipation of something that will frustratingly never arrive.

McGinn and Jackmauh’s spunky humorous critiques of mass-produced juvenilia parallel theorist Sianne Ngai’s writing on the late capitalist underpinnings of minor aesthetic categories such as “cute.” Ngai understands “cuteness” as an index for consumption which elicits affective responses that can vary from tenderness to aggression. Such reactions prompt one not only to consume the object but also to identify with it. The artists’ sculptures are an indictment of this brand of false advertising; the Lucky Charms rainbow does lead to a pot of gold but for General Mills and no one else alas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lcy9vYml0dWFyaWVzL25hbWUvam9zZXBoLWphY29iLW9iaXR1YXJ5P3BpZD0yMDA0OTcwNDEmdj1iYXRlc3ZpbGxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joseph Jacob Obituary - Zephyrhills Florida,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/funeral-homes/obituaries/name/joseph-jacob-obituary?pid=200497041&v=batesville on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lcy9vYml0dWFyaWVzL25hbWUvam9zZXBoLWphY29iLW9iaXR1YXJ5P3BpZD0yMDA0OTcwNDEmdj1iYXRlc3ZpbGxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0cG9zdC5jb20vY29sdW1uaXN0L2FydGljbGUvSmVmZi1KYWNvYnMtTGV3aXMtTWlsbHMtY3Jldy1tb3VybnMtaG9ub3JzLTE2NTU3NDA0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff Jacobs: Lewis Mills crew mourns honors teammate Kailey Prenoveau who died in August,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ctpost.com/columnist/article/Jeff-Jacobs-Lewis-Mills-crew-mourns-honors-16557404.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0cG9zdC5jb20vY29sdW1uaXN0L2FydGljbGUvSmVmZi1KYWNvYnMtTGV3aXMtTWlsbHMtY3Jldy1tb3VybnMtaG9ub3JzLTE2NTU3NDA0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vY2EvbmZsL25ld3Mvam9zaC1qYWNvYnMtaW5qdXJ5LXVwZGF0ZS1yYWlkZXJzLXJiL2oxMDAxbDdsNjlzZDEzM3p6ejhtNDJiNGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Josh Jacobs injury update: Raiders RB ruled out after suffering chest injury vs. Eagles,"The Raiders will have to finish their game Sunday against the Eagles without running back Josh Jacobs.

Jacobs finished the day with six carries for 29 yards and a touchdown. He also made three catches for 39 yards.

Kenyan Drake is the Raiders' lead back with Jacobs out. Drake was the Cardinals' top back last season rushing for 955 yards and 10 TDs. Jalen Richard will serve as Drake's backup and a receiving weapon out of the backfield.

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vcmluZy1hbm5vdW5jZXItbWlzdGFraW5nbHktbmFtZXMtd3Jvbmctd2lubmVyLW9mLWNoZXJuZWthLWpvaG5zb24tbmluYS1odWdoZXMtYm91dC1pbi13aWxkLXNjZW5lLTA0MzMzNzM3Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ring announcer mistakingly names wrong winner of Cherneka Johnson-Nina Hughes bout in wild scene,"Cherneka Johnson (R) beat Nina Hughes on Sunday in Australia but not without first believing she had lost. (Mikey Williams/Top Rank)

The announcer at RAC Arena was not having a good day on Sunday.

The scene was reminiscent of when Steve Harvey crowned the wrong Miss Universe in 2015 or of the “Moonlight” debacle at the Oscars in 2017. It was rough.

Cherneka Johnson beat reigning WBA bantamweight champion Nina Hughes on Sunday in Perth Australia via a majority decision. But when ring announcer Dan Hennessey a former United States Marine stepped up to announce her as the winner he completely butchered the delivery. That made for a very confusing scene in the ring.

Hennessey misread the scorecards when making his announcement and he accidentally declared Hughes the winner. Suddenly it was her arm in the air and the 41-year-old started celebrating.

Pretty quickly though he corrected his mistake as if nothing had happened. He read the scores again apparently correct the second time and Johnson's arm was lifted in the air. That left Hughes and the announcers on the broadcast incredibly confused.

Just watch the scene unfold:

ESPN’s Joe Tessitore erupted on the “absolute clown show garbage amateur hour” announcing from Hennessey too while trying to explain to viewers in the U.S. what had actually happened.

The error wasn’t Hennesseey’s only one of the night either. He messed up the scorecards for the Pedro Guevara-Andrew Moloney fight earlier in the night too. The problem for him is apparently nothing new.

Even though she was briefly robbed of the celebration and just about everyone involved was confused Johnson got her win.

Down the stretch of that season he really showed his potential — culminating in a game-starring performance off the bench in a Play-In victory against the Miami Heat. Over the summer came an opportunity for Johnson to take the next step —starting power forward John Collins was traded and the starting power forward spot was up for grabs. In fact it was Johnson’s development in the season was a contributing reason that helped prompt the Hawks’ front office to make the Collins trade in the first place.

“Really the progression of Jalen especially defensively in the last season really gave us a lot hope this year where it’s like ‘OK can you put him into the more 4-lineups whether he’s starting or not and add in some of those elements defensively as well as his playmaking ability’” said GM Landry Fields at last season’s media day. “We’re excited for his growth this year.”

Johnson went head-to-head with Saddiq Bey for the starting role Bey initially won out but combined with two losses to start the season and strong performances from Johnson off the bench prompted Hawks head coach Quin Snyder to insert Johnson into the starting lineup. When the two were healthy it soon became a non-conversation as to who it should be that starts in the lineup: Jalen Johnson was an emerging star within the Atlanta Hawks.

In a larger role now as a starter Johnson’s improved game was unleashed. From his driving and how he attacks the rim:

To his athleticism to put pressure on the rim or finish with authority:

(Who could forget this play the opening play in Los Angeles where Johnson crushed Austin Reaves?):

His improved jumpshot:

His playmaking:

And his rebounding where he can grab the board and lead the attack or find an outlet pass:

Not to mention his impact defensively whether it was as an on-ball defender or as a rebounder:

You could spend quite a bit of time watching Jalen Johnson highlight compilations: he had an impact in almost every facet of the game. In the end Johnson averaged 16 points per game on 51% shooting 35% from three 73% from the line on 2.6 attempts 8.7 rebounds 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals in 33 minutes per game.

The team grew more and more confident about Johnson’s abilities and trusted him more and more as the season progressed.

“Whether you want to call it playmaking or facilitating I think he’s getting more and more comfortable — and our team is getting more comfortable — with him having the ball in his hands” said Snyder of Johnson after a game against the OKC Thunder. “Whether it’s transition or in situations tonight where they were coming to double-team and impact our guards. He’s capable of making plays and making plays for other people as well. You’ve seen him do that in practice settings but I think his comfort and his confidence doing those things in a game against a good team that’s something that’s unique to him with his size and athleticism.”

This confidence came on both ends of the floor.

“He’s a very versatile defender” said De’Andre Hunter of Johnson after an impressive defensive showing against the Los Angeles Lakers. “He can guard one through four even sometimes the five. He’s always in the passing lanes he’s athletic he blocks shots. Having someone like that next to you gives you confidence to be a better defender and also gives the team confidence to defend better.”

In a season which was fraught with disappointment for the Atlanta Hawks Jalen Johnson was by far the brightest most encouraging spot in the 2023-24 season. With his play Johnson solidified himself in the eyes of many as one of the players who would be worth holding onto and building around. He was the one Hawk that the team could trust on an almost nightly basis on both ends of the floor.

Johnson set multiple career-highs throughout the season his high-mark coming in two 28 point showing against the Thunder in January and the Pistons in April. Johnson also recorded his first triple-double in that same Detroit game.

I wrote at various points this season that Jalen Johnson was quickly becoming the most important (not to be confused with ‘best’ player) player for the Hawks because of his ability and his value to do so many different things the Hawks really need: rebounding defending versatility. He was described by Snyder during the season as a ‘Swiss army knife’ and it’s an accurate analogy. It was almost concerning how quickly the Hawks became so reliant on him in his first season starting and when he was absent the Hawks could never make up what they missed in Johnson through one rotation player — which speaks to Johnson’s quality and versatility.

Without Johnson the Hawks’ rebounding in particular really suffered as well as their defense and defensive options with Johnson only second to Clint Capela in defensive win shares for the Hawks. Sadly the Hawks almost had to become as used to not having Johnson as they did having him in the lineup.

Johnson played 56 games this season with two injuries in particular sidelining him for prolonged periods of time: a wrist injury in a November game against the Wizards which ruled him out for just over a month. Johnson had various problems with his ankles which also saw him miss game time but a decisive ankle injury occurred during the Hawks’ run-in a double-overtime loss to the Miami Heat on April 9th one from which Johnson did not return from as the Hawks’ season ended in the Play-In game in Chicago. Had he not missed as much time Johnson would have been a very strong contender for Most Improved Player: his improvement this season was among the biggest jumps in the NBA.

These injuries slightly marred what was a hugely impressive season from Johnson who has strengthened his position heading into contract extension discussions when the Hawks and Johnson can agree on an extension later this year as Johnson enters his fourth season.

At the end of it all during the Hawks’ exit interviews Snyder outlined in detail Johnson’s season his growth and his path going forward in his development.

“Do you want one thing? I can give you a lot on Jalen!” quipped Snyder during the Hawks’ exit interviews. “I think he had a terrific year. He was a guy that dealt with some things he couldn’t control as far as a couple of ankle injuries and when he got upended in Washington when he broke his wrist. One of the things he did last year is he really worked he worked on certain things which were areas where he really wanted to get better. I anticipate him doing that again this summer. As Jalen moves forward in his career I think he’s someone — because of his mindset — that we’ll see continue to improve.

“Last year there was focus on his skill work as handling his passing his shooting and there was also focus on his health his body and his and the health performance side. I think we saw strides with both of those even when he did sprain his ankle how he handled the treatment and how he got himself back. Obviously the biggest thing I think for him because of his feel for the game he has so many different situations where he has to read what the best option is and you’re not always going to have a clear this is the best option.

“There’s a continuum there is this is a high percentage shot this is a higher percentage shot you know there there are so many things that go into it this is a good pass this is a better pass. When you have someone that’s able to make plays like that there’s a layer of the game that unfolds that that you have to prepare yourself mentally and physically to be able to make all those decisions in a really efficient way. I think he’ll continue to get more and more efficient and play better and better defense.”

Johnson himself didn’t quite elaborate as much as Snyder but throws down a different gauntlet for himself for the summer ahead.

“Everybody thinks it was a good year I think it can be better” said Johnson during the exit interviews. “That’s my mindset heading into the summer.”

An ominous warning indeed; what heights can Jalen Johnson reach? Off the evidence of this season they could be lofty heights indeed...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYnRyYWRlcnVtb3JzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L25sLWVhc3Qtbm90ZXMtbHV6YXJkby1vcnRpei1qb2huc29uLW5hdGlvbmFscy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NL East Notes: Luzardo Ortiz Johnson Nationals,"Jesus Luzardo was reinstated from the Marlins’ 15-day injured list today with right-hander Eli Villalobos optioned to Triple-A in the corresponding move. Luzardo struggled to a 6.58 ERA over his first five starts and 26 innings before a mild left flexor strain (initially diagnosed as elbow tightness) sent him to the IL so the three-week layoff between starts can hopefully set as a refresh of a tough season to date for the 26-year-old. The returns of Luzardo and Braxton Garrett this weekend will help the injury-riddled Marlins rotation though Edward Cabrera has now also gone down with a shoulder impingement.

Beyond the immediate help that Luzardo will bring to Miami’s pitching staff today’s start figures to reignite the trade rumors that have swirled around the left-hander for months. If Luzardo recaptures his 2021-22 form he would be a very hot commodity at the trade deadline as he is arbitration-controlled through the 2026 season. The Luis Arraez trade has already signaled that the Marlins are in sell mode but while the team pulled the trigger early on that deal Luzardo’s suitors will want to see a larger sample size of healthy and productive starts before moving what would have to be a very substantial trade package to pry him away from Miami.

Today prices are rising faster than expected and nobody is sure if inflation and wages will spiral upward. For all their equations and theories economists are often fumbling in the dark with too little information to pick the policies that would maximise jobs and growth.

Yet as we report this week the age of bewilderment is starting to give way to greater enlightenment. The world is on the brink of a real-time revolution in economics as the quality and timeliness of information are transformed.

Invest $15100 in These High-Yield Stocks,"These supercharged income stocks offer an average yield of 7.97%!

There's no one-size-fits-all moneymaking strategy on Wall Street. Over time we've watched growth and value investors thrive. But if there's been one near-constant it's the outperformance of dividend stocks over the long run.

Although the data is now nine years old a report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management a division of JPMorgan Chase highlights the undeniable potential of dividend stocks to make people rich over time.

In 2013 J.P. Morgan Asset Management compared the performance of public companies that initiated and grew their payouts between 1972 and 2012 to public companies that didn't offer a dividend over the same stretch. The result? Dividend-paying companies averaged an annual return of 9.5% over four decades which handily surpassed the meager 1.6% annual return for non-dividend-paying stocks over 40 years.

Since dividend stocks are usually profitable on a recurring basis have clear long-term outlooks and are time-tested they're often a smart place for investors to put their money to work in any economic environment.

The big dilemma that income investors face is deciding how to safely maximize the yield they'll receive while minimizing risk. Given that risk and yield tend to be correlated when yields hit 4% and above this is easier said than done.

The good news is that there are high-quality dividend stocks that have a track record of delivering for their shareholders. In fact some of these income stocks provide a monthly payout. If you're the impatient type who demands the regular gratification of dividend payments the following trio of high-yield stocks could be the answer. With an average yield of 7.97% an investment of $15100 divided evenly among these stocks would produce $100 in monthly dividend income.

AGNC Investment Corp: 8.73% yield

For income seekers wanting to maximize their monthly payout mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC 0.21%) appears to be the top choice.

Mortgage REITs like AGNC borrow money at short-term lending rates and use this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets such as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). The goal for mortgage REITs is to maximize their net interest margin which describes the difference between the average yield on long-term assets minus the average borrowing rate.

The great thing about mortgage REITs like AGNC is that there aren't many surprises. These are companies that ebb and flow with interest rates and their movements are often highly predictable. Generally a flattening yield curve (a situation where the yield difference between short- and long-term Treasury bonds narrows) and/or a Federal Reserve that's making big changes to its monetary policy are headwinds for companies like AGNC. Conversely a steepening yield curve with slow-walked monetary policy changes tends to be a positive for the mortgage REIT industry.

Looking back decades the early years of an economic recovery almost exclusively demonstrate a steepening yield curve and generally dovish monetary policy. In other words it's AGNC's time to shine.

Something else income investors will appreciate is the company's focus on agency MBSs. An agency asset is backed by the federal government in the event of a default. As of June 30 $85.5 billion of the company's $87.5 billion investment portfolio was comprised of agency securities. While this added protection does weigh down long-term yields it also allows the company to lever its investments to boost its profit potential.

AGNC has averaged a double-digit dividend yield in 11 of the past 12 years making it a premier income stock among monthly dividend payers.

PennantPark Floating Rate Capital: 8.57% yield

For something completely under the radar income investors seeking high-yield monthly dividends should consider buying PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (PFLT 0.35%). PennantPark is outlaying $0.095 monthly which is a payout it's held since March 2015.

PennantPark is a business development company that primarily focuses on first-lien secured debts and to a lesser degree common equity investments such as preferred stock. However instead of providing financing for well-known businesses PennantPark is predominantly a first-lien holder in smaller-capitalization private businesses that might otherwise not have the financing options available from banks that larger companies can receive.

Why focus on middle-market companies? The simple answer is yield. With fewer available financing options PennantPark is able to secure average debt yields north of 7% which is what fuels the company's supercharged dividend.

What's more virtually all of PennantPark's companies are making good on their obligations. As of June the company's investment portfolio consisted of 100 companies of which only two were on non-accrual (i.e. 90 days delinquent on their payments). This is a small percentage of its portfolio considering the company is focused on smaller-cap (i.e. less established) companies.

Arguably the best aspect of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital is as the name suggests its variable-rate loans. As of the end of June 98% of its debt portfolio consisted of variable-rate instruments. With interest rates having nowhere to go but up PennantPark's lenders are going to be paying more to the company in the years to come.

LTC Properties: 6.62% yield

A third monthly dividend stock that can deliver sustainable outsized payouts is skilled nursing and senior care REIT LTC Properties (LTC -0.09%). LTC has the ""lowest"" yield on this list at 6.6%. But to put this into perspective LTC's yield is nearly quintuple that of the broad-based S&P 500.

Without sugarcoating things LTC and its peers had a rough 2020 and start to the current year. The coronavirus pandemic brought admissions to skilled nursing facilities and senior housing to a crawl which in turn led to some level of rental delinquencies from LTC's rental base. In particular Senior Care Centers a key renter from LTC filed for bankruptcy protection and didn't make its rental payments in the second quarter.

Yet in spite of these issues LTC's dividend hasn't been cut and its overall business has quickly bounced back. Excluding Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle the company collected nearly 94% of its rent and mortgage interest income in the second quarter. With vaccination rates ticking higher especially among the elderly population and skilled nursing facility workers the prospect of returning to business as usual is somewhat in sight.

Furthermore LTC Properties' diversity has been a boost. The company holds first-lien mortgages on close to 180 properties in 27 states and more importantly has 30 lease operators. With only four of its 30 operators leasing more than nine properties as of June LTC has ensured that its business won't be turned on its head by a single operator's struggles.

Lastly the company should also benefit immensely from the aging of America. As baby boomers age demand for senior housing and skilled nursing is only bound to increase which will put the proverbial ball and rental pricing power in LTC's court."

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Swedish financial technology firm has hired the wife of Pensions Minister Guy Opperman ahead of a Government crackdown on the online shopping phenomenon.

Flora Coleman joined the loans firm after a successful stint lobbying for payments firm Wise in the lead-up to its £9billion flotation on the London Stock Exchange. Klarna has landed a number of significant meetings with Ministers since Coleman became its global director of public affairs in July.

Billionaire founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski was granted a private audience with Treasury Minister John Glen. Klarna is understood to have pushed for the meeting since before Coleman joined the company.

Siemiatkowski was also invited to deliver a speech at last week's Global Investment Summit for the world's most powerful investors where the focus was green investment. He later attended a reception hosted by the Queen at Windsor Castle.

When Coleman was at Wise she reportedly held a 'spouse pass' for the House of Commons granting her access to Parliament's meeting rooms and bars as Opperman's wife. The MoS understands Coleman has not held a spouse pass at any time while at Klarna. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Klarna in its lobbying attempts which have broken no rules.

Klarna has become one of the most talked-about 'fintechs' in the City after it attracted an eye-watering valuation of £33.1billion following investment from Japan's Softbank. London is up against New York in the race to win Klarna's blockbuster listing.

Glen is spearheading a Government push to rein in 'buy now pay later' firms such as Klarna and its big Australian rival Clearpay which allow customers to pay for their shopping in monthly instalments interest-free.

Thousands of online shops offer Klarna or Clearpay as payment options. But the products are unregulated. Klarna has faced criticism for offering loans without credit checks or ensuring customers can afford repayments.

The Financial Conduct Authority earlier this year called for 'very urgent' action after finding 'significant potential for consumer harm.'

The Treasury last week launched a consultation on new rules to protect customers most of whom are younger shoppers. The sector has become a key target for regulators after 'buy now pay later' spending boomed in the pandemic tripling to £2.7billion in 2020 as Instagram influencers promoted the service.

Klarna's meeting with Glen is seen in the industry as a big coup. Sources said Clearpay founded by 31-year-old billionaire Nick Molnar tried to speak to Glen at the Conservative Party conference this month but was turned down. One source said: 'The Klarna meeting was completely independent of the other players. It wanted to warm relations and Sebastian got some airtime with Glen – definitely more than any other provider. It seemed quite exclusive for Klarna.'

Siemiatkowski then earned a coveted invitation to last week's 'green' investment summit with the world's most affluent investors. The 40-year-old rubbed shoulders with BlackRock chairman Larry Fink JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and Ana Botin chief executive of Santander. The investor jamboree was also packed with top politicians. Boris Johnson Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss all gave speeches. Royals such as Princes Charles and William also attended the evening reception at Windsor Castle.

Though Klarna is not a big investor or UK corporation like most other summit attendees it said it took climate change 'seriously' and last week announced a £750000 investment into 'climate transformation' projects. It also announced an overhaul of operations last week – days before the Treasury launched plans to create new rules for the sector. Klarna said it would bring in stronger credit checks and penalise customers for missed payments. The sector expects the rules to be in place by the end of 2022 with stringent affordability checks and guarantees that customers will be treated fairly – especially those who struggle to repay.

The Government is encouraging fast-growing technology firms such as Klarna to list in London. Klarna has said it is considering London but has previously suggested it is leaning towards New York.

Klarna said: 'We are one of the largest fintechs operating globally in 17 markets. In the UK we work with 17000 retailers and serve 15million customers so of course we engage with Government. We follow the highest standards to get the best for UK consumers.'",,,,,,,,,,,,

In January the company released a limited number of pink candy-flavored mac and cheese boxes for Valentine’s Day. Eight months later the company teamed up with Brooklyn-based ice cream maker Van Leeuwen to create a limited edition mac and cheese ice cream pint. The unusual flavor combination sold out quickly and was restocked in August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvaXMtaXQtdGltZS1mb3ItdW5pbGV2ZXItdG8tYmUtYnJva2VuLXVwLTczOXp0OHZ6bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is it time for Unilever to be broken up?,"In 2005 a TV advertising campaign in India for Surf Excel laundry detergent ran with the slogan “dirt is good”. It showed a schoolboy leaping into a puddle to take vengeance on it after his sister fell in and hurt herself. Both were splashed with mud. The ad was so popular that it helped make Surf Excel Unilever’s top-selling brand in India where it rakes in almost €5 billion (£4.2 billion) in sales each year.

Campaigns such as this have helped Unilever become one of the world’s biggest consumer goods giants selling everything from Dove deodorant to Lipton tea Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Knorr stock cubes. It is also the second-most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange with a market value of £100 billion. It makes most of its sales in emerging markets such as India Argentina and China where Lux is the bestselling soap.

However despite its position near the top of the FTSE 100 Unilever’s share price has stagnated. It closed on Friday at £38.93 a drop of more than 6 per cent since current chief executive Alan Jope took over in January 2019. The sluggishness has prompted speculation that the company is ripe for an activist intervention with a break-up on the list of possible demands. “They should seriously explore the split of food and home and personal care into two separate listed entities” said Martin Deboo an analyst at the investment bank Jefferies. “Unilever’s food business is in mature categories that lack the fizz of Nestlé’s.”

For Unilever questions over its corporate future come in the face of extreme cost inflation in all parts of its business. Jope drew headlines last week when he warned of price increases above the 4 per cent that the company has already introduced. He said consumers faced a “once in two-decade” environment of rising prices in almost every household product. The hikes made so far helped Unilever to offset a 1.5 per cent fall in sales volumes in the third quarter of this year. The company is not alone: last week Nestlé said its prices had risen by 2.1 per cent.

For investors last week’s results brought relief that Unilever had not lowered its guidance on profit margins for the second time this year. It reassured shareholders that margins would be flat — mostly thanks to raising prices more than was expected. “It is a sign of how depressed expectations had become for Unilever that the worst quarterly volume performance since 2009 was greeted by a 3 per cent rise in the share price” noted analysts at RBC Capital Markets.

The company today is the product of a series of mergers over the past century the first in 1929 through the union of Britain’s Lever Brothers and the Dutch Margarine Union. Lever Brothers was founded in 1885; its Sunlight brand was the world’s first packaged laundry soap.

Over the years Unilever expanded. In 1993 it became the largest ice-cream manufacturer in the US with the acquisition of Breyers from Kraft. It bought Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 and added brands such as Marmite and Knorr.

It later added skincare brands such as REN and in 2016 paid $1 billion for the Dollar Shave Club which sells razors on subscription. Today Unilever is separated into three divisions one for food and refreshments one for home and another for beauty and personal care.

It is a sprawling global empire with 150000 employees. Its emerging markets business is dominated by home and personal care brands while Europe and North America are larger in food and refreshment. So should it split in two?

Breaking up is hard to do

The traditional break-up theory for Unilever involves splitting off its food business from home and personal care. That would separate brands such as Marmite and Hellmann’s from personal care brands like Dove and Lynx and home brands such as Persil and Cif cleaner.

“It’s really two businesses with very different financial dynamics” according to RBC’s James Edwardes Jones who said the emerging markets business was more “dynamic” and “entrepreneurial”. In contrast its food and refreshments arm was slower growing. “Culturally it must be extremely difficult to run a company with these two very different levels of growth and aspirations” he said.

Unilever is already planning to separate its tea business which could lead to brands including PG Tips being spun off in a stock market listing or sold or ploughed into a partnership. The division is said to be attracting interest from private equity firms including CVC Capital Partners Carlyle and Advent but the company is exploring all three options. “You could easily see the Unilever Tea Co becoming a standalone business on a listed stock exchange” Jope said earlier this year. “That is a highly likely outcome which would have been very different under our old structure.”

Unilever was overhauled in November last year when it ditched its Anglo-Dutch dual structure in favour of a single corporate entity based in London. It came two years after an earlier attempt to unify its structure in Rotterdam failed when investors revolted. Unilever said the unification gave it “greater strategic flexibility” and that the dual structure had hampered its ability to conduct acquisitions and asset sales quickly.

In December 2017 Paul Polman then chief executive of Unilever gave an interview to the Financial Times in which he highlighted activist investors in rivals such as Kraft Nestlé and Procter & Gamble. “If you don’t have an activist you feel like you’re doing something wrong these days” he said.

Speculation is rife that Unilever is in the sights of the billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz 79 who is retiring from the board of Procter & Gamble after nearly four years — and could be hunting for a new campaign. Elliott Management’s arrival at Glaxo Smith Kline showed how scale is no defence against an aggressive activist particularly when shares have underperformed and investors have grown restless.

The case for not breaking the business up is that a larger conglomerate creates economies of scale. There are questions as to whether two separate companies would achieve the sales growth needed to drive a significant shift in the share price. “We question whether the friction costs are going to be greater than the value created” said one top-20 investor.

A bigger purpose

Under Polman Unilever became an advocate of multi-stakeholder capitalism which urges companies to be conscious of their wider social impact. The Dutchman spoke of little else in his decade in charge. He helped rally business leaders to support the Paris climate accord in 2015 and pledged to create a more responsible business model. In 2017 Kraft Heinz made a takeover attempt for Unilever. Polman’s defence of the company — ultimately successful — centred on fears that Unilever’s US rival would destroy its culture with ruthless cost-cutting.

Jope has continued the mission. Shortly after being made chief executive he declared that Unilever would ditch products that lacked purposeful messaging. “We will dispose of brands that we feel are not able to stand for something more important than just making your hair shiny your skin soft your clothes whiter or your food tastier” he said.

Last week Unilever joined Amazon and Ikea in committing to using only zero-emission ships for cargo by 2040. It has also promised to make sure that all of its plastic and packaging is fully reusable recyclable or compostable by 2025.

But some think such crusading leaves Unilever more exposed to reputational risk. “They’ve set out their stall to be a leader of sustainability but the big fear is that somebody uncovers something they’re doing that isn’t great” said a top-20 investor citing the mission to encourage recycling — when most of its products are sold in plastic containers. “There’s a risk if you put yourself up on a pedestal people will throw rocks at you.”

Hunting for growth

Since taking over Jope has overhauled Unilever’s executive team and unified the structure to allow it to be more nimble in targeting acquisitions and making disposals. He has launched a €2 billion (£1.7 billion) efficiency drive. However his efforts have yet to feed through to the share price. “He’s done quite a lot but it’s almost like he’s put his foot down on the accelerator and it’s not connecting to the engine” said one investor. “I do think they’re constrained by the portfolio.”

Historically Unilever’s strong presence in emerging markets has given it an edge over rivals. In India it has hired local women as rural sales agents to sell Unilever products door-to-door in their communities — equipping them with smartphone apps to help manage inventory. In Pakistan Unilever trained hundreds of village women as beauticians working out of their homes; they charge for their services and earn commission on sales. In the Philippines the company has recruited larger stores to act as sub-distributors to the hundreds of thousands of smaller shops in the country.

But Unilever’s growth engine has been hit hard by Covid. Business in Thailand struggled due to the lack of tourists and in Vietnam where troops were deployed to deliver food sales fell almost 20 per cent. “Emerging markets is a differentiator” said one top investor. “At the moment it’s a differentiator to the downside.” Jope has his work cut out. The activists are watching.",,,,,,,,,

Why do people add an “s” to the end of so many words that don’t need it?

This is more of a Grammar Guru musing than a lesson but it’s a worthwhile and hilarious one. The idea was sparked by an entertaining Twitter discussion on Nashville-based author Mary Laura Philpott‘s Tweet below.

Why do we just LOVE to add the letter “s” to business names? Krogers? Nordstroms? Aldis? If you don’t do this you likely know someone who does.

I’ve heard tales of the companies themselves accidentally adding an “s” in marketing materials. I’ve heard of employees having to deal with people writing checks to the misspelled business. I’ve heard of career-long employees not saying their own employer’s name correctly. Apparently even the audio recording of the book The Queen’s Gambit includes the word Krogers.

In my hometown of Charlotte NC everyone said Eckerds and JC Penneys despite neither business ever having had an “s” on the end. Ever. So why do we do this who does it the most and what are some of the worst mistakes?

Common brands and businesses we INCORRECTLY add the letter “s” to I asked a lot of people and did a lot of research to find businesses that people attack with an unwarranted “s” most often. I tried to write these in order of most commonly to least commonly misspelled/misspoken. I left them without any apostrophes for clarity’s sake but will tackle that below.

Belks

Nordstroms (This actually used to be the correct spelling until the 1950s but most people who say this did not live in the 1950s.)

Barnes & Nobles

JC Penneys

Krogers

Aldis

Sbarros

Costcos

Piggly Wigglys

Winn-Dixies

Benihanas

Sonics

Walmarts

Why do we do this?

This Grammar Guru/language lover believes it’s a combination of these three phenomena.

REASON 1: This is a concept carried over from the past which is why older generations do it more than the younger ones. Department stores food markets and restaurants have a long history of being named after their founders and taking on the possessive form. In a Southern Living article on department stores of the past the majority of the 19 stores mentioned end in “s” and most of those are possessive names: Rich’s Loveman’s Davison’s Foley’s Joske’s Neilson’s Gayfers (which was originally Gayfer’s but dropped their apostrophe in 1970) Ivey’s McRae’s Burdine’s Furchgott’s Tapp’s… the list goes on. Almost all the places my grandparents’ generation patronized had a single person’s name or a family name behind them. The Meijer grocery chain in the Midwest was once “Meijer’s Thrifty Acres” so locals say “Meijer’s” constantly.

REASON 2: Many businesses that we frequent end in “s” or the “s” sound. Whole Foods Trader Joe’s Walgreens Starbucks and Publix to name a few. So perhaps we just want them all to sound the same?

REASON 3: Perhaps it rolls off the tongue. When people shorten Neiman Marcus they say Neiman’s instead of Neiman. I am guilty of adding an “s” to Barnes & Noble because I think it makes sense for both names to end the same way. There is a concept called “productivity” in linguistics that basically states that we use processes to form words. Adding an “s” happens a lot in English — to make something plural or to show possession. So it just makes sense in our brains to add an “s.”

Are we making it PLURAL or POSSESSIVE?

It could be both. Since this is mainly a spoken error it’s hard to know whether someone means to convey an “s” or with an apostrophe for the possessive. Most people interested in this topic think that these errors are not pluralizing but rather making the name possessive. Again likely harkening back to when you would quite literally walk down to Friedman’s and Mr. Friedman would greet you by name with a smile. It makes sense to relate a place of business to its owner.

Is this just a Southern thing?

It’s actually not! This happens everywhere my research finds. I read a lot of articles (and their comments sections) about people doing this in the Midwest and the Northeast and even in the UK and Australia. It seems this particular slip of the tongue slips all over the English language.

Some brands have purposefully dropped the apostrophe.

This is a tangent but an interesting one. Some businesses that have had the possessive “s” for decades have dropped the apostrophe EVEN THOUGH it’s still possessive. Starbucks Harrods Michaels and Tim Hortons are some examples. There are many reasons these companies slashed the apostrophe. Some wish to distance themselves from the person who founded the company. Some strive to be uniform succinct and able to fit into the digital age with ease (URLs and social media handles don’t have apostrophes). Maybe some save a little money on signage without the extra character. This is much to the dismay of many purists who know how silly it is to have a possessive WITHOUT an apostrophe.

If your mind is blown by this here is an article that dives deeply into the topic.

Do the companies CARE about this?

Not as much as the grammar snobs and NextDoor App trolls do apparently. Kroger did post this hilarious meme about the topic though seemingly in jest.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kroger (@krogerco)

Some brands have publicly said that the personification of their name (assuming it is possessive) is endearing and that they love it. It’s like the customer is approaching their store as if it is someone’s home. It shows familiarity and perhaps some nostalgia for the shopping days of old. Don’t get me wrong — there are some people who irrefutably do not know that it’s Nordstrom and not Nordstrom’s. Or maybe they do know but don’t care.

Whatever the reason there is rarely any confusion as to what you’re saying so let’s chalk this up to a quirky linguistic slip that has perhaps been born from previous generations. Whether or not it will stand the test of time is yet to be seen but I’m not correcting anyone’s grandma when she tells about all the deals she got at Krogers yesterday.

In the time of COVID-19 people are looking for ways to make their shopping trip as efficient as possible or even avoid perusing the shelves in-person altogether and opting for delivery instead. Luckily browsing new arrivals is easier than ever—and Kroger just dropped new frozen items on its website.

Under their ""New Arrivals"" section is an array of products that might help get you closer to finding everything you need all in one place to avoid that second grocery run. Some of these products will be available at your local store but since there are 2700+ Kroger stores in 35 states some items may not be at the one in your neighborhood yet. In any case here are six brands debuting 13 new items to stock your freezer with in October 2021.

Beyond Meat

Kroger is bringing more options for vegan and vegetarian shoppers with these two Beyond Meat products. Sizzle up a couple juicy protein-packed sausages with breakfast or toss some Italian-seasoned ""meatballs"" in a warm marinara-coated pasta.

Beyond Meat Beyond Breakfast Classic Plant-Based Sausage Links comes with 8 links per pack for $4.99 and Beyond Meat Italian Style Plant Based Meatballs includes 12 per pack for $4.99.

These pea-protein substitutes are made with all-natural non-GMO ingredients so that you can enjoy a convenient meal even if you're giving up meat or trying to cut saturated fat and sodium content from your diet. Both items are soy-free and gluten-free in case you were worried about those too.

Morning Star

These two MorningStar Farms additions to the freezer aisle can also help if you're quitting meat but still craving the taste of your favorite beef-flavored go-to's.

If you prefer your vegetarian-friendly sausage in patty-form look no further than the MorningStar Farms Veggie Breakfast Plant-Protein Hot and Spicy Meatless Sausage Patties with 8-ounces of meatless protein for $4.29.

Dreaming of a burger? The MorningStar Farms 16g Protein Grillers Prime Veggie Burgers could hit the spot. As you're taking in the last days of warm grilling weather or preparing game-day food for football season the charred flavor on these veggie burgers will leave you as satisfied as the real thing. The four-burger package runs for $4.29.

However both of these items do contain wheat. So if you're avoiding gluten opt for a different choice.

Totino's

Who doesn't love a convenient way to eat pizza? Kroger is adding Totino's Frozen Triple Cheese Party Pizza Pack to their aisles giving you a treat to bring to your socially-distanced get-togethers. One box holds 4 pizzas and can be prepared in a toaster oven in just 15 minutes.

With a listed serving size of only half a pizza this grocery cart add-on is something you can use in a pinch but we wouldn't recommend stocking up on this one every week.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Red Baron

Three new thick-crust Red Baron frozen pizzas arrived to suit any kind of pizza lover – Five Cheese Pepperoni and Supreme (stacked with pepperoni sausage peppers and onions). It's not suited for an everyday indulgence but at $7.49 for a 6-slice pie this might be handy to store in the back of your freezer for a rainy day to share.

Tyson

Kroger is bringing a handful of Tyson fully cooked options for when you don't want to think about food prep or venture out into the cold for fresh groceries. There are 4 varieties: Tyson Fully Cooked Chicken Nuggets Tyson Fully Cooked & Breaded Chicken Patties Family Pack Tyson Fully Cooked Crispy Chicken Strips and Tyson Fully Cooked and Breaded Southern Style Chicken Breast Tenderloins.

The chicken meat is free of antibiotics and contains no added hormones or steroids. While it can't help you with a well-balanced diet it does make a great occasional snack for $9.99.

Raised & Rooted

Even meatless customers love a good nugget and this one carries some heat. The Raised & Rooted Spicy Plant-Based Nuggets offer less saturated fat than traditional snack-sized chicken. This item is 8-ounces for $4.99 and chock-full of protein made up of vegan-friendly alternatives.

Though this option eliminates meat it carries 580 milligrams (25% daily value) of sodium in a single serving so just be careful if you're monitoring your salt intake.

Rare is the real estate agent who knew by the time they were a junior in college that the industry was calling. But in the case of Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate agent Austin Kent the calling was strong.

The 2016 SMU graduate who majored in Advertising with a focus in Digital Media Strategy and minored in Graphic Design says it was a no-brainer for him. Not only did real estate seem like a career he would enjoy and give him the flexibility to create his own schedule but he would be following in the footsteps of prior generations. Kent’s father was the director of construction at Lennar Homes and his grandfather an ironworker so a strong work ethic and ability to lead is at his very core.

By the time Kent got out of school he had already served as assistant superintendent for a builder in Austin flipped four homes and sold a spec home he built for $900000. He also started his own gym called Self Made Training Facility – during a pandemic no less. He wore all the hats there serving as broker builder owner and manager while continuing to sell real estate. The entrepreneurial life definitely suited him.

Fast forward to today and his nascent company Kent Development has almost 70 homes and townhomes scheduled to break ground in the next 12 months. The majority are near the Medical District as that is where he saw a great need. He also has a single family home near Inwood and Lovers and three duplexes due for completion in early 2022.

Kent has channeled his efforts to providing housing near the Medical District.

“I originally planned to build eight homes a year but the goal changed very quickly as the local new construction market picked up” Kent says. “I have found some pockets around town that are primed for what I’m doing. I like to say ‘Location is the best amenity you can have’ and then develop accordingly.”

Kent says he was heavily influenced down this road by his frequent conversations with Brian Buffini. If the name sounds familiar it’s because he is founder and chairman of Buffini & Company the largest training and coaching company in North America. (The website boasts 60000 real estate agents attend his seminars every year.) Buffini’s son AJ played football with Kent at SMU and the two were roommates. Kent had the opportunity to pick the elder Buffini’s brain and eventually Buffini pointed him – very directly – to DPMRE and the Phyllis Glover Group.

These interiors reflect the high quality and on-trend design and construction Kent is known for.

“When Brian Buffini makes a recommendation” Kent says “you jump on it! I did and joined her team as soon as I passed my exam in 2015. My learnings from that time with her were invaluable. I feel like once I got the fundamentals of real estate transactions down I was ready to explore some additional paths.”

As he ramps up for what’s sure to be a busy 2022 Kent’s quick to give credit to the incredible mentors he’s had along the way. In addition to his dad and grandfather Buffini and the late Glover Kent says his manager at the Park Cities office Lee Thomas has been a source of encouragement and advice as well.

“DPMRE has an incredible pool of talented realtors who know the Dallas market better than anyone else” Kent says. “Such an amazing support group over at DPMRE and I wouldn’t leave for anything.”

Be on the lookout for great things to come – actually continue coming – from this ambitious self starter. For more information on working with Austin call him at 503.505.4032 or email [email protected].",,,,,,,,,,,,

The X-59 QueSST (Quiet SuperSonic Technology) is being built to prove that by combining a new aerodynamic shape engine configuration and video-enabled controls the agency can reduce the amount of noise generated by sonic booms.

The X-59 is undergoing the Low Boom Flight Demonstration test program which involves running the aircraft through a series of flight tests that use microphone arrays. These arrays are installed on the ground to record sound levels as it travels as fast as Mach 1.42 (937mph).

X-59’s first flight is planned to take place next year with flights over populated communities planned for 2024.

Gathered test data is essential to internationally reversing a ban on commercial supersonic flights over land. The ban has existed since the first and only supersonic passenger aircraft Concorde operated between the UK France and the USA in 1976.

Nanoracks in collaboration with Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin has formed a team to develop the first-ever free-flying commercial space station.

The space station known as Starlab will be a continuously crewed commercial platform dedicated to conducting critical research fostering industrial activity and ensuring continued US presence and leadership in low-Earth orbit. Starlab is expected to achieve initial operational capability by 2027.

These industry leaders will develop Starlab specifically to enable the growing space economy and meet pent-up customer demand for space services such as materials research plant growth and astronaut activity.

Speaking about the collaboration Jeffrey Manber CEO and Co-Founder of Nanoracks said: “Since the beginning Nanoracks has sought to own and operate a private space station to fully unlock market demand. Our team has spent the last decade learning the business of space stations understanding customer needs charting market growth and self-investing in private hardware on the ISS like the Bishop Airlock. Nanoracks and our team are excited to work with NASA and our friends across the world as we move forward with Starlab.”

NASA recently announced the Commercial Low-Earth Orbit Destination (CLD) project to support the development of private space stations. CLD will stimulate a multifaceted LEO economy and provide science and crew capabilities in LEO before the International Space Station (ISS) retires.

Nanoracks will prime the Starlab development effort leveraging over a decade of experience as the pathfinder of and global leader in commercial ISS utilisation. Voyager Space the majority shareholder in Nanoracks will lead strategy and capital investment and Lockheed Martin will serve as the manufacturer and technical integrator.

The basic elements of the Starlab space station include a large inflatable habitat designed and built by Lockheed Martin a metallic docking node a power and propulsion element a large robotic arm for servicing cargo and payloads and a state-of-the-art laboratory system to host comprehensive research science and manufacturing capability. Starlab will be able to continuously host up to four astronauts for conducting critical science and research.

Lisa Callahan Vice President and General Manager Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed Martin added: “We’re excited to be part of such an innovative and capable team—one that allows each company to leverage their core strengths. Lockheed Martin’s extensive experience in building complex spacecraft and systems coupled with Nanoracks’ commercial business innovation and Voyager’s financial expertise allows our team to create a customer-focused space station that will fuel our future vision. We have invested significantly in habitat technology which enables us to propose a cost-effective mission-driven spacecraft design for Starlab.”

Nanoracks’ Starlab business model is designed to enable science research and manufacturing for global customers and bring added value to long-duration sovereign astronaut missions. Starlab will also serve tourism and other commercial and business activities.

Dylan Taylor Voyager Space Chairman & CEO stated: “Voyager Space is highly confident in the Starlab business model and its ability to be commercially sustainable and well-capitalised. Voyager Space sees numerous synergies leveraging the capabilities across our organization’s operating businesses as well as within the Lockheed Martin ecosystem. We see this partnership as just the beginning of our work together.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMjQvbmFub3JhY2tzLWFubm91bmNlcy1wbGFucy1mb3ItY29tbWVyY2lhbC1zcGFjZS1zdGF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nanoracks announces plans for commercial space station – Spaceflight Now,"Nanoracks announced Oct. 21 it is teaming with Lockheed Martin to develop a commercial crewed space station named Starlab that officials said could reach initial operational capability by 2027.

The commercial space lab will be continuously crewed to conduct critical research support off-planet industrial activity and ensure continued U.S. presence in low Earth orbit after the retirement of the International Space Station Nanoracks said in a press release.

Nanoracks launched a commercial airlock module to the International Space Station in December 2020 aboard a SpaceX cargo mission. The airlock is designed to transfer experiments and small satellites between the pressurized interior of the space station and the vacuum of space.

The company also arranges accommodations for commercial experiments at the space station and rides for small CubeSats to be deployed into orbit.

“Since the beginning Nanoracks has sought to own and operate a private space station to fully unlock market demand” said Jeff Manber CEO and co-founder of Nanoracks in a statement. “Our team has spent the last decade learning the business of space stations understanding customer needs charting market growth and self-investing in private hardware on the ISS like the Bishop Airlock. Nanoracks and our team are excited to work with NASA and our friends across the world as we move forward with Starlab.”

Lockheed Martin will design and build Starlab’s large inflatable habitat. The station will also include a metallic docking node a power and propulsion element and a large robotic arm for servicing cargo and payloads according to Nanoracks.

The station will continuously host up to four astronauts supporting scientific experiments and in-space manufacturing capabilities Nanoracks said.

“Nanoracks’ Starlab business model is designed to enable science research and manufacturing for global customers and bring added value to long-duration sovereign astronaut missions” the company said. “Starlab will also serve tourism and other commercial and business activities.”

Voyager Space the majority shareholder of Nanoracks will lead strategy and investment for the Starlab program. Nanoracks did not disclose the expected cost of the space station its plans for funding the venture or what vehicles it will use for crew and cargo transportation.

“We’re excited to be part of such an innovative and capable team — one that allows each company to leverage their core strengths” said Lisa Callahan vice president and general manager of commercial and civil space at Lockheed Martin. “Lockheed Martin’s extensive experience in building complex spacecraft and systems coupled with Nanoracks’ commercial business innovation and Voyager’s financial expertise allows our team to create a customer-focused space station that will fuel our future vision.

“We have invested significantly in habitat technology which enables us to propose a cost-effective mission-driven spacecraft design for Starlab” Callahan said in a statement.

Nanoracks a Houston-based company leads one of several teams developing concepts for commercial space stations.

Axiom Space another company headquartered in Houston won an award from NASA in 2020 to attach a commercial pressurized module to the International Space Station.

Axiom says their first ISS module is scheduled for launch in 2024 but it is just the first of several elements Axiom plans to attach to to the international research complex. Under Axiom’s roadmap the modules will eventually detach from the ISS to form a privately-owned space station.

Sierra Space a subsidiary of Sierra Nevada Corp. has also revealed its concept for a commercial space station in low Earth orbit.

The companies are vying for NASA support in a public-private partnership to develop a commercial replacement for the International Space Station.

NASA’s Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destination or CLD program aims to help U.S. industry develop commercial habitats where NASA astronauts foreign space fliers and private astronauts could visit live and work after retirement of the ISS.

NASA hopes to keep the International Space Station operating until at least 2030 but eventually wants to transition responsibility for low Earth orbit stations to the private sector. Agency officials say that will allow NASA to focus its resources on deep space exploration.

State-run Chinese media is claiming that the People’s Liberation Army has been able to track the U.S. Air Force’s Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over the East China Sea. While the Chinese report might be easily dismissed as propaganda—it is not beyond the realm of possibility. In fact—it’s very possible that China can track the Raptor. Stealth is not a cloak of invisibility after all. Stealth technology simply delays detection and tracking.

First off if a Raptor is carrying external fuel tanks—as it often does during “ferry missions”—it is not in a stealth configuration. Moreover the aircraft is often fitted with a Luneburg lens device on its ventral side during peacetime operations that enhances its cross section on radar.

That being said even combat-configured F-22s are not invisible to enemy radar contrary to popular belief . Neither is any other tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft with empennage surfaces such as tailfins—the F-35 PAK-FA J-20 or J-31. That’s just basic physics.

The laws of physics essentially dictate that a tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft must be optimized to defeat higher-frequency bands such the C X Ku and the top part of the S bands. There is a “step change” in a Low Observable (LO) aircraft’s signature once the frequency wavelength exceeds a certain threshold and causes a resonant effect. Typically that resonance occurs when a feature on an aircraft—such as a tail-fin — is less than eight times the size of a particular frequency wavelength. Effectively small stealth aircraft that do not have the size or weight allowances for two feet or more of radar absorbent material coatings on every surface are forced to make trades as to which frequency bands they are optimized for.

Therefore a radar operating at a lower-frequency band such as parts of the S or L band—like civilian air traffic control (ATC) radars—are almost certainly able to detect and track tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft. However a larger stealth aircraft like the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit which lacks many of the features that cause a resonance effect is much more effective against low-frequency radars than for example an F-35 or F-22. Typically however those lower-frequency radars do not provide what Pentagon officials call a “weapons quality” track needed to guide a missile onto a target. “Even if you can see an LO [low observable] strike aircraft with ATC radar you can’t kill it without a fire control system” an Air Force official had told me.

That being said Russia China and others are developing advanced UHF and VHF band early warning radars that use even longer wavelengths in an effort to cue their other sensors and give their fighters some idea of where an adversary stealth aircraft might be coming from. But the problem with VHF and UHF band radars is that with long wavelengths come large radar resolution cells. That means that contacts are not tracked with the required level of fidelity to guide a weapon onto a target. As one U.S. Navy officer rhetorically asked “Does the mission require a cloaking device or is it OK if the threat sees it but can’t do anything about it?”

Traditionally guiding weapons with low frequency radars has been limited by two factors. One factor is the width of the radar beam while the second is the width of the radar pulse—but both limitations can be overcome with signal processing. Phased array radars—particularly active electronically scanned arrays (AESA)—solve the problem of directional or azimuth resolution because they can steer their radar beams electronically. Moreover AESA radars can generate multiple beams and can shape those beams for width sweep rate and other characteristics. Indeed some industry experts suggested that a combination of high-speed data-links and low-frequency phased-array radars could generate a weapons quality track.

The U.S. Navy and Lockheed may have already solved the problem. The service openly talks about the E-2D’s role as the central node of its NIFC-CA battle network to defeat enemy air and missile threats. Rear Adm. Mike Manazir  the Navy’s director of air warfare described the concept in detail at the U.S. Naval Institute just before Christmas in 2013 .

Under the NIFC-CA ‘From the Air’ (FTA) construct the APY-9 radar would act as a sensor to cue Raytheon AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles for Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets fighters via the Link-16 datalink. Moreover the APY-9 would also act as a sensor to guide Raytheon Standard SM-6 missiles launched from Aegis cruisers and destroyers against targets located beyond the ships’ SPY-1 radars’ horizon via the Cooperative Engagement Capability datalink under the NIFC-CA ‘From the Sea’ (FTS) construct. In fact the Navy has demonstrated live-fire NIFC-CA missile shots using the E-2D’s radar to guide SM-6 missiles against over-the-horizon shots—which by definition means the APY-9 is generating a weapons quality track.

That effectively means that stealthy tactical aircraft must operate alongside electronic attack platforms the like Boeing EA-18G Growler . It is also why the Pentagon has been shoring up American investments in electronic and cyber warfare . As one Air Force official explained stealth and electronic attack always have a synergistic relationship because detection is about the signal-to-noise ratio. Low observables reduce the signal while electronic attack increases the noise. “Any big picture plan looking forward to deal with emerging A2/AD threats will address both sides of that equation” he said.

The Philippine House of Representatives has approved the request of the Hukbong Himpapawid ng Pilipinas (PAF Philippine Air Force) for additional funding to acquire five new Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 2022 budget has been amended for down payment on the new transporters.

According to the Scramble Magazine database the PAF has four operational C-130s in its inventory which are operated by the 222nd Airlift Squadron Hercules at Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base.

The acquisition of new equipment is part of the AFP modernisation programme which is a priority measure of the president Duterte administration. It has not been reported if the PAF intends to acquire the C-130J or C-130J-30 model.

LOW,Lowe's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbXBlci5jb20vbGlmZS93aGVuLWRvZXMtbG93ZXMtcHV0LW91dC1jaHJpc3RtYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When Does Lowe's Put Out Christmas 2021? The Aisles Are Stocked,"Lowe’s is not just the place you can pick up tools home appliances and plants for the garden. The retail store also gives us another spot to grab cool holiday decorations like outdoor inflatables for the yard Christmas trees wreaths garland and even fun pathway markers.

What is known today as one of the largest retail stores started as a small hardware store in 1946. But even before that it was a general store founded by L.S. Lowe’s in 1921 and called Lowe’s North Wilkesboro Hardware in North Carolina. Over a couple of decades the company was passed to family members one of which saw the rise in need for construction after WWII so he decided to restructure the store’s aim to home improvement.

Since then the home improvement oasis has become a national chain and expanded on the products you can find including being able to grab something Christmasy.

But before you can deck the halls you need to know when Lowe’s puts out their holiday items.

When Does Lowe’s Put Out Holiday Decorations?

Sure the Thanksgiving turkeys haven’t been purchased yet but that doesn’t mean you have to wait to feel the holly and start planning exactly how you want your holiday ambiance to flow.

And Lowe’s is already prepared for early shoppers.

“We put our holiday items out on September 24” a member of Lowe’s headquarters office tells Romper. “We couldn’t sell them before the 24th of September so they are definitely out now.”

A Lowe’s retail member confirms that holiday items are currently available on the floor at her store. “We already have our Christmas stuff out. It’s been out for a couple of weeks now.”

They have a wide range of products from the large tree you’re eager to put up to the smallest trinkets and knick-knacks. Lowe’s even has a special section for holiday decorations under $15 so every purchase doesn’t have to break the bank or cut too deep into your wallet. And if you see something special online that isn’t at your local store Lowe’s can make it happen.

“Some items are in stores and some are for delivery and shipping only. But if you order they can be shipped to the store in three to five days” the headquarters representative says.

Go ahead and let out that holiday spirit you’ve been suppressing all year!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yc3BvcnQuY29tL21vdG8yL25ld3MvZW1pbGlhLXJvbWFnbmEtbG93ZXMtd2luLWZlcm5hbmRlei1jcmFzaC82NzA3MTQzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emilia Romagna Moto2: Lowes wins Fernandez crashes out,"Ajo KTM rider Fernandez trailed teammate Gardner by nine points coming into Sunday’s Misano race and was on course to take the championship lead when he crashed out of the lead on lap 15.

Poleman Sam Lowes took the lead of the race at the start from Aspar’s Aron Canet and Speed Up’s Jorge Navarro while Fernandez was seventh and Gardner 12th.

Canet took the lead for the first time into the Quercia hairpin while Navarro would demote the Marc VDS rider come the third tour.

Fernandez had worked his way to fourth by the second lap and on lap four moved into the podium places in third ahead of Navarro as Lowes returned to the lead.

As Lowes stretched his lead to over seven tenths Fernandez’s charge continued on Canet into Quercia to move into second and begin his assault on the lead.

A lap later the championship picture took a twist as Gardner collided with Honda Team Asia’s Somkiat Chantra into the Caro hairpin at Turn 14.

Gardner was eventually hit with a long-lap penalty by Race Direction on lap 15 while Fernandez capitalised on a mistake for Lowes on the previous tour to take the lead.

But just moments after Gardner was first notified of his penalty Fernandez sensationally locked the front of his Ajo bike and suffered a fast crash into Quercia while leading.

Fernandez walked away unscathed while Gardner lost no positions in seventh when he took his penalty.

At the front Lowes ran wide on lap 18 at Quercia and allowed Canet into the lead but carved past into Turn 2 a few laps later – the Briton having a big moment as he changed direction up the inside of the Aspar rider.

Lowes subsequently broke free of Canet to claim his first win of the season since April’s Doha GP.

Canet fell into the clutches of a late-charge from the sister Marc VDS Kalex of Augusto Fernandez who had to serve a long lap penalty at the start of the race for blocking Canet in qualifying on Saturday.

Augusto Fernandez snatched second from Canet out of the final corner as the Aspar rider’s fuel-starved bike began to cut out to complete a Marc VDS 1-2 for the first time since 2017.

Canet held onto third from VR46 rider Celestino Vietti and Navarro while Stefano Manzi got his Pons Kalex to the chequered flag in sixth.

Gardner came home seventh after a late crash for the sister VR46 bike of Marc Bezzecchi with the Australian now 18 points clear of teammate Fernandez in the championship.

Gresini’s Fabio Di Giannantonio was eighth with Honda Team Asia’s Ai Ogura and American Racing rider Marcos Ramirez rounded out the top 10.

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS9lbnRlcnByaXNlLXN0b3J5LzIwMjEvMTAvbHVsdWxlbW9ucy1hdGhsZXRpY2EtcGFzc2FnZS1pbmRpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stories about startups & entrepreneurships,"Athletic-apparel retailer Lululemon Athletica styles itself as lululemon athletica. Headquartered in Vancouver Canada it has 521 company-operated stores in 17 countries—315 of these are in the US and 62 in Canada.





Unsurprisingly North America contributes more than 85 percent of lululemon athletica's revenue of $4.4 billion in 2020.





But in early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic posed a number of hard questions for the retailer as its management reinforced the 'Power of Three' strategy in the backdrop of several lockdowns. Keeping stores shut was the primary reason for a 34 percent dip in lululemon athletica's in-store revenue.





Lululemon Athletica's Power of Three strategy focuses on product innovation omni-guest experiences and international expansion.





""Each of these goals is heavily reliant on technology"" notes Julie Averill Executive Vice President and CTO Lululemon Athletica. ""As we saw a consumer shift and employees start to work from home technology had to change with this.""

On the product-innovation front lululemon athletica acted on opening its India Tech Hub in Bengaluru earlier this month. It has employed 70 people and aims to grow the team to 250 before 2023.





The company appointed Vaidyanathan Seshan Vice President - Information Technology as Head of its India Tech Hub. Seshan has been with the company in Seattle since February 2018. He and Praveen Mysore Senior Director of lululemon athletica in Vancouver have moved to India to grow the team here.





Its technology organisation is 1500-people strong and the company has around 25000 employees globally.





Lululemon Athletica also acquired in-home fitness company MIRROR for $500 million in June 2020. Founded in 2018 MIRROR hosts weekly live classes on-demand workouts as well as immersive one-on-one personal training.





""The acquisition gives us tremendous potential to connect more content more classes and more guests"" Averill says. One thing was evident: it wants to expand in direct-to-customer (D2C) and expand its omni-guest experiences.





""We realised we have to shore up our technology organisation"" Averill says. ""We began investing in technology and leadership."" And the company wants to decentralise the technology buildout.





""We are figuring out how to be both omni-channel and locally relevant"" she says. ""Areas like payments are different by geography as are the services we offer."" Lululemon Athletica doubled its D2C business clocking $2.3 billion in 2020. It now accounts for nearly 52 percent of net revenue.





""Architecturally we don’t develop anything just for one channel"" Seshan points out. ""We always look at technology from the lens of multi-channel and global. Our foundation architecture is designed for that.""

During the pandemic this meant build out locally-relevant technologies across markets. ""The experiences may differ by country. But we continue to innovate to serve our guests where they are and how they want us to show up for them"" Averill says citing its products that have enabled lululemon to be present for customers to buy online order online and pick up at the kerbside or even at its stores.





Its international expansion entailed 18 stores in the Asia-Pacific region and three in Europe. This spurred its international markets' growth by 31 percent compared to North America's 8 percent in 2020.





""Our growth is coming from Asia and India is in the time zone of APAC"" Seshan says. ""So there is China as well as Europe. And we can serve the rest of the world for growth from the India Tech Hub.""





The other aspect about lululemon athletica is its supply chain: 33 percent of its products are manufactured in Vietnam 20 percent in Cambodia 12 percent in Sri Lanka and 9 percent in China.





""As a vertical-focused retailer we make our own products"" Seshan adds. ""So we have data end to end—from the factory to assortment of merchandise at stores and are fortunate to work with this huge amount of data.""





Little wonder the India Tech Hub has begun with a focus on areas like artificial intelligence data sciences and product development for its lululemon athletica's global markets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlL25vdy1pcy10aGUtdGltZS10by1zaG9wLXdpdGgtY2FycmVmb3VyLWZyaWRheXMtdW5iZWF0YWJsZS1vZmZlcnMtdHI0cDl3ZXbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Now is the time to shop with Carrefour Friday's unbeatable offers,"Dubai: Carrefour owned and operated by Majid Al Futtaim in the UAE has announced its shopping extravaganza Carrefour Friday.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvdHJ1bXAtaXJzLWNoaWNhZ28tYXVkaXQtMDAxNTc0ODDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump may face a $100M-plus tax bill if he loses IRS audit fight over Chicago tower according to report,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/11/trump-irs-chicago-audit-00157480 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvdHJ1bXAtaXJzLWNoaWNhZ28tYXVkaXQtMDAxNTc0ODDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Michael Jordan card could fetch $5M at auction: Ken Goldin reveals '100 best collectibles',"Goldin Auction’s second annual Goldin 100 event displays the rarest and most valuable collectibles of the year.

The 2024 roundup does not disappoint with a variety of pop culture items and sports memorabilia including a one-of-a-kind signed Michael Jordan 2003 ultimate collection card.

The card is currently valued at $2 million but Goldin Auctions CEO and founder Ken Goldin told FOX Business in an on-camera interview that he thinks it could sell for much more than that.

""It probably will sell for between $3 million and $5 million"" he said. ""I think [it’s] the best-ever Michael Jordan card.""

Any offer over $2.7 million will be a record sale for a Michael Jordan card according to Goldin.

The auction also features a 1957 Mickey Mantle game-used jersey that Goldin expects to be a seven-figure item — along with a pair of Michael Jordan’s shoes that the star wore during the Aug. 1985 game when he shattered a backboard.

""The glass collapsed down and [the shoe] actually has a piece of glass in it"" Goldin said. ""It’s the only time Michael Jordan ever broke a backboard in his pro career.""

Among the items in other categories Goldin is auctioning off a highest-grade copy of the first-ever issue of Playboy Magazine featuring Marilyn Monroe on the cover and a rare copy of a Superman No. 1 DC comic book from 1939.

""We even have Harry Houdini’s belt buckle that he was wearing the night he performed his last act and died"" Goldin said.

Hong Kong Marathon runners wearing clothing with the slogan “Hong Kong add oil” were stopped at the starting line days after the organizer said the slogan would be acceptable.

“Add oil” is a Cantonese slang phrase which means “keep it up.”

Hong Kong Marathon's 42-kilometer full marathon 21km half-marathon and 10km races started on Sunday morning. It is the first mega sports event held in Hong Kong since the national security law took effect last year.

Several runners were told to change their clothes with logos or slogans that said ""Hong Kong add oil"" before they could join the race.

A man who tattooed the slogan ""Hong Kong add oil"" on his leg was asked to cover it with a bandage.

A participant who wore a black undershirt with the word ""Hong Kong"" on it was also taken to the security checkpoint.

On last Monday the event's organizing chairman William Ko Wai-lam said runners are allowed to wear any color to the event as long as ""it doesn't affect other runners.""

Asked if runners can display political slogans Ko said the phrase ""Hong Kong add oil"" should be acceptable but he still recommended runners reword it to ""runners add oil.""

On Sunday Ko said the organizer didn't want any political elements to appear in the sports event.

No runner has been disqualified due to to their attitre he said.

The police said on Saturday that they would send the Counter Terrorism Response Unit and Railway Response Team to cover multiple routes of the marathon races to prevent and fight against terrorism.

Organizers of the race also said they would seek help from law enforcement agencies if runners breached the law or the event's rules and cautioned runners against pulling political stunts or making the run a protest.

Political messages aside some runners put on attire inspired by Squid Game -- a South Korean drama that went viral recently.

A participant cosplayed as the drama's main character Seong Gi-hun wearing a jersey with his identifying number ""456."" Another female runner dressed up as a robot in the drama which identified failing participants to be shot to death.

Some runners told local news outlets that they were ordered to change or cover up clothing that read ""Hong Kong Add Oil!""

The slogan was widely adopted by demonstrators at the large and often violent pro-democracy protests that shook the city in 2019 and infuriated China.

Organisers had warned ahead of the race that political slogans would not be tolerated and when around 15000 runners turned up on Sunday some were told they could not start if they bore the slogan according to local media reports.

One woman told CitizenNews that she was escorted to a booth by police during a security check and told she was wearing a ""political outfit"" - her shorts had ""Hong Kong Add Oil!"" on them.

A man told HK01 another local outlet that after intervention by police officers marathon staff told him to remove his shirt that had the slogan on it and run in his blazer.

Another participant who had the phrase tattooed on his leg was left with plastic tape covering the text HK01 added.

""This is a sports event and we do not wish to see any political element"" Mr William Ko the marathon organising committee's chair said at a press conference after the race.

He did not elaborate on why the slogan - which pre-dates the 2019 protests - was problematic.

""Add oil"" is a ubiquitous phrase of encouragement used across Chinese languages and cultures.

A parent might shout it at a child's sports day or before they take an exam. Someone might use it to urge a friend to keep pressing on at a time of adversity.

Hong Kong police did not directly address the reports involving the slogan in response to an AFP query.

""If the event organiser encounters situations that damage social peace and violate the law they can seek help from police. During this event police did not receive any reports"" the force said in a statement.",,,,,,,,,

I

The 15 starting with six luxury hotels are W Jaipur JW Marriott Ranthambore Resort & Spa JW Marriott Chennai ECR Resort & Spa JW Marriott Agra Resort & Spa JW Marriott Goa JW Marriott Shimla Resort & Spa Moxy Mumbai Andheri West Courtyard by Marriott Gorakhpur Courtyard by Marriott Tiruchirappalli Courtyard by Marriott Goa Arpora Courtyard by Marriott Ranchi two Fairfields by Marriott Jaipur Katra Marriott Resort & Spa and Westin Goa.





The new signings are indicative of the growing demand for domestic travel and luxury stays in India especially at leisure destinations even as the hospitality sector in the country rapidly recovers.





Forbes India spoke to him about the reasons behind Indian hospitality’s rapid recovery current trends in Singapore-based Rajeev Menon President Asia Pacific (excluding Greater China) Marriott International  visited India after a gap of almost one-and-a-half years to meet his colleagues and partners and take stock of the business in the country. During his official trip to New Delhispoke to him about the reasons behind Indian hospitality’s rapid recovery current trends in luxury hospitality  the new age of digital-savvy and multi-tasking hotel employees and support required from the government to accelerate business.





What do these new deals and openings tell us about the hospitality industry in India today?





Even in the toughest time (Covid-19 pandemic) in the industry it is great to see that the long-term fundamentals of travel and tourism remain pretty strong. We are always looking for more opportunities in India and I am extremely proud of the team for the record number of signings.





As people are coming out of the pandemic  they want to travel and spend time with family. As access to international destinations such as Europe or Thailand is still restricted people are looking inward and exploring domestic destinations which is great for our resorts. You see this trend and pattern in the new deals as well. Over 50 percent of the upcoming properties are leisure-oriented and luxury especially of JW Marriott. It is a testimony of how popular the brand is in India and how strong is our partners’ confidence in it especially after seeing the demand and success of JW Marriott - Mussoorie Walnut Grove Resort.





Why is there a focus on luxury properties at leisure destinations?





For a number of years even in pre-Covid times we saw leisure travel grow 4X times than business travel across the globe. Luxury travel is growing in double digits year on year. Even in India there is more demand for leisure travel. While Goa has always been India’s playground in a country as large as India the number of luxury resorts and hotels at other leisure destinations is limited. Even in the Covid pandemic people want to go out and take short breaks of 3 to 5 days and are happy driving to a destination.





Also as wealth increases the aspiration to travel grows as well. Hence you see a lot more leisure and luxury development.





Amongst upcoming hotels there is one Moxy property in Mumbai which will mark the brand’s debut here. Globally there is a lot of demand for Moxy a young millennial brand and our Mumbai partner with whom we have another property in the city was also keen on having one in Andheri.





How has the hospitality industry changed and evolved in the pandemic?





Much has changed from both the consumer and business point of view.





Contactless experience: Customers and hotel associates have leapfrogged in the use of technology. Did you ever use a QR code for anything in a hotel before Covid? Today if you walk into a Customers and hotel associates have leapfrogged in the use of technology. Did you ever use a QR code for anything in a hotel before Covid? Today if you walk into a restaurant and somebody gives you a menu you would wonder what’s going on and demand a QR code. We see contactless experience led by technology being widely accepted now even though we were pushing for it even before the pandemic. At most Marriott hotels around the world you can now check in check out order food access elevators all without making any or very limited contact with hotel staff.





Hybrid meetings: Globally meetings and conferences were a major part of our business before the pandemic. It’s not that people won’t meet face to face anymore but hybrid meetings are here to stay. You will have a few people attend the physical meeting at the venue and many others will dial-in virtually. This is and will be the new normal. All hotels are equipping themselves with the required technology to bring in people from across the world to virtually attend the meeting happening at a place.





Purposeful travel: During the lockdown most people had the time to reflect about the lifestyle they lead and the choices they make and their impact on the planet. People are now more drawn towards purposeful travel are keener on giving back to the community look after the world and stay with hotels that they know are making a difference. Early this year we launched the Good Travel - During the lockdown most people had the time to reflect about the lifestyle they lead and the choices they make and their impact on the planet. People are now more drawn towards purposeful travel are keener on giving back to the community look after the world and stay with hotels that they know are making a difference. Early this year we launched the Good Travel - Marriott Bonvoy programme in 15 of our hotels around the world and it has been received very well. In the Maldives we have the coral planting project and it’s incredible to see the kind of engagement we have been getting for it from our guests. We are now expanding the programme to all resorts and will eventually bring it to the city hotels as well.





Given the technological advancement has Marriott changed its hiring in any way? Are you hiring fewer people?





We haven’t changed our hiring policy but there is a real need to multi-skill our associates. When I started my career 30 years ago all roles were assigned. A cashier would only do his job; someone else would only check-in guests. But today everyone is doing a little bit of everything. People across verticals are assisting guests helping out with F&B if required and doing more.





So multi-skilling and digital learning have become very important for hospitality employees.





We have a digital learning zone for employees and associates are required to take live classes.





You could say that hotels have become leaner (not hiring as many employees per hotel as before the pandemic) but it varies in different hotels. But yes productivity across hotels has definitely improved.





Do you see a recovery in the hospitality sector?





Globally we are in the recovery phase . In June of this year our global RevPar (Revenue per available room) was down 38 percent as compared to 2019. In July it was down 23 percent to 2019.





We have seen that recovery in bigger markets such as the US and China is quite strong. In China our RevPar in July was 9 percent more than 2019. But in August they had a couple of cases and they shut down a few cities impacting the business.





Wherever the government has been able to contain the virus and ease restrictions business has been bouncing back rapidly.





In India in the second quarter of this year during the humanitarian crisis of the deadly second wave of Covid-19 in the country our RevPar was down 74 percent. In comparison in July it was down only 47 percent and in August we were down about 40 percent.





In Asia (except for China) India is growing at the fastest rate and I think the domestic business in India will bounce back to 2019 levels by next year.





What is your recovery plan for India?





It is evident that countries with a bigger domestic base will recover faster. Our focus in India too is on inbound travel and to go hyper local. That’s the key phrase in the recovery plan.





Currently the leisure sector is leading the recovery. Fifty percent of our booking is coming in three to four days before the travel date. We are also seeing some growth in the corporate sector with bookings from SMEs. They are already on the move and we are ensuring that our customers have a seamless booking experience on all our digital booking platforms.





Some innovations introduced in the lockdown have been doing very well. And one of them is Marriott Bonvoy on Wheels . If you had asked me how many hotels provided take-away food pre-pandemic I would have told you not many because we were not necessarily in that business except for maybe Diwali hampers. But in the pandemic  we have seen a real shift here. People across Asia have become comfortable ordering from hotels and we see a real growth in take-away dining experiences. India is currently leading this growth.





We are rapidly adopting newer technologies for people to have a quick and efficient ordering experience.





Out of all the current trends which ones do you think are here to stay and which ones may not be that prominent post the pandemic?





The trend of staycations is here to stay. Most people never checked into a hotel a few kilometres down the road from where they are staying but in the pandemic they did that and have enjoyed it. Everyone is keen on just getting out for a bit so people will continue taking multiple short trips over the weekends and on special occasions.





Also safety and hygiene is and will continue to be the point of entry for any customer into a hotel. These will be the minimum ask. Customers will book with brands they trust to have superior hygiene and safety measures.





What kind of support do you expect from the government to accelerate the recovery of the hospitality business in India? Do you plan to shut any Marriott hotels in the near future?









If the government lends its support in marketing India as a safe destination I genuinely see incredible opportunity for the Indian hospitality industry to grow.





Also when it comes to Marriott we have been growing at an exponential rate in the country. Our first managed hotel here the Goa Marriott Resort & Spa opened in 1999. Today we have 125 hotels across 16 brands and we will get to 200 hotels by 2025. I am not aware of any that will shut down. Has the pandemic taken its toll? Yes. But we have been working with our partners and finding ways to not only survive the pandemic but in the long run also thrive.

The Reykjavik Edition has been designed by local architecture firm T.ark and New York-based studio Roman and Williams with guidance from the Ian Schrager Company design.

The hotel is located on the harbourside adjacent to Harpa the city’s concert hall and conference centre and is minutes from the shopping street Laugavegur in downtown Reykjavik.

The legacy that the program holds would not be where it is today had it not been for the previous generations of batters pitchers and coaches who graced the field as Profs.

This year the Shirley O’Day-Joy Solomen Rowan Glassboro State Athletic Hall of Fame welcomes one of the program’s all-time pitchers Bob Pfeffer to the Hall with the Class of 2021.

Pfeffer’s on-field contributions date back to the late 1970’s playing as a four-year starter from 1975 to 1978 while he was the team’s ace for both the 1977 and 1978 seasons. In each of those seasons Glassboro State made a run at the College World Series winning the title in 1978 under legendary coach Dr. Mike Briglia.

Pfeffer was instrumental in the team’s success over that two-year period. In 1978 alone he started 17 games and pitched 121 full innings which still stand today as the school’s all-time single-season records in each of those categories.

When it mattered the most in the 1978 NCAA Regionals with the Profs desperately in need of two wins over Lynchburg to advance Pfeffer’s durability and skill kept him on the mound for 18 full innings. Twelve of those innings came in one complete game which was Glassboro State’s first win over Lynchburg during the Regional and that game still remains one of the most memorable games in his career.

“It was such an up and down game where we had the lead then didn’t have it and had to come back” said Pfeffer when asked about the game that saved their season in 1978. “There was a lot of drama in that game – it was about 90 degrees very humid – It was just an intense game.”

After defeating Lynchburg once Glassboro State went on to do it again in game two of that series. Pfeffer started and pitched 6 2/3 innings in that game as well which helped the Profs ultimately win in 15 long innings. The victory put them in the College World Series which the Profs won behind the Pfeffer’s outstanding pitching. To him the win was redemption from the team’s third-place finish from the previous year.

“We went there our junior year and came in third and we were heartsick because we knew we were good enough to win it. I think at the beginning of the year [1978] that was the number one mission: win the College World Series. We had been there [in 1977] and had it right on the fingertips and we let it slip away. Everything we did [in 1978] was to win the College World Series.”

Pfeffer was unarguably an essential part of the team’s championship. For his contributions on the mound in the playoffs he was named the Most Outstanding Player of both the Regional and the College World Series.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2loZy1zZWxsLWtpbXB0b24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intercontinental Hotel Group: Please Sell Kimpton,"My dear readers some links on this site pay us referral fees for sending business and sales.

Kimpton Fills A Unique Market Position

Kimpton IHG’s smartest acquisition was purchased to fill a mid-market gap with modern hotels and a cool factor reminiscent of W Andaz and Edition. Kimpton focuses on design and plays to a young affluent crowd though many of their properties are rather affordable. W Hotels is a lot more money for a similar product Andaz too but the latter is just a little less loud than W. Kimpton has the design and for lack of a better word sass of W without the hefty price point.

Kimpton is a small chain (just 1.2% of IHG’s portfolio) upmarket of Indigo but more accessible than the newly acquired Six Senses.

IHG Is Just Terrible

For all of its faults IHG has identified its market gaps: luxury lifestyle resort – and has worked to bring brands in to fill those gaps. For the top end of the market Regent was acquired by the hotelier to compete with Park Hyatt Waldorf-Astoria (Hilton) St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton (Marriott.) At the time it the 51% stake was purchased Regent was just six properties; IHG intends to grow it to 40 hotels. For one of the world’s largest chains (6031 hotels worldwide) a six property entrance into the $60bn luxury hotel market sums up the brand’s approach nicely.

Intercontinental Hotel Group cannot be trusted with the long-term survival of a meaningful loyalty program. Kimpton developed its own Inner Circle with great perks and a unique culture. They promoted a “secret word” its members could say at check in that would deliver a Kimpton Inner Circle gift; both the perks and secret word changed quarterly keeping members engaged.

Meanwhile IHG doesn’t offer late guaranteed 4 pm checkout free breakfast nor confirmable upgrades to its most loyal IHG Rewards Club customers amassing 75 or more stays in a calendar year. To get some (but not all) of those benefits you’d need to apply and pay $200 – and that only corresponds to Platinum status.

IHG Rewards Club points have devalued its redemptions over the last few years from 50000 points as the highest category to trying to sneak in a hike to 120000 during the pandemic. They ultimately retreated following substantial vitriol from members. The credit card delivers little value when compared with competing brands and they don’t seem to care. It doesn’t help to earn IHG Rewards points if they devalue faster than other programs for hotel stays you rarely want to book anyway.

As much as I dislike Marriott Bonvoy even that program is more trustworthy and delivers more value than IHG and would be a better home for the brand.

IHG hates its elites. Even as a Business Edge IHG Rewards member I found little value in the program and virtually no access to Rewards Club Customer Care Center help for large bookings of many guests for an extended period of time.

Why IHG Should Sell Kimpton

IHG has helped Kimpton grow from a few dozen properties to 75 in 50+ cities. Is there a more perfect time to sell? IHG has been able to acquire the brand add customers (whether they are a good fit or not more on that below) add value and now can sell a far more mature brand with greater reach.

The reason why other brands are able to grow and build a following with their premium brands is that their offerings are broader. Premium brands at SPG represented a far larger percentage of its portfolio. Hyatt also has a significant amount of their brand coming in above select service categories (Hyatt Place Hyatt House) and Marriott does a better job of this than IHG. Here’s a great example as to why:

A premium guest who spends time at Intercontinental properties for work in major cities wants to relax on vacation with her family. In Hawaii for example there are just two properties – none of them full service. In Barcelona all of the choices for IHG are sub $100/night with the exception of the Intercontinental a Kimpton and a Hotel Indigo. We find the same limited offerings outside of select service in Rome. A premium business traveler does not want to stay in the Holiday Inn Express Waikiki.

It doesn’t fit with the rest of their brand because it doesn’t fit with their customer base. The majority of customers are Holiday Inn customers (I’m not throwing shade it was the best hotel in a city I worked in extensively and I earned Spire status because of it) but those are rarely willing to pay the premium for Kimpton. That said some Kimptons are priced below where they could be with a more premium customer base and marketing that works for those brands.

Conclusion

I really enjoy Kimpton hotels. Each one I have visited delivers a cool factor worthy of a premium. If they were part of a loyalty program where I had a broader range (both up and down lines) I’d be far more likely to choose them as often as possible. The reason I don’t is because there aren’t enough of them to make them my primary chain and there’s simply not enough other quality brands in a loyalty program that returns value to me. For IHG’s part they have built up the brand and can turn a profit on the larger product but Kimpton just doesn’t fit in with the rest of its customer base.

What do you think? Should IHG sell Kimpton? Should it keep the brand and grow it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFuaG9zcGl0YWxpdHkuY29tL3NoaXZzdGFyLWludmVzdG1lbnRzLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tZmFpcmZpZWxkLWlubi1zdWl0ZXMtaW4tdGFtcGEtZmwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shivstar Investment Breaks Ground On Fairfield Inn & Suites,"SHIVSTAR INVESTMENTS LED by Pravin Gadhia and Pankaj Patel has broken ground on its Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott in Tampa Florida.

Your HR Department Is About to Be Transformed,"Photo: Getty Images

Diversity initiatives and technology are sweeping through companies transforming the meaning of HR and the roles within the HR department.

BRINK spoke to Jeanne Meister of Executive Networks about the big changes that are happening in the HR industry.

MEISTER: The first big event that changed HR practices has been the pandemic which accelerated all the macro-trends around the future of work that HR professionals have been talking about in the last couple of years such as remote working employee well-being the future skills needed to thrive in the workplace and so forth.

The second game-changer is the digital transformation of HR — nearly every function in an organization has gone through a digital transformation and HR is now being transformed so that its services are seamlessly accessible by employees.

A Consumer-Grade HR Experience

But the biggest recent shift by far in HR is the focus on employee experience which really means creating a compelling experience for prospective employees and current employees.

Companies are now expected to offer a consumer-grade employee experience one that mirrors their best customer experiences. So we have companies that are creating new positions like the Director of Employee Experience that is focused on bringing learning knowledge and resources to do one’s job into the flow of working.

A growing number of companies are also focused on providing a whole suite of services for improving an employee’s experience a prime example of this is Microsoft Viva.

Finally and related to this is a focus on employees’ well-being and mental health especially during the last 18 disruptive months with so many employees working virtually. This focus on mental health has been expanded from the individual employee to helping the entire family unit of the employee.

BRINK: On the subject of employees and their well-being you’re predicting that HR departments will soon have a role called a Distraction Prevention Coach. What does that mean?

MEISTER: Being distracted at work entails not only a loss of your productivity but it elevates your stress levels and so this falls into the bucket of helping employees with their well-being at work.

This is basically helping employees to identify those moments when they are distracted and what they can do about it to stay focused. Because as we all know when you get in the flow of anything you’re working on you’re happier you’re more productive and you get your job done faster.

BRINK: One striking thing about these new HR jobs of the future is how many are tech-related with strange-sounding positions like Chatbot & Human Facilitator and Algorithm Bias Auditor.

MEISTER: I think it’s fair to say that there’s no such thing as technology companies and service companies anymore. Everybody is now a technology company.

Artificial intelligence tools have entered the workplace but not without the potential for harm and bias. Back in 2019 Future Workplace conducted a survey of 8370 HR leaders hiring managers and workers across 10 countries and found that 80% of workers said their employer should ask for permission before using artificial intelligence to gather any data on them.

So I think that some employees are leery of possible data breaches in our personal lives and hence they are wondering how will companies leverage AI in the workplace to collect data which data will be collected how long will the data be kept by the company what will the company do about it and will it be transparent?

All of that has led to this job that we identified in the 21 HR Jobs of the Future article called the Human Bias Officer. That’s somebody who works not so much in HR but with HR the legal department and the compliance department to mitigate bias and ensure that the algorithms being used are explainable and transparent and to share what the company is actually doing with all this data.

The growing presence of artificial intelligence in the workplace is requiring companies through their legal and compliance and risk management departments to create these human bias officer jobs or algorithm bias officer positions to make sure that the company is treating their employees fairly through their use of these algorithms.

BRINK: What about the Chatbot and Human Facilitator? What do you envisage for that?

MEISTER: There have been many articles saying there’s going to be a loss of jobs due to automation but we take a different stance here: that it’s not so much about losing jobs it’s actually about creating new jobs. And at the heart of these new jobs will be the partnership between humans and machines in the future.

So in the HR department two of them — the Human/Machine Teaming Manager and the Chatbot Coach — do just that.

The chatbot coach is one example of an HR job of the future and has already been created at DBS Bank in their talent acquisition department. DBS created a chatbot in order to help its recruiting team source candidates for one of its jobs as a relationship wealth manager. It handled the routine tasks of screening candidates and answering frequently asked questions to free up the human recruiters so that they could focus on the more strategic aspects of their job such as engaging with hiring managers and better understanding the need for the job.

The Chatbot Coach ran the chatbots doing this and was also responsible for auditing the algorithms used to source these new jobs and to make sure that they were still correct. As new questions and issues came up the coach would train the bot just as if the bot were an extra person in the talent acquisition department of DBS.

BRINK: So in a sense HR and tech are starting to merge?

MEISTER: Yes HR is becoming an important influencer in buying decisions for new technology platforms.

It’s no longer just the chief information officer because so many of these tech platforms impact the workforce throughout the employee life cycle from talent acquisition through onboarding to learning and development to performance management even exiting the organization.

Tech is embedded increasingly in the HR function meaning the HR leaders are key influencers in technology decisions made on an enterprise-wide basis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzQyMDUvY29uc3VsdGFuY2llcy1zZWxlY3RlZC1mb3Itd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3Qtc29sYXItZW5lcmd5LWluZnJhLXByb2plY3TSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdWx0YW5jeS5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9hbXAvNDIwNS9jb25zdWx0YW5jaWVzLXNlbGVjdGVkLWZvci13b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1zb2xhci1lbmVyZ3ktaW5mcmEtcHJvamVjdA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Consultancies selected for world’s largest solar energy infra project,"Profiles Marsh

PwC

One of the world’s most ambitious renewable energy ventures has taken its next step with five consultancies selected for the Australia-Asia PowerLink project.

The delivery team for the groundbreaking $30 billion Australia-Asia PowerLink renewable energy project linking Northern Territory solar-generated electricity to Singapore has been named with PwC and Marsh among the consultancies selected.

Once at full capacity the ambitious Sun Cable project aims to deliver 3.2 gigawatts of dispatchable solar-generated electricity harnessed from a vast 12000 hectare solar farm north of Tennant Creek and transported through 4200 kilometres of submarine cable to Singapore.

To put those numbers into perspective the up to 20 GW of peak solar power generation is close to ten times greater than anything that currently exists which will be supported by a 36-42 gigawatt-hours battery storage – Tesla’s famous big battery in South Australia has recently reached a capacity of 189 MWh.

Meanwhile the 720-kilometres North Sea Link crossing the North Sea from Norway to the United Kingdom is currently the world’s longest HVDC subsea cable at one sixth of the length of the Australia to Singapore link.

To help achieve this remarkable feat of engineering Sun Cable – which has already received backing from two of Australia’s wealthiest billionaires in Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest – has now selected a consortium of international and local advisories as its Integrated Project Delivery Team made up of PwC insurance and risk giant Marsh and global infrastructure engineering and project management firms SMEC Bechtel and Hatch.

“We are so proud to be helping harness Australia’s rich sunshine to power thousands of businesses and communities across Australia and Singapore” said Tom Seymour CEO of PwC Australia which will serve as project advisor. “This complex and ambitious project is unlike anything previously developed. Australia-Asia PowerLink will help solve Australia’s carbon emissions footprint (and) provide once-in-a-lifetime economic opportunities for communities.”

With construction expected to get underway in late 2023 and supply to Singapore to kick-off in 2027 (serving up to 15 percent of the nation’s demand) the touted economic and environmental benefits of the venture include a projected $8 billion boost to the Australian economies and approximately 1500 jobs during the construction phase (mainly in the and Northern Territory).

“By unlocking the vast world-class solar and land resources that Australia has available Sun Cable is creating the pathway for a new export industry generating up to $2 billion per annum in exports for Australia” said Michael Gunner Chief Minister of the Northern Territory Government.

Speaking on behalf of Marsh which is providing risk management consultancy to the project CEO of the Pacific region Nick Harris said: “This project deliver a large volume of renewable energy over a longer distance than ever before which represents a seismic shift in the way Australia exports energy to the world. We are excited to be part of the team.”

The contribution to CO2 reduction goals is forecasted to be major with modelling showing a 6 million tonnes per year reduction in Singapore’s carbon emissions with a total abatement of 8.6 million tonnes.

“Surbana Jurong is very excited to be part of this multi-national project development team whose vision is in step with Singapore’s goal to intensify solar energy deployment” said Wong Heang Fine CEO of Surbana Jurong which purchased project advisors SMEC for S$400 million in 2017.

James Phillis CEO of SMEC for Australia and New Zealand added: “The Australia-Asia PowerLink will be the world’s largest solar energy infrastructure network and will be a game-changer for the renewable energy sector worldwide. As a member of the project delivery team SMEC is excited to be a critical force in bringing this project to life.”",,,,,,,,,

We demystify them,"Boost-Glide vehicles (BGV) have been around for quite a while but have suddenly been catapulted (or more accurately rocketed) into the news by some recent successful and less successful test events. Now I have to state a disclaimer here – I am not an expert in the field and have never been involved in any BGV programmes which in the context of this article is a good thing because my comments are based on observations and inferences from open-source material and cannot be considered to disclose anything classified. Jim ‘Sonic’ Smith reports:

I have however been interested in BGV and their related technologies for quite a while and indicated in earlier articles for @Hush_Kit that BGV were an emerging defence capability that it was important to watch. The first BGV hardware I encountered was at a US Aerospace Materials Conference in 1990 (yes 30+ years ago). This was a simple very slender conical structure in Carbon-Carbon exhibited in an open Conference by Martin-Marietta and labelled with no further explanation “BGV nose cone”. So BGVs are real even if not everyone knows what they are.

Looking into this field from the outside can be somewhat confusing. A number of capabilities are dependent on similar technologies and as some of those capabilities are strategic in nature there tends to be quite substantial obfuscation going on about the purpose of various technology demonstration and maturation activities.

In this article I will attempt to clarify some aspects of the various programmes which appear to be being pursued; clarify some of the language; and explain the importance of BGV and how they differ from other hypersonic programmes.

Definitions

Here I am defining what I mean by various terms in this article. Other sources my use different definitions.

Hypersonic: The word hypersonic is used to describe high-speed flight typically at Mach numbers greater than 5. Flight at such speed brings potential advantages but comes with specific technology challenges. The principal advantages are reduced warning time a more difficult interception by defensive system and high kinetic energy.

The technical difficulties stem from the interaction of a flight vehicle and the atmosphere at high speeds. These difficulties include thermodynamic heating of structures requiring the use of advanced materials; predicting managing and controlling flow behaviour to reduce thermal effects and control and manoeuvre flight vehicles; and managing propulsion particularly if this is to be air-breathing rather than rocket-based.

Hypersonic Weapon: A system designed to achieve ‘kinetic effect’ and to operate at hypersonic speeds. Such a weapon may be air or surface-launched and may be directed against a variety of targets ranging from the fleeting and tactical to the fixed and strategic.

Some examples may help to de-mystify this. The simplest operational hypersonic weapon is the APFSDS (Armour Piercing Fin-Stabilised Dispensing Sabot) anti-tank weapon otherwise known as a long rod penetrator. These are typically fired from Main Battle Tank guns against other tanks and fly at about 1.8 km/s which is a little over Mach 5 at sea level. No guidance after launch or warhead is required – the kinetic effect is achieved through speed and APFSDS mass which is enhanced through the use of high-density materials.

Moving away from land warfare recent conflicts have shown that there may be significant tactical advantages in effective guided weapons which are highly reactive or in other words have a short flash-to-bang time. Other requirements leading to potential hypersonic solutions might include high-speed and long-range anti-air weapons. Hypersonic weapons may vary from the unguided short-range APFSDS through high-speed cruise missiles and to air-launched ballistic missiles.

Boost-Glide Vehicle: A flying vehicle that is accelerated to very high speeds but is then un-powered.

This is an intentionally broad definition and is intended to indicate that BGV concepts have been around for a very long time and are already in use. The APFSDS is a short-range unmanned BGV of a sort with the boost phase provided explosively. The North American X-15 a 1960s rocket-propelled research aircraft able to operate at speeds greater than Mach 6 was an early manned-BGV.

The aim and intent of current BGVs extends well beyond the aspirations of the X-15 program and I will explore possible current objectives later in this article. BGVs are a special class of hypersonic weapon systems that may prove to be particularly de-stabilising.

Programmes

The two sections that follow are a quick look at some hypersonic weapons and BGV programs and these are followed by a discussion of recent US and Chinese BGV test activity. This is an overview. It’s not comprehensive and doubtless misses some of the reader’s favourite programs particularly if they are not being reported in the open literature. However there should be sufficient here to discriminate between hypersonic weapons and BGV programs; to indicate the activities in these areas; and to indicate why BGV might be of broader concern rather than merely of technical interest.

Hypersonic Weapons

Looking at the development of air-to-surface strike capabilities over the last several decades one can determine two trends of interest. Those targets which cannot be readily moved including for example airfields command centres communication hubs and so on have been buried or hardened where possible. This has led to continuing efforts to improve the capability of (largely) conventional weapons against hardened targets.

Where hardening is not achievable to a sufficiently effective level effort has been put into making key assets mobile or moveable at short notice and in unpredictable ways. This has created a class of targets which are high-value yet for which the engagement opportunities may be short-lived or “fleeting”. The advent of conflicts prosecuted by non-state actors insurgents and other unconventional forces has further increased the pressure to be able to locate and take rapid action on the occasions when targets are apparent and can be engaged.

This type of issue has become a strong driver for real-time and near real-time reconnaissance and intelligence systems capable of alerting the command structure to the presence of such targets. Responding to such targets is another matter and depends on the availability of suitable weapons systems; their presence in or near the engagement area; and a sufficiently flexible and responsive command structure to ensure a timely engagement. In a word having a hypersonic strike weapon is not enough – the rest of the target discovery identification command and authorization chain has also to be in place.

That said by maintaining standing strike patrols of B-1B aircraft with precision guided weapons on board the US has achieved very rapid response times when targets have become apparent. However this may not be practical in circumstances where weapons platforms themselves are threatened by ground or air threats and a long-range high-speed strike weapon may be required. This appears to be the objective of the majority of visible US programmes.

Other nations see the world somewhat differently. The Russians appear to me to be rather more defensively minded than the US but are also perpetually nervous about NATO the US and various other perceived threats. The strength of US Naval Forces and their mobility is a particular concern so it is no surprise that the Russians appear to have a strong interest in hypersonic anti-shipping weapons. In addition it is clear that much NATO and US Air capability is dependent on high-value air assets such as AEW&C aircraft air-to-air refuelling tankers and high-flying and long endurance reconnaissance systems. To counter these it is possible that future hypersonic anti-air systems will be developed.

In respect of China key potential flashpoint areas appear to be in the South China Sea on the island of Taiwan as well as a generally difficult relationship with several of its neighbouring countries. Area denial would appear to be a strong driver for recent military developments and it is possible that the large and capable J-20 will eventually be equipped with hypersonic air-to-surface and anti-air weapons to have at least a deterrent and possibly an area-denial effect. China is also said to be concerned that recent US hypersonic technology developments may threaten its nuclear deterrent.

Some hypersonic weapons programess are identified below:

USA

· U.S. Air Force—Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM);

and · DARPA—Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC pronounced “hawk”).

The USAF program is presumed to derive from the DARPA demonstrator and relies on a Supersonic Combustion Ramjet (SCRAMJET) to provide sustained hypersonic propulsion. SCRAMJET technology is one of the high-risk areas for hypersonic weapons and significant international efforts are underway to demonstrate viable systems. The benefit gained through the use of air-breathing propulsion is that the weapon is smaller and could perhaps be carried by the F-15 as well as the B-52. An additional advantage is that it may be easier to integrate sensors and seekers into hypersonic cruise missiles suggesting that these are intended to achieve more tactical effects.

The Air Force is also examining proposals for the Expendable Hypersonic Air-Breathing Multi-Mission Demonstrator Program alternatively known as Project Mayhem which is seeking to achieve significantly longer range than current systems.

Russia

The detail below has been derived from a report Hypersonic Weapons – Background and Issues for Congress – Congressional Research Service https://crsreports.congress.gov R45811

Russia is developing the Avangard BGV and the 3M22 Tsirkon (or Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile and has reportedly fielded the Kinzhal (“Dagger”) a maneuvering air-launched ballistic missile.

The Tsirkon is a ship-launched hypersonic cruise missile capable of traveling at speeds of between Mach 6 and Mach 8 (Russian sources state Mach 8 to 9 and claim a range of up to 1000km). Tsirkon is reportedly capable of striking both ground and naval targets. Tsirkon can be fired from the vertical launch systems mounted on a number of Naval vessels as well as 885 Yasen-class submarines and other platforms.

Russia has also fielded Kinzhal a maneuvering air-launched ballistic missile which was successfully test fired from a modified MiG-31 fighter in July 2018—striking a target at a distance of approximately 500 miles. Russian media has reported Kinzhal’s top speed as Mach 10 with a range of up to 1200 miles when launched from the MiG-31. The Kinzhal could eventually be fitted with a nuclear warhead.

China

According to U.S. defense officials China successfully tested Starry Sky-2 (or Xing Kong2) a nuclear-capable hypersonic vehicle prototype in August 2018. China claims the vehicle reached top speeds of Mach 6 and executed a series of in-flight maneuvers before landing. Starry Sky-2 is described as a “waverider” that uses powered flight after launch and derives lift from its own shockwaves.

Other Programmes

There has been and continues to be very extensive international interest in hypersonic technologies and related programs are in place in (at least) Australia France Germany India and Japan.

Boost-Glide Vehicles

When I first encountered the term BGV it was in the context of one of those forward-looking papers the USAF occasionally put out on technology trends and aspirations indicating that the USAF had a desire to achieve Global Reach and moreover to be able to deliver capability anywhere on the Globe in two hours. This would be in around 1990 and this highly ambitious target was to be approached through testing and development of Boost-Glide Vehicles.

As time has passed events have demonstrated the need for systems capable of reacting quickly to respond to rapidly changing military situations or to attack high-value fleeting targets. Recent aspirations suggest the desire is now to be able to strike anywhere on the globe within one hour rather than two. Current BGV systems offer the prospect of being able to do that and moreover using delivery systems that are much less predictable than ballistic missiles and hard to counter.

The key aspect is the use of the space and near-space environment. Two alternative approaches have been described the first of which may be thought of as a hypersonic glider. Such a vehicle is launched using a booster rocket and delivered at high speed into the upper atmosphere or near-space environment. After separation from the booster the BGV descends and transits for significant distances in the upper atmosphere at hypersonic speed.

In this cruise mode the vehicle can manoeuvre to change course and although in the upper atmosphere will be below the target radar horizon for much of its flight which might extend for a few thousand miles. This increases unpredictability reduces warning time and makes defensive engagement more difficult.

Placeholder for insertion of FOBS vs Hypersonic Glider figure

The second approach is more ambitious and requires a launch system capable of putting the BGV into low-earth orbit. Re-entry may be achieved at a location of choice which may be extended by a skipped re-entry allowing cross-track manoeuvre and increasing unpredictability. Because a partial orbit is used to deliver the flight path systems like this are referred to as Fractional Orbit Bombardment Systems or FOBS. The nature of the flight path provides truly global reach.

Pairing a BGV hypersonic glider payload with a FOBS delivery system massively increases unpredictability because of the range and manoeuvrability of the BGV after it has entered the atmosphere coupled with the global reach and unpredictable flightpath of the FOBS delivery vehicle.

Naturally there is nothing to prevent the BGV carrying a nuclear payload rather than a conventional strike warhead.

Some Boost-Glide Vehicle programs are identified below:

USA

· DARPA—Tactical Boost Glide (TBG);

· DARPA—Operational Fires (OpFires);

The DARPA programs are closely related. TBG is Air Force and air-launched in focus but is also looking at compatibility with Navy Vertical Launch systems while OpFires is focussed on ground-launched vehicle-based systems for Army.

· U.S. Navy—Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS);

· U.S. Army—Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) otherwise known as ‘Dark Eagle’;

The US Army and Navy programs are intended to use a Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) with a Navy developed booster. The Navy system would be submarine based while the Army would use a mobile launch platform. The Army system is stated to have a range of “more than 1725 miles”

· U.S. Air Force—AGM-183 Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW)

The USAF program builds on the DARPA Tactical Boost Glide program with the BGV being derived from the Falcon

Interestingly US hypersonic programs have been described as being “mostly non-nuclear” which is scarcely reassuring.

The programs appear to be based around the hypersonic glider rather than FOBS concept – but given the unclassified nature of the paper describing them this is no surprise. Given US space capability generally it would be surprising if a US FOBS program does not exist.

Russia

The detail below has been derived from a report Hypersonic Weapons – Background and Issues for Congress – Congressional Research Service https://crsreports.congress.gov R45811

Russia is developing the Avangard BGV and the 3M22 Tsirkon (or Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile and has reportedly fielded the Kinzhal (Dagger) a maneuvering air-launched ballistic missile.

Avangard is a hypersonic glide vehicle launched from an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) giving it “effectively ‘unlimited’ range.” Reports indicate that Avangard is currently deployed on the SS-19 Stiletto ICBM though Russia plans to eventually launch the vehicle from the Sarmat ICBM. Avangard features onboard countermeasures and will reportedly carry a nuclear warhead. Russian news sources claim that Avangard became operational in December 2019.

China

China has conducted a number of successful tests of the DF-17 a medium-range ballistic missile specifically designed to launch BGVs. U.S. intelligence analysts assess that the missile has a range of approximately 1000 to 1500 miles and may now be deployed. China has also tested the DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile which might also be modified to carry a conventional or nuclear BGV.

China has tested the DF-ZF BGV (previously referred to as the WU-14) at least nine times since 2014. The U.S. officials have identified the range of the DF-ZF as approximately 1200 miles and have stated that the vehicle may be capable of performing “extreme manoeuvres” during flight.

Recent test activity

US

Recently the US attempted a BGV test from Alaska. The material disclosed by the US suggests that this was a test of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-GHB) in support of the Army Dark Eagle and Navy Conventional Prompt Strike Programs.

The test apparently failed due to a problem with the booster rocket and it appears likely that this booster was new and differed from the USN booster rocket used previously. It may be that this is the first test of a three-stage booster with the C-GHB payload.

Previous reporting has suggested a range of 1725+ miles for the Dark Eagle system using a two-stage booster but the trial warning and airspace notification for the failed test identified possible landing zones for three booster stages and an overall range of about 4000 miles. This suggests that new longer-range applications are being sought for the C-GHB and its launch system and coming as it does a few days after a successful Chinese BGV test one cannot help wondering whether new scenarios for the use of such systems are being examined.

China

China was recently reported in the Financial Times as having conducted a successful BGV test in August using a Long March 2C rocket as the launch vehicle and presumably carrying the DF-ZF BGV as payload. The system was reported as completing an orbit of the Earth before re-entry of the BGV which landed near its intended target.

Although the miss distance was of the order of 40 km this might not be regarded as too significant particularly if the intended future application is nuclear weapon delivery.

The significance of this test is immense as it confirms the capability of combining a FOBS delivery with a manoeuvring hypersonic BGV payload. The upshot were this to be developed into a fully capable system would be a Chinese ability to deliver global nuclear reach using hitherto unpredicted and undefended flightpaths.

Assessment

In an environment of increasing tension between three global super-powers the US China and Russia it is a matter for concern that all three are actively developing BGV-based strike systems. It is highly likely that all three are considering the use of such systems in the context of both conventional and nuclear conflicts. To describe these developments as de-stabilising seems a mild use of the term.

There would of course be extreme dangers should any Nation seek to deploy and use even a conventional variant of a future FOBS-BGV capability. The unpredictable flightpath coupled with low warning time available would be likely to result in any target Nation regarding such an attack as Strategic in nature and responding accordingly with very high risk of escalation.

It is perhaps no coincidence that these capabilities are becoming public at a time when the US DoD will be seeking funding for detection tracking and defensive systems capable of defeating such threats particularly as defensive concepts remain largely to be defined.

It is also no coincidence that proliferation is an immediate concern. Given the technologies required to possess a ballistic missile-delivered nuclear system it is perhaps a relatively minor step from there to add a BGV capability to the payload. One need only consider the list of states outside the big three that are known to possess nuclear weapons to recognise the danger that the relevant technologies could represent if developed elsewhere.

While Mastercard argues that the new policy would help in preventing child sexual abuse and the uploading of other non-consensual content adult content creators and activists say the rules will not only hit the livelihood of sex workers but are also impractical in nature.

What are the new regulations?

The payments and technology company in April this year via a blog post announced that under its new “speciality merchant” regulations creators of adult content and platforms streaming it will be required to follow a strict documentation and moderation process.

In the blog post Mastercard’s senior vice-president of customer engagement and performance John Verdeschi said that considering the “high risk” nature of the adult content industry it was imperative to keep “strong content control measures and clear unambiguous and documented consent” in place.

“You might ask ‘Why now?’ In the past few years the ability to upload content to the internet has become easier than ever. All someone needs is a smartphone and a Wi-Fi connection” he had argued defending his company’s new policy.

Under the new regulations banks that connect merchants to Mastercard’s network will be required to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor block and where necessary take down an illegal content.

Banks will also have to ensure that the adult websites document the age and verify the identity of people in uploaded photographs and videos as well as that of the content uploader.

In simple words content creators including sex workers uploaders and the uploading platform would only be able to avail the services of Mastercard if they have proper documentation about their consent to be in the film cam show or picture to have them distributed and have them available for download.

Also read: What the RBI ban on Mastercard means for the future

Mastercard also wants banks working with it to ensure that platform moderators review the content before publishing it and have in place a “complaint resolution process that addresses illegal or nonconsensual content within seven business days”.

The banks should also see to it that platforms remove adult photo and videos if a person featured in it raises objection.

Reason behind the regulation

The regulations come in the wake of Mastercard Visa and Discover blocking the use of their cards to access Pornhub last year following allegation of sex trafficking-related content (including child abuse and rape) being streamed on the platform.

Replying to the ban Pornhub in a statement called it “exceptionally disgusting” especially when the website just recently had announced steps to “protect images of abuse non-consensual activity and underage models on the site including a ban on unverified users uploading material”.

Despite its wariness about “unlawful activities” related to sexual content on its network Mastercard ironically is a branded card for Cabelas a brand selling assault weapons.

Sex workers cry foul

Sex workers and activists have decried the new regulations by Mastercard and have been demanding the company for a rollback.

Activists say the new policy is an “attack on free speech” and would make it immensely difficult for sex workers to eke out a living from online platforms.

In a commentary in American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) trans justice campaign manager Lala B Holston-Zannell wrote that the policy “makes it harder for sex workers to do business online and makes sex workers more vulnerable especially those who are trans women of colour”.

She says when seen practically the new requirement is quite tardy to follow if not impossible. Giving the example of social networking platform OnlyFans she said the website has one million content creators. So if each of them uploaded one video a day under Mastercard’s new policy the website would have to review each video before publishing it.

“Pre-publication review at that scale is almost impossible and would likely be rife with errors considering the speed at which online platforms operate. This policy will make it much harder for platforms to host adult content which will destabilize the websites that sex workers use to make a living” she writes.

To raise their objection against the policy around 1500 sex workers sex educators and other stakeholders in September signed a letter to Mastercard demanding a withdrawal of the rules.

“Payment processors should not be dictating platforms’ content moderation policies. Mastercard’s proposal will lead to more violence and discrimination against vulnerable people not less” said Evan Greer director of Fight for the Future in a statement.

“If they move ahead with this proposal and refuse to even pause to listen to more stakeholders they are in fact saying that acceptance doesn’t matter to them. They’re throwing LGBTQ+ communities human rights and marginalized people under the bus. Full stop” Greer said in the statement.

Not only queer sex workers Greer said the new policy would also affect all queer content creators including comic artists game developers sex educators and academics.

“All of society suffers from restrictions on consensual sexuality and speech increases in surveillance and misdirection of resources that should help the most vulnerable” Greer said.

Stating that everyone deserves to access financial services Holston-Zannell said financial discrimination and laws that stigmatise or criminalise sex work will not only harm the safety and wellbeing of Black transwomen but also expose them to the dangers of mass incarceration racist policing as well put curbs on their free speech and invade their privacy.

“If Mastercard is a true supporter of LGBTQ rights as it claims on its Pride page it should immediately reverse this discriminatory policy” she said.

Calling the policy a “war” on sex workers Sex Workers Outreach Project Behind Bars has said that the regulations would put a lot of sex workers out of work and maginalise them further.

“We say ‘war against sex workers’ because the damage they do does not impact the labour as much as it affects the labourers who depend on the Pornhub platform to earn a living” the platform stated.

“Violence against sex workers includes the societal and institutional violence that has led to the shuttering of our online platforms that give us a measure of safety and allow us the critical resource that is the ability to access banking” the platform said.

Sex workers say these policies do more harm than good.

“By forcing me to fill out a consent ‘contract’ or upload an ID that protects producers platforms and banks from liability I would have a harder time winning a case against an abusive producer. Sex workers themselves are rarely involved in legal or civil liability for trafficking child sexual abuse or other problematic content. I only see this surveillance and these policies as further exploitation not help; they make me less safe” a sex worker told Vice.

Ironically while a chunk of adult platforms have stringent moderation and content documentation policies non-adult social medium platforms like Facebook and Instagram often stream adult and abusive content which and never get pulled up for it. According to an annual report by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Facebook reported 20 billion instances of child sex abuse in 2020 while the same reported on Snapchat platform was 144000. Twitter reported more than 65000 instances of child sex abuse while Microsoft reported 96776 instances.

This however is not the first instance where sex workers faced financial discrimination. Payment processors like PayPal have refused to do business with sex workers due to the “high risk” nature of their work.

Many adult sites have already drafted new rules in line with Mastercard’s regulations and alerted users about the same. Porn site iWantClips for instance recently intimated its creators about the change in content review policies warning them that non-compliance may lead to the blacklisting of erring creators.

However some websites after complying with Mastercard’s rules have reversed them following huge outcry by users. For instance Onlyfans in August announced that it will ban explicit content from its platform from October. The platform however had to roll back its decision after users protested against it. Onlyfans’ founder Tim Stokely however has said that the website was already complying with Mastercard’s rules and that they had nothing to do with the ban.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmludGVjaHRpbWVzLmNvbS90bm0tbXBhbWJhLWxhdW5jaGVzLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtZGViaXQtY2FyZC1pbi1tYWxhd2kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TNM Mpamba Launches Mastercard Debit Card in Malawi,"In a country-first for Malawi mobile money service provider TNM Mpamba has launched a Mastercard debit card enabling its customers – even those without bank accounts – to make safe and seamless in-person and online digital payments on the Mastercard network.

Dubbed “Khadi Mbambande” the new card is expected to enhance financial inclusion and improve access to the digital economy. The rollout of the TNM Mpamba Mastercard payment solutions plays a key role in advancing Mastercard’s worldwide commitment to financial inclusion to bring a total of 1 billion people and 50 million micro and small businesses into the digital economy by 2025.

Powered by the National Bank of Malawi the physical Mastercard debit card is interlinked with the TNM Mpamba mobile money wallet giving customers access to pay for products and services at Mastercard retail locations both in Malawi and further abroad.

Customers will also be able to withdraw funds from ATMs as well as use the card in a similar manner to the Mastercard virtual payment solution Khadi Mbambande to access an array of online payments and services like Netflix Facebook advertising and popular online shopping platforms like Amazon.

Convenience is a key advantage of the debit card as customers can better manage and track finances as funds are adjusted directly against a customer’s Mpamba wallet with an electronic record of every transaction carried out.

To boost financial literacy TNM Mpamba and Mastercard collaborated with the National Bank of Malawi to contextualise and adapt key card information for the Malawian market. This will ensure that first-time users of physical and virtual debit payment products enjoy a safe and user-friendly payment experience.

TNM Mpamba confirmed a simplified onboarding process when registering for TNM Mpamba and applying for its Mastercard payment solutions.

Following double-digit growth in 2020 GSMA’s latest data reports over half a billion mobile money accounts in Africa – close to half of the global total. Customers are using their accounts for new and more advanced use cases including person-to-merchant payments suggesting that more people are moving away from the margins of financial systems and leading increasingly digital lives.

Research has also shown that access to digital financial services and mobile money platforms has allowed previously unbanked Malawians and other Africans to grow their micro-enterprises and businesses.

According to Reserve Bank of Malawi Governor Dr. Wilson Banda who spoke at the launch event in Lilongwe the solution will accelerate efforts towards deepening financial inclusion and economic activity. “With the TNM Mpamba Mastercard debit card there is now certainty to add over nine million people to the national payments system in one fell swoop. Such a development has the potential to instantly revolutionise the country’s financial services sector as millions of people become financially included in one go.

“With the potential to instantly add nearly half of the entire population using a mobile money platform such as Mpamba the dream to achieve financial inclusion is closer to reality than ever.”

TNM Chief Executive Officer Arnold Mbwana said the Mpamba Mastercard debit card is one of the outcomes of the company’s long-term investments in mobile technology and systems and aims to further improve the capacity of Malawi’s national payments ecosystem.

“The introduction of a Mastercard debit card is part of TNM Mpamba’s ongoing program to provide more people with access to financial services and tools that will simplify their lives. With access to Mastercard’s unrivalled network of merchants and ATMs together with TNM Mpamba’s wide agent network we are able to increase the ecosystem of locations where the Mpamba mobile wallet can be used further expanding transaction options and use cases for our mobile money customers. This brings greater convenience more choice and an enhanced user experience.”

Amnah Ajmal Executive Vice President for Market Development Mastercard Middle East and Africa added: “To create a powerful ecosystem partnerships between players are increasingly needed to meet the needs and expectations of the fast-evolving consumer. We are pleased to advance our digital partnerships strategy in MEA with TNM Mpamba as we support their digital transformation and bring more seamless payment experiences to their customers. This in turn will help increase the adoption and usage of digital payments and services – ultimately leading to a more connected and inclusive digital economy that benefits everyone.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIxMTAyNDAwNTAxNy9lbi9PbmJlLUJlY29tZXMtT25lLW9mLUZpcnN0LUNvcnBvcmF0ZS1EaXNidXJzZW1lbnQtUGxhdGZvcm1zLXRvLUpvaW4tVS5TLi1GYXN0ZXItUGF5bWVudHMtQ291bmNpbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Onbe Becomes One of First Corporate Disbursement Platforms to Join U.S. Faster Payments Council,"CHICAGO & PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Onbe a market-leading corporate disbursements platform announced today that it has accepted the invitation to join the U.S. Faster Payments Council (FPC) an industry-led membership organization dedicated to advancing faster payments in the United States.

The providers that do not comply with the new regulations will be unable to process payments through Mastercard and affiliated banks.The new ‘speciality merchant’ regulations underscore how financial institutions especially credit companies are becoming the de facto regulators of what happens on the internet. And much to the consternation of sex workers they are not willing to listen to the other side of the story.However Mastercard in a statement clarified the regulations do not impact legal adult activity in the country.“In April announced a registration program for banks who connect merchants to our network. Those banks need to certify the websites selling adult content have effective controls in place to monitor block and remove illegal or unconsented content. This program does not impact legal adult activity created by consenting individuals or studios” it said in a statement.While Mastercard has not publicly revealed what these new regulations will call for advocacy groups like Free Speech Coalition and others have stated some of the stipulations that Mastercard has put on adult content providers.Among other requirements platforms that publish adult content will now need to show that every person in an adult video has consented to be in it consented to have it distributed and consented for that content to be available for download.Additionally companies will have to verify and document the age of everyone within the content and also the age of the uploader of the content. All of this data would be given to Mastercard in monthly compliance reports.Mastercard has also sent ‘compliance packages’ to webmasters of adult content platforms. Within these packages platforms have to set up a page dedicated for visitors to report instances of abuse reported Xbiz. This checklist of potential ‘abuse’ and reportable offences include “exposed personally identifiable information” “impersonation” “underage material” “copyright/trademark infringement” and “spam"" as well as “prostitution or trafficking” “weapons” “drugs” and “other.”The form was essentially forcing websites to add words like “underage material” “prostitution or trafficking” “weapons” and “drugs” to their metadata which would put these websites and platforms at risk of being shadow-banned and come under state surveillance.Apart from the morally-coded implications of labelling prostitution along with trafficking webmasters told Xbiz that the system is ripe for abuse. With the reports being copied and forwarded to Mastercard the report system can easily be abused by anti-porn forces and rival competitors. The reports can also be used by jilted partners and stalkers to harass particular performers on their own websites as well.“Mastercard is now making me comply with a form that could harm my brand and even the models I work with if I want to continue doing business with them” the webmaster told Xbiz.Sex workers activists and others have said that these new regulations are a continuation of the discriminatory behaviour of financial institutions towards the sector.Payment processors and banks have long been hostile and practised discriminatory practices towards sex workers with banks and payment providers like PayPal and Square terminating accounts associated with their work.The discrimination against sex workers continues even in nations where the profession is heavily regulated and completely legal.Nearly a year ago Visa Mastercard and Discover cut ties with Pornhub a major adult content platform after anti-porn groups used a New York Times opinion piece over claims of sex trafficking on the platform.“These actions are exceptionally disappointing as they come just two days after Pornhub instituted the most far-reaching safeguards in user-generated platform history” Pornhub had said in a statement in response.“I don’t feel helped by these new policies” a sex worker who asked to remain anonymous told Vice.“By forcing me to fill out a consent 'contract' or upload an ID that protects producers platforms and banks from liability I would have a harder time winning a case against an abusive producer. Sex workers themselves are rarely involved in legal or civil liability for trafficking CSAM (child sexual abuse material) or other problematic content. I only see this surveillance and these policies as further exploitation not help; they make me less safe” the person added.A key group that has been advocating against porn is the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) renamed from Morality in Media. The group has admitted before to be working towards completely outlawing all porn from the internet.While Mastercard has updated its regulations it’s unclear how these regulations will apply to other websites that are not considered adult websites but do publish adult content in the form of art books and other miscellaneous material.What is certain is that the new regulations will further marginalise the already heavily discriminated profession. The irony is not lost that one can buy a firearm using a Mastercard in many places while the company is putting more regulations on sex work.Mastercard in a statement to CNBC-TV18 said such “allegations of bias against adult content creators are demonstrably untrue. Our actions and business practices against trafficking and exploitation clearly show this.”The financial payments company is also in discussions with groups to monitor how the implementation of the new policies. “We are monitoring how the program is being implemented so that we can provide further clarification and guidance to the acquiring banks and their customers as needed” it said.(The copy was updated to incorporate Mastercard's statements)"

In their 13th attempt in World Cups Pakistan finally managed to beat India and did so comfortably on a night when almost everything went to plan for them. With the sensational uprooting of the openers with the new ball Shaheen Shah Afridi was the brightest star of the night but everyone in the support cast played their role well including a nerveless chase by the openers Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan

The first half of the match was as if Pakistan were playing on the white board. Afridi you get me early wickets. Imad Wasim you bowl cheap powerplay overs against their right-hand top order. Hasan Ali we need one impactful over in the first 10 from you. Mohammad Hafeez you can finish Imad's overs if we get left-hand batter Rishabh Pant in. Shadab Khan you control the middle overs. Haris Rauf at the end of the innings pace is pace yaar. And change of pace is change of pace yaar.

Afridi announces himself

Afridi began the match tied with Mohammad Amir for the most wickets in the first two overs of T20 games since the start of 2018. He took the new ball here and with the fourth ball of the innings he took the sole lead on that stat. It was not just a full inswinger but it was a late inswinger and from Afridi's high release. Rohit Sharma missed comprehensively to be trapped lbw.

In his second over that beautiful late flick in release was on display again as Afridi got KL Rahul. This wasn't even that full and to get such late swing - almost seam - to go past a defensive bat and hit the top of middle was high skill. India 6 for 2 in 2.1 overs.

Hasan seals the powerplay

India didn't try to break Pakistan's rhythm against right-hand batters and stayed with Suryakumar Yadav at No. 4. Imad got away with two overs for 10 and India's need to get a move on got so bad even Kohli took an early risk to back away and hit Afridi for a six in the fifth over. Hasan though provided the final blow to win Pakistan the powerplay: the wicket of Suryakumar with nip off the pitch on a short-of-a-length delivery.

Middle-overs tussle

At 36 for 3 in the powerplay there was no way India were going to go six-hunting West Indies style . Kohli was going to drop anchor and see if he could hurt Pakistan at the death a phase of play where he is historically among the best. Rishabh Pant got in and the onus for disruption was on him. Pakistan though used this uncertain period for India to get through Hafeez's two overs.

Rauf announced himself with an over of high pace in the 11th over and it was clear the job in the death overs was his to do. In the 12th over Pant hit Hasan for two one-handed sixes to threaten Pakistan. Shadab though came back to get rid of Pant with a wrong 'un and make it 84 for 4 in the 13th over.

Rauf shuts India down

This was when India made their first change promoting Ravindra Jadeja ahead of Hardik Pandya. The idea perhaps was to keep right-left going and also retain Pandya's power for the death overs. Jadeja though did not attack. He was 9 off 11 when he tried to hit his first boundary. When he tried to hit his second he holed out to a Hasan slower ball.

However the real danger for Pakistan was now. Kohli had survived into the death overs where only AB de Villiers Chris Gayle and Andre Russell have a better strike rate than him in all T20 cricket. He also had Pandya who can be lethal. India were on their way to 140-150 which was the bare minimum. Now they stood a chance to go for bonus runs.

Bowling the 17th over was Rauf who is not known for bowling too many slower balls. In the last PSL though he added it to his repertoire bowling 23 of them for 19 runs and two wickets. Here he bowled four of those in a row to concede just four runs in the 17th over. Afridi then got rid of Kohli with a slower bouncer in the 19th. Rauf conceded just seven in the last over.

Slow start to the chase

While India didn't get any bonus above their bare minimum they still had asked Pakistan to mount their second-highest successful chase in the UAE if they were to win this game. After the 10-run first over India gradually pulled Pakistan back with Varun Chakravarthy conceding just two runs in the fourth over. Overs six to eight yielded no boundaries and Pakistan were going at barely a run a ball. They were still the favourites - 60% according to ESPNcricinfo's Win Predictor - but you wondered if they were leaving themselves too much to do on a slow pitch.

Babar turns the tide

In the ninth over Jadeja made his first mistake with a ball a touch too short. Babar 21 off 25 at this point rocked back to hit him for a six. In the next over he found a four off Varun.

And this was around the time the dew began to become significant. Babar went after Jasprit Bumrah's first over back. It was in the 13th over though that the exclamation mark was provided. Varun bowling for the first time with the shorter boundary on the leg side dropped short twice and both openers dropped him over square leg for a six each. And once they got two fours off Jadeja Pakistan had brought it down to 40 off 36.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3Nlcmllcy9pY2MtbWVuLXMtdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC0yMDIxLTIyLTEyNjc4OTcvZW5nbGFuZC12cy13ZXN0LWluZGllcy0xNHRoLW1hdGNoLWdyb3VwLTEtMTI3MzcyNS9saXZlLW1hdGNoLWJsb2fSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As it happened - England vs West Indies Men's T20 World Cup Super 12s,"ICC/Getty Images

Not without a stumble but England get to the winning target in 8.2 overs which gives them a big net-run-rate boost of 3.97. We sign off with a teaser from our end-of-game report:

There was no thriller in the repeat of the 2016 T20 World Cup final as West Indies played low-percentage cricket on a difficult pitch to be bowled out for 55 a target England had to work reasonably hard to overhaul losing four wickets and taking 8.2 overs. Between them England spinners Moeen Ali bowled 6.2 overs for 19 runs and six wickets.

That it wasn’t easy for England will make West Indies question their approach: they lost nine of their 10 wickets looking to hit a four or a six 59 of the 86 balls they faced were dots and they made no attempt to rebuild after losing early wickets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBha2lzdGFudG9kYXkuY29tLnBrLzIwMjEvMTAvMjMvZm9yZ2V0LXRoZS1wYXN0LWluLWluZGlhLW1hdGNoLWJhYmFyLXRlbGxzLXRlYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forget the past in India match Babar tells team,"DUBAI: Despite winning 73 of the total 132 ODI games played against India Pakistan have lost all seven World Cup clashes against archrivals as well as five games in the T20 World Cup and start their campaign on Sunday as “underdogs”.

But exuding confidence Captain Babar Azam stressed that the past is irrelevant to his players.

“To be honest what has passed is beyond us” he told a virtual media conference on Saturday as both nations buzzed in anticipation of a thrilling match.

“We want to use our ability and confidence on the day of the match so that we can get a better result.

Pakistan did tour India in 2012 for five limited over matches but ties were not fully resumed as the two nations continued to be at loggerheads over multiple issues with the disputed region of Kashmir heading the list.

Azam admitted it will be a match full of intensity.

“The matches between Pakistan and India are always full of intensity so we need to perform well in all three departments of the game” said Azam.

The second round matches — Super 12 Stage — start on Saturday with Australia taking on South Africa in Abu Dhabi while defending champions the West Indies face England in Dubai in the evening match in Group 1.

Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are the other two teams in the Group.

Former champions India and Pakistan are placed in Group 2 along with New Zealand Afghanistan and Scotland and Namibia who both came through the qualifying stage.

Azam announced 12 for the match with hard-hitters Haider Ali and Asif Ali competing to make the final eleven.

“The boys are excited to play the World Cup and we have a crucial match on Sunday” said Azam who will be leading Pakistan for the first time in a senior World Cup match.

“A winning impact is necessary and then we will go match by match.”

Azam said the prime minister Imran Khan — who led the country to victory in the 1992 World Cup — had shared his experiences with the team.

“The prime minister met us before our departure and shared his experiences of the 1992 win and told us to play aggressive and fearless cricket against India.”

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee. The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcnVzc2VsbC13aWxzb24tY2FsbGVkLW1lLWFzLXNvb24tYXMtaS1nb3QtZHJhZnRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mason McCormick: Russell Wilson Called Me 'As Soon As I Got Drafted',"To hammer home the point one more time Russell Wilson is embracing all of his new teammates especially the ones tasked with protecting the quarterback. As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtbWNkb25hbGRzLWNvZmZlZS1yZWFsbHktdG9vLWhvdC10d28tbmV3LWxhd3N1aXRzLXNheS15ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is McDonald's Coffee Really Too Hot? Two New Lawsuits Say Yes,"In late February of 1992 a 79-year-old woman named Stella Liebeck ordered a 49-cent cup of coffee from a McDonald's restaurant in Albuquerque N.M. That beverage would turn out to be the costliest cup of coffee the chain had ever sold. Until perhaps now.

Liebeck suffered severe burns when the dangerously hot coffee spilled onto her lap injuries that would lead to a lawsuit with a multi-million dollar settlement. (Though the amount was subsequently reduced and the matter closed in a private settlement.) It was also largely derided as a frivolous case that had inspired countless personal injury lawsuits against major corporations many of which were indeed without merit.

But a close review of the facts of Liebeck's suit shows it was far from frivolous—McDonald's coffee had already been known to cause serious injury when spilled yet the company had taken no action to protect its customers. And it seems that the chain still hasn't taken proper steps to solve the issue: despite the fact that McDonald's has already lost several lawsuits over hot coffee burns there are now two recent new cases filed.

The facts of the 1992 hot coffee case

On that fateful February 27 1992 Stella Liebeck was seated in the passenger seat of a parked vehicle when she popped the lid off her McDonald's coffee intending to add cream and sugar according to Poole Law Group. Liebeck accidentally spilled the coffee on her lap which under normal circumstances would have resulted in temporary discomfort and perhaps embarrassment but not grievous injury. But in this case the coffee was heated to a wildly unsafe temperature between 180 and 190 degrees Fahrenheit a mere 25 or so degrees below the boiling point of water. Liebeck's thighs sustained third-degree burns so severe she required skin grafts. She was initially willing to settle for a payment of her medical bills and lost wages only moving ahead with a more punitive civil case when the McDonald's corporation offered compensation of a mere $100 according to Consumer Attorneys Of California (CAOC).6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The difference between hot and too hot

As noted the coffee served to Stella Liebeck was somewhere between 180 and 190 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a study examining the optimal temperatures for serving hot beverages ""Brief exposures to liquids in this temperature range can cause significant scald burns."" While coffee does need to be brewed at high temperatures (the ideal temperature for the water used to brew coffee is between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit) serving temperatures should not exceed 165 degrees while surveys find the ideal temperature for consuming a hot drink to be 136 degrees on average according to the same study.

The company knew the coffee was too hot

Mistakes can be forgiven when it's clear they were made without the knowledge that could have stopped them. But that was far from the truth in Stella Liebeck's case. In fact according to CAOC McDonald's was using an operator's manual that dictated the coffee be kept at a temperature between 180 and 190 degrees Fahrenheit. And what's more the company had already faced multiple similar injury claims before yet had taken no action either to reduce the temperature of the coffee served at restaurants or to at least ensure customers knew the beverages would initially be too hot for safety.

Two new cases in Texas

McDonald's is currently facing new lawsuits that are quite comparable to that seminal case. The company and one of its San Antonio Texas franchisees are facing two hot coffee spill lawsuits in Bexar County according to KSAT. The first suit was filed on October 5 and relates to an incident that occurred in 2019 when a cup of coffee handed through a drive-thru window spilled on a woman's lap and caused ""serious and permanent injuries."" The second lawsuit filed days later relates to an incident from 2020 in which another cup of coffee passed from a different drive-thru window also spilled and resulted in second-degree burns. The plaintiff in the first suit is seeking $250000 in damages while the plaintiff in the latter seeks $1 million according to Law and Crime and both have cited loosely fitted lids as the culprits for the spills.

There's a reason why McDonald's keeps its coffee scalding hot

One of the recent McDonald's lawsuits says the chain was negligent in handling hot coffee. In particular the chain is being held responsible for ""failing to properly handle hot materials when delivering to customers failing to maintain liquids at a temperature that would protect customers from suffering burns failing to train employees in handling hot liquids and failing to act as a reasonable person using ordinary care in the same or similar circumstance"" according to KSAT.

Turns out McDonald's has something to gain by keeping its coffee at scalding temperatures: the hotter coffee seems fresher especially to people with long commutes. It remains to be seen whether the new lawsuits can finally bring about meaningful change in the way McDonald's serves its coffee.

Jarmier Owens



McDonald's workers are planning another strike on Tuesday to protest alleged sexual harassment at multiple locations in the US.

The strike will build upon a pattern of McDonald's #MeToo movements that started in 2018.

The McDonald's effort is the latest in a line of worker strikes across multiple industries in the month of October alone.

The ""Striketober"" streak continues as McDonald's employees become the latest group of workers to demand corporate change.

Employees at the fast-food giant in at least ten cities across the US including Chicago and St. Louis are planning a one-day strike on Tuesday to protest allegations of sexual harassment against employees. During the strike employees will ""demand that McDonald's stop wasting time and listen to workers when it comes to fixing rampant sexual harassment in their stores"" the workers' rights group Fight for $15 wrote in a Facebook post on Friday.

The McDonald's strike follows a rise of protests in recent months over what some workers say are poor working conditions toxic cultures and insufficient wages at a range of companies including John Deere Netflix Kellogg's and American Airlines. The fight for workers' rights has been further magnified by ongoing pandemic pressures labor shortages and supply chain issues which have made it harder to retain employees.

Fight for $15 helped organize the strike which serves as a direct response to the alleged rape of a 14-year-old McDonald's worker in Pittsburgh by a manager at the restaurant according to USA Today.

The effort also comes amid claims of harassment across other McDonald's restaurants including a lawsuit filed in September after a McDonald's franchisee did not adequately respond to harassment complaints from multiple teenagers in 22 locations in California Nevada and Arizona.

""I'm going on strike because despite years of protests McDonald's still refuses to take responsibility for the countless women and teenagers who face harassment on the job at its stores across the globe"" Jamelia Fairley a McDonald's employee in Sanford Florida told The Hill.

""It's not safe to work at McDonald's"" former Milwaukee McDonald's worker Jennifer Berry said in a Facebook post shared by Fight for $15. ""It's our right to feel safe at our job. We deserve to work for a company that cares about their employees.""

McDonald's also experienced a wave of employee unrest on the heels of the #MeToo movement. Workers at the fast-food company organized a similar one-day strike in September 2018 which became the first multistate strike in the US specifically aimed at sexual harassment.

Workers have staged multiple strikes against sexual harassment in the company with at least 50 workers filing charges against the company since 2016 as of April 2021 according to The Associated Press. Workers cited physical and verbal harassment as well as retaliation when they made complaints.

In April McDonald's announced new mandatory training starting next year for over 2 million workers in 39000 stores around the world focused on combatting harassment discrimination and violence in its restaurants.

""Every single person working at a McDonald's restaurant deserves to feel safe and respected when they come to work and sexual harassment and assault have no place in any McDonald's restaurant'' McDonald's US said in a statement to USA Today on Friday. ""We know more work is needed to further our workplace ambitions which is why all 40000 McDonald's restaurants will be assessed and accountable to global brand standards.""

McDonald's did not immediately respond to request for comment about the impending strike and how the company is addressing these latest concerns.

A suspect is in custody after shooting at police and barricading in a Fort Myers McDonald’s where he hid for about two hours on Saturday afternoon.

Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said the suspect who has been identified as 41-year-old Marlon Illescas was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries.

Illescas is facing seven counts of aggravated assault on an officer as well as other charges related to the standoff. Bond has been set at $475000.

“We meet deadly force with deadly force in this county” Marceno said after the Illescas was detained.

After a loud pop and a flash smoke appeared. When the smoke cleared law enforcement emerged with the suspect in custody. “Today we used less than lethal and we gassed him out so he cooperated” Marceno said. “Obviously our SWAT team deployed the OC gas and obviously you know he wasn’t going to breathe much longer inside there. He comes out and we take him to custody without incident.”

Marceno said the incident began at around 11 a.m. when Fort Myers police officers encountered the armed individual who shot at police officers.

Marceno did not say whether anyone was injured. Marceno said the action of law enforcement prevented a mass shooting. For hours LCSO The Fort Myers Police Department and the SWAT team did what they could to keep an active shooter behind a door and away from the crowds watching outside.

“We are working… using every technology piece that we have. Both teams as you can see here FMPD and LCSO. We’re going to do everything we can to make sure this is peacefully resolved” said Sheriff Marceno.

The suspect then fled into the restaurant at 4280 Palm Beach Boulevard.

Marceno said the police and deputies got all of the employees out safely. “FMPD and the Lee County Sheriff’s office went in were able to get all the employees out for safety” Marceno said.

WINK News Safety and Security Specialist Rich Kolko says law enforcement wanted everyone out in a timely manner. “They want to make sure everyone comes home safely But of course they’re going to work diligently to get anybody in harm’s way out of there as quick as possible while the negotiations continue” said Kolko.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDRub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWZ0ZXItc2hvb3RpbmctYXQtcG9saWNlLWJhcnJpY2FkZWQtaGltc2VsZi1pbi1tY2RvbmFsZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man arrested after shooting at police barricaded himself in McDonald's,"FORT MYERS Fla. — Authorities arrested a man who barricaded himself inside of a McDonald's in Fort Myers Saturday morning after shooting at Fort Myers police officers.

Sheriff Carmine Marceno said the officers encountered the armed man around 11 a.m. When they approached him they said that's when he opened fire and ran into the McDonald's on Palm Beach Blvd.

Sheriff Marceno said both departments were able to work together to help get everyone inside of the fast-food restaurant out safely.

During a news conference he explained law enforcement was talking to him on a cellphone when the phone died. One of the officers was able to lend the man his phone so they could continue to talk. They were also able to use technology to further their communication with the suspect.

""We utilized one of our robots and a drone. The robot can see can hear and can communicate so you don’t just send someone into that building and then there is a deadly confrontation. You send that robot in so we know what is going on so we can see what’s going on and we can communicate"" Sheriff Marceno said.

Colleen Harrell said she saw the whole stand-off. She said law enforcement made multiple attempts for the suspect to come outside.

“Come out with your hand up. Come out with your hands up. They said it multiple times"" she said.

Sheriff Marceno said the man refused to come out so they released tear gas and took him into custody.

“We used less than lethal and we gassed him out"" Sheriff Marceno said.

Following protocol the man was taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries before being taken to jail.

Sheriff Marceno said there were no injuries including those officers that got shot at.

The Lee County Sheriff's Office said the investigation is ongoing as they look further into the altercation.

The family of Martha Medina who was killed in a robbery outside a McDonald's is calling out the judge who granted bond for the suspect involved.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Community members along with advocates from FIEL Houston held a vigil Saturday night in honor of Martha Medina who was reportedly killed by a suspect who was out of jail on bond.

Family friends and residents of the area gathered at the Guadalupe Plaza exactly one month after Medina was killed. Medina's daughter Lourdes asked the community to join them in their fight for justice.

""My mom is gone"" Lourdes said. ""I know nothing's bringing her back but I'm doing this not just for her memory but because I'm tired of seeing this across the city.""

Medina was killed outside a McDonald's at the 400 block of Uvalde Road in east Harris County on Sept. 23.

SEE ALSO: E. Harris Co. purse-snatching suspect denied bond as court reveals he may have followed victim

The 40-year-old suspect Andrew Williams is accused of stealing Medina's purse hitting her with his car and taking off according to authorities.

Court records show Williams was out on bond in connection with a previous capital murder charge from 2019 and also out on bond for an aggravated assault that same year.

Williams was charged with capital murder in connection to Medina's death.

Lourdes and her brother Adrian believe the judge who let Williams out on bond needs to be held accountable along with the other Harris County judges who continue to let repeat violent offenders out on bond.

""We're feeling a little sad but also empowered because we want to get a message across the city not just the city but to the judges that continue to let these repeat offenders out"" Lourdes Medina said. ""We want to put Hilary Unger's name out there first of all and there's plenty of more judges after her. But we feel like she has just as much blood in her hands for my mother's death as much as Andrew Williams does.""

On Oct. 7 ABC13 reached out to the judge about the case.

In an email Unger said ""The Canons prohibit me from talking about pending matters. But I would direct your attention to the clerk's file in the matter specifically the public docket sheets on the District Clerk's website whom all can view. Also direct your attention to the Court of Criminal Procedure and the Texas Constitution (sections regarding bail) which requires me to set bail.""

ABC13 Investigates reached out to sources who say while it's not an easy process it is certainly possible for defendants accused of capital murder to be denied bond.

""The family of Marta Medina is devastated by the loss of their loved one at the hands of a person who was out on bond"" FIEL Executive Director Cesar Espinosa wrote in a statement. ""They are asking for changes to be made to the unfair criminal justice system so that no other families have to go through this. We believe in justice but also believe in fairness for all people involved. We must do better to protect all families here in Houston. We must fight for changes with the hope that no other family has to live this nightmare. We look forward to dialogue but demand immediate change.""

(KMTV) — The presidential elector from District 2 Precious McKesson is leaving the world of Nebraska politics and heading to Washington D.C. to work for the Department of Education. On Friday the Nebraska Democrats gave her a heartfelt goodbye.

McKesson made a name for herself on the national stage last year when she cast Nebraska’s only democratic electoral vote but she's been at work in the Omaha community for many years.

Senator Terrell McKinney said she was someone who had supported him throughout his campaign.

“She’s probably one of the first people I told I was running for office"" he said during the celebration.

Senator Justin Wayne said McKesson encouraged him to strive for big changes in the legislature.

“Every elected person has somebody behind them pushing them to do things they may not think they can do"" Wayne said.

McKesson said it was good to hear from the community before heading out on her next adventure.

“It’s a great feeling to know that I’m being appreciated and we’ll continue the work to get that elector vote it just won’t be me next time"" she said with a laugh.

Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb said McKesson played a huge role in mobilizing voters and candidates of color and putting Omaha on the map during the 2020 election.

“This is obviously very sad for me as a leader but on the other hand couldn’t be happier"" Kleeb said. ""Our loss is definitely President Biden administration's gain.”

McKesson says she’ll be sticking to her roots of community engagement in her new role as a special assistant in the office of communication and outreach.

She couldn't speak in too much detail about the goings-on at the department but said she'd be focusing on getting families engaged with their children's education.

“I’m not just Precious from Omaha; now I’m Precious in the Department of Education for the United States"" McKesson said. ""So I get to build all these relationships throughout the communities throughout the nation.”

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

“An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. Stop. I am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. Stop. Mail is only form of transportation. Stop.”

Dr. Curtis Welch

This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome Alaska to all the major Alaska towns to territorial governor Scott Bone in Juneau and to the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington D.C. Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.

Known as the “Great Race of Mercy” it’s an iconic story of human compassion.

Weather prevented delivery by air so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300000 units of antitoxin which was produced by Merck legacy company H.K. Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.

674 miles 5 days 300000 units

Over 130 years of vaccine leadership In 1895 the H.K. Mulford Company began marketing the first commercially available diphtheria antitoxin in the U.S. the very medication that helped avert the diphtheria epidemic in Nome. Today we have a significant presence in vaccine discovery development and distribution in both human and animal health.

Vaccines are not just for children

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider vaccines to be one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. In the U.S. vaccines are now available for a number of infectious diseases that once routinely affected people. While there are many vaccines available for children it’s important to remember that adults also are susceptible to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.

Each year in the U.S. thousands of adults suffer complications from these diseases. In low- and middle-income countries the toll is even higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L2Jpb3RlY2gtbmV3cy1tZXJjay1qdXVsLXBmaXplci1leWVwb2ludC1uYXNhLXNwYXJrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Readout Newsletter: Merck Pfizer EyePoint and more,"Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

Since 2018 we’ve built teams with expertise on issues such as human rights hate speech misinformation and polarization. Many have lived or worked in high-risk countries and speak relevant languages.

We have an industry-leading process for reviewing and prioritizing countries with the highest risk of offline harm and violence every six months. When we respond to a crisis we deploy country-specific support as needed.

The complexity of these issues means there will never be a one-size-fits-all solution. Our work will never be finished and requires ongoing vigilance and investments.

Over the past two decades Facebook has empowered people around the world with a wealth of social and economic benefits. It has made social connection and free expression possible on a massive scale. This can be especially important for people who are in places that are experiencing conflict and violence.

Facebook supports people’s right to express themselves freely regardless of where they are in the world. Freedom of expression is a foundational human right and enables many other rights. But we know that technologies for free expression information and opinion can also be abused to spread hate and misinformation — a challenge made even worse in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence. This requires developing both short-term solutions that we can implement when crises arise and having a long-term strategy to keep people safe. Here is our approach.

Since 2018 we’ve had dedicated teams spanning product engineering policy research and operations to better understand and address the way social media is used in countries experiencing conflict. Many of these individuals have experience working on conflict human rights and humanitarian issues as well as addressing areas like misinformation hate speech and polarization. Many have lived or worked in the countries we’ve identified as highest risk and speak relevant languages. They are part of the over 40000 people we have working on safety and security including global content review teams in over 20 sites around the world reviewing content in over 70 languages.

In the last two years we’ve hired more people with language country and topic expertise. For example we’ve increased the number of team members with work experience in Myanmar and Ethiopia to include former humanitarian aid workers crisis responders and policy specialists. And we’ve hired more people who can review content in Amharic Oromo Tigrinya Somali and Burmese. Adding more language expertise has been a key focus area for us. This year alone we’ve hired content moderators in 12 new languages including Haitian Creole Kirundi Tswana and Kinyarwanda.

Evaluating Harm in Countries at Risk

Our teams have developed an industry-leading process for reviewing and prioritizing which countries have the highest risk of offline harm and violence every six months. We make these determinations in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and following a review of these factors:

Long-term conditions and historical context : We rely on regional experts platform data and data from more than 60 sources like Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)  Uppsala Conflict Data Program the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Early Warning Project  the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project  and the World Bank to assess the long-term conditions on the ground. These can include civic participation and human rights societal tensions and violence and the quality of relevant information ecosystems.

How much the use of our products could potentially impact a country: We prioritize countries based on a number of factors including: where our apps have become most central to society such as in countries where a larger share of people use our products; where there’s been an increase in offline harms; and where social media adoption has grown.

Current events on the ground : We also give special consideration to discrete events that might magnify current societal problems such as local risk or occurrence of atrocity crimes elections episodes of violence and COVID-19 vaccination and transmission rates.

Strategies for Helping to Keep People Safe in Countries At Risk

Using this prioritization process we develop longer-term strategies to prepare for respond to and mitigate the impacts of harmful offline events in the countries we deem most at risk. This allows us to act quickly to remove content that violates our policies and take other protective measures while still protecting freedom of expression and other human rights principles. Recent examples include our preparations for elections in Myanmar Ethiopia India and Mexico.

Understanding and engaging with local contexts and communities: We know that working with the people and organizations on the ground with firsthand information and expertise is essential. Over the past few years we’ve expanded these relationships with local civil society organizations to support country-specific education programs and product solutions and to ensure our enforcement accounts for local context. We’ve also expanded our global network of third-party fact-checkers. Additionally we have invested significant resources in more than 30 countries with active conflict or societal unrest. Together with UN partners and dozens of local and global NGOs we have developed programming including through global digital literacy initiatives such as We Think Digital or programs to make online engagement safer such as Search for Common Ground’s program in central Africa.

Developing and evaluating policies to prohibit harmful content and behavior: We are constantly evaluating and refining our policies to address evolving nuances of hate speech identify groups at heightened risk of violence or perpetrators of atrocities and human rights abusers  or the potential for rumors and misinformation to contribute to offline physical harm particularly in countries where ethnic and religious tensions are present.

Improving our technology and enforcement to help keep our community safe: During moments when the risk of harm is greater we may take more aggressive action. For example ahead of elections and during periods of heightened unrest in India Myanmar and Ethiopia we significantly reduce the distribution of content that likely violates our policies on hate speech or incitement of violence while our teams investigate it. Once we confirm that the content violates these policies we remove it. (Update on October 24 2021 at 12:45PM PT: This is in addition to our proactive hate speech detection we run in Hindi Bengali Tamil Urdu Amharic Oromo and Burmese.) We also significantly reduce the distribution of content posted from accounts that have repeatedly posted violating content — in addition to our standard practice of removing accounts that frequently violate our Community Standards. To protect people in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover we launched a feature that allows them to lock their profile to provide an extra layer of privacy security and protection for their information.

Update on December 15 2021 at 9:55 AM PT: I n some circumstances we may reduce the distribution of potentially violating content even when our systems predict that a specific post has a very low probability of violating our policies while our teams investigate it. The extent of that reduction is based on the confidence of our systems’ prediction as well as local conditions. For example we may take less action to reduce a piece of content in News Feed that is determined to have a 25% chance of violating our policies on hate speech versus a piece of content that has a 50% percent chance of violating.

In a crisis we will determine what kind of support and teams we need to dedicate to a particular country or language and for how long we need to keep them in place. This might include deploying our Integrity Product Operations Centers model to monitor and respond to threats in real time. It can also include seeking to ensure our integrity systems and resources are robust and ready where there may be ongoing risk of political unrest or building temporary product levers ahead of a protest or a culturally sensitive event — all while ensuring that we have teams ready to support unplanned events such responding to the coup in Myanmar.

We know that we face a number of challenges with this work and it is a complex and often adversarial space — there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Many of these offline issues have existed for decades or longer and media services have a long history of being abused by those seeking to assert or maintain power or incite violence. But we know our work to keep our global community safe will never be finished and it requires ongoing vigilance and investments. That’s what we’ve done for many years and we will continue doing it going forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbWV0YXZlcnNlL25ld3NWaWV3L2tlZDIwMjExMDI0MDAwMtIBMWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbmV3c0FtcC9rZWQyMDIxMTAyNDAwMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Masayoshi Son to bet $170 mn on Naver metaverse platform,"Softbank Group founder Masayoshi Son

K-pop girl group Blackpink avatars created by Zepeto

Softbank Group founder Masayoshi Son is slated to bet $170 million on Naver Corp.’s metaverse platform. The investment is expected to help Naver expand business in the market where global major players such as Roblox Corp. Facebook Inc. and Google fiercely compete.Softbank Vision Fund 2 plans to invest 200 billion won ($170 million) along with South Korean venture capital firms in Naver Z Corp. the operator of South Korea's metaverse platform Zepeto according to investment banking sources.Naver Z is in the final stages of talks with investors for the money the sources said. Softbank Vision Fund 2 accounted for the majority of the investment while three or four local venture capital firms were reportedly seeking participation. Softbank initially aimed the investment alone but other investors joined it due to Zepeto’s popularity. A Naver official declined to comment.Zepeto attracted 240 million users including the largest overseas customer base for South Korea’s internet service except for online games. The app allows users to play games communicate with others through 3D avatars as well as make money through the production of fashion items and other content.The app has become a popular playground for teens and twentysomethings  with teenagers making up 80% of its users. K-pop girl groups Blackpink and TWICE create their content on the app to communicate with fans around the world. Non-Koreans make up about 90% of its users.Zepeto needs to focus on further expansion in the global market since it is a latecomer with a launch in 2018. Its larger competitor Roblox started the business in 2006.“A paradigm shift to the era of the metaverse is taking place like the mobile transition period” said an information technology industry source. “A company that dominates this market first will become an industry leader like Google Facebook and Apple.”Competition in the global metaverse sector is intensifying. Facebook decided to invest $50 million and prepares to change the company’s name related to the metaverse. Roblox acquired Guilded Inc. an operator of a platform to connect gaming communities while Epic Games the developer of the hit game Fortnite completed a $1 billion round of funding for the business.Zepeto’s growth potential in the global market was limited given its heavy reliance on China as users in the country account for 70% of the total.With the latest investment Zepeto plans to expand its business to Japan the US and Europe.Japan is a market where Zepeto is expected to quickly increase its market shares given close cooperation between Naver and Softbank. They are operating Line and Yahoo Japan together through a joint venture Z Holdings.Naver and Softbank are expected to jointly develop a metaverse platform through Zepeto making it easier to expand the business in Japan supported by Line and Yahoo Japan analysts said.Softbank is expected to challenge global major metaverse platform companies such as Roblox by investments in other promising metaverse platform operators starting from Zepeto.In 2014-2015 Softbank formed a pan-Asia alliance against Uber Technologies Inc. with investments in Asian mobility startups such as DiDi Chuxing in China and Grab in Southeast Asia. Uber failed to expand market shares in Asia and withdrew its business from some countries in the region.“This is Softbank’s first major investment in a metaverse platform” said another IT industry source referring to the investment in Zepeto. “Even after Zepeto Softbank will ramp up its influence by investing in various platforms. Zepeto will be able to use them as strong allies in fighting in the global market.”Naver Z which posted an operating loss of 18.8 billion won last year is expected to upgrade various services with the fund raised from Softbank.The operator of Zepeto is likely to step up efforts to establish its own economic ecosystem based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital assets that cannot be reproduced altered or counterfeited as they are deployed on a decentralized blockchain. Since NFT technology is applied to Zepeto’s services such as content transactions Naver invested in a blockchain startup Superblock in August.Naver Z is also expected to upgrade its service for users’ game development to be released later this year. The service benchmarks Roblox that became popular as it allows users to develop and sell games. Facebook acquired Unit 2 Games for such a service.Softbank’s investment is set to help Naver Z increase content for Zepeto. It has been expanding content with an investment of 17 billion won from HYBE Co. JYP Entertainment Inc. and YG Entertainment Inc.“Naver Z will be able to accelerate the establishment of ecosystem and content expansion through acquisition and investment in startups with the cash” said an IT industry source.Min-Ki Koo and Chae-Yeon Kim at kook@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",,,,,,,,,

And he’s not about to stop now.

“I like the Giants what can I tell you?” said Ryan who will be honored at MetLife Stadium during Sunday’s home game against the Carolina Panthers as a season ticket holder for more than six decades.

Longtime New York Giants fan Francis Ryan.

The 94-year-old World War II veteran has attended almost every home game since 1957 when Ryan longtime friend Ron Herald and eight other New York Telephone Co. employees shelled out about $40 apiece to buy a row of season tickets.

“I worked with Ron in Flushing” Ryan remembered. “We gave him the money and he’d get the tickets but the only guys I knew was him and his brother. Everyone else worked for different parts of the phone company.”

Francis Ryan 94 is a World War II veteran.

At the time the Giants were playing at Yankee Stadium. Jim Lee Howell coached the G Men and wide receiver Frank Gifford carried the team to a second-place spot in the NFL Eastern Conference with a 7-5 record — a much more palatable season than current one.

“The Giants’ defense this year is awful” Ryan said about the team’s current 1-5 record. “Their offense is OK but the defense? Good God!”

The Brooklyn native’s love affair with the Giants began about a decade before he became a season ticket holder. In the 1940s Ryan was a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers — the football team that is not the baseball franchise soon to abandon the borough.

In 1944 a year before Ryan was drafted into the U.S. Army the Dodgers renamed themselves the Brooklyn Tigers before merging with another team and closing up shop.

Ryan who served in the Panama Canal Zone during the war followed a few of the former Dodgers players to the Giants and has remained a fan ever since. But his first set of season tickets weren’t the best Ryan remembers.

“There was a pole right in front of my face” he said. “I had to lean to the left and lean to the right just to see anything.”

When the Giants moved to the Meadowlands in 1976 Ryan followed securing season tickets on the 35-yard line. In 2010 MetLife Stadium opened and Ryan managed to get seats at the 20-yard line behind the Giants bench but at great cost: Before buying the $3500 season passes he had to pay $10000 a pop for a Personal Seat License.

“I couldn’t afford it but one of my sons helped me buy the PSLs” he said. “[Other season ticket holders] dropped out like crazy but my seats are two seats away from the next section and they went for $20000 for each PSL!”

Today Ryan usually watches the games with one of his four children sporting one of his favorite New York Giants or World War II veteran hats. No matter what the score he’ll be in his seat watching until the bitter end.

“If it’s raining or anything I’ll get up to get out of the rain but I’ll still be watching” said the resilient Long Island resident who played both ice hockey and baseball until his mid-60s.

Francis Ryan (left) and his son Brendan Ryan.

“Last week the Giants got shot down like 40 times but I sat through the whole thing” he said recalling the 38-11 loss to the Rams.

Ryan’s hoping for a better outcome Sunday.

“I don’t know what to expect” he said. “So far I prayed the rosary like 15 times.”

Francis Ryan will be honored at MetLife Stadium during the Giants’ home game on Sunday Oct. 24 as a season ticket holder for more than six decades.

The only way he’ll give up his seat is if one of his his three sons daughter or son-in-law wanted to see one of their favorite teams huddle up against Big Blue. One of Ryan’s sons is a Cowboys fan and his son-in-law is an Eagles fan but there’s no accounting for taste.

Health issues also forced him to give up a few home games this season but the long-suffering fan still watched the Giants on his hospital TV. And as soon as he was discharged he was back on the 20-yard line — and he doesn’t plan to give up his season tickets anytime soon.

“I’ll let you know when I’m in my casket” he joked.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveHdlYXRoZXIuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9uaWNlLXdlYXRoZXItZXhwZWN0ZWQtZm9yLXBhbnRoZXJzLXZzLWdpYW50cy1nYW1l0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94d2VhdGhlci5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25pY2Utd2VhdGhlci1leHBlY3RlZC1mb3ItcGFudGhlcnMtdnMtZ2lhbnRzLWdhbWUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Classic football weather expected for Panthers vs Giants game,"EAST RUTHERFORD NJ – It’ll be a battle of who wants to remain out of the NFC cellar at MetLife Stadium as the Panthers take on the Giants in some classic fall weather.

On Sunday the New York Giants took notice.

The G-Men honored the Brooklyn native before the team’s win over the Carolina Panthers at MetLife Stadium recognizing him for both his military service and startling 63 years as a season ticket holder.

“It was unbelievable greater than anything I could’ve imagined” Ryan who is from Sheepshead Bay told The Post. “As always the Giants fans were awesome. I am truly honored.”

Ryan has been a season ticket holder since 1957 when the Giants played at Yankee Stadium and the price tag was a mere $40.

Today he’s shelling out $1750 and still prefers the oldtimers — but is no less enthusiastic about his gridiron team.

“Frank Gifford was my favorite” Ryan said. “YA Title Charlie Connerly were great. Today’s players couldn’t measure up to those guys.”

But he conceded “Lawrence Taylor and Michael Strahan were great too.”

Ryan joined the US Army out of James Madison High School and served in the Panama Canal Zone during the war — receiving the Victory and American Theater medals.

On Sunday he stood in the end zone at MetLife with his four children their spouses and five grandchildren sharing the special moment with him.

“I was stunned when the Giants called me” he said. “It is an unbelievable thrill and honor to be recognized for both my loyalty as a fan and my military career.”

It was over when Sam Darnold stepped on the field.

(Kidding. Kinda.)

It was definitely over when stepped off it of though.

Darnold with the Panthers down 15-3 was benched in favor of P.J. Walker at the 12:41 mark of the fourth quarter. Whether that hook was a desperate attempt to spark the offense or just a white flag that 12-point deficit felt like a 1200-point deficit.

Giants kicker Graham Gano ironically enough pushed the game out of distance with a 44-yard field goal with just under six minutes remaining. That was followed up by a 19-yard touchdown run by New York running back Devontae Booker a minute later to make it 25-3."

Eleven Pablo Picasso artworks have been sold for a combined $109 million in a Las Vegas auction coinciding with the artist's 140th birthday.

The nine paintings and two ceramic pieces had been displayed inside the Picasso restaurant at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art for more than two decades until owner MGM Resorts decided earlier this year to sell them.

The Saturday event was organized by Sotheby's and marked the first time the famed auction house staged an evening marquee sale in North America outside its New York saleroom. It featured Picasso artworks from 1917 to 1969.

Auction officials said Picasso's 1938 portrait of his muse Marie-Thérèse Walter entitled ""Femme au béret rouge-orange"" (""Woman in a reddish-orange hat"") sold for $40.5 million after a bidding battle well above estimates of $20 million to $30 million.

The painting last sold at auction in the 1980s for around $900000 and was acquired by casino mogul Steve Wynn in 1998 and became MGM Resorts' property when the company purchased The Mirage resort from Wynn.

The Picasso auction also featured two Cubist-inspired still life paintings from the early 1940s during World War II with ""Nature morte au panier de fruits et aux fleurs"" selling for $16.6 million and ""Nature morte aux fleurs et au compotier"" going for $8.3 million.

""Homme et enfant"" a 1959 work that is nearly two meters tall sold for $24.4 million.

Picasso lived from 1881 until 1973 and spent much of his adult life in France.

Over the course of more than 70 years as a working artist Picasso is said to have created more than 13000 paintings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL21hcmtldC9tZ20tY2FzaW5vLXBpY2Fzc28tYXVjdGlvbi1zb3RoZWJ5cy0xMjM0NjA3ODkzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Picasso Auction at MGM Casino Brings in More Than $100 M.,"Against the backdrop of a buzzing Las Vegas 11 works by Pablo Picasso auctioned by Sotheby’s at the MGM Bellagio resort on Saturday evening brought in a total of $108 million.

The works sold in the Nevada city had been on display for nearly two decades with five of the sale’s lots long showcased at the casino’s restaurant which is named for the Spanish modernist. The works entered the Bellagio’s collection via the hotel’s previous owner mega-collector Steve Wynn who amassed a collection of blue-chip 19th- and 20th-century art housed at the Bellagio’s art gallery. The art and hotel changed hands when the MGM franchise purchased the resort in 2000.

The entire grouping was backed by the auction house with a guarantee with each lot sold by the sale’s end. Three lots—a painting of a man and a self-portrait produced in 1967 and 1969 respectively and a 1948 still life—came to the sale with irrevocable bids. The 11 works were expected to fetch an estimated of $70.5 million-$100 million.

Sotheby’s veteran auctioneer Oliver Barker took to the rostrum on Saturday to lead the sale which lasted only 45 minutes. Taking place in a Bellagio ballroom converted to the auction house’s redesigned stage a packed room full of VIP onlookers attended as seated dinner guests. The setting was more intimate and the energy more relaxed than that of a New York marquee sale. For those viewing by livestream it felt like happening upon a private show.

The work which fetched the highest price was the 1938 portrait Femme au Béret Rouge-Orange which depicts Picasso’s muse Marie-Thérèse Walter. Four bidders wrestled for the work. One intent bidder in the room whose paddle number was not revealed went up against clients on the phone with Sotheby’s chairman Brooke Lampley global head of contemporary art Gregoire Billaut and Sotheby’s Houston office head Aliyaa Stude. It eventually hammered with Stude’s client at $35 million going for a final price of $40.5 million premium. The hammer price was well over the pre-sale estimate of $30 million. More than 30 years ago it sold at auction for $880000; Wynn purchased it a decade later.

A large-scale vibrant portrait Homme et Enfant (1969) sold for $24.4 million to a bidder on the phone with Billaut who triumphed over Lampley’s bidder to win it. Another big-ticket item that came to the sale with an irrevocable bid was Buste d’Homme (1969) which had long been displayed over the Picasso’s bar. It went for $9.5 million hammering below its estimate of $10 million. One of two still lifes on offer Nature morte au panier de fruits et aux fleurs (1942) exceeded its $15 million high estimate selling for $16.6 million and going to a bidder on the phone with Sotheby’s head of private sales David Schrader.

Private third-party deals like the ones secured for three of the sale’s lots including Buste d’Homme often keep bidding competition low. Many times when a lot with an irrevocable bid hits the auction block it sells on a single bid to the backer. Without the arrangement Femme au Béret one of the sale’s highest estimated lots saw a spirited bidding spar that drove the hammer price up well past its expectation.

It was one of the smaller works painted on ceramic that saw one of the night’s longest bidding periods. Le Dejeuner sur l’herbe (1962) featuring four nude figures in yellow and blue tones takes as its inspiration a Manet work of the same title. It sold for $2.1 million going for for more than four times its $500000 high estimate. It hammered at $1.1 million after a bidding spar between Sotheby’s Miami correspondent Alexandra Rossetti who won it against three other bidders including a man in the room. Another bidder on the phone with Schrader won a 1917 ink drawing of clown titled Pierrot which sold for $4.4 million against an estimate of $2.5 million.

Saturday’s sale was part of a move on MGM’s part to restructure its public-facing art collection and focus on presenting works by more diverse artists according to Ari Kastrati MGM Resorts’ chief hospitality officer. The restaurant will keep 12 other Picasso works on view.

Sales of valuable corporate collections are nothing new to major auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s but staging an auction at the very space that once owned the works is rare. The tactic—transforming an evening sale into a bespoke event—is one which one Sotheby’s specialist described to ARTnews before the sale as being “mutually beneficial” to both the house and the hotel. The change in atmosphere was felt in Barker’s opening description of the transported stage. He called the auction “our signature evening sale on the road.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC11cy1jYW5hZGEtNTkwMjYyMjDSATVodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtdXMtY2FuYWRhLTU5MDI2MjIwLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Picasso masterpieces fetch nearly $110m at Las Vegas auction,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9tZ20taXMtYXVjdGlvbmluZy1pdHMtMTEtcGljYXNzby13b3Jrcy10aGF0LWhhbmctaW4tYmVsbGFnaW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MGM Is Auctioning Its 11 Picasso Works That Hang In Bellagio,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.casino.org', port=443): Read timed out.

The works included nine paintings and two ceramic pieces spanning from 1917 to 1938 and had previously been on display at the Bellagio Gallery of fine arts for the last 20 years until MGM decided to sell them earlier this year.

Saturday’s auction which lasted just 45 minutes was the first hosted by Sotheby’s in North America outside of its New York City location. About 150 people attended.

The most expensive work was the 1938 painting “Femme au béret rouge-orange” [“Woman in a reddish-orange hat”] which is a portrait of Picasso’s muse Marie-Thérèse Walter.

The piece fetched $40.5 million dollars following a tense bidding battle much higher than the $20-30 million expected.

The painting was last sold at auction in the 1980s for $900000 before casino developer Steve Wynn acquired it in 1998. It became MGM Resort’s when the company purchased Wynn’s resort The Mirage.

Other pieces included two Cubist still-lifes Picasso painted during a period of isolation in Paris during WWII “Nature morte aux fleurs et au compotier” and “Nature morte au panier de fruits et aux fleurs” selling for $8.3 million and $16.6 million respectively.

For a product so devoid of anything digital this didn’t exempt the tire industry from the crisis threatening to bring the whole industry to its knees.

Initial reports claim Continental expects to lower its profit margins by between 5.2%and 5.6% way down from a previous estimate of 6.5% to 7%. Outside of chip shortages the company also claims a worldwide supply chain meltdown is a second major contributing factor in a profit loss the global leader in performance tire production likely hadn’t anticipated.Statistics presented by Continental themselves show their third-quarter sales were approximately 8.04 billion euros ($9.35 billion). Down from 8.6 billion in the third quarter last year. A drop in sales of only 500 million euros may not seem like a dire situation for a brand as large as Continental.But with shortages in other materials like magnesium and natural rubber also reported in the last year there may be tough times ahead not just for Continental but the entirty of the tire industry. How it affects the industry as a whole still remains to be seen.Executives from other Tire manufacturers like Goodyear in America have already claimed they will not be affected by potential rubber shortages at least in the short term. But the global manufacturing sector is in the midst of a supply chain catastrophe not seen since the Second World War almost eight decades ago. It’s a precarious situation that could turn even more ugly for the industry exceptionally quickly with enough disruption.At day’s end if there are no new cars in need of four shiny new tires Continental Goodyear and every other tire company on the planet will be hard-pressed to move nearly as much inventory as they’re likely used to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9lY29ub215LXBvbGljeS9nb3Z0LWV4cGVjdHMtaW5kaWFuLWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctdG8tcmVhY2gtMzAwLWJuLW1vcy1pdC0xMjExMDIyMDE3MzhfMS5odG1s0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9lY29ub215LXBvbGljeS9nb3Z0LWV4cGVjdHMtaW5kaWFuLWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctdG8tcmVhY2gtMzAwLWJuLW1vcy1pdC0xMjExMDIyMDE3MzhfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Govt expects Indian electronics manufacturing to reach $300 bn: MoS IT,"The government expects the Indian electronics manufacturing sector to grow to around USD 300 billion (about Rs 22.5 lakh crore) by 2024-25 Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said on Friday.

Speaking at an event by the Public Affairs Forum of India (PAFI) the minister said the government is looking beyond devices and communication with expansion plans looking at equipment and systems and further to automotive and medical equipment.

Chandrasekhar said in 2014-15 the electronics production in the country was about Rs 1.8 lakh crore which grew to Rs 5.5 lakh crore in five years.

Electronics is the second largest traded commodity after hydrocarbons and petroleum he noted.

""We were marginal players for decades but we have grown on the back of very precise policy action..."" Chandrasekhar said.

He further said in the USD 1.5 trillion global electronics market where there is clamour for a diversified and trusted supply chain the government has now decided that India should be a significant player in that space.

""Our ambitions are reasonable. We believe that by 2024-25 we want to be at about USD 250-300 billion worth of electronics manufacturing in India"" Chandrasekhar said.

The national electronics policy had set a target to create a USD 400 billion electronics manufacturing ecosystem by 2025.

The minister also said India will be a very significant provider of trusted goods and services to the global market.

He said at some point in the not so distant future India will have the ability to manufacture semiconductors as well.",,,,,,,,,

This is the same actor behind the cyberattacks targeting SolarWinds customers in 2020 and which the U.S. government and others have identified as being part of Russia’s foreign intelligence service known as the SVR.

Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers. We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers. We began observing this latest campaign in May 2021 and have been notifying impacted partners and customers while also developing new technical assistance and guidance for the reseller community. Since May we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers that have been targeted by Nobelium. We continue to investigate but to date we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been compromised. Fortunately we have discovered this campaign during its early stages and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers technology providers and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful.

These attacks have been a part of a larger wave of Nobelium activities this summer. In fact between July 1 and October 19 this year we informed 609 customers that they had been attacked 22868 times by Nobelium with a success rate in the low single digits. By comparison prior to July 1 2021 we had notified customers about attacks from all nation-state actors 20500 times over the past three years.

This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government. While we are sharing details here about the most recent activity by Nobelium the Microsoft Digital Defense Report published earlier this month highlights continued attacks from other nation-state actors and cybercriminals. In line with these attacks we are notifying our customers when they are targeted or compromised by those actors.

The attacks we’ve observed in the recent campaign against resellers and service providers have not attempted to exploit any flaw or vulnerability in software but rather used well-known techniques like password spray and phishing to steal legitimate credentials and gain privileged access. We have learned enough about these new attacks which began as early as May this year that we can now provide actionable information which can be used to defend against this new approach.

We’ve also been coordinating with others in the security community to improve our knowledge of and protections against Nobelium’s activity and we’ve been working closely with government agencies in the U.S. and Europe. While we are clear-eyed that nation-states including Russia will not stop attacks like these overnight we believe steps like the cybersecurity executive order in the U.S. and the greater coordination and information sharing we’ve seen between industry and government in the past two years have put us all in a much better position to defend against them.

We have long maintained and evolved the security requirements and policies we enforce with service providers that sell or support Microsoft technology. For example in September 2020 we updated contracts with our resellers to expand Microsoft’s abilities and rights to address reseller security incidents and to require that resellers implement specific security protections for their environments such as restricting Partner Portal access and requiring that resellers enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) in accessing our cloud portals and underlying services and we will take the necessary and appropriate steps to enforce these security commitments. We continue to assess and identify new opportunities to drive greater security throughout the partner ecosystem recognizing the need for continuous improvement. As a result of what we have learned over the past several months we are working to implement improvements that will help better secure and protect the ecosystem especially for the technology partners in our supply chain:

As noted above in September 2020 we rolled out MFA to access Partner Center and to use delegated administrative privilege (DAP) to manage a customer environment

On October 15 we launched a program to provide two years of an Azure Active Directory Premium plan for free that provides extended access to additional premium features to strengthen security controls

Microsoft threat protection and security operations tools such as Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) M365 Defender Azure Defender and Azure Sentinel have added detections to help organizations identify and respond to these attacks

We are currently piloting new and more granular features for organizations that want to provide privileged access to resellers

We are piloting improved monitoring to empower partners and customers to manage and audit their delegated privileged accounts and remove unnecessary authority

We are auditing unused privileged accounts and working with partners to assess and remove unnecessary privilege and access

Today we are also releasing technical guidance that can help organizations protect themselves against the latest Nobelium activity we’ve observed as the actor has honed its techniques as well as guidance for partners.

These are just the immediate steps that we’ve taken and in the coming months we will be engaging closely with all of our technology partners to further improve security. We will make it easier for service providers of all sizes to access our most advanced services for managing secure log-in identity and access management solutions for free or at a low cost.

As we said in May progress must continue. At Microsoft we will continue our efforts across all these issues and will continue to work across the private sector with the U.S. administration and with all other interested governments to make this progress.

Microsoft angered the .NET open source community earlier this week by removing a key part of Hot Reload in the upcoming release of .NET 6 a feature that allows developers to modify source code while an app is running and immediately see the results.

It’s a feature many had been looking forward to using in Visual Studio Code and across multiple platforms until Microsoft made a controversial last-minute decision to lock it to Visual Studio 2022 which is a mostly paid product that’s limited to Windows. Sources at Microsoft speaking on condition of anonymity told The Verge that the last-minute change was made by Julia Liuson the head of Microsoft’s developer division and was a business-focused move.

Microsoft admits it made a mistake

Microsoft has now reversed the change following a backlash and anger inside the company from many of Microsoft’s own employees. “We made a mistake in executing on our decision and took longer than expected to respond back to the community” explains Scott Hunter director of program management for .NET. Microsoft has now approved the community’s pull request to re-enable this feature and it will be available in the final version of the .NET 6 SDK.

We asked Microsoft to comment on the fact an executive ordered the change but the company didn’t want to discuss the controversial decision. “We have taken steps to address the issue that some of our OSS community members have experienced” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. “Hot Reload capability will be in the general availability build of the .NET 6 SDK available on November 8th.”

Microsoft’s blog post doesn’t address this controversial decision though. Instead it suggests it was simply a mistake to remove the code instead of simply disabling it and not a business decision. “In our effort to scope we inadvertently ended up deleting the source code instead of just not invoking that code path” says Hunter.

While the reversal will be a welcome one for the .NET community the explanation and circumstances around this incident won’t sit easy with those who value transparency around such decisions.

“As is true with many companies we are learning to balance the needs of OSS community and being a corporate sponsor for .NET” says Hunter. “Sometimes we don’t get it right. When we don’t the best we can do is learn from our mistakes and be better moving forward.”

This eventful episode came after weeks of unrest in the .NET community over Microsoft’s involvement in the .NET Foundation. The foundation was created in 2014 when Microsoft made .NET open source and it’s supposed to be an independent organization that exists to improve open source software development and collaboration for .NET. A resigning board member questioned the role of the .NET Foundation recently asking whether it’s “here to enforce Microsoft’s will on .NET open source or are you here to help foster and promote a healthy community?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS93aW5kb3dzLXhwLXR1cm5zLTIwLW1pY3Jvc29mdHMtcmlzZS1hbmQtZmFsbC1wb2ludHMtdG8tb25lLXRoaW5nLWRvbnQtZml4LXdoYXQtaXNudC1icm9rZW4tMTY2NDkz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Windows XP turns 20: Microsoft's rise and fall points to one thing — don't fix what isn't broken,"Twenty years on from the public release of Windows XP the popular operating system is still regarded one of Microsoft’s greatest achievements.

As of August this year Windows XP still maintained a greater market share than its successor Windows Vista.

When mainstream support for XP ended in April 2009 it was running on a huge 75% of Windows computers and about 19% of people were still using XP when extended security support finished in 2014. Microsoft provided security support in a few special cases such as for military use until 2019 — an incredible 18 years after the initial release.

But what made XP excel? And what has Microsoft learned in the two decades since its release?

The rise and rise of Windows XP

Windows XP launched on October 25 2001 during a golden age at Microsoft when the company was achieving its highest revenues yet dominated the PC market and had taken a strong lead over Netscape in the browser wars (after the latter led the race through the 1990s). XP also came at a time when more people than ever were buying their first personal computer.

These personal and business computers arrived with a full suite of Microsoft software pre-installed and ready to use. As a result the Windows operating system defined many people’s computing experience.

Built on the core of the highly successful Windows NT operating system (also the foundation for Windows 2000) Windows XP provided an option which for the first time looked and felt the same whether it was being used at home or at work.

The prioritisation of users’ needs in this way represented a watershed moment for Microsoft and was a key ingredient in the long reign of XP. XP also featured several innovations including the introduction of the Microsoft Error Reporting platform.

Earlier versions of Windows had become infamous for the so-called “blue screen of death” that appeared when the system encountered an error. XP replaced this with a small pop-up to collect data about the error and send it to Microsoft’s engineers to help them improve the software.

During the tenure of XP Microsoft also launched Visual Studio .NET a software suite for building new Windows programs. This combined all their developer tools for a variety of programming languages including Visual C++ and Visual Basic and the new “object-oriented” language C# – a rival to the popular Java language.

This was further evidence of changing attitudes at Microsoft; the company was centred on prioritising users. But it didn’t last.

The fall of Vista and Windows 7

In 2007 Windows Vista — the successor to XP — was released. It was considered an inferior bloated and unusable system by many commentators including Time magazine. Designed for high-powered computers Vista was often excruciatingly slow and frustrating to use on older machines that comfortably ran XP.

Windows 7 followed Vista in 2009 confronting users with massive changes. It initially forced users on computers with a keyboard and mouse into a tablet-style interaction on the home screen.

The familiar icons and desktop format vanished. Instead users were greeted with differently-sized tiles and scrolling mechanisms that were perfect for touch-screens but awkward for mouse navigation.

It seemed Microsoft no longer had users’ wishes as its priority. It wasn’t until the release of Windows 8 in 2012 that the company returned to its user-first paradigm. And this change was spurred in no small part by having to compete with Apple’s MacOS (Macbooks) iOS (iPhones and iPads) and Android phones and tablets.

Branching away from PCs

Although released at the same time as Windows XP Microsoft’s first tablet offering was widely regarded a failure too. The Windows XP tablet was based on a cut-down operating system and a completely different family of processors.

The tablet’s system was hamstrung by connectivity issues related to its need for consistent and stable internet connection (which even now is not a given in the mobile world). It was also incompatible with existing software offerings.

A similar story unfolded in the mobile phone space. Early Windows phones such as Windows Phone 7 released in 2010 without many basic functions such as copy and paste were never serious competitors for Apple’s iPhones or Google’s Android phones.

In 2013 Microsoft purchased Nokia’s mobile and devices division (later abandoned and resold in 2016) but its phones were still unsuccessful.

Although Windows phones are still available Microsoft changed lanes in 2014. Incoming chief executive Satya Nadella said the new agenda was “mobile first cloud first” meaning cloud-connected mobile computing was the focus. Nadella outlined a desire to create a Windows NT for the internet.

This is something the Microsoft Azure cloud-computing service and Surface Pro tablet — now with the same processors as its PC cousins and the ability to run without a constant internet connection — have achieved.

Cloud or service-oriented computing means you can use any type of device to access your operating system (known as “platform as a service”) and office productivity tools such as Office365 (“software as a service”).

Azure represents a return to Microsoft providing computing that serves the needs of businesses and people.

If it’s not broken don’t fix it

Modern computing is a balance between portability power consumption usability and speed among other factors. Companies can no longer just throw advanced hardware at a problem and expect the public to tolerate poor user experience.

The success of XP and subsequent failures of its successors present many lessons to the technology sector — the chief of which is this: if it’s not broken don’t fix it.

By acknowledging earlier mistakes and reverting to a user-first policy Microsoft could indeed secure its place in the market for decades to come.

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said the attacks were part of a planned campaign that began in May this year.

The attacks included spear-phishing campaigns and password-spraying operations that targeted employees of companies that manage IT and cloud infrastructure on behalf of their clients.

“We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers” said Tom Burt Corporate Vice President for Customer Security & Trust at Microsoft.

“We have learned enough about these new attacks which began as early as May this year that we can now provide actionable information which can be used to defend against this new approach” Burt said.

Indicators of compromise from these attacks are available in an MSTIC report published earlier today.

Nobelium which the White House tied to Russian intelligence service SVR is the same threat actor that orchestrated the attack against US software provider SolarWinds in 2020. The group hacked SolarWinds inserted malware inside one of its software products and then used the malware to enter the networks of high-value targets such as government agencies and large corporations.

These attacks disclosed today carried out on a large scale confirm that the SolarWinds intrusion was deemed a success for the Russian group which is now trying to replicate it again by attacking other companies part of the software supply chain attack of organizations across the world.

She was shot and killed in her apartment by a man she had not even been dating for two weeks. Her family is hopeful the lawsuit filed can bring change for anyone put in a similar situation.

""She worked hard she was a go-getter and she knew she wanted to make a difference in this world"" Natalia's mom LaKeshia Cox said.

Cox's mom and dad Lester and Lakeshia Cox spoke out for the first time since their daughter's life was cut short in March.

""We were understandably upset. It was probably more so disbelief"" Lester Cox said.

Cox was shot multiple times in her unit at the Colonial Grand at Canyon Pointe apartment complex. The man who allegedly did it is Henry Watson Jr. who Cox had only gone on two dates with.



""As we've said in the past things escalated pretty quickly"" Lester said.

Days before Cox was killed Austin Police had responded to a call of a terrorist threat at her home. According to an affidavit Watson showed up with a gun. Watson yelled that if he was not let inside then he would ""shoot his way in."" He tried to enter the apartment by kicking the door in. Watson fled the scene before police could arrive.

The lawsuit claims Cox and her roommate went to management at the apartment complex to relocate them to a different unit but were told they would need to pay the fees to move. The process required the roommates to pay a new application fee new security deposit new administrative fee and two months' rent for failure to provide 60 days' notice of move-out. They were unable to and were forced to stay in the unit.

""I think our biggest change that we want to make is defining what does help look like when it comes from an apartment complex when someone has expressed that their life is in danger and they need help and they need help fast"" LaKeisha Cox said.

The lawsuit seeks to hold Mid-American Apartment Communities (MAA) and one of its property managers accountable. It said the manager failed to take appropriate and reasonable steps to protect Cox's safety.

""It's not just women it's any person that can be put in danger because Natalia just met this young man"" LaKeisha said.

Cox would have turned 22 years old in just a few weeks. CBS Austin has reached out to MAA for comment and we’re still waiting to hear back.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The energy in the gleaming labs matches the urgency of their mission to narrow vaccine disparities. By working to replicate Moderna’s COVID-19 shot the scientists are effectively making an end run around an industry that has vastly prioritized rich countries over poor in both sales and manufacturing.

And they are doing it with unusual backing from the World Health Organization which is coordinating a vaccine research training and production hub in South Africa along with a related supply chain for critical raw materials. It’s a last-resort effort to make doses for people going without and the intellectual property implications are still murky.

“We are doing this for Africa at this moment and that drives us” said Emile Hendricks a 22-year-old biotechnologist for Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines the company trying to reproduce the Moderna shot. “We can no longer rely on these big superpowers to come in and save us.”

Some experts see reverse engineering — recreating vaccines from fragments of publicly available information — as one of the few remaining ways to redress the power imbalances of the pandemic. Only 0.7% of vaccines have gone to low-income countries so far while nearly half have gone to wealthy countries according to an analysis by the People’s Vaccine Alliance.

That WHO which relies upon the goodwill of wealthy countries and the pharmaceutical industry for its continued existence is leading the attempt to reproduce a proprietary vaccine demonstrates the depths of the supply disparities.

The U.N.-backed effort to even out global vaccine distribution known as COVAX has failed to alleviate dire shortages in poor countries. Donated doses are coming in at a fraction of what is needed to fill the gap. Meanwhile pressure for drug companies to share including Biden administration demands on Moderna has led nowhere.

Until now WHO has never directly taken part in replicating a novel vaccine for current global use over the objections of the original developers. The Cape Town hub is intended to expand access to the novel messenger RNA technology that Moderna as well as Pfizer and German partner BioNTech used in their vaccines.

“This is the first time we’re doing it to this level because of the urgency and also because of the novelty of this technology” said Martin Friede a WHO vaccine research coordinator who is helping direct the hub.

Dr. Tom Frieden the former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has described the world as “being held hostage” by Moderna and Pfizer whose vaccines are considered the most effective against COVID-19. The novel mRNA process uses the genetic code for the spike protein of the coronavirus and is thought to trigger a better immune response than traditional vaccines.

Arguing that American taxpayers largely funded Moderna’s vaccine development the Biden administration has insisted the company must expand production to help supply developing nations. The global shortfall through 2022 is estimated at 500 million and 4 billion doses depending on how many other vaccines come on the market.

“The United States government has played a very substantial role in making Moderna the company it is” said David Kessler the head of Operation Warp Speed the U.S. program to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development.

Kessler would not say how far the administration would go in pressing the company. “They understand what we expect to happen” he said.

Moderna has pledged to build a vaccine factory in Africa at some point in the future. But after pleading with drugmakers to share their recipes raw materials and technological know-how some poorer countries are done waiting.

Afrigen Managing Director Petro Terblanche said the Cape Town company is aiming to have a version of the Moderna vaccine ready for testing in people within a year and scaled up for commercial production not long after.

“We have a lot of competition coming from Big Pharma. They don’t want to see us succeed” Terblanche said. “They are already starting to say that we don’t have the capability to do this. We are going to show them.”

If the team in South Africa succeeds in making a version of Moderna’s vaccine the information will be publicly released for use by others Terblanche said. Such sharing is closer to an approach U.S. President Joe Biden championed in the spring and the pharmaceutical industry strongly opposes.

Commercial production is the point at which intellectual property could become an issue. Moderna has said it would not pursue legal action against a company for infringing on its vaccine rights but neither has it offered to help companies that have volunteered to make its mRNA shot.

Chairman Noubar Afeyan said Moderna determined it would be better to expand production itself than to share technology and plans to deliver billions of additional doses next year.

“Within the next six to nine months the most reliable way to make high-quality vaccines and in an efficient way is going to be if we make them” Afeyan said.

Zoltan Kis an expert in messenger RNA vaccines at Britain’s University of Sheffield said reproducing Moderna’s vaccine is “doable” but the task would be far easier if the company shared its expertise. Kis estimated the process involves fewer than a dozen major steps. But certain procedures are tricky such as sealing the fragile messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles he said.

“It’s like a very complicated cooking recipe” he said. “Having the recipe would be very very helpful and it would also help if someone could show you how to do it.”

A U.N.-backed public health organization still hopes to persuade Moderna that its approach to providing vaccines for poorer countries misses the mark. Formed in 2010 the Medicines Patent Pool initially focused on convincing pharmaceutical companies to share patents for AIDS drugs.

“It’s not about outsiders helping Africa” Executive Director Charles Gore said of the South Africa vaccine hub. “Africa wants to be empowered and that’s what this is about.”

It will eventually fall to Gore to try to resolve the intellectual property question. Work to recreate Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is protected as research so a potential dispute would surround steps to sell a replicated version commercially he said.

“It’s about persuading Moderna to work with us rather than using other methods” Gore said.

He said the Medicines Patent Pool repeatedly tried but failed to convince Pfizer and BioNTech to even discuss sharing their formulas.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi who is among the members of Congress backing a bill that calls on the United States to invest more in making and distributing COVID-19 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries said reverse engineering isn’t going to happen fast enough to keep the virus from mutating and spreading further.

“We need to show some hustle. We have to show a sense of urgency and I’m not seeing that urgency” he said. “Either we end this pandemic or we muddle our way through.”

Campaigners argue the meager amount of vaccines available to poorer countries through donations COVAX and purchases suggests the Western-dominated pharmaceutical industry is broken.

“The enemy to these corporations is losing their potential profit down the line” Joia Mukherjee chief medical officer of the global health nonprofit Partners in Health said. “The enemy isn’t the virus the enemy isn’t suffering.”

Back in Cape Town the promise of using mRNA technology against other diseases motivates the young scientists.

“The excitement is around learning how we harness mRNA technology to develop a COVID-19 vaccine” Caryn Fenner Afrigen’s technical director said. But more important Fenner said “is not only using the mRNA platform for COVID but for beyond COVID.”

Since the FDA approved the Pfizer booster shots for individuals who are ‘high risk’ or over 65 pharmacy managers are preparing themselves to distribute the COVID-19 Moderna booster.

News has been developing quickly when it comes to the COVID-19 booster shots. It can be hard to keep track of all the new information and many individuals have lots of questions. What vaccines have been approved for a booster? What are the eligibility requirements? What locations are providing booster shots?

The FDA also approved the booster mix-and-match approach. This allows those who are vaccinated to receive the second dose of a different COVID-19 vaccine from the first a strategy known as heterologous prime-boost.

“Most People are really excited to get it they are really anxious but they’re doing really well with it” said Lansing CVS pharmacy manager Kim Schieberl. “People are especially excited to get their third dose entering winter months with the Delta Variant.”

A panel of outside advisers to the FDA voted unanimously to recommend a booster shot of the Moderna vaccine to those with underlying health issues.

“We are lucky to be giving the booster shot to those who are immunocompromised” said Schieberl. “But right now that is the only thing that has been approved.”

Much like the Pfizer booster shot which is the only vaccine that has emergency use authorization for a booster shot the Moderna will not be available for everyone right away. The Moderna booster will likely be prioritized for seniors adults with health problems as well as those that live or work in areas that put them at a higher risk.

“People are really anxious waiting for the shot calling every week to see if we have it” said Walgreens pharmacy manager Mckenzie Grulke.

After receiving the Pfizer booster shot Meridian Township resident Dominique Brown hopes to keep his family safe from the coronavirus when he goes home to visit them.

“Someone in my family has cancer so it was important that I get the booster shot to be able to protect them whenever I go home” said Brown.

Many people are trying to get the vaccine due to health-related issues with family vaccine mandates for work or school and some just want everything to go back to normal.

“I would recommend everyone to get vaccinated” said Brown. “It is important to protect those you care about and get back to normal life.”

The JIC also reported three pediatric COVID-19 cases at the Guam Memorial Hospital according to the Joint Information Center’s Saturday report.

On Friday the JIC reported two cases ages 20-months and 17-years old. Officials didn't have the age of the third child on Saturday.

The increase in pediatric cases are part of this current surge that Department of Public Health and Social Services warn Guam is still in the midst of in spite of decreasing cases confirmed daily. Territorial Epidemiologist Dr. Ann Pobutsky said hospital cases and intensive care cases in particular haven’t changed much.

On Saturday there were 54 COVID-19 patients at the two civilian hospitals. And of those patients 14 were in ICU - nine at GMH and five at Guam Regional Medical City the JIC reported.

Individuals who received the first two doses of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines more than six months ago are eligible for a booster shot if they are:

• 65 years old or older.

• 18 years or older with underlying medical conditions.

• 18 years and older with an elevated risk of COVID-19 exposure and transmission due to their occupation including: law enforcement firefighters medics or work in health care education daycare food or agriculture manufacturing postal workers corrections public transit grocery stores or institutional settings.

For individuals who received the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine booster shots are also recommended for those who are 18 and older and who were vaccinated two or more months ago.

DPHSS officials said eligible individuals may choose which vaccine they receive as a booster dose.

Village clinics for the boosters will be available from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on the following dates:

• Oct. 26 to Nov. 16: Dededo Senior Center.

• Oct. 27: Asan Maina Mayor’s Office.

• Nov. 1: Yigo gym.

• Nov. 8 to 10: University of Guam Calvo Field House.

• Nov. 15: Astumbo Senior Center.

• Nov. 18: Tamuning Senior Center.

Residents can make appointments online at tinyurl.com/covidstopswithme or call their mayor.

Pediatric cases

During a media briefing on Thursday Pobutsky noted that recent data gathered shows that COVID-19 cases in children - infants to age 11 - continue to increase.

“All age groups were generally in a downward trend except for the 0-11 age group which now has the highest case rate” according to the report. “Most notably the 12-17 age group has been the least risky recently and this likely correlates with increased vaccination.”

Chima Mbakwem DPHSS chief public health officer said while there have been students who’ve tested positive DPHSS hasn’t seen evidence of clusters at the schools or other indications that COVID-19 is being transmitted at schools.

He did note that DPHSS is working out plans to administer vaccines to children ages 5-11.

The Food and Drug Administration’s advisory council is meeting this week to discuss Pfizer’s application to approve its COVID-19 vaccine to the younger age group. The vaccine currently is being administered to children ages 12 to 17 under an emergency use authorization."

T.J. Lavin has hosted since its 11th season

BMX rider T.J. Lavin began hosting The Challenge in its 11th season The Gauntlet 2 (2008). Before season 11 the show rotated through several hosts.

However after his debut Lavin has continued to return for every season now referred to as the “handler.” Remembered for notably laughing at the players during the challenges and his perpetual hatred for quitters the host has become a staple of the show.

During the Apr. 15 episode of MTV’s Official Challenge Podcast Lavin explained he inadvertently became friends with an MTV production executive who asked him about hosting the show.

After asking late BMX legend Dave Mirra who previously hosted a season for his blessing Lavin took the gig. After nailing his first day on the job the crew offered him the official position and the former BMX rider has held it for over 10 years.

Lavin on his favorite memory while filming ‘The Challenge’

As the host of The Challenge Lavin has downtime when the players aren’t competing in missions. In an exclusive scene he shared that he can connect with the locals by visiting coffee shops and restaurants daily.

The host also opened up about his favorite memory while filming remembering a time in South Africa when he and the crew gave locals car rides.

Although he didn’t name the season Lavin is likely talking about season 32’s Final Reckoning which was filmed in Hermanus. According to the host during these car rides back and forth from Capetown they and the locals listened to Bob Marley which he referred to as “the language of the world.”

Lavin called it the “best experience ever” as they sang the songs “at the top of their lungs” throughout their rides.

He previously competed as a BMX rider

Currently 44-years-old The Challenge host began riding bikes at the age of 2. After racing until around the age of 15 Lavin got into dirt jumping.

Also a talented high school wrestler he chose to fully pursue BMX becoming a professional by 19. From 1995 until 2010 the host performed well in competitions winning the DK Dirt Circuit Gravity Games CFB a Europe competition and was crowned “King of Dirt.”

Lavin also won three bronze medals a silver one and three gold medals while competing in the X Games. Additionally he has received sponsorships from major companies such as Monster Energy Drink and S&M Bikes.

The proposed debt offering by CA Magnum Holdings (CAMH) a special-purpose investment holding firm set up for the deal has been assigned a B1 rating the international rating agency said in a note on Friday. B1 is considered below investment grade rating. The bonds are due in 2026.

Mint first reported on 5 September that Carlyle was in talks with banks to raise $1 billion debt to finance the Hexaware buyout. “The proceeds from the proposed bond will be initially kept in an escrow account and will ultimately be used to fund CAMH’s planned acquisition of a 95.42% stake in Hexaware. Should the proposed acquisition not proceed as planned CAMH will redeem the bonds in full along with any accrued and unpaid interest by largely using the proceeds in the escrow account"" Moody’s said.

CAMH’s rating reflects the credit quality of Hexaware as the software company will be the only source of cash flow to service its debt obligations the rating agency added. “Hexaware’s resilient business profile supported by tailwinds from the pandemic resulting in accelerated digitization of business processes along with its high Ebitda-to-cash-flow conversion and strong liquidity also support CAMH’s rating"" said Sweta Patodia an analyst at Moody’s.

Hexaware serves customers in the digital solutions segment within the software services industry including digital product engineering digital core transformation enterprise and next-generation services cloud transformation and data analytics.

In line with rising demand for such services Moody’s expects that Hexaware’s operating performance will remain strong and that the company’s revenues will grow 14-15% annually over the next 2-3 years the rating agency said.

“However CAMH’s rating also factors in the company’s high starting leverage and dependence on dividends from Hexaware for its debt service requirements"" Patodia said. According to Moody’s CAMH’s consolidated leverage as measured by gross debt/Ebitda will be around 6 times immediately following the transaction in December. This is high for CAMH’s current ratings but Moody’s expects its leverage to decline to around 4.7 times by December 2023 and around 4 times by 2024. Ebitda a measure of a firm’s operating performance stands for earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization.

Moody’s expects Hexaware’s Ebitda to improve to around $233 million by 2023 from around $179 million in 2021. Hexaware reported revenues of around $919 million for the 12 months ended September 2021. The firm also has an opportunity to win new business from Carlyle’s other portfolio companies which collectively spend around $1 billion on IT services each year Moody’s said.

“As of 30 September 2021 Hexaware had cash and cash equivalents of around $189 million compared with a total debt of $23 million. Moody’s expects a steady cash build up on the balance sheet as the company will continue to generate $80-90 million in cash flow each year (after accounting for interest expenses on the bond) while capital spending needs will be minimal and limited to around 2% of revenues"" Moody’s said.

""When I was little I was always that person who excelled in everything that I did"" Irvin 31 tells CNBC Make It. ""In school I had straight A's the entire time I had leadership positions … I kind of was always in this mind trap that I want to get a really high-paying job and kind of follow what my parents did they worked in New York City on Wall Street."" The New Jersey native landed her first internship when she was 16 working for Morgan Stanley. ""I always envisioned I was going to be that Wall Street girl"" she shares. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012 her childhood dream came true: she moved to New York to work as a financial analyst. She quickly realized however that ""there was not much work life-balance at all"" working on Wall Street. ""I started to really crave the life aspect"" she adds. Irvin had always used her limited vacation time for international trips but as she notes ""it's impossible to see the world in two weeks."" For two years she saved about $1000 each month with the intention of taking a one-year career break to travel around the world. ""I knew I would regret it if I didn't do it … I was young single had no kids and wasn't making all that much money which makes it all easier to pack up and go"" she says. ""The longer you wait too the more chances there are for life's obstacles to get in the way."" She officially quit her job in 2015. That one year turned into two then three and now Irvin lives in Rennes France as a full-time travel blogger and digital nomad. Her travel blog ""Kesi To and Fro"" has nearly 15000 followers on Instagram and serves as Irvin's main source of income. She lives with her boyfriend Alex as he completes his master's program at the EIT Digital Master School in Rennes. The pair met in 2018 while working on a boat together in Croatia. She moved to the city in September on a tourist visa that lasts three months but is in the process of applying for a long-term visa.

Turning her hobby into a profitable business

Irvin started her travel blog six years ago for fun to document her trips and pass on recommendations for the countries she visited but decided to monetize her growing platform about two years ago during the start of the coronavirus pandemic. ""After about four years of constant traveling around the world I knew I was missing something to work on like I want to use my brain somehow and challenge myself"" she recalls. ""I made my first investment in the blog which was a $500 blogging course and once I finally invested money in myself that's how I knew I was gonna take blogging seriously."" As a travel blogger Irvin makes money through multiple avenues though brand collaborations where Irvin promotes products companies or other things on her platform have been her focus. Irvin estimates she's paid between $300-$2000 per collaboration and she receives that money via bank transfer or her PayPal business account. Other streams of income include group trips she organizes and hosts; paid travel writing; affiliate marketing and ad revenue from her website. ""I don't make as much money from those last two categories right now but my main mission now is to increase the marketing and ad revenue for my blog"" Irvin notes. Before monetizing her blog Irvin relied on her savings and worked as a seasonal charter host on a boat in Croatia Greece Thailand and other countries to support her travels. Now that Irvin is generating about $1000 per month from her blog she doesn't have to take on any side hustles. ""I'm making a sustainable living from my work and living a comfortable lifestyle in France as a travel blogger"" she says. ""It gives me more confidence to live in other countries as a travel blogger and that this can really be my main career.""

How she spends her money

Rennes is home to several universities and about 60000 students so finding housing at the start of the school year in September was a challenge. Irvin and her boyfriend found a room to rent on Airbnb in an apartment with roommates. She pays about $405 in rent (including utilities) per month. Irvin saves money by limiting how often she goes out to eat (usually once each week) and biking everywhere she can. She spends about $152.25 each week on food (this cost includes groceries and dining out) and makes most of her meals at home. ""I split my groceries with my boyfriend which probably keeps the cost a little lower"" she says. Overall Irvin notes ""living in France is cheaper than living in New York City."" Irvin still uses her U.S. phone number and pays about $55 per month for a Google Fi plan. On travel and entertainment — including parties concerts and nights out at bars — Irvin estimates she spends $323 per month and $150 per month respectively. Right now she does not have insurance but is considering a plan for digital nomads through SafetyWing which costs $40 per month.

Here's a monthly breakdown of Irvin's spending (as of September 2021): Rent and utilities: $405

$405 Food: $609

$609 Phone/WiFi: $55

$55 Health insurance: $40

$40 Recreational travel: $323

Her routine in France

""I'm still learning what a typical day looks like for me because I'm still exploring this new city"" Irvin says. ""One thing I like about Rennes though is it has a smaller city feel so I don't feel overwhelmed."" She continues: ""Usually I'll wake up grab a tea have breakfast in my apartment or find a café then I'll ride my bike to a café and try to do some work on my laptop. In the afternoon hopefully I'm doing work whether that's sending emails to clients creating a pitch deck or working on a group trip I have. There's always a million things I have to do so I've been figuring out what to prioritize for the day.""

Irvin says it's important for her and Alex to share a meal together in the evening so she usually cooks for them and Alex cleans up afterward. ""Then if there's an event going on like a concert or there was recently a free bouldering event I'll sign up because I want to make new friends"" she says. Irvin has faced a couple challenges as she adjusts to living in France namely that she doesn't speak French. ""I studied French for seven years growing up but my French is minimal"" she says. ""I really don't know much which is probably one of the reasons I'm most excited to live here because I am that stereotypical American that only knows English."" Irvin has been using the free version of the Memrise app to learn the language. Learning the cultural customs has been another struggle. ""[I've noticed] French people work on their own hours so stores are only open for a couple hours — they can be open from 11-2 then from 7-10"" she says. ""I'm trying to get used to the time schedule.""

According to a recent prediction by a Morgan Stanley analyst the SpaceX founder is on his way to becoming the world’s first trillionaire with his relentless amassing of wealth.

A Twitter account called UberFacts tweeted this prediction. Amusingly the Tesla CEO replied to the tweet stating that he would be a Dogecoin trillionaire. With that reply he sent the Dogecoin price soaring again.

As of today Musk is already the wealthiest man in the world ahead of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos who is in second place. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index he has an estimated net worth of $252 billion. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world’s richest people.

In July the tech entrepreneur revealed that he owns Bitcoin Dogecoin and Ether.

Musk’s net worth has skyrocketed because of Tesla whose stock price has kept increasing over the months. On Friday the company’s shares rose to a new high above $900/share. With his current net worth he is worth more than the entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of New Zealand.

On Friday Twitter account @UberFacts reported the prediction from Morgan Stanley.

Elon then replied directly to the tweet agreeing that he would be a trillionaire but in Dogecoin.

In July Musk revealed that he owns Bitcoin Ethereum and Dogecoin. However he has always posted memes about Dogecoin in particular and is constantly weighing in on the meme coin.

In May the SpaceX founder announced that in 2022 SpaceX will launch a moon mission funded by Dogecoin. He said this is the first time that cryptocurrency will be used in space and that it will also be the first meme used in space.

SpaceX Founder’s Net Worth Prediction

According to the Guardian analysts at investment bank Morgan Stanley have predicted that Elon Musk will become the first trillionaire in the world.

Forbes says that the tech entrepreneur is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth through electric car maker Tesla and in space via rocket producer SpaceX.

A Morgan Stanley analyst says that he could make much more money from his space exploration business SpaceX than he has made from Tesla.

The analyst Adam Jonas said that SpaceX was “challenging any preconceived notion of what was possible and the timeframe possible in terms of rockets launch vehicles and supporting infrastructure”.

He added: “More than one client has told us if Elon Musk were to become the first trillionaire … it won’t be because of Tesla. Others have said SpaceX may eventually be the most highly valued company in the world – in any industry.”

Jonas estimates that the privately-held SpaceX valued at $100bn this month could be worth $200bn and even more. It is presently the world’s second-biggest privately held company after the internet firm ByteDance. The SpaceX founder owns roughly 48% of the company.

It remains to be seen if these predictions about the Tesla CEO will come to pass.

Several factors appear to be contributing to this belief including rising exports and robust tax collections. The government initiatives such as asset monetisation and the recent privatisation drive raised hopes of disinvestment proceeds picking up steam. While bank credit growth remains a concern the resolving bad loan situation is comforting. While booming corporate profits are welcome private investments are still sore and so is capacity utilisation. Yet some like Morgan Stanley expect that a virtuous cycle is in the offing supported by strong capex. This cycle they believe will be unlike the past decade and more like the one seen during 2003-07 allowing strong growth rates while keeping macro stability risks at bay.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDEyMzE0NS9DaGluYS1naWFudC1TaGVpbnMtdGF4LXJ1c2UtYmlnLXRocmVhdC1Cb29ob28uaHRtbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDEyMzE0NS9hbXAvQ2hpbmEtZ2lhbnQtU2hlaW5zLXRheC1ydXNlLWJpZy10aHJlYXQtQm9vaG9vLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China giant Shein's tax ruse 'big threat to Boohoo',"Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein is exploiting a series of tax perks to undercut some of Britain's most successful online retailers according to a major report seen by The Mail on Sunday.

The mysterious Chinese firm uses its tax advantages to sell products at significantly less than its British competitors and it has become a thorn in the side of Boohoo and Asos – despite operating in Europe for just seven years.

Global sales at Shein are forecast to approach $20billion (£14.6billion) next year which could eclipse some of the world's largest retailers including Zara-owner Inditex and H&M. In the UK market sources estimate Shein's sales are now worth at least £250 million a year and are rising rapidly.

On the up: Made in Chelsea star Georgia Toffolo modelling Shein fashions

A 99-page report by investment bank Morgan Stanley states that tax exemptions alone mean Shein's costs are up to 20 per cent lower than its rivals. It says that allows it to undercut Manchester's low-priced fast fashion retailer Boohoo by 15 per cent and London-based Asos by 35 per cent. Shein's prices are now about half those of discount clothing retailer H&M it added.

Boohoo's group sales in the UK will top £1billion this year – doubling market share on two years ago. But Morgan Stanley has cut profit guidance on Boohoo by 10 per cent for next year and reduced its recommendation for the stock to 'underweight' – meaning investors should cut their holdings. The bank also reduced its profit forecast for Asos in subsequent years but it is not urging investors to sell.

Shein uses its efficient supply chain and customer behaviour data – collecting troves of information from social media and apps while adding thousands of new products to its website daily – to stoke demand. Its web traffic in Britain has doubled this year alone.

But its growing global dominance and secrecy have caught the eye of governments across the world including the UK – where its 'sinister' approach has been criticised by Tom Tugendhat MP chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee – and India where it was among dozens of Chinese apps banned over security concerns last year. In 2018 China waived export taxes for companies shipping direct to shoppers as a result of a trade war with former President Donald Trump. This appears to have added rocket fuel to Shein's already rapid growth ever since.

Shein is free from Chinese VAT and consumer taxes and is subject to lower corporation taxes. These incentives are awarded to it for manufacturing in China and then only selling its goods outside the country. Arriving in the UK by post the parcels are of such low value that they are not subject to import duties as they would be if the goods were delivered to British distribution centres in shipping containers – the method used by other big retailers.

The bank's analysts said the company's 12-15 per cent 'order handling fee' which Shein applies to bigger deliveries to the UK almost exactly mirrors the excise duty. It said that 'shipping to the end user exclusively from China' reaps a 'tax advantage' that has helped to reinforce the momentum driven by its well-honed product development strategy. Shein uses a 'test and reorder' model to fast-track popular outfits has massive ranges and cheap sources of supply. It said suggesting its success relates to tax advantages alone would be a 'misunderstanding' of its model.

Morgan Stanley said Shein's current price advantage 'might not be sustainable should tax policies change' in China Europe or the US.

French bank Credit Suisse said in a recent report that a reaction by Western governments 'to level up the playing field' with restrictions on direct imports of cheap Chinese goods could impede the company's progress.

It said: 'There are practical difficulties in monitoring or halting thousands of small-value packages but we would not exclude governments eventually following the example of India.'

Morgan Stanley said the ease with which Shein has been able to get a foothold in the global fast-fashion market is 'the most extraordinary aspect' of the company's rise.

The bank added: 'Other similar or even more disruptive players could well emerge over the next ten years – further increasing pressure in this market.'"

But because Massachusetts mandates a town vote for system leases going beyond three years body-worn cameras won’t find focus in the town until 2022.

“We anticipated that we would be using them by now” Frederickson said. “But as we entered into the procurement process we found that it was more affordable to engage in a five- to 10-year contract and that requires a vote at town meeting.”

Yarmouth voters approved $50516 at its May 18 town meeting to outfit two full shifts of Yarmouth police officers with body-worn cameras at a time for one year. Another vote is set for Tuesday at special town meeting for the new camera systems program to move forward said Bob Whritenour Yarmouth town administrator.

“The article will allow police technology to be leased for a period of up to 10 years” Whritenour said. “Currently under the state law we are only allowed to finance that type of project for up to three years unless the town adopts a longer standard.”

Frederickson is expecting a favorable outcome at town meeting but said that nothing about the camera systems “will be set in stone” until after the town meeting vote. The unforeseen delay will push paperwork and officer training into the next year he said.

If approved Yarmouth would be the second town police department on the Cape using body-worn cameras. The Mashpee Police Department started its body camera pilot program in December 2020.

Dashboard-mounted cameras which will be linked to body-worn technology will also need to be installed in every Yarmouth police cruiser which pushes the timeline back even further Frederickson said.

“I would love to tell you it will take two weeks but that is not going to be the case” he said. “It could take four months before we have everything installed and running at 100%.”

Pay-as-you-go for Yarmouth police

With the town meeting vote pending Deputy Chief Kevin Lennon is using the extra time to research technological bundles and packages through potential provider WatchGuard Technologies which provides mobile video solutions for law enforcement. The “Body Camera-as-a-Service program” provides a pay-as-you-go option for law enforcement agencies looking to begin an “all-inclusive body-worn program” Lennon said.

“You can buy cameras outright and own them or do a service plan that gives you the camera mounting system and unlimited access to the communications central program with off premises storage” Lennon said. “We are opting for the pay-as-you go service plan.”

Andres Lacambra senior director for Mobile Video and Motorola Solutions said that WatchGuard which was acquired by Motorola Solutions in 2019 offers body-worn camera programs built from an understanding of challenges associated with being a police officer. Because the wireless in-car system is connected to the cameras and the dispatch radio for example wearable cameras begin recording as soon as an officer is dispatched to an incident and the cruiser siren and lights are activated.

“Officers often have to think about a lot of things at the same time whenever they find themselves in front of an incident” he said. “We try to make it as simple as possible so officers have as much time to focus on a mission and not worry about technology. At the same time they can avoid getting into situations where they forget to capture something that is important.”

The off-site computer storage which Lacambra said is a cloud-based system — “kind of like iTunes is for music” — that transfers the video collected or “original evidence” from an officer’s shift to an evidence management system. A record of what happened at any given time is documented: when it was uploaded who has seen it and whetherit’s been edited exported or compromised.

“That solution provides the agency with the means to organize all videos. They have the ability to manage content and classify it based on different types of incidents” Lacambra said. “It also provides tools for officers to redact and share evidence with the judicial system — share it with prosecutors.”

Much of the technology will remain consistent and “pretty straight forward” across police platforms Lacambra said but it’s the actual “procedures and policies” such as privacy warrants and length of data collection that will differ from state to state.

“There are all of the procedures and policy dealing with content that the agency needs to put in place” he said. “That is in each police department’s hands.”

To tackle policies associated with the new technology an internal committee composed of Lennon and six to eight Yarmouth officers convened twice in the last six months to hammer out procedures governing the use of police body-worn cameras including when they must be turned on when video can be viewed and by whom and how long videos are stored in the cloud. By largely modeling Yarmouth policies after Massachusetts State Police guidelines and conferring with the Cape and Islands District Attorney’s Office Lennon said Yarmouth procedures “are 85% done.”

“A lot of the language between policies is extremely similar so we need to tweak certain things to fit Yarmouth based on our chief command staff and the union” Lennon said. “The policy is a work in progress but we should have a final stamp of approval by December.”

Policies will also depend on evolving legislation on body-worn technology as well as the police reform bill signed by Gov. Charlie Baker in December 2020. The state law spurred by the killing of George Floyd in 2020 when he was restrained by Minneapolis police  creates a standardized licensing and training process for police accountability and transparency.

As laws grow and change on evolving law enforcement technology Frederickson said there “will be much more to come.”

“It’s an evolving area” he said. “I think as time goes on there will be more guidelines and policies. Gray areas will become clear one way or another.”

Mashpee police keep the cameras rolling

As Yarmouth police press pause on body-worn cameras until after the town meeting vote wearable camera technology for the Mashpee Police Department’s pilot program will be extended into June 2022 Police Chief Scott Carline said. By lengthening the program he said the state can “further advise on future mandates for body-worn cameras under the new reform law.”

“I’d like to get all the information I can from what the state is looking at before we implement any policies” Carline said. “Regardless we are receiving constant positive feedback from the officers involved and I couldn’t be happier in the direction this program has gone.”

The pilot program which was initially slated to run for one year has “gone so well” Carline said that Mashpee police bought two additional wearable devices bringing the total to five body-worn cameras that are shared by officers.

“For training purposes we monitor the cameras every day and the evidence these bring are extremely eye opening” Carline said. “It’s one thing to read a report and get a picture of what happened versus actually seeing what happened on video. It’s brought a much higher level of professionalism to our overall patrol operations.”

For Frederickson the success that police agencies like Mashpee has enjoyed using wearable technology has further demonstrated that body-worn cameras will help Yarmouth police “build credibility within the community.”

“We want to make sure our community is being protected in a way they think they should be” he said. “Hopefully the evidence will show a tremendous amount of professionalism is taking place. There are many reports that say otherwise but we are confident this will be a positive addition to the department.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20 2021

Brian Withers: Yeah there was a question here from Fool Fan on ""Which is the better buy Accenture or CTSH?"" which is Cognizant. Fool Fan notes that Tom Gardner has CTSH in his personal portfolio. I know at one point Cognizant was a pick for the Everlasting Portfolio and I think they sold out of it. Let me double-check. Stock Advisor. Yeah. The Everlasting Portfolio sold but it's possible. Tom likes to keep one share of stocks [laughs] that he sold just to remind him that he was in that business and he has since moved on and that helps him keep track of it. Do you have an opinion Neil between these Cognizant and Accenture are very much going after the same digital transformation customers and focused on bringing customers to the cloud. Is there one that you see as a better buy right now?

Neil Patel: Not at for any particular reason off the top of my head. I think this is one of those situations where a rising tide lifts all boats thing and there's just such a multi-generational secular shift toward the internet that's just getting bigger every year. Obviously cyber security is a huge threat companies don't know how to deal with it they don't know how to prepare for it and it's something that I think every company in this space is going to benefit from. I see that Cognizant is selling for a much lower or PE if that's something that's a big deal for you. But I think Accenture's quality particularly in the most recent quarter and over the past 12 months given everything that's going on in the world speaks to its quality. I think if you're interested in the space there's nothing wrong with owning both of those names.

The games had record viewership and highlighted the potential success for the league this season.

Here is a look at 7 stocks to watch during the 2021-22 NHL season.

1. Walt Disney: One of the big winners from a strong NHL season could be the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney landed a deal with the NHL to bring games back to ESPN for the first time in 17 years.

Disney is paying a reported $400 million annually to be the lead television partner for the NHL. The seven-year contract sees Disney and Turner Sports an AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) unit splitting the coverage of NHL games that was previously aired with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).

Disney secured the rights to air 103 exclusive NHL games on ESPN ESPN+ ABC and Hulu. The deal also includes over 1000 out of market games to air on ESPN+. Disney will have the rights to the Stanley Cup Finals for four of the seven years including the current season.

Disney reported that it is mostly sold out of advertising slots for the 2021-22 season and could hit $100 million in sales for the season.

“We are very very well sold” Disney advertising sales President Rita Ferro told Front Office Sports. “We have a couple of positions left mostly in the playoffs and finals.”

The opening night doubleheader had average viewership of 884000 viewers during the five plus hours of coverage. The night marked the highest season opener doubleheader on record. The first game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Pittsburgh Penguins was the most viewed opening game on cable of all-time. The later 10:30 p.m. ET game between the Seattle Kraken and Las Vegas Golden Knights was the second most viewed regular season NHL game to begin after 9 p.m. ET in the league's history across cable and broadcast television.

2. AT&T: As mentioned above Turner Sports is the other major television partner for NHL content. Turner is paying a reported $225 million annually on the seven-year deal with the NHL.

The first two NHL games to be shown on Turner’s TNT this season averaged 817000 viewers and 522000 viewers averaging 670000 for the double header. The viewership from the NHL games topped the WNBA Finals a U.S. Men’s Soccer World Cup qualifier and NBA Preseason game on other networks. One of the two games was the most watched NHL game ever to air on the second night of a new NHL season.

3. Madison Square Garden Sports: Publicly traded Madison Square Garden Sports (NYSE:MSGS) is the owner of several sports teams including the NHL’s New York Rangers. The company also owns the NBA’s New York Knicks.

The Rangers are one of the few sports teams that are publicly traded and have a strong NHL season for viewership fan attendance and overall demand could be a catalyst for MSGS shares.

Sportico values the Rangers as the second most valuable NHL franchise at $1.87 billion only trailing the $2 billion Toronto Maple Leafs. The value is split as $1.4 billion for the team and $470 million for the business and real estate division.

Sportico sees the Rangers posting revenue of $243 million in the 2021-22 season an increase from $91 million last season and from the $229 million in 2019-20 which featured a full slate of fan attending games prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. Madison Square Garden Entertainment: The owner of the namesake Madison Square Garden is Madison Square Garden Entertainment (NYSE:MSGE).

The company owns the arena that will enjoy a financial boost from the return of fans for Rangers games. MSGE is also the parent company of MSG Network and MSG+ two media channels that air Rangers games and other sports content.

5. DraftKings: Sports betting company DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) signed on as an official partner of the NHL recently. The deal includes DraftKings being an official partner for sports betting iGaming and daily fantasy sports.

The deal also includes DraftKings being the exclusive integration partner of NHL content on the Turner Sports platforms. DraftKings will create sports betting and daily fantasy content for Turner Sports and Bleacher Report digital and linear media platforms centered on the NHL.

6. Super Group: Sports betting company Super Group which is merging with Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp (NYSE:SEAH) has a multiyear partnership with the NHL. The company’s Betway brand’s first sports league partnership is with the NHL.

The company launched an advertising campaign centered on the partnership during the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs and will likely try to grow brand awareness during the 2021-22 NHL season.

Betway will have a corner-in-ice brand position during the biggest NHL events of the year including the All-Star Game and Winter Classic.

7. Sinclair Broadcast Group: Media company Sinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ:SBGI) acquired the regional sports networks formerly owned by Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) in a purchase deal with Disney. The company has the rights to air many NHL teams locally throughout the country. The company has also explored launching a direct-to-consumer streaming platform.

NHL teams covered by the Sinclair Broadcast properties include the Los Angeles Kings Anaheim Ducks Arizona Coyotes Dallas Stars St. Louis Blues Columbus Blue Jackets Carolina Hurricanes Nashville Predators Tampa Bay Lightning Florida Panthers and Detroit Red Wings.

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20 2021

Brian Withers: This is another one that I'm just super surprised at. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that as the coronavirus abated and people started getting vaccines they're out to Costco and spending more money. I was going to show a couple of slides they have of Costco today presentation that has a couple of interesting little tidbits if you're not super familiar with Costco. Right in the beginning they have a few of the I guess these are the newest Costcos and this is in Japan and I don't know if you noticed there's something a little bit different about this Costco then Demitri sees it. What's different?

Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Unless that's photoshop I see a big parking lot on the roof. [laughs]

Withers: On the roof. Absolutely. It's on the roof and they have the gas station here which is impressive. But I was just like ""Wow look at all [laughs] those cars on the roof."" It looks like it's a double-decker parking lot even on the top. That's pretty interesting. Certainly the parking lot around the edges here smaller. Look at the next one. This is from a place near Nashville. You can see the huge parking lot and there's no parking on the roof. [laughs] Just a couple of more Little Rock Oklahoma Springfield.

Neil Patel: Isn't Japan the country with the third most locations for them?

Withers: It has a warehouse that we'll see in a minute. But I didn't realize.

Patel: They have a lot of stores in the area.

Withers: Yeah. This didn't dawn on me either that they're the third largest global retailer. I think that might be 12th largest retailer in the Fortune 500 I'm not sure. They may even be 12.

Patel: Yeah. It might be 12 overall actually.

Withers: A hundred billion mark.

Kalogeropoulos: It's interesting because I know they were the second largest at least for a while there. I wonder who hedged in there in second place behind Walmart I'd have to check that.

Patel: Amazon maybe.

Withers: I'd wonder if they're counting Amazon as a retailer; 192 billion in sales 288000 employees. Here's the warehouses. They have 30 in Japan. So Canada Mexico. It's likely that these are larger.

Patel: Iceland wow. [laughs]

Withers: Iceland pretty nice. Five hundred and sixty-four warehouses in the US that's impressive. This must be their stores. They call them warehouses right?

Patel: Yeah.

Withers: This number is pretty impressive to this cardholder thing. As you sign up for the executive Demitri you talked a little bit about the executive membership you get I think it's now a Visa it used to be I think a Mastercard. But you get points and you get cashback and stuff and that's a super cool feature. Four billion in membership fee income. You talked about the 91 percent. Really pretty cool. Seems to be just doing well. I know they've worked on their online presence as well and so that's a bigger deal.

Kalogeropoulos: That was something a lot of people were worried about for a while there too. It made sense that the bare idea that Costco's it's pretty a big part of their competitive advantages that they have. They cover wide areas with their stores. They don't have a store within ten-minute drive of everybody. That 564 I think is compared to like a Walmart which might have over 2000 locations in the US. You would think that might limit their ability to do quick drop two-day delivery or within 24 hours like Walmart's doing and what Target's doing. But there's no evidence that Costco is having any trouble with e-commerce compared to Target or any company that has way more stores. It's another wild factor for their logistics team.

Loading...

The list of the world's most valued companies has remained dynamic over the years. Manufacturing companies which once dominated the list are now hardly found giving way to a near clean sweep by software and services companies. Benzinga looked at these changing dynamics by comparing the list of most valued companies in 2001 and two decades later in 2021.

Conglomerate GE Led The Pack In 2001: Conglomerate General Electric Company GE was the most valued company in 2001 and quite rightly so as it was once considered the bellwether of the U.S. economy given the diverse businesses under its fold. The company's reactive approach to emerging opportunities is considered the primary reason among the many factors for its downfall. The company is now no longer part of the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average.

A few technology names pharma major Pfizer Inc. PFE retail giant Walmart Inc. WMT were among the other companies that made the top 10 list in 2001.

A Different Era and Radically Different Companies Dominate In 2021: Tech companies made up a majority of the top 10 companies in 2021. Except for Saudi Aramco and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) all the other companies belonged to the tech sector.

Musk Finds It Interesting: Tesla Inc. TSLA founder and CEO Elon Musk views the changing dynamics as ""interesting."" His reaction came in a reply to a tweet that highlighted the change over the two-decade period.

One of the interesting replies to the original tweet was that if space travel is commercialized Musk's SpaceX will have a decade+ lead over other companies and Tesla will no longer figure in the list.

Today Microworld Infosol is one of the fastest-growing companies in the segment. Vikram Singh Dayma is the Founder and Managing Director at Microworld Infosol Pvt Ltd. He was in conversation with team IT-Voice recently where he answered questions about the technology domain organization and the future ahead. Here is a snippet from the interaction:

Prateek: Tell us about the journey of Microworld Infosol in lats 13 years.

Vikram Dayma: Originally founded in 2008 Microworld Infosol Pvt.Ltd is an IT Infrastructure firm providing a full portfolio of services around System Integration Application & Infrastructure. Our vision is “To become the most preferred partner in the domain of digital transformation.”

Today we offer an integrated portfolio of products solutions and services built around Automation Cloud Cybersecurity & Digital.

Our employees skilled marketing people and engineers have risen to the occasion in providing uninterrupted services to customers which is the core of our vision. In the last few years we have undertaken a number of initiatives and helped customers in their digital transformation.

For the last 2 years we are the top 3 partners of HP across the country including being a No.1 partner in Northern India.

We at Microworld Infosol understand the significance of environmental sustainability. We are working closely with government organizations in the E-Waste management niche. We collect e-waste from pan India collection centers and dispose of it at Faridabad located plant. This is a step up in our portfolio and we are looking forward to expanding the services with new collection centers.

Prateek: Tell us more about the Huion?

Vikram Dayma: We are one of the leading distributors of Huion (Graphic Tablets). HUION is a drawing tablet brand providing drawing tablets light pads and pen displays. The high-end products are suitable for beginners and professionals. The products are compatible with macOS Android and Windows. These could be used to create digital artwork. We have generated a good number of orders for the products during the pandemic supporting the local artists.

Prateek: How has the pandemic altered the demand for IT infrastructure products?

Vikram Dayma: Last year and a half were marked with the pandemic and lockdowns. No business was left unaffected. But the IT sector was the quickest to recover and rebound. Companies quickly realized the significance of remote working which was normal prior to the pandemic in many organizations. This created a huge demand for IT infrastructure across the country. Everyone started to work from home and even the education was confined to the mobile and desktop screens. But it was a challenge to cater to the needs during the lockdown. Our team of professionals worked day and night to provide support to the organizations with adoption to the cloud hardware server extensions cybersecurity bandwidth optimization DLP and much more.

Prateek: What trends will dominate the Indian IT sector in the coming years?

Vikram Dayma: The country is going through a transition phase. Although the digitalization process was in steady motion prior to the pandemic in private and public sector enterprises and businesses now no business wants to be left behind in the process. Center and state governments have also adopted e-governance models to reach the maximum number of people.

This process will be dominated by cloud computing in the coming years with a fair share of Artificial Intelligence and IoT. I hope that the due resources are invested in the cybersecurity segment as well as the insecure ERPs and servers could result in cyberattacks and losses.

Prateek: Indian companies have started to focus on cyber security threats. What services does Microworld Infosol offer in the segment?

Vikram Dayma: The pandemic has fastened the pace of digitalization in India. SMEs SMBs and startups are adopting cloud platforms and eCommerce platforms to reach out to their customers. Internet users and digital payments have also reached new heights. But with the increased pace of digitalization a rise in cyber-attacks has also been noticed. Many startups and tech companies were victims of cyberattacks in the last months.

We are offering cybersecurity products for enterprise and entry-level users. Startups and tech companies can avail our essential products to safeguard themselves from any cyberattacks. Our diverse portfolio includes antivirus critical infrastructure security network security cloud security & Application Security.

Prateek: What will be the company’s policies in the coming year for expansion and penetrating deeper into the diverse Indian market?

Vikram Dayma: Past years have been instrumental for the organization in terms of learning and expansion. Currently we are the no.1 partner in the North region & Our roadmap is to expand our business in other metro cities like Mumbai & Bangalore as they are the major center for IT industries. We are committed to delivering top-notch products to our customers. Additionally we would be launching the latest technology products with the association of dealer channel partners in regions where we have a lesser presence. Hiring experienced professionals and training the existing ones will also be a part of our expansion strategies.

I examine my List peruse the various rows vertically and horizontally and tab through the Movies and TV shows section. After what seems like hours (or maybe decades) later I still can't frackin' pick a title. And I write a weekly ""what to watch this weekend"" guide! This should be easy for me!

To cure the indecision blues of people like me Netflix rolled out Play Something earlier this year. It's a sort of shuffle function that literally does what its name says — it plays something! Not completely randomly but based on the tastes and preferences expressed by your past viewing history. But you don't have to choose; the algorithm does it for you.

I was pretty skeptical of it when it launched. Plus it wasn't (and still isn't) available on Netflix's Apple TV app so I forgot about it. But while I was testing the Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus I noticed the Play Something option and decided to give it a shot. The results weren't at all what I imagined.

Netflix is massive and needs better discovery

My initial expectation of Play Something was that it would serve as a kind of discovery mode — like Netflix's version of my article on shows and movies to watch after Squid Game. Like ""Hey we know you like this thing so here's this other thing you've never seen that's similar.""

(Image credit: Netflix)

The fact is Netflix has so ... much ... stuff. The size of its library is unfathomable. I've had friends talk excitedly about a Netflix show that I've never even heard of — and that's literally my job. Still the sheer breadth and depth of the programming makes discovery extremely difficult on your own. The themed rows on my Netflix home screen aren't particularly helpful. ""Futuristic Sci-Fi"" sure. ""Because you watch [insert title]"" understandable. But ""Exciting TV Shows"" seems overly broad. And ""Mood Boosters?"" Whatever.

Those rows can actually make my indecision worse. I start internally arguing about whether Start Up can truly be considered a ""Familiar TV Favorite"" or puzzling over why Criminal Minds is in the ""Award-Winning TV Shows"" category.

Even when I do find something that looks interesting I don't start playing it immediately. I add it to My List or make a mental note then keep scrolling in case I find something even better to watch among the zillions of other programs. It's a classic case of choice paralysis — which is where Play Something should step in.

Netflix's algorithm has its limits

One evening I fired up Netflix and selected the Play Something option. It took 15 skips to discover a title that was new to me. I either had already watched something was in the middle of watching it or I wasn't interested.

Here are the 15 Play Something offerings I got:

Grey’s Anatomy (previously watched elsewhere) You (currently watching) Great British Baking Show (currently watching) Sex Education (currently watching) Schitt’s Creek (previously watched elsewhere) Shameless (previously watched elsewhere) Seinfeld (previously watched elsewhere) Lucifer (not interested) The Blacklist (not interested) Midnight Mass (not interested) My Unorthodox Life (watched on Netflix) Money Heist (currently watching) Chicago Med (not interested) Love on the Spectrum (currently watching) On the Verge (new to me!)

None of these suggestions are egregiously out of step with my preferences. As you can see the majority of them are shows I've watched or am in the middle of watching. To be fair Netflix explains that Play Something will deliver: a brand new series or film a series or film you’re already watching a series or film on your list or an unfinished series or film you may want to revisit.

I suppose I also can't really fault Netflix for not realizing if I've watched shows elsewhere on broadcast cable or another streaming service (though an I've Watched This Already"" button would be neat). For instance while I viewed the first five seasons of Schitt's Creek on Netflix I tuned into Pop TV for the final installment. I was one of millions of people who saw Seinfeld during its first run on NBC. I do have plans to rewatch it on Netflix at some point so it's an understandable suggestion.

(Image credit: Pop TV)

In general though my Play Something results indicate that it's less of a discovery tool and more of a reminder to catch up on shows I've fallen behind on. Yeah yeah I know there's new episodes of Sex Education and Money Heist — I'll get to them uh soon! Promise! But Netflix already has a feature that reminds you to get back to watching a show you started. It's called ""Continue Watching"" (and I hate it).

Only the fifteenth offering On the Verge was new to me (I had heard about Julie Delpy's series but it had escaped my mind). One out of 15 isn't a great track record though if you want to use Play Something to find gems you don't already know about. It takes time to process what title is playing hit next see the new program queue up and so on. At that point it's taking nearly as much time as scrolling.

Speaking of time saving for people with less than stellar internet Netflix is getting an upgrade that will make it easier to stream videos on a slow connection.

I didn't expect Play Something to be perfect and find exactly what would suit my mood in a particular moment within one or two recommendations. But I had hoped it might at least somewhat relieve my decision paralysis. Instead it's added a different kind of anxiety to the Netflix experience. Maybe if I was the type of person to wake up and choose chaos Play Something would be perfect.

What started as a controversy over transphobic material in Dave Chappelle’s new special has grown into a full-blown crisis culminating in a walkout by the company’s trans employees on Wednesday. It isn’t surprising to find a corporation putting profits ahead of a potential threat to a marginalized group’s safety; even in his initial email assuring Netflix’s employees that he took their concerns seriously Sarandos couldn’t help bragging about The Closer’s “stickiness.” What is surprising is how long Netflix managed to convince both its users and its workers that they weren’t like anybody else.

Like most upstart studios Netflix made inroads by targeting soft spots in the marketplace areas where Hollywood’s institutional culture was falling short. Although Netflix’s flagship production was the pricey prestigious House of Cards its defining hit was Orange Is the New Black a series that used its pretty white protagonist as an on-ramp to the stories of incarcerated Black and Latina women—and most groundbreaking of all Laverne Cox’s Sophia a role which led to her being the first openly transgender person on the cover of Time. In the years that followed Orange’s 2013 debut Netflix built on the image of itself as a place for diverse talent both behind and in front of the camera. The company put its money where its mouth is too financing projects like Bridgerton The Chair and Ava DuVernay’s forthcoming miniseries about Colin Kaepernick to name just a recent few. But they also put money where their mouth wasn’t spending eight- and nine-figure sums on action movies by Michael Bay and Zack Snyder going head-to-head with Hollywood rather than complementing it. As studios like Disney and Warner Bros. launched their own streaming services they were more inclined to keep their blockbusters to themselves so Netflix started making their own.

Netflix which plans to spend $17 billion on content in 2021 alone doesn’t just want to be the place where you get the perspectives you can’t find anywhere else. They want to be the Everything Store the go-to place for red America and blue America not to mention Africa and Latin America and South Korea. And that inevitably means that some of its representational milestones—shows like Sense8 and GLOW and One Day at a Time—have been cut down in their prime. (As New York Times television critic James Poniewozik wrote in a column after that last series was canceled “Netflix isn’t your buddy.”)

Netflix being Netflix there’s always something else to watch. And in addition to its vaunted algorithm the service has built up a network of social media-channels with names like @StrongBlackLead and @ConTodoNetflix along with the LGBTQ handle @Most to help viewers find a place to see their own experience reflected back at them. Those accounts don’t just promote Netflix’s diverse portfolio of content. They embody it writing from a first-person perspective that makes it feel like it’s coming from a well-informed friend rather than a corporate behemoth. I know of several journalists who went from covering culture to working on Netflix’s socials.

That personalization is a double-edged sword. Netflix has been tremendously effective at getting users to view their attachment to the service as part of their identity and to respond to criticism of Netflix as if they’re being personally attacked. But it also means that they expect more from Netflix including that it stands for something in a way no company of its size really can. No one expects ideological coherence from HBO so it doesn’t feel like a contradiction let alone a betrayal to air I May Destroy You one night and Bill Maher the next. (There was a small bump in the road when HBO Max launched and included Gone With the Wind among its slate of classic Warner Bros. movies but the service added an introduction providing historical context and discussing the film’s racist depictions of the pre-Civil War South and the furor died down.) But at least some of Netflix’s trans employees believed that the company cared more about them than the pursuit of profit. On the same day that The Closer debuted Terra Field whose viral tweets sparked the protests of the special tweeted about how Sarandos had made Netflix “a great place for trans people to work.” As she admitted in a post this week “That aged like milk.”

After more than a solid week of criticism Sarandos altered his messaging stressing the company’s commitment to developing content by and featuring trans and nonbinary people. But the shine may be permanently gone along with the sense that Netflix ever deserved it in the first place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL3BhbGVzdGluaWFuLXN0b3JpZXMtYS1yZWFzb24tdG8tYm95Y290dC1uZXRmbGl4LW9waW5pb24tNjgyODkw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Palestinian Stories': A reason to boycott Netflix? - opinion,"When Netflix announced its group of films called Palestinian Stories they invited subscribers to “discover all the greatness of Palestinian cinema with this heartfelt humorous and captivating collection that features award-winning films and filmmakers.”

I had already seen one of the films included in the collection: The Present. Filled with lies it was clearly just a vehicle for anti-Israel propaganda and I critiqued the film in depth. Therefore I turned to Facebook friends seeking alternatives to Netflix. They provided a variety of suggestions.

Yet I still am resistant to switch. For one reason only. Netflix brings movies from around the world made by them and from within their own cultural and societal realities not movies made about them by others as we might find in Hollywood. American movies with Asian themes for instance are always in relation to the United States – either Asian immigrants and their experiences in America or Americans and their experiences in Asia.

On Netflix we find movies that are like opening a window into their own societies as told by them for themselves. I am enjoying films from Lebanon (and there is no anti-Israeli tone in them even when dealing with war such as Under the Bombs) from Korea (I love their detective films) a legal series from Abu Dhabi and more. And herein lies the big difference between films from other countries and this set of films from the Palestinian Authority.

It is as if nothing else concerns the PA population other than “the occupation.” Every problem they have is seen through the lens of “the occupation.” The brief descriptions of these films show this. For example for Salt of this Sea:

“A Palestinian American woman travels to her homeland to retrieve her grandfather’s savings which had been frozen since his exile during the Nakba.”

The word “Nakba” is a loaded term referring to the displacement of about 700000 Arabs from the State of Israel during the War of Independence. Of course that was a catastrophe for those involved but the term is one that seeks to delegitimize Israel. The displacement and murder of millions of Syrians is also a catastrophe but the word Nakba is not used to refer to this ongoing tragedy for example. Is Netflix going to make a series titled “Syrian Stories”?

Not likely. A still from ''Omar'' by Hany Abu-Assad one of the movies in the new Netflix collection. (credit: Courtesy)

Looking over its selection of films we find that the series mostly deals with issues of detention and imprisonment in Israel the checkpoints and examining the effects of exile loss and trauma. As if writing about the lives of individuals and families that are unrelated to “the occupation” is impossible. As if “the occupation” is the cause of all evils in the Palestinian Authority. In fact this mirrors academic articles that examine a whole myriad of problems faced by those living under the PA whereby heart attacks and other medical problems are caused by “the occupation” university studies are hindered by “the occupation” and more.

It is natural that films made in the PA will deal with themes of war checkpoints displacement and trauma. But when the overwhelming bulk of their films do this we cannot help but come to the conclusion that the only thing filmmakers in the PA consider film-worthy are these topics.

An interesting exception I thought is the 14-minute film Ave Maria and I anticipated being able to write that this one indeed was different. It is about what happens when a car carrying a Jewish couple living in Judea and Samaria and the husband’s mother get into an accident at the entrance to a convent housing five nuns who are under an oath of silence. Labeled a comedy this film could have gone in any number of directions but what it is in fact is a platform for demonstrating the ugly Jewish settler.

All the actors are Israeli-Arabs except for two Jewish women who play Jews yet they categorize this as a “Palestinian” film. One of the stars avoids referring to herself as Israeli by calling herself a Jerusalemite. Aside from showing how despicable the Jews are it also demonstrates no understanding of Shabbat something Arabs having grown up in Israel should not get so wrong. It was painful to watch.

May Odeh director of The Crossing is quoted on the Netflix website as exclaiming that “we all in the Palestinian film industry have been eager to share our narrative with the world through our authentic creative productions as an alternative to news reporting.”

And there we have it! They are not interested in making films that simply dramatize various aspects of their lives but rather that continue to convince the world of the validity of their “narrative.”

All art is produced by people who have biases – and we all have biases – but these “Palestinian Stories” take the bias further and anticipate that the naïve viewer will accept these fictions as an alternative to news reporting or let me add as a booster shot to biased anti-Israeli news reporting rampant in the media.

Do I have to miss all the other international offerings on Netflix that I appreciate in order to protest the use of its platform for demonizing my country?

For the first time at the trial in San Jose Calif. here was Holmes not being described by others as she has been for six weeks.

Instead jurors heard the young entrepreneur in her own voice saying all the things an investor would want to hear — touting her company’s extraordinary leaps of technological innovation a rocketing stock price and a closing window of investment opportunity that would naturally produce a sense of urgency to jump in.

The recording was preserved by an executive of a Dallas-based Hall Group who had overseen an early $2 million investment in Theranos — and who testified Friday in a slow folksy Texas accent that he approved investing another $5 million because Holmes was so persuasive on the call.

“There was a limited amount of time to react and make an investment decision” Bryan Tolbert a vice president of Hall Group told jurors. Hall Group is developer Craig Hall’s real estate company.

Tolbert’s recording is a “jackpot” for prosecutors and “some of the most damaging evidence a prosecutor can present” said Barbara McQuade a former U.S. attorney who teaches at the University of Michigan Law School. Jurors get to “hear the defendant’s own words” she said allowing them “to assess for themselves whether she had an intent to defraud the investors.”

Tolbert was a small player compared with the family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Walmart heiress Alice Walton or News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch who took a $125 million stake in Theranos.

Seven years after his initial investment in 2006 Tolbert decided to tape record a conference call Holmes held to pitch investors for another funding round that would close by the end of 2013. Long stretches of the recording were played for jurors Friday.

Holmes can be heard confidently describing the superiority of Theranos’s blood testing compared with traditional methods the ongoing work the company was doing for pharmaceutical companies how its proprietary technology was being adopted by the U.S. military and most importantly its rollout just months earlier in Walgreens stores.

Perhaps most enticing to those on the call Holmes described how Theranos’s share price had gone from 82 cents in a funding round years earlier to $75 in the 2013 stock offering.

In Walgreens Theranos was creating “a national footprint as fast as we can” Holmes told investors. “We are already creating significant value and of course we’re just getting started” she said. Tolbert and others on the call heard from Holmes how the company’s value had increased from $20 million in 2006 to $7 billion by 2013 based on the value of privately held shares.

Investors were wiped out when Theranos collapsed after a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal and regulatory investigations revealed serious failings in Theranos machines and inaccuracies in test results.

Holmes’s lawyers have not indicated whether she will take the stand during the trial which is expected to run into December. She faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted of charges that she deceived investors and patients.

Tolbert’s recording allowed Holmes’s jury to hear the former CEO make claims about her company’s technology that former Theranos employees and a board member have testified were untrue.

For the government to make the argument that Holmes lied to raise more than $700 million a cooperative witness with little baggage is preferable to a billionaire media mogul or family scion said Andrey Spektor a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner in New York.

“Those factors outweigh how famous they are or how much money they’ve lost” Spektor said. “Jurors may feel less swayed by testimony of a rich person who they believe should have known better or has not suffered all that much.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9taXNzaW9uLXplcm8tcHV0dGluZy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtb24tYS1wYXRoLXRvLWEtbmV0LXplcm8tZnV0dXJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvODNmNTIxYmZkOWQ1OTJhYjZkZWZkYWI3ZDNiODFjZTjSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvbWlzc2lvbi16ZXJvLXB1dHRpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLW9uLWEtcGF0aC10by1hLW5ldC16ZXJvLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzgzZjUyMWJmZDlkNTkyYWI2ZGVmZGFiN2QzYjgxY2U4P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mission Zero: Getting Australia to a net zero future,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/environment/mission-zero-putting-australia-on-a-path-to-a-net-zero-future/news-story/83f521bfd9d592ab6defdab7d3b81ce8 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9taXNzaW9uLXplcm8tcHV0dGluZy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtb24tYS1wYXRoLXRvLWEtbmV0LXplcm8tZnV0dXJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvODNmNTIxYmZkOWQ1OTJhYjZkZWZkYWI3ZDNiODFjZTjSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvbWlzc2lvbi16ZXJvLXB1dHRpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLW9uLWEtcGF0aC10by1hLW5ldC16ZXJvLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzgzZjUyMWJmZDlkNTkyYWI2ZGVmZGFiN2QzYjgxY2U4P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5udG5ld3MuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvbm9ydGhlcm4tdGVycml0b3J5L2Nob2tpbmctZGVhdGgtYW5kLW1hZ2dvdGluZmVzdGVkLWJlZC1zb3Jlcy1pbi1udC1udXJzaW5nLWhvbWUtaG9ycm9yL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMjJjZDVjYTI0YmNmOWU5YWI0YzMwMjU5NTA4YjJhNDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regis Tiwi Gardens fails aged care audit in NT: Choking death maggots on residents,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/choking-death-and-maggotinfested-bed-sores-in-nt-nursing-home-horror/news-story/22cd5ca24bcf9e9ab4c30259508b2a45 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5udG5ld3MuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvbm9ydGhlcm4tdGVycml0b3J5L2Nob2tpbmctZGVhdGgtYW5kLW1hZ2dvdGluZmVzdGVkLWJlZC1zb3Jlcy1pbi1udC1udXJzaW5nLWhvbWUtaG9ycm9yL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMjJjZDVjYTI0YmNmOWU5YWI0YzMwMjU5NTA4YjJhNDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5c2lha2luaS5jb20vY29sdW1ucy81OTY1MTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COMMENT | The business of the media industry - can it survive?,"COMMENT | The Malay Mail ceased publishing its print paper in 2018 completing a 122-year run. The Tamil Nesan shut down in 2019 five years shy of its centennial. Chinese daily Oriental Daily is the most recent casualty shutting down in 2021.

They are not alone. A US study found that 1800 newspapers have shut. In mid-2020 News Corp announced over 100 papers would stop printing in Australia.

The papers that remain alive have shriveled down both in terms of circulation and revenue. The Audit Bureau of Circulation which measured distribution in Malaysia shut down in 2019 so it's hard to measure the decline.

Industry sources put it at well under a million papers sold daily across the country only about 20 percent of its peak of 4.7 million copies in 2007.

The number could be even lower during periods when readers were under pandemic-related lockdowns.

Is digital doing better?

One would think with the audience going digital media would make back online whatever they lose in print. This would also seem to be the case with many players entering the market. Why would they do so unless it was profitable?

The internet especially the growth of smartphones in the last decade has brought news instantly to the fingertips of over 90 percent of the adult population. The top news sites would typically reach over a million users per day.

In print a circulation of 100000 copies can generate RM1 million to RM3 million in advertising revenue per day or about RM10 to RM30 per reader.

Comparatively online advertising earnings can range between one to three sen per user generating between RM10000 to RM30000 in ad revenue per day nearly 1000 times lower than in print.

Why is this the case? Tech giants - particularly Google and Facebook - are able to offer advertising at dramatically lower rates as they access billions of users globally.

Advertisers are able to spend less and reach more customers using their giant platforms as opposed to purchasing more expensive advertising directly from media companies.

The drain on the media is not only due to the intense competition from the tech giants. The internet has allowed other forms of competition too.

Piracy has become a major issue. Paid TV providers such as Astro have been hit by streaming boxes that are able to offer the same paid channels for free through a one-time purchase or through a monthly subscription at a much lower price.

Astro is able to hang on to the older less tech-savvy audience but has found it challenging to pick up newer audiences.

Piracy is also a major issue for news sites - their original content is often copied and re-published on anonymous websites which earn revenue by working with advertisers.

This form of piracy is a copyright offence and reduces advertising revenue for copyright holders. However there has been little action by the authorities to curb this form of theft.

The media market is also now global. Audiences in Malaysia can access many media sites on many platforms both for entertainment such as Youtube Netflix and Disney+ for news or hobby sites. Malaysians are no longer confined to Malaysian-based media.

The internet also offers a lower barrier to entry. Anybody can set up a content site overnight ranging from serious publishers to bloggers and influencers.

Brands too are no longer reliant on the media to convey their message. From billboards to email campaigns and social media pages brands now invest heavily in building a direct relationship with their existing and potential customers without relying on digital and traditional publishers.

So why isn’t there much effort to rescue the industry? There is little pressure coming from the customer or the audience. In fact from the connected audience's perspective it is a golden age of information.

They have access to more media choices than ever before. Media is now more engaging faster and cheaper than ever before. The bad for the industry is a boon for the consumer.

In reaction to this disruption print and broadcast media have had to downsize dramatically. Retrenchments closing down of newspapers reduction in hiring have all taken place.

How do we rescue the industry?



There are a few schools of thought and approaches. One approach has been to get those who have benefited from the digital disruption to contribute back to the industry.

For example in early 2021 the global media industry watched as Australian media lobbied and got the government to pass a law (officially called News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) that forced the tech big boys Google and Facebook to negotiate a revenue-sharing deal with the media.

The law strengthened the position of Australian media to demand a higher share of advertising revenue.

However it remains unclear how much the media have benefitted and whether such benefits will be enjoyed by the local and smaller players as well.

Elsewhere there are also reports that Google has agreed to pay French publishers for news.

This approach also has some support in Malaysia. Sinar Harian acting head of product development & data management Ahmad Nazri Mohd Noor said “News portals are the opposite of the false news.

""(News portals) are reliable and authoritative. Therefore social media platforms should pay for the content that the media produces every day.”

Sinar Harian acting head of product development & data management Ahmad Nazri Mohd Noor

He warned that relying on digital advertising and subscriptions alone may not be enough to cover costs and called on the media industry to work together to pressure the government to act.

“The Malaysian government needs to facilitate cooperation between social media platforms and news portals to facilitate some revenue sharing from the social media platforms to the news portals"" he added.

Other approaches called for the media to be more nimble and adapt to changes quickly.

“The reality is print audiences have declined and fragmented with more going for audio and video hence the proliferation of distribution channels or non-news platforms” said The Malaysian Insight editor and CEO Jahabar Sadiq.

“Our choice is simple we follow and build the audience in those channels - more video audio and to a certain extent long-form journalism - that can be sponsored or have paid content and subscribed to.”

He argued that breaking and topical news have to be sacrificed in order to attract a discerning audience that is willing to pay for quality news content.

“In the Malaysian context that will mean language and demographic differentiation to widen revenue streams.”

He said one way to reduce costs is for the industry to agree to “a common payment gateway wallet infrastructure for all subscribers to access... then we make it simpler cheaper and better for all of us to do business.”

“What should make us different is our approach to journalism therefore giving a choice of news and content rather than having too many platforms and payment options” he stressed.

TheVibes.com editor-in-chief Terence Fernandez also called for innovation but more in terms of the advertising model.

""Advertising budgets in many companies have now shifted from marketing to communications. With this in mind the media needs to consider venturing into the realm of reputation management communications advisory and training.



Editor-in-Chief of TheVibes.com Terence Fernandez

""At first glance it is a fine line to thread as this will question impartiality and independence of the press. However it is no different from the current challenges of having clients who pay for ad space.

""Ethics vs revenue dilemmas will always be there but in my experience maintaining editorial integrity is a selling point. Bona fide brands will want to be associated with organisations that command the public trust.

""Just think how many times have we as individual newspersons been approached by politicians CEOs PR practitioners etc for free advice?"" said Terence suggesting that this relationship can be monetised.

Ms Walsh has been directing American film and television shows from Brisbane for close to 20 years.

She’s currently the additional assistant director on the American documentary series Joe Exotic which is filming in Brisbane telling the story of the controversial American zookeeper nicknamed “Tiger King” who is now in jail for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot.

“Because the director can’t talk to the extras I give all the extras their first position a queue and an action” Ms Walsh said. “It’s something I’ve been doing for 20 years.

Her partner fellow filmmaker Paul Butler has just premiered a documentary he worked on with Oscar nominated director Judith Ehrlich as part of the Brisbane International Film Festival called The Boys Who Said No.

But filmmaking is only part of Ms Walsh’s career portfolio.

‘You that TV guy?” Bill McDonald turning heads with latest gig

She is also the interior designer behind Fortitude Valley’s new Greaser Bar the owner of Brisbane’s largest antique centre the Camp Hill Antique Centre and TART Cafe and the mother of three children under 10.

With so much going on it’s no wonder the portrait of her entered in the Brisbane Portrait Prize by local artist Marisa Veerman last year is a blur of motion.

But 20 minutes before a crowd of strangers arrive to inspect her East Brisbane home which is going to auction next month she sits cross-legged on her couch with The Righteous Brothers playing on an old valve radio that takes 30 seconds to warm up.

“You think it’s not working and then all of a sudden …” she said.

Making things work in a different setting is something Ms Walsh is particularly good at doing.

She once came home with the diner from the Australian TV series H2O: Just Add Water that she was working on.

“The whole diner’ she said. “We had it before we renovated and we actually did put the booth up inside the house.”

Then there was the kitchen from the hit US series Monarch Cove which starred a bevy of Brisbane actors including Andrew Buchanan and James Stewart.

“I’ve never used this place as a film location but a lot of items are props and have been used as props from shows I’ve worked on.”

In renovating the now four-bedroom family home she shares with filmmaker Paul Butler and their three children Elvis Hemingway and Sinatra she has gone one step further using professional skill sets in different ways to achieve a home that is a blend of vintage charm and modern family function.

“The spiral staircase is out of a church and we got a guy who builds roll cages for cars to do the balustrading” she said.

“He built the big steel frames and then soldered these (circles) on individually. He probably regretted the job at that point but it is one of my favourite features.”

Glass concertina doors from the old Burleigh Pub on the Gold Coast also feature in the extension to the house which has added bedrooms an attic downstairs living and kitchen areas and outdoor entertaining zones around an in-ground pool.

“I’ve incorporated the old with the new so that it flows really well and you don’t realise you’re in the old part or the new part of the house” she said.

It starts raining as she speaks and the concertina doors are open on two sides of the downstairs family room in preparation for the twilight open home but there’s no need to close anything because surrounding covered decks protect the home.

The original two-bedroom cottage has been restored and has a central foyer accessed from the side of the house with a flight of six stairs leading up to front office with a skylight and red and yellow stained glass windows that can be seen from street level.

The lounge to the right of the foyer has now become a dedicated library with a fireplace.

From the library a hallway leads past two bedrooms which are connected by a creative folding wall into the main living areas.

The spiral staircase leads to the master suite with its own private deck and an attic for extra storage.

“Basically I’ve had three children and each child came with its own renovation” she said.

“Elvis our first child came with the pool and the extension to the house nine years ago. Hemingway our second child came with our office and our third child Sinatra came with the new bathroom and new bedrooms for the children. That was four years ago.”

A European-style laundry was also a feature of the most recent renovations hidden behind a custom-built wall in the main bathroom.

Ms Walsh is now working on the US documentary Joe Exotic which is filming in Brisbane while she looks for a new home for her growing family and continues her other job as the owner of the Camp Hill Antique Centre and TARTS cafe while Paul Butler’s Vietnam War documentary The Boys Who Said No made its Queensland debut at the Brisbane International Film Festival on Saturday and is awaiting a cinematic release.

“Because of the shop I can’t do the directing full time any more and I have three little kids but this is an exciting time for Brisbane” she said.

“When Brisbane gets locked down during Covid we can keep filming and every other place in the world it’s different. We are safer here than anywhere really.

For the first time at the trial in San Jose Calif. here was Holmes not being described by others as she has been for six weeks.

Instead jurors heard the young entrepreneur in her own voice saying all the things an investor would want to hear — touting her company’s extraordinary leaps of technological innovation a rocketing stock price and a closing window of investment opportunity that would naturally produce a sense of urgency to jump in.

The recording was preserved by an executive of a Dallas-based Hall Group who had overseen an early $2 million investment in Theranos — and who testified Friday in a slow folksy Texas accent that he approved investing another $5 million because Holmes was so persuasive on the call.

“There was a limited amount of time to react and make an investment decision” Bryan Tolbert a vice president of Hall Group told jurors. Hall Group is developer Craig Hall’s real estate company.

Tolbert’s recording is a “jackpot” for prosecutors and “some of the most damaging evidence a prosecutor can present” said Barbara McQuade a former U.S. attorney who teaches at the University of Michigan Law School. Jurors get to “hear the defendant’s own words” she said allowing them “to assess for themselves whether she had an intent to defraud the investors.”

Tolbert was a small player compared with the family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Walmart heiress Alice Walton or News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch who took a $125 million stake in Theranos.

Seven years after his initial investment in 2006 Tolbert decided to tape record a conference call Holmes held to pitch investors for another funding round that would close by the end of 2013. Long stretches of the recording were played for jurors Friday.

Holmes can be heard confidently describing the superiority of Theranos’s blood testing compared with traditional methods the ongoing work the company was doing for pharmaceutical companies how its proprietary technology was being adopted by the U.S. military and most importantly its rollout just months earlier in Walgreens stores.

Perhaps most enticing to those on the call Holmes described how Theranos’s share price had gone from 82 cents in a funding round years earlier to $75 in the 2013 stock offering.

In Walgreens Theranos was creating “a national footprint as fast as we can” Holmes told investors. “We are already creating significant value and of course we’re just getting started” she said. Tolbert and others on the call heard from Holmes how the company’s value had increased from $20 million in 2006 to $7 billion by 2013 based on the value of privately held shares.

Investors were wiped out when Theranos collapsed after a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal and regulatory investigations revealed serious failings in Theranos machines and inaccuracies in test results.

Holmes’s lawyers have not indicated whether she will take the stand during the trial which is expected to run into December. She faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted of charges that she deceived investors and patients.

Tolbert’s recording allowed Holmes’s jury to hear the former CEO make claims about her company’s technology that former Theranos employees and a board member have testified were untrue.

For the government to make the argument that Holmes lied to raise more than $700 million a cooperative witness with little baggage is preferable to a billionaire media mogul or family scion said Andrey Spektor a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner in New York.

“Those factors outweigh how famous they are or how much money they’ve lost” Spektor said. “Jurors may feel less swayed by testimony of a rich person who they believe should have known better or has not suffered all that much.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9taXNzaW9uLXplcm8tcHV0dGluZy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtb24tYS1wYXRoLXRvLWEtbmV0LXplcm8tZnV0dXJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvODNmNTIxYmZkOWQ1OTJhYjZkZWZkYWI3ZDNiODFjZTjSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvbWlzc2lvbi16ZXJvLXB1dHRpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLW9uLWEtcGF0aC10by1hLW5ldC16ZXJvLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzgzZjUyMWJmZDlkNTkyYWI2ZGVmZGFiN2QzYjgxY2U4P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mission Zero: Getting Australia to a net zero future,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/environment/mission-zero-putting-australia-on-a-path-to-a-net-zero-future/news-story/83f521bfd9d592ab6defdab7d3b81ce8 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9taXNzaW9uLXplcm8tcHV0dGluZy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtb24tYS1wYXRoLXRvLWEtbmV0LXplcm8tZnV0dXJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvODNmNTIxYmZkOWQ1OTJhYjZkZWZkYWI3ZDNiODFjZTjSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvbWlzc2lvbi16ZXJvLXB1dHRpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLW9uLWEtcGF0aC10by1hLW5ldC16ZXJvLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzgzZjUyMWJmZDlkNTkyYWI2ZGVmZGFiN2QzYjgxY2U4P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5udG5ld3MuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvbm9ydGhlcm4tdGVycml0b3J5L2Nob2tpbmctZGVhdGgtYW5kLW1hZ2dvdGluZmVzdGVkLWJlZC1zb3Jlcy1pbi1udC1udXJzaW5nLWhvbWUtaG9ycm9yL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMjJjZDVjYTI0YmNmOWU5YWI0YzMwMjU5NTA4YjJhNDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regis Tiwi Gardens fails aged care audit in NT: Choking death maggots on residents,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/choking-death-and-maggotinfested-bed-sores-in-nt-nursing-home-horror/news-story/22cd5ca24bcf9e9ab4c30259508b2a45 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5udG5ld3MuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvbm9ydGhlcm4tdGVycml0b3J5L2Nob2tpbmctZGVhdGgtYW5kLW1hZ2dvdGluZmVzdGVkLWJlZC1zb3Jlcy1pbi1udC1udXJzaW5nLWhvbWUtaG9ycm9yL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMjJjZDVjYTI0YmNmOWU5YWI0YzMwMjU5NTA4YjJhNDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5c2lha2luaS5jb20vY29sdW1ucy81OTY1MTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COMMENT | The business of the media industry - can it survive?,"COMMENT | The Malay Mail ceased publishing its print paper in 2018 completing a 122-year run. The Tamil Nesan shut down in 2019 five years shy of its centennial. Chinese daily Oriental Daily is the most recent casualty shutting down in 2021.

They are not alone. A US study found that 1800 newspapers have shut. In mid-2020 News Corp announced over 100 papers would stop printing in Australia.

The papers that remain alive have shriveled down both in terms of circulation and revenue. The Audit Bureau of Circulation which measured distribution in Malaysia shut down in 2019 so it's hard to measure the decline.

Industry sources put it at well under a million papers sold daily across the country only about 20 percent of its peak of 4.7 million copies in 2007.

The number could be even lower during periods when readers were under pandemic-related lockdowns.

Is digital doing better?

One would think with the audience going digital media would make back online whatever they lose in print. This would also seem to be the case with many players entering the market. Why would they do so unless it was profitable?

The internet especially the growth of smartphones in the last decade has brought news instantly to the fingertips of over 90 percent of the adult population. The top news sites would typically reach over a million users per day.

In print a circulation of 100000 copies can generate RM1 million to RM3 million in advertising revenue per day or about RM10 to RM30 per reader.

Comparatively online advertising earnings can range between one to three sen per user generating between RM10000 to RM30000 in ad revenue per day nearly 1000 times lower than in print.

Why is this the case? Tech giants - particularly Google and Facebook - are able to offer advertising at dramatically lower rates as they access billions of users globally.

Advertisers are able to spend less and reach more customers using their giant platforms as opposed to purchasing more expensive advertising directly from media companies.

The drain on the media is not only due to the intense competition from the tech giants. The internet has allowed other forms of competition too.

Piracy has become a major issue. Paid TV providers such as Astro have been hit by streaming boxes that are able to offer the same paid channels for free through a one-time purchase or through a monthly subscription at a much lower price.

Astro is able to hang on to the older less tech-savvy audience but has found it challenging to pick up newer audiences.

Piracy is also a major issue for news sites - their original content is often copied and re-published on anonymous websites which earn revenue by working with advertisers.

This form of piracy is a copyright offence and reduces advertising revenue for copyright holders. However there has been little action by the authorities to curb this form of theft.

The media market is also now global. Audiences in Malaysia can access many media sites on many platforms both for entertainment such as Youtube Netflix and Disney+ for news or hobby sites. Malaysians are no longer confined to Malaysian-based media.

The internet also offers a lower barrier to entry. Anybody can set up a content site overnight ranging from serious publishers to bloggers and influencers.

Brands too are no longer reliant on the media to convey their message. From billboards to email campaigns and social media pages brands now invest heavily in building a direct relationship with their existing and potential customers without relying on digital and traditional publishers.

So why isn’t there much effort to rescue the industry? There is little pressure coming from the customer or the audience. In fact from the connected audience's perspective it is a golden age of information.

They have access to more media choices than ever before. Media is now more engaging faster and cheaper than ever before. The bad for the industry is a boon for the consumer.

In reaction to this disruption print and broadcast media have had to downsize dramatically. Retrenchments closing down of newspapers reduction in hiring have all taken place.

How do we rescue the industry?



There are a few schools of thought and approaches. One approach has been to get those who have benefited from the digital disruption to contribute back to the industry.

For example in early 2021 the global media industry watched as Australian media lobbied and got the government to pass a law (officially called News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) that forced the tech big boys Google and Facebook to negotiate a revenue-sharing deal with the media.

The law strengthened the position of Australian media to demand a higher share of advertising revenue.

However it remains unclear how much the media have benefitted and whether such benefits will be enjoyed by the local and smaller players as well.

Elsewhere there are also reports that Google has agreed to pay French publishers for news.

This approach also has some support in Malaysia. Sinar Harian acting head of product development & data management Ahmad Nazri Mohd Noor said “News portals are the opposite of the false news.

""(News portals) are reliable and authoritative. Therefore social media platforms should pay for the content that the media produces every day.”

Sinar Harian acting head of product development & data management Ahmad Nazri Mohd Noor

He warned that relying on digital advertising and subscriptions alone may not be enough to cover costs and called on the media industry to work together to pressure the government to act.

“The Malaysian government needs to facilitate cooperation between social media platforms and news portals to facilitate some revenue sharing from the social media platforms to the news portals"" he added.

Other approaches called for the media to be more nimble and adapt to changes quickly.

“The reality is print audiences have declined and fragmented with more going for audio and video hence the proliferation of distribution channels or non-news platforms” said The Malaysian Insight editor and CEO Jahabar Sadiq.

“Our choice is simple we follow and build the audience in those channels - more video audio and to a certain extent long-form journalism - that can be sponsored or have paid content and subscribed to.”

He argued that breaking and topical news have to be sacrificed in order to attract a discerning audience that is willing to pay for quality news content.

“In the Malaysian context that will mean language and demographic differentiation to widen revenue streams.”

He said one way to reduce costs is for the industry to agree to “a common payment gateway wallet infrastructure for all subscribers to access... then we make it simpler cheaper and better for all of us to do business.”

“What should make us different is our approach to journalism therefore giving a choice of news and content rather than having too many platforms and payment options” he stressed.

TheVibes.com editor-in-chief Terence Fernandez also called for innovation but more in terms of the advertising model.

""Advertising budgets in many companies have now shifted from marketing to communications. With this in mind the media needs to consider venturing into the realm of reputation management communications advisory and training.



Editor-in-Chief of TheVibes.com Terence Fernandez

""At first glance it is a fine line to thread as this will question impartiality and independence of the press. However it is no different from the current challenges of having clients who pay for ad space.

""Ethics vs revenue dilemmas will always be there but in my experience maintaining editorial integrity is a selling point. Bona fide brands will want to be associated with organisations that command the public trust.

""Just think how many times have we as individual newspersons been approached by politicians CEOs PR practitioners etc for free advice?"" said Terence suggesting that this relationship can be monetised.

Ms Walsh has been directing American film and television shows from Brisbane for close to 20 years.

She’s currently the additional assistant director on the American documentary series Joe Exotic which is filming in Brisbane telling the story of the controversial American zookeeper nicknamed “Tiger King” who is now in jail for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot.

“Because the director can’t talk to the extras I give all the extras their first position a queue and an action” Ms Walsh said. “It’s something I’ve been doing for 20 years.

Her partner fellow filmmaker Paul Butler has just premiered a documentary he worked on with Oscar nominated director Judith Ehrlich as part of the Brisbane International Film Festival called The Boys Who Said No.

But filmmaking is only part of Ms Walsh’s career portfolio.

‘You that TV guy?” Bill McDonald turning heads with latest gig

She is also the interior designer behind Fortitude Valley’s new Greaser Bar the owner of Brisbane’s largest antique centre the Camp Hill Antique Centre and TART Cafe and the mother of three children under 10.

With so much going on it’s no wonder the portrait of her entered in the Brisbane Portrait Prize by local artist Marisa Veerman last year is a blur of motion.

But 20 minutes before a crowd of strangers arrive to inspect her East Brisbane home which is going to auction next month she sits cross-legged on her couch with The Righteous Brothers playing on an old valve radio that takes 30 seconds to warm up.

“You think it’s not working and then all of a sudden …” she said.

Making things work in a different setting is something Ms Walsh is particularly good at doing.

She once came home with the diner from the Australian TV series H2O: Just Add Water that she was working on.

“The whole diner’ she said. “We had it before we renovated and we actually did put the booth up inside the house.”

Then there was the kitchen from the hit US series Monarch Cove which starred a bevy of Brisbane actors including Andrew Buchanan and James Stewart.

“I’ve never used this place as a film location but a lot of items are props and have been used as props from shows I’ve worked on.”

In renovating the now four-bedroom family home she shares with filmmaker Paul Butler and their three children Elvis Hemingway and Sinatra she has gone one step further using professional skill sets in different ways to achieve a home that is a blend of vintage charm and modern family function.

“The spiral staircase is out of a church and we got a guy who builds roll cages for cars to do the balustrading” she said.

“He built the big steel frames and then soldered these (circles) on individually. He probably regretted the job at that point but it is one of my favourite features.”

Glass concertina doors from the old Burleigh Pub on the Gold Coast also feature in the extension to the house which has added bedrooms an attic downstairs living and kitchen areas and outdoor entertaining zones around an in-ground pool.

“I’ve incorporated the old with the new so that it flows really well and you don’t realise you’re in the old part or the new part of the house” she said.

It starts raining as she speaks and the concertina doors are open on two sides of the downstairs family room in preparation for the twilight open home but there’s no need to close anything because surrounding covered decks protect the home.

The original two-bedroom cottage has been restored and has a central foyer accessed from the side of the house with a flight of six stairs leading up to front office with a skylight and red and yellow stained glass windows that can be seen from street level.

The lounge to the right of the foyer has now become a dedicated library with a fireplace.

From the library a hallway leads past two bedrooms which are connected by a creative folding wall into the main living areas.

The spiral staircase leads to the master suite with its own private deck and an attic for extra storage.

“Basically I’ve had three children and each child came with its own renovation” she said.

“Elvis our first child came with the pool and the extension to the house nine years ago. Hemingway our second child came with our office and our third child Sinatra came with the new bathroom and new bedrooms for the children. That was four years ago.”

A European-style laundry was also a feature of the most recent renovations hidden behind a custom-built wall in the main bathroom.

Ms Walsh is now working on the US documentary Joe Exotic which is filming in Brisbane while she looks for a new home for her growing family and continues her other job as the owner of the Camp Hill Antique Centre and TARTS cafe while Paul Butler’s Vietnam War documentary The Boys Who Said No made its Queensland debut at the Brisbane International Film Festival on Saturday and is awaiting a cinematic release.

“Because of the shop I can’t do the directing full time any more and I have three little kids but this is an exciting time for Brisbane” she said.

“When Brisbane gets locked down during Covid we can keep filming and every other place in the world it’s different. We are safer here than anywhere really.

“Queensland can leverage that people will realise that this is the place we can come and shoot film and TV. That’s because there’s beaches sunshine aqua waters and red dirt. You can do anything here.”

Chris Rice and Taj Suffolk of Place Bulimba will take 18 Chorlton St East Brisbane to auction on November 6."

I grew up playing on the beaches near Pensacola — splashing in the surf collecting shells building sandcastles. To me those shimmering white dunes and bobbing sea oats are more of a signifier of Florida-ness than all the citrus boxes seafood platters and theme parks put together.









Even the serendipity of Florida beaches tickles my fancy. A partial list of the odd things that have washed up on our beaches includes a swordfish eye as big as a softball part of European rocket 1000 pairs of shoes wild boar carcasses a chunk of whale blubber that became known as “the St. Augustine Monster” and of course bales of marijuana known as “square grouper.”

Then in 2010 I watched in anger and horror as something new washed ashore: glistening globs of weathered oil from BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster. They were showing up on the beaches I had played on as a child arriving two months after the rig exploded off Louisiana.

The first Floridian to spot those tar balls was Robert K. Turpin a fourth-generation native in charge of Escambia County’s marine resources department. I thought I loved the beach but this is a guy who loves the beach so much that his ringtone made the sound of waves slapping the shore.

Turpin got up at 4:30 a.m. one morning in 2010 and put on his county uniform and drove out to Pensacola Beach where by the light of a half moon he could see gobs of black goo littering the normally pristine sand.

Unbelieving he reached out and touched one of the globs. “And that was … the world changed” he said a decade later.

I thought about Robert Turpin poking the brown goop when I read a story in The New York Times last week that said the Biden administration is turning its back on offshore drilling rigs such as Deepwater Horizon (hurray!). Instead the paper’s headline said “Biden Administration Plans Wind Farms Along Nearly the Entire U.S. Coastline.”









“Speaking at a wind power industry conference in Boston Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said that her agency will begin to identify demarcate and hopes to eventually lease federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico Gulf of Maine and off the coasts of the Mid-Atlantic States … to wind power developers by 2025” the story said.

“Hey” I said “wait just a sandspur-picking minute!”

Look at a map of the state. Florida has more than 1260 miles of coastline — more coastline than any other state in the continental United States. If you’re putting wind turbines along the coastline that means you’re going to be lining them up next to Florida right?

You’ll have to forgive me for not trusting Interior to do a good job on Florida’s exterior. After all that agency oversees the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which in its infinite wisdom said in 2017 that Florida manatees are no longer an endangered species yet we now are seeing nearly 1000 of them wiped out in a single year by malnutrition.

Meanwhile a different part of Interior — the Minerals Management Service as it was known then — issued the permit that BP needed for cranking up the Deepwater Horizon oil rig declaring it safe to operate prior to it exploding and sinking.

After witnessing the mess that Deepwater Horizon made I don’t want any more oil to show up on Florida’s glorious beaches. But I am not keen on seeing Interior planting a bunch of wind turbines just offshore either.

But after I talked to several folks it dawned on me that maybe I don’t have to worry.

‘A less-smart place’

When people in Florida talk about alternate energy they seldom bring up wind. Instead they talk about solar power. After all we are the Sunshine State. We get lots of sun and we ought to be producing a lot more solar energy than we already are.







There’s also a project using the power of the Gulf Stream to generate electricity. Last year a company called OceanBased Perpetual Energy worked with Florida Atlantic University to test whether the ocean current would turn turbines to produce an electrical current. It did.

When it comes to wind though Florida is known more for its balmy breezes than any steady gusts. “Steady gusts” are what wind power requires. They are as necessary for wind power as chocolate chips are when you bake chocolate chip cookies.

“Florida does not have sustained on-shore winds like they have in Nebraska and Oklahoma” said Susan Glickman a longtime advocate for clean energy in Florida.

I think the only exception to that rule is in Tallahassee and then only when the Legislature is in session. That’s the time when there might be enough huffing and puffing to get the blades turning on a whole bunch of turbines.

One Florida company is definitely in the wind power business. NextEra Energy of Juno Beach is the biggest producer of both wind and solar power in the world. NextEra operates across 37 states and Canada with wind farms in places like Kansas.

But it has zero plans for any wind farms in its home state.

“There are smart places to put wind turbines and less-smart places to put wind turbines” a NextEra official told the Palm Beach Post in 2012. “Florida is a less-smart place due to the lack of wind resources.”

An outsider tried to put one here. Ten years ago a St. Louis company Wind Capital Group proposed building wind turbines on sugar cane land just north of Lake Okeechobee.







Environmental groups opposed the Sugarland Wind project arguing that the proposed location would slaughter migrating birds drawn to the Everglades. Nevertheless the company got local and state permits to build Florida’s first wind farm despite its own estimates that its 114 turbines would kill nearly 500 birds a year.

Then in 2013 before construction began Wind Capital Group abruptly dropped the whole thing citing “market forces.”

Ever since then Glickman said nobody has talked about doing wind power here.

Complicating matters is that until January the occupant of the White House was the world’s greatest opponent of wind power a Floridian named Trump. He did more than just rant about the noise of the blades causing cancer (which by the way they do not). He imposed a moratorium on all offshore energy development off Florida and that includes not just offshore oil and gas but also offshore wind turbines.

“That moratorium goes into effect in 2022 and lasts for 10 years” said Chris Carnevale of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. The only way to stop it is for Congress to pass a law overturning it before it takes effect he said.

But as you may have heard Congress is stuck in the mud right now spinning its wheels instead of spinning any wind turbines.

This is because of one man — the one who coincidentally has been taking a ton of fossil fuel campaign contributions Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia who also happens to be chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The senator (cough cough) from coal country (cough cough) doesn’t like the parts of the Biden bill that would pay utilities to get off fossil fuels even if fossil fuels are bad for the rest of America. Can’t have that clean energy stuff mucking up our dirty economy you know!

Better than BP

I asked the Department of the Interior to explain to me what in the Haaland its secretary was talking about when she mentioned places for offshore wind in “federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico.” I got a reply email from John Filostrat a spokesman for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management — that’s the name the Minerals Management Service took on after the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

“We are in the earlier planning stages to assess commercial interest in the Gulf of Mexico while obtaining public input to increase our understanding of the area” Filostrat said. “One of our goals is to identify areas where offshore wind development can be safely and responsibly developed while avoiding or reducing potential conflicts with other existing uses and protecting environmentally sensitive areas.”







How preliminary is this planning stage? They haven’t had any conversations yet with the fishermen who depend on the Gulf to supply their catch according to Annie Hawkins executive director of a pro-fishing group called Responsible Offshore Development Alliance.

A government map that Carnevale pointed out to me shows a potential leasing area in federal waters — i.e. nine miles from land because federal waters are six miles farther from shore on Florida’s Gulf side than on its Atlantic coast. This one is due south of the Alabama-Florida state line.

But neither of us could name even one wind power company vying for a lease there — not even offshore oil companies like BP which are now trying to get into the offshore wind business by citing their extensive experience with building offshore platforms. (No really! They think that’s a good thing!)

We couldn’t name one because there isn’t one said Jeremy Firestone director of the University of Delaware’s Center for Research in Wind.

Nobody’s vying for a lease for a wind turbine farm offshore of Florida for the same reason there’s no one vying for a spot on land in Florida: Except for the occasional hurricane or tropical storm Florida’s offshore areas lack wind.

“Theoretically wind [power] can work in the Gulf of Mexico” Firestone told me. “But practically it’s not going to happen in the near future. … It’s going to be a while before anybody builds any offshore wind farms off of Florida.”

Filostrat’s agency paid for a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to assess offshore wind energy resources in the Gulf. One of the sites they picked for the study was off Pensacola.

But they found that the “highest wind resources” are in the western gulf — in other words near Texas not the Florida Panhandle.

The bottom line here is that Haaland’s bold talk of building wind turbines off nearly every coastline is just a lot of hot air. Florida is a lot of things — a place with great beaches and award-winning state parks home to every tourist attraction you can think of from the mermaids of Weeki Wachee to Dinosaur World as well as the producer of lots of wacky crime log items. But it is simply not a suitable spot for wind power.

I suppose by making such an outlandish pronouncement Haaland was hoping people who only read headlines would think the Biden administration is taking a sweeping approach — wind turbines everywhere! — to the big frightening problem of climate change.

The truth is much much narrower which is what often happens with government programs. Remember the “War on Drugs”? It was a big sweeping program that sounded good but obscured the fact that nobody in authority really knew what to do. But we sure spent a lot of money on it!

The irony is that we do know what to do about climate change: Drive less use less power plant trees avoid subsidizing fossil fuels. We can focus our personal energy on boosting renewable energy sources — solar in Florida for instance — and not just on making big promises that will never pan out.







Florida certainly has more to lose from climate change than nearly every other state. Our coastal areas tend to be low-lying so sea level rise hits us pretty hard not just with storm surges but with sunny day flooding. Also we’re already pretty warm day and night. And we’ve already got problems with hurricanes toxic algae blooms and mosquito-borne diseases. Those are all things that climate change is expected to make worse.

In a world full of change though some things remain the same. That’s why I wound up calling Robert Turpin again.

He’s still working the same job he had in 2010 still overseeing marine resources for Escambia County. He told me he’d be OK with wind turbines several miles off Pensacola.

“If it’s not too far out” he said “it could serve as a sort of an artificial reef structure that could be a type of habitat for fish.”

One thing’s for sure he said. Wind turbines are a lot less likely to explode and spill thousands of gallons of oil that wind up washing ashore on Florida beaches.

He is the author of five books including the New York Times bestseller Oh Florida! How America’s Weirdest State Influences the Rest of the Country which won a gold medal from the Florida Book Awards.

Not in Brexit Britain…,"Nike has shelved its popular recycling scheme in the UK in response to higher costs arising from Brexit.

The Reuse-a-Shoe scheme allowed UK customers to deposit their old trainers at a Nike store where they would be shipped to one of Nike’s four distribution centres in Flanders Belgium to be recycled into rubber for use in track surfaces gym flooring and new Nike footwear and apparel.

“Bring your old pair and join us on a journey towards zero carbon zero waste future-proof sport” the company’s marketing materials stated.

However Brexit and the subsequent introduction of EU export tariffs mean the scheme is no longer economically viable. Higher haulage and excise costs mean the programme is roughly one-third more expensive for Nike to run.

The company is yet to announce the scheme’s permanent suspension but Reuse-a-Shoe was placed on hiatus in spring 2020 when Nike’s UK retail outlets were closed due to Covid-19. A landing page for the site remains accessible through the company’s British website although clicking through to “learn more” about the scheme takes you to a page that simply reads: “The product you are looking for is no longer available.”

Customers can still collect a recycling bag from Nike stores in which they can send their old shoes to one of the Belgian distribution centres. As well as packing the items individuals now have to cover postage costs previously borne by Nike itself.

A Nike spokesperson said: “We can confirm Nike’s Reuse-a-Shoe programme is not currently available in the UK. Nike offers our recycling and donation programme in 22 markets across the Europe Middle East and Africa region where consumers can have a positive impact on our planet and their communities by dropping off gently worn footwear and apparel at participating local Nike stores for recycling or donation.”

Compared with other footwear trainers can be especially difficult to recycle as they often contain a number of composite materials held together with hard-to-recycle glue. It is estimated that Britons send about 150 million pairs of shoes to landfill every year with only about 15% of post-consumer shoe waste being recycled or redistributed.

Simon Ellin chief executive of the Recycling Association which represents British recyclers said the industry was undergoing a host of Brexit-related issues not least the HGV driver shortage and a one-third rise in export costs. He said: “Brexit has brought huge challenges for our industry not least the mountain of expensive red tape we now need to enable us to export recycled materials on to the continent for reprocessing.

“Brexit has also meant we have had to change our trading terms with our European partners for VAT purposes. This has proved challenging but it has been very encouraging that most of our European outlets have engaged with us to find a workable system. We now just regard it as the new norm.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL2d1bmRhbS1uaWtlLXNiLWR1bmstaGlnaC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gundam x Nike SB Dunk High DH7717-100 DH7717-400 Release Date - SBD,"Nike SB and Japanese anime franchise Gundam are teaming up to release two special edition colorways of the Nike Dunk High.

Nike has suspended its Reuse-a-Shoe recycling scheme in the UK as the recycling industry grapples with high costs related to Brexit.

Customers looking to send their old shoes off for recycling can still collect a recycling bag from Nike stores to be sent to one of the brand’s four distribution centres in Belgium.

But now they must pack the items themselves and pay for postage which was previously paid for by Nike.

The scheme’s change first reported by the Guardian comes as the introduction of EU export tariffs as a result of Brexit pushed the cost of the recycling programme up by around a third.

The sports apparel and footwear brand previously allowed UK customers to leave their old trainers at a Nike store to be sent to Belgium.

The shoes which are generally difficult to recycle due to the mixed materials and glue that holds them together are then recycled into rubber to be used in playgrounds running tracks courts and new Nike products.

The company’s website says: “Take your old pair to a store near you and we’ll transform them into Nike Grind – a material that’s powering the next generation of athletes.

“Bring your old pair and join us on a journey towards zero carbon zero waste future-proof sport.”

But clicking on the “Learn More” button on the site leads to a page that says: “The product you are looking for is no longer available.”

Nike suspended its recycling programme last year when stores were forced to close because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

A spokesperson for the company said in a statement: “We can confirm Nike’s Reuse-a-Shoe programme is not currently available in the UK.

“Nike offers our recycling and donation programme in 22 markets across the Europe Middle East and Africa region where consumers can have a positive impact on our planet and their communities by dropping off gently worn footwear and apparel at participating local Nike stores for recycling or donation.”

Simon Ellin chief executive of the Recycling Association told the Guardian that the industry was experiencing a number of issues related to Brexit.

With the national HGV driver shortage hitting multiple industries and the increase in export costs Ellin said: “Brexit has brought huge challenges for our industry not least the mountain of expensive red tape we now need to enable us to export recycled materials on to the continent for reprocessing.

“Brexit has also meant we have had to change our trading terms with our European partners for VAT purposes. This has proved challenging but it has been very encouraging that most of our European outlets have engaged with us to find a workable system. We now just regard it as the new norm.”"

Nuraddeen Muhammad Usman popularly known as Nura MC Khan is the chairman of Kadawood Film Industry based in Kaduna and the producer of ‘Daga Ceton Rai’ and many other TV series. He’s also featured in many Nollywood movies. In this interview he talks about the difference between Northern and Southern movies and lots more.

WM: People hear more of Kannywood as the Hausa film industry so tell us about Kadawood?

Nuraddeen Muhammad Usman: Kadawood has been there for a very long time. We created Kadawood solely as an independent film making industry to tell our stories ourselves from our own perspective.

We have good artists in Kaduna who have been making names all over. We want to use the platform to promote peace and harmony in our state and beyond after all the crises that bedevilled the state for a long time. This is the reason we created the film industry.

WM: What is the difference between Kadawood and Kannywood?

Usman: They are the same thing as far as filmmaking is concerned. We are all producing films. But unlike Kannywood Kadawood is structured to embrace all Nigerian languages. At Kadawood we want to give a platform to all Kaduna tribes and those outside the state. So basically whereas Kannywood is largely dominated by Hausa speaking people and they produce Hausa films in Kadawood we produce movies in English Hausa and we are planning to expand to produce movies in other Kaduna languages.

WM: You’ve featured in many Nollywood movies but it seems your recent one ‘The takers’ is receiving more applause.

Usman: ‘The takers’ is a very big budgeted movie that tells a lot. It tells the relationship between the North and the South. The movie is aimed at addressing the ever-growing apprehension between us and inculcates the habit of living harmoniously together. I implore you to go and watch the movie and thank me later. It is of the Hollywood standard.

I was the second lead actor. I gave my best in the movie which I think is the reason it opened many doors for me in Nollywood. I had featured in many movies before ‘The takers’ and after it but in ‘The takers’ I think I did something exceptional that brought me more into Nollywood limelight. The director Toka McBaror said having me in English movies is a blessing.

WM: How many English movies have you featured in so far?

Usman: I featured in movies like ‘The only Surviving Soldiers’ ‘King of Kumar’ ‘Paper Board’ ‘Salim’ and most recently ‘The takers’ and so on.

WM: What are the differences between Hausa and English movies?

Usman: Well there are some differences. In the marketing aspect Nollywood is ahead of us which perhaps is because they are using English language. So producers make more money there which is a huge booster to any filmmaker and it helps them in producing better movies because they know they will get profit no matter how much they devote.

They also pay more which is also directly linked to the market they have.

But the Hausa film industry is coming up. Some of us now make big budget movies that are good in all ramifications. So we are trying our best to bridge the gap.

But where the Hausa film industry is better than Nollywood is in the way our people appreciate us. Here our people appreciate us and give us more attention than our counterparts in the South. The recognition they get that is better than ours is in getting more endorsement.

WM: Between Hausa films and Nollywood where do you enjoy working more?

Usman: I enjoy working in both industries. Wherever I find myself I try to give my best. I am a filmmaker so I don’t like giving anything less than 100%. I think this is one of the reasons more producers are coming for me.

WM: What can be done for the Hausa film industry to reach the level of Nollywood?

Usman: We should redefine our perspective. We have to start producing movies targeting the world at large. We need to go for more training in all aspects of film making and even the actors need to be updating. So if we can be updating ourselves I see our industry competing with Hollywood and Bollywood in the near future not even Nollywood. And lastly we must put merit ahead of sentiment and loyalty. In some of our movies casts are selected in some cases based on loyalty whereas in Nollywood they select cast based on merit.

There is one Nollywood movie ‘The House of Dambe’. The producers called me and described what they wanted and I sent a boy to them that was working here only as a bodyguard in our movie and they cast him as the lead role. In all the Nollywood movies I featured I was selected based on what I can offer not on loyalty.

WM: In your company – ‘The white bird movies’ you sell most of your content on YouTube. Are you making profit?

Usman: I upload my movies on YouTube – in Kadawood TV and I sell my contents to TV stations. On the issue of making profit I can say we are getting small profit but one thing with YouTube is that it is a life-long thing; so you will keep getting profit for a very long time and it depends on your viewers and subscribers. The higher you get the more money you get. Your children can even inherit it and keep getting money. After all we don’t have better options now; the CD market is dead and we don’t have many standard cinemas.

WM: Can YouTube solve the marketing problems of Kannywood?

Usman: I don’t think YouTube alone is enough because we are talking of competing with global film industries. So the only way out is to have more standard cinemas. If we have as many standard cinemas as possible; producers will get more profit and so they will invest more and by doing so actors and other crew members will be well paid.

WM: Kannywood actors are seen in politics but you are not visible anymore why?

Usman: Well I am also into politics. Nowadays things have somewhat changed so much that you must enter politics to make your things move better. My only principle is that I try to give my best in whatever I believe in but I don’t take myself too low to beg for favours. That is why I do politics with utmost caution.

WM: Any message to your fans?

Usman: I can only thank them. All we are doing is because of their unflinching support; so I don’t have enough words to appreciate them. My prayer is that we continue to entertain them and have a good ending.

Ilorin for more than two centuries has been a significant segment of Northern Nigeria. While geographically it is the southernmost Emirate it is also called the frontier Emirate of Northern Nigeria. It is unarguably the most heterogenous in terms of history and constituents among all the Emirates of Northern Nigeria. It has therefore been a subject of debates concerns and attractions among all the people of Nigeria.

While in language and other great aspects of cultural peculiarities  Ilorin shares a lot of similarities with the Yoruba part of Nigeria. Ilorin to a great extent is also a perfect exactitude of the traditional political institutions of the Hausa-Fulani people of Nigeria. This is evident in the Emirate’s political system right from its pinnacle the Emirship and other hereditary traditional leadership institutions. This trend is equally observable in the honourary traditional titles conferred on exceptionally accomplished indigenes and selected friends of the Emirate.

The institution of honourary titles which was formally introduced and formalised in 1955 with the conferment of the titles of Waziri and Madawaki of Ilorin on Mallam Muhammadu Ajeigbe Gobir (1900-1960) and Alhaji Yahaya Madawaki MBE MFR (1907-1998) respectively by the 8th Emir of Ilorin Shaykh Abdulkadir Shuaib Bawa(1919-1959) has come to stay as a very significant aspect of the community’s sociopolitical culture. Today close to twenty of such titles have been created by succeeding Emirs such as Shaykh Sulu-GambariCFR(1959-1992); Shaykh Aliyu Abdulkadir (1992-1995); and the incumbent Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari CFRwho mounted the respected stool in 1995.

Of all the titles the office of Turaki appears to be one of the most prominent highly coveted and greatly respected by all and sundry. This veneration may not be unconnected to its significance in the far North. It may also be informed by the calibre of those who have held the position in the prominent Emirates of Northern Nigeria particularly since the nation became an independent country. Take for instance the first elected President of Nigeria Alhaji Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari GCFR (1924-2018). He was the Turaki of Sokoto between 1962 and his death. Similarly former Vice-President of Nigeria Alhaji Abubakar AtikuGCON (b.1946) held the title of Turaki of Adamawa for so many years before he was elevated to the office of Wazirin Adamawa a few years back .There was also Alhaji Aliyu Turakin ZazzauOBE (1908-1974)who was the Honourable Minister of Trade and Industry and subsequently Minister of Establishment and Training; andof courseAlhaji Maje Abdullahithe very popular Turakin Kanowho lived between 1924 and 1975 and was a prominent figure. All these gentlemen were very visible in the sociocultural and political firmaments of Northern Nigeria and the nation at large for many decades.

In Ilorin each of those who held the title was a very important member of the community.The first Turaki of Ilorin Alhaji Sanni Olanrewaju Buraimo Okin(1910-1972) was appointed the Turaki of Ilorin in 1963 by the 9th Emir of Ilorin Shaykh Sulu-GambariCFR. Alhaji Okin was a teacher politician statesman and community leader who served the people of Ilorin creditably. He was a Court Registrar Treasurer and a Member of the Northern House of Assembly at various times. He was also a Member of the House of Senate during the first republic. He was once a Provincial Commissioner for Kabba Province in the administration of the Northern Regional Premier Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello KBE GCON. He held the traditional title from 1963 till 1972.

The second holder of the office was Dr Abubakar Olusola Saraki (1933-2012). He was an accomplished medical doctor foremost politician and extraordinary community leader who became the political leader of Kwara State shortly after he took the title. He was the main issue in the politics of Kwara State for four(4) eventful decades. The second Turaki of Ilorin was also regarded as “the Chief Launcher of the State” due to his deep pocket and generosity. He was a man of the people till his death. He was also the Senate Leader at the nation’s Upper Legislative House during the Second Republic between 1979 and 1983. Many people believed that his conferment and turbaning as Turaki of Ilorin on April 121974 was the key with which he found a space for himself in the politics of the State and the nation at large. On his elevation to the title of Waziri in 2006late Dr Saraki was succeeded by his son Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki CON (b. 1962).The third Turaki of Ilorin was the Executive Governor of Kwara State between 2003 and 2011.He was also the President of the Senate between 2015 and 2019.He was indeed the first Muslim to serve as the Senate President and Chairman of the National Assembly. In between his tenure as Governor of the “State of Harmony” he served as the Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum. He was also the Chairman of the influential Nigerian Governors Forum and became an important political force too as his father.

Going by the pedigrees of those who held the title some of which were stated above it is generally assumed and accepted that the title is of high value in every Emirate of Northern Nigeria. And Ilorin despite its peculiarities is not an exception. This is because only first class patriots and established statesmen are appointed to hold it.

The literal meaning of the title is Business Leader. The position grants the occupant the privileges of serving as a close confidant of the Emir. It is just like the position of Senate Leader in a Senate where the holder is usually the engine-room of the parliament and a “go-between” the parliament and the executive arm of the government. In traditional politics of Northern Emirates a Turaki is usually “the face of the Kingdom” which granted him the title. It is therefore a position of exceptional honour.

The seat of Turaki in a typical Hausa-Fulani entity like Zazzau( Zaria) is a position that could be traced back to the Habe regime. The office was considered exclusively a seat for princes as it was Prince Bayero the son of Hammada the then Emir of Zazzau who was the first personality to ascend the seat of Turaki. He served as Turaki while his father was serving as the Emir of Zazzau.

From the slogan associated with the title of Turaki one would appreciates the significance of the title a bit more as it goes thus:

“Turakithe crown controller; Antihill the center of the entire earth; Bugau the mediator of the palace conflict; the fagaci of the Amiryou reserve the lord

and pass the wealth across board”.

As it can be gleaned from the above anyone who becomes the Turaki of an Emirate is usually carefully chosen as he becomes an endearment to the Emir.

This means that Turaki is trusted by the Emir to the extent that he can visit the Emir in his private room to convey his messages.

Understandably the words of Turaki are highly and quickly translated into actions. This is because he is seen as the liaison officer who “links” the Emir with the Kingdom. On the other hand” antihill the epicenter of the earth “means he conveys all the princes’ messages to the Emir.

And so the title of Turaki is no less an important and significant one in an Emirate. As it is in Zaria Sokoto Kano and Adamawa among other leading Emirates of the North it is also so in Ilorin. Hence the calibre of those who were chosen to hold it right from its establishment in 1963.

Just as Allah guided his father in the choices of Alhaji Sanni Okin in 1963 and Dr Abubakar Olusola Saraki in 1974 the incumbent Emir was also obviously guided in the choice of Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki in 2006. It is also clear that his decision to appoint Mallam Saliu Mustapha as the new and fourth Turaki of Ilorin is also a product of divine guidance.

This assertion is premised on the pedigrees capacities and potentials of the new Turaki Mallam Saliu Mustapha. He is not only young but also wealthy. The new Turaki of Ilorin is also not only resourceful but also generous. He is not only a patriot but also enterprisingly patriotic and a rising figure bridge-builder and highly connected personality who will use the position to promote the status of Ilorin as an established force in the “politics” of the nation.

One can only wish this energetic gentleman and a truly handsome personality sound health more wealthgreater wisdom and exciting goodwill long life and every other requirement to discharge his responsibilities far beyond the expectations of the Emir and the good people of Ilorin Emirate and their friends.

Sub-hunting spy planes armed with torpedoes maritime drones armed with missiles high-resolution surface scanning cameras and fast-moving surface ships dragging sonar sensors while conducting surface reconnaissance are all fast-growing threats to U.S. Navy submarines.

Part of the challenge is finding ways to minimize Navy submarine vulnerability to enemy detection and attack by simply remaining at safer depths yet in order to achieve a high-degree of high-speed connectivity submarines need to break the ocean surface by coming to “periscope depth” which is closer to the surface.

The U.S. Navy is working with a number of industry partners such as Northrop Grumman to identify evolve and refine new kinds of undersea communications technology.

“Today the submarine comes to periscope depth and conducts the majority of its transmissions at this depth. Capabilities we’re developing at Northrop Grumman will allow the submarine to never have to come up to the surface because it is at its most vulnerable when at periscope depth” Alan Lytle vice president of Strategy & Mission Solutions Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors division Northrop Grumman told The National Interest in an interview.

Interestingly while most people might immediately associate Northrop Grumman with high-profile programs such as its B-2 and B-21 stealth bombers the company’s history with undersea warfare goes back nearly 100 years including substantial World War II efforts. Years ago Northrop Grumman was involved in adapting radio frequency (RF) technologies to undersea acoustic systems and developed the first electric torpedoes for Navy submarines.

“We have been working in the undersea domain for well over 50-years and our support for the Navy stretches back even further” said Jenny Roberts director of strategy investments & integration Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors division Northrop Grumman.

Roberts who formerly worked as a director for undersea influence at the Navy’s Undersea Warfare Division says Northrop Grumman innovators seek to align closely with the sense of mission and purpose now driving the U.S. Navy’s push to stay in front of undersea warfare technology.

“We bring together the power of the corporation’s continuous innovation to provide capabilities our Navy customers need for mission success” Roberts explained to The National Interest. As part of the ongoing effort to synchronize efforts with the Navy Northrop Grumman developers are placing a special premium on innovation in the areas of undersea warfare and cross-domain networking.

For instance perhaps a surface drone submarine ship or fighter jet can identify and share time-sensitive targeting data across domains in near real-time integrating crucial threat information exponentially faster than ever before. The ultimate goal of this is to massively truncate sensor-to-shooter timelines. Perhaps an undersea drone could identify an enemy subsea target pass the data back to an undersea-warfare commander who in turn instantly sends coordinates to a helicopter armed with Very Light Weight Torpedoes. This innovative kill-chain concept was demonstrated by Northrop Grumman in a Navy exercise.

“To deter future conflict or to ensure we win if future conflict arises we need to provide capabilities which expand the influence of the undersea force including connectivity across all domains” Lytle added.

In light of this Northrop Grumman developers discuss their efforts to link undersea and space domains in the context of the Pentagon’s fast-evolving Joint All Domain Command and Control initiative. JADC2 as it is called seeks to engender a kind of multi-node connectivity between otherwise disparate pools of information across multiple domains.

A Long March 3B lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center southwest China at 9:27 p.m. Eastern Oct. 23 sending Shijian-21 into geosynchronous transfer orbit.

The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC) confirmed launch success within an hour of launch. Chinese state media Xinhua reported that Shijian-21 will “test and verify space debris mitigation technologies.”

No details of the satellite or its capabilities were made available. Coupled with the fact that space debris mitigation technologies are “dual-use” having both civilian and military applications the satellite is likely to attract interest and scrutiny outside China.

A commercial case for active debris removal and in the case of geostationary orbit repairing and refueling satellites or delivering them to graveyard orbits is being made globally.

The Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology unveiled a “supplemental service spacecraft” at the Zhuhai Airshow in late September. After approaching to within approximately two meters of a target it would be able to dock with and refuel a compatible satellite. SpaceLogistics a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman has developed Mission Extension Vehicles while DARPA the European Space Agency Astroscale of Japan and others are developing refueling spacecraft.

The classified nature and lack of transparency regarding the intentions and actors involved in the Shijian-21 mission could spark concern however. The same capabilities to rendezvous with and attach to a satellite for refueling and repair could also be used to disable spacecraft of adversaries.

Shijian (“practice”) satellites are broadly technology demonstration satellites. Shijian-17 launched by the first Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket in 2016 is an experimental satellite for communication and broadcast services. It also carried out rendezvous and proximity operations in geostationary orbit.

The Secure World Foundation has tracked Chinese and other space actors’ rendezvous and proximity operations. It notes that Shijian-17 has demonstrated maneuverability around the geostationary belt circumnavigated Zhongxing-5A (ChinaSat-5A) and made later approaches to Zhongxing-6B and Shijian-20 which launched in December 2019.

The Saturday launch of the Long March 3B indicates that the launcher was not the cause of an issue affecting the Sept. 27 launch of Shiyan-10 another classified spacecraft. The satellite was apparently unresponsive in terms of propulsion for more than two weeks before a series of burns raised its perigee by hundreds of kilometers each time and indicated to the outside world that Shiyan-10 was active.

Shiyan-10 continues to alter its orbit and has raised its perigee to 1100 kilometers according data from the U.S. Space Force’s 18th Space Control Squadron (SPCS). The satellite is understood to have been targeting a geosynchronous orbit with a current apogee of 40100 km. Neither CASC nor state media have provided an update on the health or situation of the Shiyan-10 satellite.

The Long March 3B was slated for a busy end to 2021 and appears fit to continue its role as a workhorse among China’s Long March rockets.

The launch was CASC’s 36th launch of the year and 39th overall for China including launches from state-owned spinoff Expace and private firm iSpace. China’s next launch will set a national record for orbital launches in a calendar year surpassing the 39 set in 2018 and matched in 2020.

CASC is targeting more than 40 launches before the end of the year. Private firm Galactic Energy are soon expected to conduct their second launch while Expace’s efforts to launch a second Kuaizhou-1A record this year have been hit by a COVID-19 outbreak.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvYW1lcmljYS1jYW4tbm93LWRldGVjdC1oeXBlcnNvbmljLW1pc3NpbGVzLWZseWluZy1vdmVyLWFyY3RpYy0xOTUzMjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America Can Now Detect Hypersonic Missiles Flying over the Arctic,"The U.S. military needs to re-craft its command and control doctrine to better track hypersonic threats.

Here's What You Need To Know: Hypersonic weapons could reach targets that are 1000km away within minutes. The Pentagon aims to stop them.

It almost seems so obvious it could easily be overlooked. ICBMs and even long-range ballistic missiles could be launched over the Arctic to attack enemies half a world away faster and more directly. The fastest and most direct route between North America and parts of Russia or even China might be straight over the Arctic given the distance across the Pacific or Atlantic and European continent.

Northrop Grumman is working on a development contract with the Pentagon on a “Next-Gen Polar” satellite system and payload technologies specifically engineered to establish a continuous track or threat trajectory across otherwise separated radar fields of regard such as those covering the Arctic.

In a multi-billion dollar deal awarded by the United States Space Force Northrop Grumman will provide flight hardware ground system development and risk reduction functions for Phase 1 of what’s called the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Polar (OPIR) program. The deal covers the design and development of the first two polar-orbiting space vehicles according to a Northrop Grumman statement.

“We are working with the MDA (Missile Defense Agency) to define a spiral approach to do a prototype constellation that will involve a handful of satellites using optical cross-links” Mike Ciffone director Strategy Capture & Operations OPIR & Geospatial Systems Northrop Grumman told reports at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium.

In a related effort Northrop Grumman is also working on payload technologies to support Lockheed Martin’s now in development Overhead Persistent Infrared Next-Gen GEO program.

Success in developing a track relies upon both establishing a continued target trajectory and an ability to share network or transmit the track information from one satellite to another and from one satellite to ground-based command and control centers. Optical cross-links which can use laser connectivity and fiber optics to transmit high-value data at the speed of light between satellites to enable a kind of “mesh” networking between nodes in space designed to bridge an otherwise disruptive “gap” in tracking a threat. Naturally this is something that becomes increasingly challenging when trying to defend against hypersonic missiles traveling at more than five times the speed of sound. Hypersonic weapons can of course transit from one radar aperture to another at unprecedented speeds making it almost impossible for geographically segmented radar systems to establish a continued track on a target.

Hypersonic weapons “could reach targets that are 1000km away within minutes” according to a 2019 paper from a UK-based think tank called Article36 titled “Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.”

Significantly the impact of this kind of threat seems to be anticipated in a 2017 article in AIP Conference Proceedings which cites a need for the U.S. military to re-craft its command and control doctrine to better track hypersonic threats.

“While operational doctrine and command structures adequately address traditional atmospheric air attack or exoatmospheric ballistic missile attack existing doctrine and organizational structure may not be adequate to address the cross-domain threat posed by hypersonics” the paper states.

The Next-Gen GEO which is also part of OPIR will operate above the mid-latitudes of the earth but cannot fully or easily reach polar elliptical orbit whereas the Polar system will “dwell over the Northern Hemisphere” to catch missiles as they traverse between continents. For example a polar satellite could if sufficiently networked to securely transmit time-sensitive information across multiple nodes in real-time alert ground control commanders to a submarine-launched long-range ballistic missile early in its flight trajectory. This becomes much more difficult in the case of a moving target Ciffone said because maneuvering missiles might not follow a predictable “parabola-like” trajectory making it more challenging to discern or anticipate the weapon's speed and expected point of impact.

The challenge of truly being able to “see” things faster and more completely anywhere in the globe continues to grow more pressing as potential enemies continue to advance new technologies designed to prevent detection or intercept such as electronic warfare countermeasures to jam radar decoys and coordinated multiple attacks. This scenario was anticipated in a document called “Army Air & Missile Defense 2018 Vision” which specifies some of the more difficult challenges presented by enemy weapons. For instance regarding ballistic missile threats the Army Vision essay explains that advanced weapons are now engineered with “countermeasures maneuverable re-entry vehicles multiple independent reentry vehicles hypersonic/supersonic glide vehicles and electronic attack.”

It seems almost too self-evident to mention that an ability to succeed in truly establishing a continuous “track” requires a multi-domain approach involving space air ground and sea assets operating with an ability to instantly network sensitive and timely track data. Maj. Gen. Robert Rasch Program Executive Officer Missiles and Space said the MDA has the lead when it comes to hypersonics missile defense but that air-ground synergy would be crucial to success.

“Army will have a role as there is not a solution box that does not require joint sensing. It will take combined sensing to track a hypersonic target over time” Rasch said at the symposium.

There are currently two F-15EXes in existence. The air force accepted delivery of them at Eglin Air Force Base Florida in March and April 2021. The platform is anticipated to join the F-35 F-16 and A-10 along with a sixth-generation fighter program as part of the four-plus-one concept intended to streamline the fleet.

At Nellis AFOTEC Detachment 6 is leading the initial operational test and evaluation of the F-15EX with units from Eglin and Nellis AFB the Oregon and Florida National Guard and contractors.

The plane has undergone a series of developmental tests to ensure the aircraft adheres to the required build specifications and safety standards. It has also conducted operational missions as part of Northern Edge in Alaska.

“We’ve never done full large-scale operational tests with the F-15EX because it’s only been in the US Air Force’s hands for six months” said Lt. Col. Kenneth Juhl Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center F-15 tester.

“The main focus here is to provide the initial push for operational tests and evaluation to really evaluate the platform from an end-to-end perspective with the addition of a robust threat environment that we have here at Nellis. That way when we write our initial test reports we’re giving an accurate look to the Combat Air Force and the Guard as to what the platform is capable of when it initially fields” said Colton Myers F-15EX test project manager Operational Flight Program Combined Test Force.

Maj. Kevin Hand an F-15EX experimental and operations test pilot with the Air National Guard-Air Force Reserve Test Center is among a handful of pilots who will fly multiple day and night missions with defensive and offensive counter air while at Nellis.

“The big thing we’re trying to take away is really showing the differences between the EX and the C model” said Hand.

“A big improvement the EX has is that it’s a digital flight control system so it’s a fly-by-wire aircraft versus the traditional C model which is a standard hydro mechanical aircraft completely controlled by the pilot versus now a computer controlling the airplane” he said.

In addition to operationally testing the aircraft the two-week event also involves testing the aircraft’s Eagle passive active warning survivability system (EPAWS).

“The EPAWS system is the next gen advanced electronic attacks as well as electronic protection system that the EX and Strike Eagles are currently testing and developing and hopefully fielding in the relatively near future” said Hand. “That’s going to give us the ability to essentially go into some of these more advanced threats or aerial denial kind of situations where we can now self-protect and self-jam our way through.”

Juhl said Nellis is the best place to do the operational testing because it offers the best air-to-air and surface-to-air training range and provides the highest fidelity data on the backend to be able to know whether the systems worked.

“Oftentimes we go out there as pilots and we think that the airplane works as well as it should but behind the scenes we dig into some of the instrumentation and it wasn’t exactly what we remembered” he said. “Every so often we need the instrumentation folks to help us out with what was really going on.

“The Nellis range complex offers that ability to be able to not only do an instant feedback of how the airplanes performed but also pull back the data to be able to analyze it in very close detail to make sure that that’s what was happening or even better to be able to find the problems that we had and use that data to find the fixes and then implement them as quickly as possible” he added.

Following the tests at Nellis Myers said the planes will return to Eglin for more developmental tests.

“We’ve been doing developmental tests for the last several months leading up to this event which is more operational focus” he said. “We’ll be transitioning back into developmental tests for the remainder of this year and going into next year as we continue to test the additional capability of the platform to include the additional weapon stations and additional Operational Flight Program upgrades.”

Following that Juhl anticipates the F-15EX will eventually participate in exercises like Red Flag-Nellis.

“The more situations that we can put this airplane in the better information we learn. That integration is probably the key thing in the air force to be able to get multiple different kinds of fighters to work together to be a more formidable force” said Juhl.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvY2hpbmEtY2FwYWJsZS10cmFja2luZy1hbmQtc2hvb3RpbmctZG93bi1mLTIyLXJhcHRvci0xOTUzMzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is China Capable of Tracking and Shooting Down the F-22 Raptor?,"Here's What You Need to Remember: Russia China and others are developing advanced UHF and VHF band early warning radars that use even longer wavelengths in an effort to cue their other sensors and give their fighters some idea of where an adversary stealth aircraft might be coming from.

State-run Chinese media is claiming that the People’s Liberation Army has been able to track the U.S. Air Force’s Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over the East China Sea. While the Chinese report might be easily dismissed as propaganda—it is not beyond the realm of possibility. In fact—it’s very possible that China can track the Raptor. Stealth is not a cloak of invisibility after all. Stealth technology simply delays detection and tracking.

First off if a Raptor is carrying external fuel tanks—as it often does during “ferry missions”—it is not in a stealth configuration. Moreover the aircraft is often fitted with a Luneburg lens device on its ventral side during peacetime operations that enhances its cross section on radar.

That being said even combat-configured F-22s are not invisible to enemy radar contrary to popular belief . Neither is any other tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft with empennage surfaces such as tailfins—the F-35 PAK-FA J-20 or J-31. That’s just basic physics.

The laws of physics essentially dictate that a tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft must be optimized to defeat higher-frequency bands such the C X Ku and the top part of the S bands. There is a “step change” in a Low Observable (LO) aircraft’s signature once the frequency wavelength exceeds a certain threshold and causes a resonant effect. Typically that resonance occurs when a feature on an aircraft—such as a tail-fin — is less than eight times the size of a particular frequency wavelength. Effectively small stealth aircraft that do not have the size or weight allowances for two feet or more of radar absorbent material coatings on every surface are forced to make trades as to which frequency bands they are optimized for.

Therefore a radar operating at a lower-frequency band such as parts of the S or L band—like civilian air traffic control (ATC) radars—are almost certainly able to detect and track tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft. However a larger stealth aircraft like the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit which lacks many of the features that cause a resonance effect is much more effective against low-frequency radars than for example an F-35 or F-22. Typically however those lower-frequency radars do not provide what Pentagon officials call a “weapons quality” track needed to guide a missile onto a target. “Even if you can see an LO [low observable] strike aircraft with ATC radar you can’t kill it without a fire control system” an Air Force official had told me.

That being said Russia China and others are developing advanced UHF and VHF band early warning radars that use even longer wavelengths in an effort to cue their other sensors and give their fighters some idea of where an adversary stealth aircraft might be coming from. But the problem with VHF and UHF band radars is that with long wavelengths come large radar resolution cells. That means that contacts are not tracked with the required level of fidelity to guide a weapon onto a target. As one U.S. Navy officer rhetorically asked “Does the mission require a cloaking device or is it OK if the threat sees it but can’t do anything about it?”

Traditionally guiding weapons with low frequency radars has been limited by two factors. One factor is the width of the radar beam while the second is the width of the radar pulse—but both limitations can be overcome with signal processing. Phased array radars—particularly active electronically scanned arrays (AESA)—solve the problem of directional or azimuth resolution because they can steer their radar beams electronically. Moreover AESA radars can generate multiple beams and can shape those beams for width sweep rate and other characteristics. Indeed some industry experts suggested that a combination of high-speed data-links and low-frequency phased-array radars could generate a weapons quality track.

The U.S. Navy and Lockheed may have already solved the problem. The service openly talks about the E-2D’s role as the central node of its NIFC-CA battle network to defeat enemy air and missile threats. Rear Adm. Mike Manazir  the Navy’s director of air warfare described the concept in detail at the U.S. Naval Institute just before Christmas in 2013 .

Under the NIFC-CA ‘From the Air’ (FTA) construct the APY-9 radar would act as a sensor to cue Raytheon AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles for Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets fighters via the Link-16 datalink. Moreover the APY-9 would also act as a sensor to guide Raytheon Standard SM-6 missiles launched from Aegis cruisers and destroyers against targets located beyond the ships’ SPY-1 radars’ horizon via the Cooperative Engagement Capability datalink under the NIFC-CA ‘From the Sea’ (FTS) construct. In fact the Navy has demonstrated live-fire NIFC-CA missile shots using the E-2D’s radar to guide SM-6 missiles against over-the-horizon shots—which by definition means the APY-9 is generating a weapons quality track.

That effectively means that stealthy tactical aircraft must operate alongside electronic attack platforms the like Boeing EA-18G Growler . It is also why the Pentagon has been shoring up American investments in electronic and cyber warfare . As one Air Force official explained stealth and electronic attack always have a synergistic relationship because detection is about the signal-to-noise ratio. Low observables reduce the signal while electronic attack increases the noise. “Any big picture plan looking forward to deal with emerging A2/AD threats will address both sides of that equation” he said.

Jones (11-1 MMA 1-1 UFC) used striking and grappling pressure to wear down short-notice promotional newcomer Onama (7-1 MA 0-1 UFC) for the unanimous decision by scores of 29-28 29-28 and 29-28.

The lightweight bout was part of the UFC Fight Night 196 preliminary card at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas. It streamed on ESPN+.

It was an action-packed first round as Jones and Onama went right after each other with heavy strikes. There were big strikes laned from both but then Jones decided to change the narrative by taking it to the ground. He was able to keep Onama there for a portion of time but eventually they got back to the feet and started trading shots again.

They came out of the gate in Round 2 with the same type of energy. Jones and Onama tagged each other to the body and the head but Jones’ pressure was more effective. He clinched Onama against the fence and secured a takedown then took the back of his opponent. Onama somehow scrambled free to his feet where he resumed the striking exchanges. Jones clinched his opponent against the fence and landed an accidental illegal knee while the hand was down causing a warning from the referee.

Onama landed some hand punches once the action resumed in the second round. Jones retaliated by clinching and trying to force the action back to the mat. He grounded Onama late in the frame but couldn’t be overly effective in scoring points down the stretch.

With a competitive fight handing in the balance going into the final round Jones went back to his wrestling and got Onama down early in the round. He advanced to mount inside 90 seconds of the frame and started to work toward a submission victory. Onama did well to stay composed and avoid getting put away but Jones kept a firm grip on him and controlled positions until late in the round. Onama had a late flurry but it wasn’t enough to steal the fight.

With several months' worth of FSR integration into games and over three years of increasing DLSS use among games and game engines we're now equipped to shed a bit more light on how the two technologies compare.



We've selected four games that each support both technologies so we can provide direct comparisons between them. We've also tested on one AMD and one Nvidia GPU for each game. This will allow us to compare performance scaling between the different rendering modes as well as comparing image quality.



There's more to life than pure performance though we do track that in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy. Image quality and perhaps more importantly image quality while reaching high frame rates is what we really want. DLSS and FSR tackle this problem in very different ways which we'll briefly cover here before getting into the results of our comparisons.

Nvidia DLSS Overview

Nvidia created DLSS to improve performance without drastically reducing image quality but just as important Nvidia wanted a good way for modern games to render at lower resolutions and then upscale so that things like real-time ray tracing would be more viable on mainstream hardware. To that end Nvidia added tensor core hardware to it's RTX 20-series GPUs and basically doubled down on the tensor core performance with the RTX 30-series.



Tensor operations aren't something Nvidia invented as they've been used and discussed in machine learning circles for a while now. The basic idea is to create special-purpose hardware that has enough precision combined with tons of compute to make the training and inference processes associated with artificial intelligence run better.



The RTX GPUs use FP16 (16-bit floating point) operations and each tensor core on the RTX 20-series can work with 64 separate pieces of data while the RTX 30-series GPUs can work on 128 chunks of data. The RTX 30-series also supports sparsity which basically means that the hardware can skip multiplication by zero and effectively double its performance. The net result is that an RTX 2070 has a potential 59.7 TFLOPS of FP16 compute while the RTX 3070 has a potential 163 TFLOPS of FP16 compute.



All of that computational power gets used to upscale and enhanced frames using inputs from previous frames the lower resolution current frame and an AI network trained on how to make lower resolution images look like they were rendered at a higher resolution.



Nvidia offers four DLSS modes: Quality mode renders at half the target resolution balanced renders at one third the target resolution performance uses one fourth the resolution and ultra performance is one ninth the final resolution. Or at least that's the theory. In practice it seems games have a bit of leeway in their rendered resolution.

AMD FSR Overview

AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution involves far less computational work. It's a post-processing algorithm that has been designed to upscale and enhance frames but without all of the deep learning stuff tensor cores and massive amounts of compute. Basically it upscales an image using a spatial algorithm (it only looks at the current frame) and then has some edge detection and sharpening filters to improve the overall look — or if you want specifics it's Lanczos upscaling with edge detection.



While that may not sound as impressive as DLSS FSR does have some pretty major advantages. The biggest is that FSR can run on pretty much any relatively modern GPU. We've tested it on Intel's UHD 630 AMD GPUs going back as far as the RX 500-series and Nvidia GPUs from the GTX 900-series and it worked on all of them. Also FSR is open-source meaning others are free to adopt it modify it etc.



The FSR algorithm basically uses the shaders that are part of all modern GPUs to do the heavy lifting. As with DLSS there are four modes commonly available: ultra quality quality balanced and performance. AMD uses different scaling factors of 1.3x at ultra quality 1.5x for quality 1.7x for balanced and 2.0 for performance. Those scaling factors apply in both horizontal and vertical dimensions so performance mode ends up being 4x upscaling (the same as Nvidia's performance mode).

DLSS vs. FSR Test Setup

We've selected four games that support both FSR and DLSS for this article. The latest release is Back 4 Blood which came out earlier in October — you can read our full Back 4 Blood benchmarks article for more details on how that game runs and what settings are available. The Myst remake also came out in August 2021 and it uses Unreal Engine 4 to allow you to walk around a fully rendered world unlike the original point and click adventure of the 90s. Next is Deathloop (and I refuse to capitalize the whole name silly Arkane) which released in September. Last (and perhaps least) Marvel's Avengers originally launched without DLSS support but it was added a month later in October 2020 with FSR support added in July 2021.



That's three relatively recent games plus an older game but there are a few others as well. Baldur's Gate III (RPG) supports both DLSS and FSR in the latest early access branch. Other games with FSR and DLSS include Chernobylite (sci-fi survival) Edge of Eternity (a JRPG) Enlisted (multiplayer war shooter) F1 2021 (race car sim) The Medium (adventure) and Necromunda: Hired Gun (shooter). Chernobylite and Necromunda both use Unreal Engine for their DLSS and FSR support just like Myst and we'll probably see quite a few Unreal Engine games in the future with both DLSS and FSR.

Test System for GPU Benchmarks

Intel Core i9-9900K

Corsair H150i Pro RGB

MSI MEG Z390 Ace

Corsair 32GB DDR4-3600 (2x 16GB)

XPG SX8200 Pro 2TB

Windows 10 Pro (21H1)



For testing we're using our standard GPU testbed with a Core i9-9900K CPU 32GB RAM and a 2TB M.2 SSD. We used the GeForce RTX 2060 and Radeon RX 5600 XT in Back 4 Blood since it's the least demanding of the four games and we wanted to look at performance scaling on slightly older and less capable GPUs in that game. The other games we tested with the GeForce RTX 3060 and the Radeon RX 6700 XT. Both have 12GB of VRAM which generally ensured we didn't run into VRAM limitations. The other three games also support ray tracing which we enabled for all of our testing.



The RX 6700 XT normally outperforms the RTX 3060 by a decent amount (by 34% in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy) so we're not really comparing AMD vs. Nvidia performance but rather looking at how DLSS and FSR affect performance. However the use of ray tracing does narrow the gap some as Nvidia's GPUs generally offer better RT performance. And with that out of the way let's look at the results from the four games.

DLSS vs. FSR: Back 4 Blood

We have separate AMD and Nvidia charts since only the Nvidia GPUs support DLSS. Starting with the RTX 2060 even in ultra performance mode DLSS only improved performance by a bit less than 50% while FSR in performance mode boosted framerates by over 90%. Each higher upscaling factor in DLSS improved performance by about 10% with a slightly larger jump going from performance to ultra performance mode.



For FSR each level of upscaling improved performance by closer to 20% on the RTX 2060. It's possible our use of previous generation hardware was a factor in how much performance improved but in general Back 4 Blood wasn't a super demanding game and so CPU bottlenecks can start to be a factor.

Somewhat surprisingly the RX 5600 XT showed slightly lower overall scaling compared to the RTX 2060. Framerates improved by up to 87% using performance mode just a bit lower than the 91% we measured on the RTX 2060 — and most of the other levels are also 1–2% less of an improvement with the exception being ultra quality mode where both GPUs improved by the same 18%.



At least when looking at Turing and RDNA GPUs then FSR doesn't appear to favor AMD's architecture at all. But performance as we said in the beginning is only part of the story. Let's take a look at image quality.

You'll want to open up those 4K images and view at full magnification to see the finer details. We also saved using maximum quality JPG files so there shouldn't be any noticeable loss in quality compared to the source PNG files (which were about 14MB each).



There's a minimal loss in visual fidelity going from no upscaling to FSR ultra quality — you can probably spot a few small details that get blurred out but nothing particularly noteworthy especially when the game's in motion. FSR quality also looks quite good while FSR balanced starts to look a bit blurry and finally there's a clear loss in crispness using FSR performance mode. The branches and needles grass fences ground corrugated metal roof panels and other elements all look a bit fuzzy using the balanced and performance FSR modes. However in motion — this is a fast-paced zombie shooter after all — a lot of those differences become far less noticeable.



Move on to DLSS upscaling and again there's a minimal loss in detail using quality mode a bit more fuzziness with balanced mode and more noticeable blurring and lack of fine details with the performance and ultra performance modes. In motion you might register the fuzziness during less intense parts of the game but when you're fighting zombies it's all good. Which is surprising when you consider the 1280x720 source resolution with DLSS ultra performance mode.



If all of the DLSS and FSR games we tested looked and performed like Back 4 Blood we'd be quite happy. Unfortunately this is one of the better results for image quality using FSR. It's not clear why some of the other games look noticeably worse but let's see for ourselves.

DLSS vs. FSR: Deathloop

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Deathloop was promoted by AMD but it added DLSS with an update and also changed the 120 fps cap to 240 fps — both welcome changes in our book. DLSS ultra performance mode isn't supported so that's one less scaling option to choose from this time.



We're using faster GPUs this time but the performance scaling from the various modes ends up favoring Nvidia quite a bit for some reason. Perhaps it's because we're also using ray tracing but we still would have expected similar gains from the FSR modes. DLSS performance scaling was also markedly better in Deathloop.



For the RTX 3060 DLSS quality mode boosted framerates by 55% balanced improved performance by 87% and performance mode was over twice as fast — 111% faster to be precise. Sticking with the 3060 FSR ultra quality improved performance by 47% quality mode gave an 80% increase balanced was 111% (the same as DLSS performance mode) and FSR performance mode yielded a 153% improvement in fps. Note that the starting point was just 28 fps however and only FSR performance mode got the RTX 3060 to a (mostly) steady 60+ fps.



On the RX 6700 XT the gains were generally quite a bit lower. FSR ultra quality only improved performance by 18% quality mode bumped that to 45% balanced mode gave a 64% increase and performance mode slightly more than doubled performance with a 102% gain. Interestingly performance at native resolution without FSR was 31 fps while FSR performance mode ended up at 62 fps so the RX 6700 XT started out faster than the 3060 but ended up slower. (Note: I may need to retest just to verify these numbers because they're a bit odd.)

Again you need to click the enlarge button and access the full-size images to see the details better. This time unfortunately the image fidelity comparisons don't do FSR any favors. We've got two sets of images and there's some clear aliasing present at higher FSR levels on the first set (right below the ""Expand Your Mind"" sign). But the ultra quality and quality modes can be used pretty much without complaint.



DLSS image quality is interesting because this time there are things that look better with DLSS quality mode than at native — look at the railing above the roof for example. In fact DLSS performance mode still looks almost the same as native mode which is quite impressive.



In the second set of images look at the rock face of the arch the writing on signs and other fine details like the lights on the red arrow sign and you see a very noticeable drop in details even with FSR quality mode and it only gets worse at the higher upscaling settings. DLSS doesn't look better than native this time but all three modes look very close to the same.



I do wonder if standing still for a screenshot perhaps benefits DLSS too much. It uses temporal data — meaning data from previous frames — to help recover lost detail and it could be that standing still presents a perfect opportunity for it to look nearly perfect. Still it's when you're not really moving around that the fine details are actually noticeable and DLSS works wonders in that case.



Based on performance gains this time DLSS gets the nod. You can play using performance mode at 4K and still get a very good overall experience visually while FSR boosts performance but causes a noticeable loss in fine details for some areas of the game. FSR ultra quality is still worth a shot but I wouldn't want to use the balanced or performance modes if I could avoid it.

DLSS vs. FSR: Myst 2021

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Myst performance improvements are a bit better than what we saw in Deathloop but still tended to favor the RTX 3060. Ultra quality FSR boosts fps by 51% on the 3060 and 44% on the 6700 XT quality mode yields an 86% gain on the 3060 vs. 71% on the 6700 XT balanced was 121% compared to 100% and performance increased by 175% versus 132%. These are both the latest GPU architectures so it's interesting that FSR actually appears to run better on Ampere than on RDNA2 at least in some cases.



As for DLSS ultra performance mode basically matched FSR performance mode with a 178% increase in fps. DLSS performance mode likewise matched FSR balanced mode at 121% higher fps while DLSS balanced mode gave a 91% improvement and even quality mode boosted framerates by 63%. Myst isn't a fast-paced action game so high fps isn't really required but both GPUs easily managed more than 60 fps at 4K with the right upscaling settings — DLSS balanced or FSR quality or higher for the RTX 3060 and the RX 6700 XT got slightly more than 60 fps even with native rendering.

Image quality again ends up a bit of a blurry mess with FSR at higher scaling factors. It's not awful but the trees and other details all start to look noticeably worse with the balanced and performance modes. DLSS looks better at least up until the ultra performance mode.



Our second image test scene ended up being worthless as you can see from the screen captures. All the swirling fog makes it hard to tell what's changing from upscaling and what looks different from the fog which is a good illustration of times where you can get away with even FSR performance mode and not really notice the loss of fidelity.



Overall DLSS looked better and performed well in Myst but non-RTX users can certainly run FSR in the ultra quality or quality modes and get higher performance for a relatively unobtrusive drop in crispness and detail.

DLSS vs. FSR: Marvel's Avengers

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Last we have the oldest game of the bunch Marvel's Avengers. It has some oddities that immediately stand out with DLSS specifically that the balanced and quality modes perform basically the same — actually quality mode performed slightly better. Other than that one oddity though things mostly make sense.



The AMD and Nvidia GPUs we tested were a lot closer in scaling this time with the biggest difference being just 3% — the RTX 3060 ran 59% faster with FSR quality mode vs. native while the RX 6700 XT improved by 57% for example.



DLSS ultra performance mode ended up providing the highest performance on the 3060 though again the 9x resolution upscaling was definitely noticeable. Either way you can potentially double your performance in Avengers with the highest upscaling modes from FSR and DLSS.

As with the second image set in Myst there's a lot of vapor and clouds and such swirling around in Avengers which makes it a bit more difficult to see what changed due to FSR and DLSS and what changed just because of the weather. DLSS quality mode is visually indistinguishable from native rendering though and it's equally difficult to spot any differences between native and FSR ultra quality. FSR performance on the other hand certainly looks blurrier. The trees and shrubberies also show more blockiness with FSR than with DLSS.



But when you're in the middle of a fight? Yeah it all sort of blends together. Which is why so many console games have used upscaling in various forms for years without too many complaints from the gamers.

DLSS vs. FSR the Bottom Line

(Image credit: Shutterstock AMD Nvidia)

If you were hoping to see a clear winner there are far too many factors in play. DLSS certainly seems to be more capable of producing near-native quality images especially at higher upscaling factors but it requires far more computational horsepower and at times doesn't improve performance as much as we'd like. More importantly it's an Nvidia-only technology and not just that an RTX-only tech. All the Nvidia users with GTX cards are out of luck as are AMD card owners and Intel GPU users.



FSR doesn't win the image quality matchup particularly in higher upscaling modes but if you're running at 4K and use the ultra quality or quality mode you'll get a boost in performance and probably won't miss the few details that got lost in the shuffle. FSR performance mode however can look pretty bad. In fact I'd prefer running a game at 1080p and letting my monitor stretch that to 4K rather than using FSR performance mode. Balanced mode likewise should only be used if you're in dire need of improved performance.



The wildcard in this discussion is Intel's upcoming XeSS. It sounds a lot like DLSS and one of the people who helped design DLSS left Nvidia to go work for Intel. It will supposedly work on most modern GPUs —Intel AMD or Nvidia — but how well it works is very much unknown. It will use Intel's version of tensor cores for Arc and fall back to DP4a calculations for other GPUs. Plus making a good upscaling algorithm isn't the same as getting it adopted by game developers.



We also didn't get into more traditional forms of upscaling which quite a few games have been using for years. Temporal or spatial upscaling techniques that only drop performance a few percent exist and many games even have dynamic scaling where you target your monitor refresh rate and the game adjusts the resolution on the fly. It may not look quite the same but there are a lot of times where you won't even notice or care.



In terms of adoption rates Nvidia DLSS still leads AMD FSR thanks to its lengthy head start. AMD FSR has been announced or released in at least 27 games at present while Nvidia DLSS is now available in at least 119 games (though many on Nvidia's DLSS list are lesser known indie games). With Unreal Engine and Unity both supporting DLSS and FSR now though we expect we'll see plenty more games incorporating both technologies going forward — and maybe even XeSS as well.



Ultimately games and game developers now have several choices available and that's a good thing. As shown here adopting one of the technologies doesn't preclude supporting the other. Over time we hope to see continued improvements in both algorithms and it's something we'll continue to monitor going forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MjM2MC9udmlkaWFzLWZsYWdzaGlwLWNtcC1jcnlwdG8tbWluaW5nLWdwdS1ub3ctYXZhaWxhYmxlLWNvc3RzLTQ2OTUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA's flagship CMP crypto mining GPU now available costs $4695,"NVIDIA's new CMP 170HX is now for sale will cost you $4695 but offer you the flagship cryptomining GPU will mine like a boss.

NVIDIA's new CMP (or Crypto Mining Processor) range is led by the flagship CMP 170HX which has just popped up for sale by Dubai retailer Vipera which has 238 of NVIDIA's new CMP 170HX crypto mining GPUs in stock and costs $4695. NVIDIA's flagship CMP 170HX was also spotted on a Yahoo auction in Japan where it was even more expensive: $5285.

Inside the NVIDIA CMP 170HX has a GPU built on the 7nm process 4480 CUDA cores 280 TMUs and 128 ROPs. There's 8GB of HBM2e memory on a 4096-bit memory bus with an insane 1.493TB/sec of memory bandwidth. But when it comes to crypto mining the NVIDIA CMP 170HX is a beast that offers 164MH/s of ETH mining performance all from a single GPU.

164MH/s from a single GPU with a 250W TDP is damn impressive when the flagship NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card taps out at around 110MH/s for 300W+ for the most part. It would be impressive to see a system with 8-10x of these for 1.5GH/s at 2.5kW of power consumption.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzkxOTAzLW52aWRpYS10b3AtbGluZS1jbXAtY3J5cHRvbWluaW5nLWdwdS1ub3ctYXZhaWxhYmxlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's top-of-the-line CMP cryptomining GPU is now available for $4300,"In context: On top of the component shortage contributing to rising prices of graphics cards crypto miners have further influenced the global shortage of GPUs by buying up all possible stock. Naturally gamers have been affected with Nvidia ""addressing"" the situation by announcing its dedicated CMP GPUs for cryptomining. One such variant has now become available for an eye-watering price.

The Nvidia CMP 170HX is the flagship GPU in the company's ""Cryptocurrency Mining Processor"" series. As spotted in Tom's Hardware the card has gone up for sale at Vipera a retailer in Dubai. The store claims to have 238 units in stock for a price of $4300. It was also found on a Yahoo auction in Japan where the seller is asking for $5285.

Futile for gamers due to the lack of display outputs Nvidia's CMP 170HX receives power via a single 8-pin pci-e connector joined by a 250W TDP. It also features a GA100 die with 4480 CUDA cores along with 8 GB of HBM2e VRAM.

In terms of hash rate the CMP 170HX can reportedly deliver up to 164 MHps for mining Ethereum. That's a big figure compared to the listed CMP models on Nvidia's official website with the maximum ETH hash rate performance reaching 86 MH/s for the 90HX.

The card combines a dual-slot design with a silver metallic shroud as well as boasting a passive-cooling solution. Built on the 7 nm process the CMP 170HX offers 4480 shading units 280 texture mapping units and 128 ROPs. In addition to being powered by 280 tensor cores the GPU operates at a frequency of 1140 MHz which can be boosted up to 1410 MHz while memory runs at 1458 MHz.

Looking ahead the popularity of cryptocurrency mining may continue increase due to Bitcoin prices recently reaching an all-time high. Ethereum has also been on a tear lately exceeding previous peaks and surpassing the $4000 mark.

Back in February Nvidia announced that all GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards would be shipped with a reduced Ethereum hash rate. Then in May the company unveiled additional measures by applying a reduced ETH hash rate to new units of its RTX 30 series including the GeForce RTX 3080 RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. However those cards' limiter have been partially bypassed resulting in mining performance being boosted to 70 percent.

Meanwhile AMD has denied that the firm is prioritizing selling cards to crypto miners over those wishing to purchase a GPU for gaming purposes though that hasn't helped availability in any significant way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL252aWRpYS1jbGFyaWZpZXMtbWVnYXRyb24tdHVyaW5nLXNjYWxlLWNsYWltL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia clarifies Megatron-Turing scale claim,"You may have noticed that last week Microsoft and Nvidia announced they had trained ""the world's largest and most powerful generative language model"" known as ""Megatron-Turing NLG 530B"" as ZDNet's Chris Duckett reported.

The model in this case is a neural network program based on the ""Transformer"" approach that has become widely popular in deep learning. Megatron-Turing is able to produce realistic-seeming text and also perform on various language tests such as sentence completion.

The news was somewhat perplexing in that Microsoft had already announced a program a year ago that seemed to be bigger and more powerful. While Megatron-Turing NLG 530B uses 530 billion neural ""weights"" or parameters to compose its language model what's known as ""1T"" has one trillion parameters.

Microsoft's blog post explaining Megatron-Turing linked to the Github repo maintained by Nvidia's Jared Casper where the various different language models are listed along with stats. Those stats show that not only is 1T bigger than Megatron-Turing NLG 530B it has higher numbers for every performance figure including the peak tera-FLOPs or trillions of floating point operations per second that were achieved.

So how can Megatron-Turing NLG 530B be the biggest if 1T is bigger by every measure? To resolve the matter ZDNet spoke with Nvidia's Paresh Kharya senior director of product marketing and management.

The key is that 1T was never ""trained to convergence"" a term that means that the model has been fully developed and can now be used for performing inference the stage where predictions are made. Instead 1T went through a limited number of training runs said Kharya known as ""epochs"" which do not lead to convergence.

As Kharya explains ""Training large models to convergence takes weeks and even months depending on the size of supercomputer used."" The table on the GitHub page is listing what are called ""scaling studies"" which create a measure of what kind of performance can be obtained even without training a model to convergence.

Such studies ""can be done by doing partial training runs for a few minutes at different scale and model sizes"" Kharya told ZDNet.

The Megatron-Turing NLG 530B natural langauge processing program developed by Nvidia and Microsoft has 530 billion paremeters. The companies say it is the largest natural langage program ""trained to convergence"" meaning with its neural weights or parameters fully developed so that it can perform inference tasks. Image: Microsoft

The figures for various metrics such as ""achieved teraFLOPs"" are ""real data points"" said Kharya ""measured by conducting partial training runs.""

The point of a partial training run is to approximate a ""miles per gallon"" measure like you would with a car said Kharya in order for customers to know what it takes to train and deploy a particular model before they commit to doing so.

""Different customers are using different models and they need to estimate if they were to bring a model size online an Nvidia platform how much computing resources would they need to invest"" explained Kharya ""or if they had a given amount of computing resources how long would it take to train these models.""

The data points in FLOPs can tell a customer for how long they would need a cloud instance or how large an instance they're going to need for a committed amount of training time.

All that means that Megatron-Turing NLG 530B is the largest model whose neural weights are actually now sufficiently developed to be able to perform on benchmark tests of which Nvidia and Microsoft offered several results.

The significance of that achievement said Kharya is the ability to deploy such a large model across parallelized infrastructure.

Various neural network models developed by Microsoft and Nvidia including Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and ""1T"" a trillion-network model. Figures are form various amounts of training ""epochs."" Nvidia

""As these models are becoming larger and larger they can break the memory of a single GPU and sometimes they don't even fit in the memory of a single server"" observed Kharya.

Using the Megatron software to split models between different GPUs and between different servers and ""using both data parallelism and model parallelism"" and smarter networking ""you're able to achieve very very high efficiency"" he said.

""That means over 50% of theoretical peak performance of GPUs"" said Kharya. ""That's a very very high number meaning you're achieving hundreds of teraFLOPs for every GPU.""

Competitors to Nvidia such as startup Cerebras Systems have started to discuss the theoretical prospect of training multi-trillion-parameter models to convergence without actually showing such an achievement.

Asked when Nvidia and Microsoft will train to convergence an actual one-trillion model Kharya demurred. ""Everyone in the industry is working on these really giant models and it's going to happen"" he said. ""But by whom and when well wait and watch.""

Megatron-Turing NLG 530B is not a commercial product it is a research project between Nvidia and Microsoft. However Nvidia has a catalog page on its Web site where one can obtain dozens of models made available in containers ready to run including Transformer-based language models and other kinds of neural networks such as those for computer vision.

The models are ""pre-trained"" ready to be used for inference but some customers also enhance the models further with additional training runs on their own data said Kharya.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9udmlkaWEtcnR4LWEyMDAwLXdvcmtzdGF0aW9uLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtc2hvd2Nhc2VzLWltcHJlc3NpdmUtbWluaW5nLWVmZmljaWVuY3ktdXAtdG8tNDEtbWgtcy11bmRlci03MC13YXR0cy_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXJ0eC1hMjAwMC13b3Jrc3RhdGlvbi1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkLXNob3djYXNlcy1pbXByZXNzaXZlLW1pbmluZy1lZmZpY2llbmN5LXVwLXRvLTQxLW1oLXMtdW5kZXItNzAtd2F0dHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA RTX A2000 Workstation Graphics Card Showcases Impressive Mining Efficiency Up To 41 MH/s Under 70 Watts,"It looks like the smallest NVIDIA Ampere workstation graphics card the RTX A2000 offers the best mining efficiency of all GPUs so far. Tested by Mining channel Dizzy Mining the RTX A2000 delivers some impressive efficiency figures when mining Ethereum.

NVIDIA RTX A2000 Is The Most Efficient Mining GPU Ever! Produces Up To 41 MH/s at Just 66W

The NVIDIA RTX A2000 features the Ampere GPU architecture. In terms of specifications the RTX A2000 rocks the GA106 GPU which is equipped with 3328 CUDA cores 104 Tensor cores and 26 RT cores all of which offer a nice performance bump over the previous generation offerings. In terms of memory the card is equipped with 6 GB GDDR6 capacity that runs across a 192-bit bus interface and the DRAM features ECC support for error-free computing.

The RTX A2000 itself comes in a small form factor design featuring a half-height and half-length board. The card even has a small blower type-fan on the shroud. Since this is a 70W TDP card there are no power connectors. It's a simple plug-and-use card that offers great efficiency in a compact design. There are four Mini DisplayPorts (1.4) near the rear panel IO shroud which also comes with a small vent to exhaust hot air out.

As for mining performance the NVIDIA RTX A2000 delivers up to 41 MH/s at just 66W when tuned. The core clock was increased by +100 MHz while the memory clock was adjusted to +1500 MHz. In terms of power limit the slider was moved to 95% while the fan speed is pushed to 100%. The card peaks at 51C at full load in mining. Interestingly enabling ECC while mining hammered the mining performance a lot so it's better to keep it disabled if you plan on mining on the workstation card. In terms of mining efficiency the RTX A2000 now takes the lead over the RX 6600:

AMD RX 6600 XT (Tuned) - ~33 MH/s @ 55W (0.59 PPW)

~33 MH/s @ 55W (0.59 PPW) AMD RX 6600 Non-XT (Tuned) - ~30 MH/s @ 50W (0.61 PPW)

~30 MH/s @ 50W (0.61 PPW) NVIDIA RTX A2000 (Tuned) - ~41 MH/s @ 66W (0.62 PPW)

Availability and pricing is another thing though. The NVIDIA RTX A2000 is priced at $649.99 US and will be hitting retail outlets in December. Since the video went live many miners have started pre-ordering the graphics card and are expecting delivery by the mid of November."

These interrelated inputs into chip design are both key chokepoints for China.” – Center for Security and Emerging Technology (Georgetown University)

China’s vulnerability in the semiconductor industry is acute rooted in its technological inadequacies in key parts of the value chain. This applies not just to the core production stages – where Beijing may plausibly imagine that it can spend its way into competitiveness with massive government investment (although so far this has not been successful). The weakness of the Chinese position extends to certain highly specialized supporting technologies which would be much harder for China to enter. The Western control of semiconductor technology is stronger than many realize.

The Basic Industry Segments And Beyond

There are four basic industry segments in the production of integrated circuits: Design Fabrication Packaging and Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment. As described in the previous column China is weak in all of them. Chinese firms have no strategically significant position in the high-value Design Fabrication and Equipment segments. They have only a modest market share in the least important most commoditized segment (Packaging) which is not enough to create meaningful economic leverage.

Semiconductor Industry Structure CHART BY AUTHOR

This picture is incomplete however. An expanded view shows China to be at an even greater strategic disadvantage.

The Critical Missing Pieces

The core IC manufacturing chain is embedded in a vast eco-system – probably the most complex supply network in the entire global economy.

“The production of a single computer chip often requires more than 1000 steps passing through international borders 70 or more times before reaching an end customer.”

The network encompasses thousands of other firms that provide critical inputs to the core: raw materials (silicon specialized chemicals and gases) high-value services and software specialized tools and test instruments and specialized commodities like ultra-pure water and ultra-reliable electricity. And of course as in any high-tech industry there are essential intellectual property assets (IP) that must be acquired or licensed.

Within this network however some components are especially important. Two ancillary segments are critical.

“EDA” (Electronic Design Automation)

“Core IP”

The companies in these segments provide key inputs to the Design segment. They enable the fabless IC companies and the IDMs to construct the chip-designs that create value for the end-users throughout the digital economy — value which ultimately pays for the entire IC network.

These supporting players are themselves very powerful generators of economic value which illuminates their crucial role in the industry. In fact the leading firms in these two segments are even more potent value-creators than the leaders in the four segments described previously.

Enabling the Design

Of the four main segments in the basic IC value chain it is the Design stage where most of the functional differentiation of an integrated circuit is substantially created. The value to the end-user comes mainly from the chip-design. The role of the Fabrication (foundry) and Packaging segments is to productize those designs which while important generates and captures a much smaller percentage of the economic value. This is why Fabless IC companies like Nvidia or Qualcomm are able to claim the lion’s share of the total industry value created (described in more detail the previous column).

But to achieve this the Design firms rely on the EDA and Core IP segments for very specialized help.

Electronic Design Automation (EDA)

Once upon a time…

“Integrated circuits were designed by hand and manually laid out…” – Wikipedia

This doesn’t happen anymore. A modern integrated circuit may comprise billions of elements – far too complex to design “by hand.” Design automation means – well just what it sounds like: it is a suite of software tools to automate the design process to manage the scale and complexity.

An industry website draws an analogy

“Imagine the difference between designing a small house versus designing a mile-high skyscraper. For the skyscraper you need to design sophisticated structural electrical plumbing security and environmental systems communications and computer networks elevators etc. all working together. This is analogous to the dramatic increase in complexity that designers must tackle in electronics today. It is this complexity – enabled by the relentless onslaught of Moore’s Law – that drives the need for automation. Engineers need to validate their concepts model and analyze their designs identify and eliminate problems before making production commitments.”

The firms that provide EDA technologies – like Cadence Synopsys and Ansys – are less well known than the mainline semiconductor firms in the basic segments. But while EDA suppliers may seem to be “in the background” their products are critical to the success of the IC development process.

EDA firms are very powerful value-creators with P/E and P/S ratios higher than any of the main semiconductor industry segments.

Comparison of EDA Value Creation with Other Semiconductor Industry Segments (P/S) CHART BY AUTHOR

The financial markets award EDA firms a 35% premium in share value compared to the Fabless IC companies per dollar of earnings and about a 25% premium per dollar of sales. The premium is obviously much larger relative to the other segments.

Core IP: ARM über alles

Several readers have pointed to what they saw as a “serious omission” in my earlier column – raising the question: What about Arm?

This unusual company – Arm Inc. or Arm Limited or Arm Holdings – embodies a distinctly 21st century business model asset-lite IP-heavy even more fabless than the fabless IC firms. Based in the UK owned by a Japanese venture capitalist (Softbank) soon to be acquired (maybe) by one of its own customers (Nvidia) – some would say that Arm is the linchpin around which the entire semiconductor galaxy revolves – or at least that part of it that deals with “edge” applications (i.e. most digital consumer products).

Arm does not belong to any of the four core segments shown above. It is a design company but it doesn’t design chips. Instead it develops and sells (licenses) blocks of intellectual property (IP) “computing architectures” which IC designers (like Qualcomm Nvidia Intel) can build upon to create their own IC products.

Arm has become spectacularly successful at what it does. Founded in 1990 with a $3 million investment by Apple the company is today the dominant power in Core IP for semiconductors in a wide range of applications. Arm virtually monopolizes the architectures for processors used in several mass market products – mobile phones smart watches tablet computers and smart TVs. Over the past two decades the company has rolled up dozens of smaller design groups into a portfolio that seems today almost unbeatable.

In 2006 – in the pre-smartphone era ARM-based processors were already used in 98% of all mobile phones; the company had sold (licensed) by then 1 billion cores (which seemed like a big number at the time)

2010 – ARM was selling almost 2 billion cores per quarter

2014 – a cumulative total of 50 billion chips had been produced with Arm designs

2017 – the cumulative total was 100 billion cores; the company floated the question: “Why not a trillion cores?”

2019 – 130 billion cores cumulatively

2020 — 180 Bn cores —

Today (2021) – their website claims 200 billion Arm-based chips have shipped…

That’s 25 Arm-based chips for every person on the planet. 70% of the world’s population are using ARM-based products.

ARM is not just for the mass (edge) markets. Its technology is also the basis of the world’s fastest supercomputer. Arm is targeting the server market as well.

As the company looks towards “a trillion cores” its management sees other new markets to swallow up including the “internet of things” (IOT) – a classic and massive edge market where their strengths should be obvious. Indeed on its website Arm now styles itself “the foundation for a new IOT economy” – that is for all sorts of…

“…physical objects embedded with sensors processing ability software and other technologies and that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet….ubiquitous computing commodity sensors…machine learning… building automation…the ‘smart home’ including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures thermostats home security systems and cameras and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem such as smartphones and smart speakers… healthcare systems…”

Arm’s licensing program covers almost the entire design side of the semiconductor industry.

“The Arm ecosystem continues to grow with Arm partners signing a record 175 new licenses in calendar year 2020 bringing the total to 1910 licenses and 530 licensees.”

“Companies that have developed chips with cores designed by Arm Holdings include Amazon Apple AppliedMicro Atmel Broadcom Cavium Cypress Semiconductor Freescale Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors) Huawei Intel Maxim Integrated Nvidia NXP Qualcomm Renesas Samsung Electronics ST Microelectronics Texas Instruments and Xilinx.”

This is not the place to go into the specifics of Arm’s technology. Arm’s essential functional advantage for the applications it dominates is the ability to deliver high-performance at low-power:

“While historically Intel has been recognized as the leader in chip making Arm slowly carved into a niche where computing devices no longer needed to be faster but they needed to be more efficient and portable. This is why Arm dominates the mobile processor market with almost every major release built on top of its architecture.”

In short if you want to build a data-center server where power is not the main constraint Intel’s X86 architecture is apparently the best option and Intel still has a 90%+ share. But if the goal is to design a smartphone or a smartwatch or an unwired sensor or other edge product where power consumption is the critical limiting factor Arm is the clear choice – and it has a 90%+ market share.

Value Creation: What is ARM Worth?

Last year Nvidia made an offer to acquire Arm from Softbank for $40 billion in stock and cash which sets us a concrete value-point. (In fact since the offer was made Nvidia’s share price has risen raising the value of the share component of the offer – so the deal today would be worth about $54 billion.)

Arm realized about $2.1 billion in revenue over the last 4 quarters and earned $125 million.

The company’s exaggerated Price/Earnings ratio in the 300-400 range may not be meaningful right now. The Price/Sales ratio is a better value metric here. Arm’s P/S is much higher than the averages for any of the other segments and comparable to the priciest of the Fabless IC companies (Nvidia itself).

Value Drivers

In summary these two ancillary segments – EDA and Core IP – are powerful value-generating engines. The market gives these firms a high premium for their sales earnings and cash flows. In functional terms they enable the chip-design companies to do what they do. In short Core IP and EDA are technologies that supply the recipe and the ingredients for the chip-makers’ secret sauce.

The Bad News For Beijing

As developed in the previous column the relative strength of the Chinese and Western positions in the semiconductor techno-geopolitical rivalry is clear:

China’s position in the high-value segments of Design Fabrication and Manufacturing Equipment segments is negligible.

China’s position in the low-value Packaging segment is modest and does not afford them significant leverage

Now we can add:

China’s position in EDA and Core IP is also negligible – even weaker than in the other segments.

To quote from a January 2021 report by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET):

“China has made progress in some segments but struggles in others. China is strongest in … packaging. It is progressing in design and manufacturing albeit with the help of state support. However China struggles in EDA and core IP.”

Re: EDA

“U.S. firms are the exclusive providers of EDA software with the full-spectrum capabilities needed by engineers at fabless firms and IDMs to design leading-edge chips…Chinese chip designers rely on U.S. EDA tools—especially Synopsys and Cadence—for all chip designs….Chinese EDA firms will be unable to support chip designs at leading-edge nodes nor compete with the top U.S. EDA firms.”

Re: Core IP

“China is weak in core IP development… Chinese chip designers are heavily reliant on non-Chinese core IP. Ninety-five percent of Chinese chips incorporated IP licensed from ARM.For example leading chips used in smartphones are largely based on ARM’s architecture and core IP. Huawei’s subsidiary HiSilicon— China’s top fabless design firm—also relies on ARM’s core IP.”

The concept of national self-sufficiency is irrelevant in semiconductors. China’s aspirations in that regard are illusory.

National leverage on the other hand can be quite real in certain situations. The squeeze applied by the U.S. to Huawei through the denial of access to American semiconductor technology has been effective more than many expected perhaps. No doubt it has been humiliating for Beijing to watch as their premier national tech champion has been taken down several notches.

Right now notwithstanding the alarmism in some quarters in the press the U.S. and its allies hold most of the important cards. The EDA and Core IP segments are two of the winners.

Two people familiar with the decision told The Associated Press that Southern Miss had agreed to leave a conference it helped found in 1995 and join the Sun Belt at a date to be determined.

The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the Sun Belt was not yet prepared to make an announcement and was still working on more expansion moves that it did not want to address publicly.

Sun Belt Commissioner Keith Gill did not immediately return a message left by AP.

The Southern Miss news comes a day after the American Athletic Conference announced the additions of six C-USA schools -- Alabama-Birgmingham Charlotte Rice Florida Atlantic North Texas and Texas-San Antonio -- also at a date to be determined.

Conference USA is down to seven schools committed to the league long-term -- Western Kentucky Middle Tennessee Old Dominion Florida International Marshall Louisiana Tech and UTEP -- and that could be dwindling as the Sun Belt continues to grow.

C-USA Commissioner Judy MacLeod released a statement Friday that did not mention Southern Miss' departure but said the conference had a ""strong core to build around.""

""There are several institutions interested in joining Conference USA both across FBS and FCS some of whom we've already met with in person"" MacLeod said. ""Every step we take will be deliberate strategically sound and intentional. We will take the necessary time to add future members that will be the best fit from an athletic and academic standpoint and allow prospective institutions time to complete their process.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL25ld3MvMTMwNzAzMC9pbnNpZGUtdGFyZWstZWwtbW91c3NhLWFuZC1oZWF0aGVyLXJhZS15b3VuZ3MtbGF2aXNoLXdlZGRpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Tarek El Moussa and Heather Rae Young's Lavish Wedding,"Watch : Tarek El Moussa & Heather Rae Young Are Married

Tarek El Moussa and Heather Rae Young's wedding was certainly a lavish affair to remember.

The Flip or Flop star married the Selling Sunset cast member on Saturday Oct. 23 more than a year after getting engaged and amid a more than two-year relationship. Tarek 40 and Heather 34 tied the knot under a triple floral arch in a gorgeous outdoor ceremony at a hotel near Santa Barbara in front of family including his children Taylor 11 and Brayden 6 and friends.

""MR. & MRS. EL MOUSSA!!!"" Heather wrote on Instagram. ""I married the love of my life today. My sweet man my everything. Cheers to forever and then some.""

Tarek wrote on his own page ""WE'RE MARRIED!!!! Flipped her name for good.""

The bride wore a fitted corset dress with French lace long sleeves and a keyhole back custom-made by Israeli designer Galia Lahav for both the ceremony and reception People magazine reported adding that the groom sported a black velvet tux with a skull-and-crossbone-print lining.

The equally elegant reception had an Old Hollywood theme and was held indoors. Tarek and Heather danced their first dance to country music group Old Dominion's ""One Man Band."""

GUANGZHOU China — China's technology giants have been pushing to develop their own semiconductors or chips a move seen as progress toward China's goal to become self-reliant in the critical technology. In reality China is still a long way off even if it's one step closer to self-sufficiency according to one expert adding that the country is still heavily dependent on foreign technology and lagging in the so-called leading edge part of the chip market. Semiconductors are key components in everything from smartphones to modern refrigerators to cars. They've also become a key focus of the broader technology battle between the U.S. and China. The world's second-largest economy has for years invested heavily into boosting its domestic chip industry but it has struggled to catch up with rivals in the U.S. and other parts of Asia. Increasingly semiconductors are seen as key to national security for many countries and a sign of technological prowess. There's been a slew of announcements from major Chinese technology companies this year regarding chips made in China. In August Baidu launched Kunlun 2 its second-generation artificial intelligence chip. This week Alibaba released a chip designed for servers and cloud computing. Smartphone maker Oppo is also developing its own high-end processors for its handsets the Nikkei reported on Wednesday.

This is a step in becoming more self-sufficient in semiconductors but a small one. Peter Hanbury partner Bain & Company

While these companies are designing their own chips they might still have to rely on foreign tools to do so. But when it comes to manufacturing and the broader supply chain China's internet giants are still heavily dependent on foreign companies. ""This is a step in becoming more self-sufficient in semiconductors but a small one"" Peter Hanbury a partner at Bain & Company told CNBC by email. ""Specifically these are examples of locally designed chips but a lot of the IP [intellectual property] manufacturing equipment and materials are still sourced internationally."" The reason these companies are designing their own chips is because they can create semiconductors for specific applications so as to differentiate from their competitors.

Foreign-dominated supply chain

A closer look at the specifics of the silicon being designed shows China's reliance on foreign companies. Take Alibaba's new Yitian 710 chip. That is based on architecture from British semiconductor firm Arm. It will also be built upon the so-called 5-nanometer process the most advanced chip technology at the moment. Baidu's Kunlun 2 chip is based on the 7-nanometer process. Oppo meanwhile is reportedly working on a 3-nanometer chip.

This is where the challenge lies for China. The country does not have a company capable of manufacturing these leading edge semiconductors at these sizes. They will have to rely on just three companies — Intel from the U.S. TSMC from Taiwan and Samsung in South Korea. China's largest chip manufacturer SMIC is still years behind its companies in terms of manufacturing technology. But it's not just manufacturing. Even companies like TSMC and Intel rely on equipment and tools for the manufacturing process from other companies. In that area power is concentrated in the hands of a few: ASML  a company from the Netherlands is the only company in the world capable of making a machine that chip manufacturers need to make the most advanced chips. ""The semiconductor ecosystem is large and complex so building self-sufficiency is very difficult across such a broad range of technologies and capabilities"" Hanbury said. ""In general the most challenging area to build self-sufficiency will be the leading edge. Here the challenge is you need both investment dollars but you also need to overcome the massive requirements around technical expertise and accumulated experience.""

Geopolitical vulnerabilities

The reliance on foreign companies leaves Chinese firms vulnerable to any geopolitical tensions — as was the case with both Huawei and SMIC. Huawei designed its own smartphone processors called Kirin. The chips were usually based on the latest technology and helped the Chinese smartphone giant become one of the biggest smartphone players in the world. However the U.S. put Huawei on a trade blacklist called the Entity List in 2019 which cut off the Chinese company from certain U.S. technology. Last year Washington introduced a rule which requires foreign manufacturers using American chipmaking equipment to get a license before they're able to sell semiconductors to Huawei.

Huawei's chips were manufactured by TSMC. But when the U.S. rule was introduced TSMC could no longer make semiconductors for Huawei. That crippled its smartphone business globally. SMIC is also on the U.S. blacklist which restricts its access to American technology. These sanctions could be a concern for Chinese companies now developing their own chips. ""For example if there was an effort to block the shipment of smart phone processors then Oppo for example would have a domestically designed source of chips"" Hanbury said. ""However most of these chips are still manufactured using international technology so they could still lose access to their chips if the manufacturing partner for these chips were blocked from manufacturing.""

Supply chain concerns

Governments around the world now see semiconductors as extremely strategic and important technology. U.S. President Joe Biden has called for a $50 billion investment in semiconductor manufacturing and research and has looked for chipmakers to invest in the country. In March Intel announced plans to spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories called fabs in the U.S. ""This is about out-competing China"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told CNBC in March.

Washington has looked to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. seeing it as key for national security given the supply chain is very concentrated in Asia. But like-minded nations are also trying to work together to ensure their semiconductor supply chains are secure. Leaders of the the United States India Japan and Australia a group known as the Quad announced plans in September to establish a semiconductor supply chain initiative aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and securing access to semiconductors and their vital components.

A lot of the recent discussion on semiconductor supply chains was sparked by a global chip shortage that has hit industries from autos to consumer electronics and worried leaders about their countries' ability to secure semiconductors when required.

So where is China now?

China may be ahead of its peers in some areas of chip development but it will find difficulty catching up with cutting-edge technology at least in the short term. For example SMIC can manufacture 28-nanometer chips on a large scale. These could be used in TVs or even autos — an area China could do well in particularly with the current shortage of semiconductors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2ludGVsLWNlby1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNob3J0YWdlLWNvbnRpbnVlLXVudGlsLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel CEO Believes Semiconductor Shortage Will Continue Until 2023 as Share Prices Drop,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2ludGVsLWNlby1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNob3J0YWdlLWNvbnRpbnVlLXVudGlsLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXB0b3BtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2NoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2Utd2hhdC1pdC1tZWFucy13aHktaXRzLWhhcHBlbmluZy1hbmQtd2hlbi10aGluZ3Mtd2lsbC1ob3BlZnVsbHktZ28tYmFjay10by1ub3JtYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chip shortage: What it means why it's happening and when things will (hopefully) go back to normal,"Technology relies heavily on semiconductors. These silicon chips power everything from smartphones to microwaves relaying the information needed to do everything from snap photos to reheat last night’s lasagna. Unfortunately these chips are in short supply these days. This has led to massive production slowdowns and price increases that both corporations and consumers are starting to feel.

From Apple and Microsoft to Dell Samsung and Sony no one is immune. Everyone is feeling the effects of the shortage. And with a silicon shortage comes higher prices and reduced availability something Apple reluctantly admitted in a recent sales call.

This isn’t just about smartphones and laptops. Some of the biggest automakers in the world have suspended operations and limited others due to a lack of semiconductors. Television manufacturers have spoken to investors about supply-side shortages that will certainly affect holiday shopping. Even the medical field is feeling the pinch with 80 percent of those surveyed saying they are experiencing the effects of the shortage.

On the consumer side ask anyone looking for a PS5  a console released a year ago how that’s going. Sony says we may see shortages well into 2022.

About the only benefits we’ve seen from the silicon shortage is in the used car market with pre-owned vehicles selling for record profits after manufacturers have failed to keep up with demand for new vehicles.

What Are the Causes of the Shortage

While it’s up for debate what the root cause of the issue is the truth is that it’s most likely a multifaceted problem without a quick solution. Some experts believe the deficit has been years in the making not the pandemic-related problem most are quick to assume.

One of many factors was a ban on the export of semiconductors to major electronics manufacturers like Huawei. The US-imposed ban forced these companies to outsource their chips to other countries many of which simply couldn’t keep up with the demand and started to outsource some of the parts themselves.

Others turned to older technology like the 200mm silicon wafer. Most semiconductors are built these days with 300mm silicon wafer which can handle roughly double the throughput of its thinner sibling. This too is problematic as few factories have the tooling needed to manufacture equipment using the older technology which further exacerbates the slowdown.

Aside from supply-side issues we also have to consider record demand. With pandemic-fueled shutdowns keeping some factories from operating at full capacity and a world full of people locked indoors — and buying more electronics than ever to stay busy — it’s easy to see that this is a difficult problem to overcome.

The COVID-19 Pandemic

While it’s easy to buy into the argument that the semiconductor shortage was years in the making and not based solely on the pandemic it would be disingenuous to say COVID didn’t play a part. With billions of people spending more time inside the devices we rely on for both work and play are becoming an even more integral part of our lives. We’re buying more devices than ever and at a time where manufacturers can’t keep up with demand.

But it’s not just physical devices. Online companies need computing power to run applications and websites. Amazon Google and Microsoft need storage to maintain the backbone of the internet. To provide computing power storage and the technical essentials needed to run online businesses we need… you guessed it more silicon chips.

How Will Semiconductor Shortage Affect Our Lives

Everyone who has the most basic idea of how the economy works knows that prices go up as supply goes down. So an inevitable effect of the shortage is an increase in the price of products reliant on semiconductors. The products most affected are going to be well everything. Everything from online services to your next car purchase is going to be affected. The only real question left is: by how much? We’ll all feel the pain in our wallets but the length of the slowdown is the only real indicator we have in how much it will affect pricing. The faster things return to normal the faster we reap the benefits as consumers.

Automakers for example have ceased or limited operations in some cases citing a lack of semiconductors to power today’s technology-driven cars. Most apply the just-in-time principle to managing suppliers. This leads to fewer slowdowns and less wasted inventory. Without a massive inventory of parts to tide them over stoppages are inevitable.

When the Experts Say it Will End

The consensus here is that there’s no consensus. What most experts agree on however is that the shortage will last into 2022 at least. Bain & Company a global management consulting firm is taking the optimistic route stating that we'll stop feeling most of the squeeze next year.

Gaurav Gupta a vice president at one of the industry's most respected analyst firms Gartner says that the shortage is likely to extend past the second quarter of 2022.

Others though are less optimistic. Some analysts believe we won’t see much relief until 2023 with a handful predicting that this is essentially the new normal; we’ll never go back.

Time will tell who gets it right but what we know now is that matters of the supply chain are complex. Taking raw materials and turning them into semiconductors and later finished consumer goods is a nightmare of interdependencies and short-term solutions require something in the range of six to nine months to implement.

One thing that’s certain is that we’re going to be feeling the effects of this for a while so maybe it’s best to hold on to that iPad for another year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vc2Nyb2xsLmluL2FydGljbGUvMTAwODM5MC9pbnRlcnZpZXctcHJhbmF5LWtvdGFzdGhhbmUtbWFrZXMtdGhlLWNhc2UtZm9yLXRoZS1xdWFkLXRvLXRha2Utb24tY2hpbmEtdmlhLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Jz0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjcm9sbC5pbi9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMDgzOTAvaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXByYW5heS1rb3Rhc3RoYW5lLW1ha2VzLXRoZS1jYXNlLWZvci10aGUtcXVhZC10by10YWtlLW9uLWNoaW5hLXZpYS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9ycw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interview: Pranay Kotasthane makes the case for the Quad to take on China via semiconductors,"Unlike AUKUS the Quad grouping – India the US Australian and Japan – are unlikely to take active military measures to contain China’s rise anytime soon. Instead the four countries have focused on deepening their bonds and taking measures to act as a counterweight to Beijing’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region through things like collaborating on Covid-19 vaccines and efforts to address climate change.

The most recent Quad joint statement however suggested there was one more front on which the grouping will be taking on China. “We are mapping the supply chain of critical technologies and materials including semiconductors and affirm our positive commitment to resilient diverse and secure supply chains of critical technologies” the statement said.

Pranay Kotasthane deputy director of the Takshashila Institution has long advocated for the Quad to collaborate on semiconductors. Earlier this year he wrote a paper making the case for a Quad semiconductor partnership while flagging the big role India could potentially play in the complex global semiconductor supply chain.

That may sound like a dusty wonky policy corner amid the bigger picture concerns of naval hardware and Chinese border aggression. But access to semiconductors has been a major policy focus for a number of countries of late with some even discussing whether China could invade Taiwan in an attempt to gain control of this vital technology that underpins every ‘smart’ product the world over.

I spoke to Kotasthane – whose newsletter and podcast are vital sources of insightful policy discussions – about why he believes semiconductors should be classified as not just critical but ‘metacritical’ technology what makes the Quad the right forum for collaboration on building a more resilient supply chain and why the idea of ‘Atmanirbhar India’ presents the biggest danger to any such plans.

To get an in-depth Q&A like this on Indian politics and policy in your inbox every week sign up here. All of our older Q&As are collected here.

You used to be an engineer and do complex things that I don’t understand. How did you end up in public policy?

It was happenstance. For a long time I had not actually heard of the term public policy even though I was interested. For me policy was synonymous with working in government. The only way to do it was through the UPSC which I tried twice and couldn’t get through.

In between I kept interacting with local government but never substantially. Then I came to know that public policy is actually something that you can study through this course that I took and now teach – a graduate certificate in public policy at the Takshashila Institution. Someone in my company told me about it.

I spent three months there. It opened me to so many avenues that I didn’t even know about. From the term public policy to economics – which was nothing like what I learned in school. It changed the way I thought about many things. And that’s when I did a scholarship with Takshashila while I was working.

Then there was an opening – Takshashila was just starting – and I jumped in.

What did you have in mind when you were studying for the UPSC exam?

These are all follies of the younger self. Back then the one thing that fascinated me was R&AW [India’s foreign intelligence service]. I thought I would get into the IPS and end up in R&AW. So that idea was my starting point.

When I entered public policy I continued to focus on foreign policy and geopolitics in general and even did some work related to intelligence policy reform. But in general public policy has been fascinating just to understand why things work the way they do in India. Why some policies get picked up but some ideas that have been there for a long time don’t. These mechanics also interest me.

How difficult was it to move from engineering to public policy?

The most important thing is family support. Having people who will encourage you that is super important and something we miss out on. For me it was not very difficult to be honest. You do go from a big pay package to a much smaller one. That is a big challenge. But I was prepared for that.

It is one trade-off that you take in return for other things – now people are able to read some of the thoughts I have on public policy I have a public profile. I told myself I have spent seven years in the engineering world. I can try this now and if it doesn’t work after a year people will take me back.

Pranay Kotasthane deputy director Takshashila Institution.

What about in terms of tools and analysis? Was it hard to adjust to that way of thinking?

It is very different from what I was used to earlier. In public policy because it’s an applied discipline you can’t close yourself to any other sources of knowledge. In engineering you will be focussed on a very limited small part. But here the entire world is open.

When I started I had not even read Harry Potter. It was one of my first readings. That was my initiation out of engineering. Reading about economics in a new light reading about philosophy reading about social science that was new.

The second thing was the importance of good writing. Until then you would do very corporate-y writing. Very limited in the scope and the vocabulary. You would use standard phrases. Policy writing is so different compared to that which was a big change for me.

The third big change was just being comfortable with uncertainty and being patient. In engineering the problem is known the solution is known so why can’t it be done? But in public policy you realise that transforming India is a marathon it takes time we all have to help each other out. Solutions don’t just happen because the information is known there are so many other factors which was also a big learning for me.

Was Harry Potter assigned to you in a public policy context?

No no it just used to come up so often in our conversations that I felt completely lost and wondered what they were talking about. So I read it and loved it.

On to semiconductors. Why are they so important? Why is Ben Thompson – whose newsletter is like yours a must-read suggesting that semiconductors alone might be a reason that the US will come to Taiwan’s defence in case of a China attack?

So to go back a bit before semiconductors you had things like vacuum tubes in order to do any automatic calculation. But the special thing about semiconductors which people realised in the 1940s was that you can arrange semiconductor material in a specific way to create something called a transistor. With transistors you had something that was small and you could arrange it to operate as a switch as a logic gate as an amplifier.

In the 1950s the integrated circuit came up. This was many transistors stored in one package. Then came something called Moore’s Law. Now this was just an observation not an actual law. But it started that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit roughly doubles about every 18 months or two years.

The fascinating thing is this statement was made in 1965 and it has largely held over the last 50 plus years. Every two years the number of transistors gets doubled which means the processing capability has been doubling every two years.

This doesn’t happen in any other industry. You don’t expect cars to become 2x better every two years. But you expect that from semiconductors. That’s why the phones we have today have more processing power than the computer onboard Apollo 11 when NASA went to the moon.

Moore’s Law’s observation was made when ICs had 64 transistors. Today an Apple A14 chip has 134 million transistors per millimetre square. That’s the reason we have all the wonders of software and of our computers.

Why has Moore’s Law held? One big reason has been the economics of the semiconductor industry. A unique supply chain that has come up over the last so many decades.

There are several stages in this. The research & development stage is massively capital- and human capital-intensive because you need a bunch of researchers who are doing cutting-edge work. The second stage is design. Designers and engineers come together to figure out the arrangement of transistors and the entire system. This is human capital intensive.

There are two substages of this. You need very specific software to design how 134 million transistors are put together called Electronic Design Automation. Only three US companies hold patents to this they are the dominating companies. Any design company actually buys licences from these and then designs chips. The second substage is the blueprints. A company like ARM’s blueprints are in every smartphone and they own the intellectual property which they license out.

Then there is manufacturing where you actually convert instructions into something physical and create a “silicon wafer” that has all these transistors on it. This is massively capital intensive because these transistors are really just a few atoms apart so an impurity like a human hair or a dust particle will cause a short circuit and you need clean rooms in massive set-ups working at breakneck speed. That takes a huge amount of investment.

For example the latest foundry that TSMC wants to establish in Arizona it will cost reportedly $12 billion which comes to around Rs 80000-90000 crore. That’s the kind of investment needed. And finally there is the outsourced assembly. This is labour-intensive.

Now before one company like Intel used to put money into all these stages with huge costs and uncertainty. In the 1980s something beautiful happened. Companies in Taiwan said you don’t need to do all this. We’ll start contract manufacturing.

Your biggest cost is your capital that goes into manufacturing – don’t worry about that. Whether you’re Apple or AMD or Texas Instruments you give me the design blueprint which needs to be carved out on the semiconductor and we’ll produce the physical product.

This division of labour liberated a lot of design companies from investing in manufacturing. The number of fab-less companies – which don’t have a fabrication unit – really mushroomed. The US dominates a lot of this space but a lot of design moved to countries with no manufacturing facilities like India.

Virtually every major company – eight out of the top 10 – have centres in India and they do a great job of designing. So design moved to lots of places and manufacturing got concentrated in a few places where they could actually do a great job of it. And they made profits because they had made huge capital investments but their order books were always good. Because they didn’t need to depend only on one company.

And then outsourced assembly moved to East Asia because the costs were too high in the US first to Japan and then to South Korea Taiwan and China.

Today it’s a supply chain that is both highly decentralised – because it’s all over – but significantly concentrated because certain portions are only done by some companies or in some countries…

It’s a hyper-global supply chain. Very lean very efficient. But not resilient. Some things are done by only one or two companies and if they have problems we will have repercussions across the world like we are seeing in automobiles.

I call semiconductors a “metacritical technology” not just critical.

First is the geopolitical angle. We are seeing that technology is a big source of power in the information age. Beating other countries in developing technology is itself an important goal. Right now the US feels that China is overtaking them in a lot of spaces. And semiconductors is one space in which China is weak and US is massively strong.

A classic idea of strategy is attack your adversary where you are powerful targeting their weak points. China may be doing really well in things like Artificial Intelligence biotech and in 5G they’re even probably beating the US but in semiconductors they are behind.

When you say China is weak do you mean all elements of the supply chain? Or one bit in particular?

Design is one stage where they are nowhere close to the US. Manufacturing they are probably at par with the US. But Taiwan is the leader. But even for manufacturing you need specialised equipment – which China doesn’t have.

If you want to make an Apple A14 chip only one company in the world has the tech to make a 5 nanometer chip that is ASML in The Netherlands. China doesn’t have access to it. And the US has made it difficult for The Netherlands to supply it to Taiwan’s TSMC if it is being used for China’s Huawei.

Back to why it is metacritical…

There is a lovely line that Willy Shih of Harvard University uses to describe the supply chain as “a transcontinental relay race with hidden hurdles.” Countries can put hurdles in the paths of other countries. That is what is happening now.

So the first geopolitical angle is US-China. The second is the dependence on Taiwan which alone accounts for nearly 73% of the world’s global contract foundry revenue. With China and Taiwan relations worsening there is a fear of “what if China were to attack Taiwan?”

I won’t agree to the statement that China will attack Taiwan because of semiconductors. But if they were to attack Taiwan semiconductor industry uncertainty will hit every single industrialised industry in the world.

The third geopolitical angle is hardware espionage. There have been reports that the Chinese have installed spy chips on certain hardware which were used in US-based companies. Clearly a lot of people aren’t speaking about this but clearly [the US’s] DARPA has created a hardware security programme.

These are driving the geopolitical imperative.

The second aspect is the economic imperative. There is a concentration risk in Taiwan. The equipment and materials are dominated by a few Japanese companies. Forget geopolitics if we have an earthquake – what happens then? The Fukushima earthquake really reorganised auto supply chains. Similarly many are looking at the semiconductor supply chain.

There is also the question of business continuity. Again forget about anything untoward happening. If one company like ASML fails to deliver its orders on time you will have ripple effects across the supply chain.

And finally you can hurt other countries’ economy through this. Not just the semiconductor industry. An automobile company of another country a medical device industry can all be hurt if they can’t access chips.

That’s the economic metacritical element.

All the other critical and emerging technologies rely on semiconductors. If you want better AI you need better chips. Similarly for 5G or for autonomous driving.

Over the last few years because of these reasons the idea of ‘indigenising’ semiconductor supply chains has become popular...

Everyone has begun thinking that semiconductors have a big strategic edge and when you make something “strategic” all countries want to do everything on their own. China has a “Make in China 2025” scheme which targets that by 2025 x percentage of the semiconductors should be produced within China. They’ve put in a huge amount of money so even companies that used to make food are now investing in this. There are local governments in China investing in this.

Not just China. The US EU India Japan have picked up this idea that it needs to be localised and they are throwing money at this.

You however are arguing that localisation is mistaken. You make a case for Quad collaboration on semiconductors instead...

One general point for multilateralism and then we’ll come to the Quad. Like we discussed the wonders of semiconductors have materialised because of this hyperglobal supply chain. The main insight of this is that you need a globalised supply chain you need comparative advantages you need some companies that are excellent at one part and let others fill in the blank.

Imagine if you were to overturn this economic logic and every country wanted to do this on their own. The amount of investment that would be required would be humongous and this will be government investment.

For example US is trying to localise manufacturing. Imagine they are successful. So let’s say they get TSMC there. But after three-four years this technology will become old. From five nanometers you will have moved to two nanometers or smaller. And the investments are not incremental. They are massive new investments to make to change the entire facility.

So governments will have to put in recurring investments every three or four years in the order of billions of dollars. It seems very unlikely that even the US will be able to sustain that. Imagine if the US is able to do this for manufacturing. Remember that is only one part of the system.

For assembly the cost disadvantages will be very high because labour is expensive. Again governments will have to be pumping in money. There are clear cost advantages on this part for countries with lower labour costs.

That’s why I say that even a country like the US cannot hope to localise the entire supply chain. Some bottlenecks will still remain which other countries can do better. That’s why my argument is that multilateralism is a necessity not a choice in this area. In the old world you could localise the entire steel industry. That’s not possible in the new high-tech world.

Coming to the Quad. What I see is that all four of these countries have comparative advantages in specific parts of the supply chain. If they put together their strengths they can become a much more powerful formation.

US is a big design powerhouse. Japan has a clear-cut advantage in materials for semiconductor manufacturing. Australia doesn’t have a great advantage in semiconductors but they have an advantage in the overall electronic supply chain. For example if you are talking about electric meters lithium supply they have very good work on materials which will be important as we think beyond silicon for semiconductors. Finally India is a human capital powerhouse. A lot of US companies and Taiwanese companies do their design in India.

All four countries have some advantages and disadvantages. When they are put together they can be a powerful grouping.

The second big reason is that you don’t really need to do everything on your own. What you actually need is that when you want supply you should be able to get it reliably. You don’t want to be in a position where China is dominating one part of the supply chain where you have no access.

As long as you achieve that goal of resilience you don’t need to achieve indigenisation. I argue that only through multilateralism and not through doing everything on your own can resilience be achieved.

What was preventing companies in these four countries from working together beforehand? Why does this need a Quad government push?

Companies are limited to act across countries because every country perceives this technology as strategic. So there are strict limits on tech transfer. Even if a US company is doing design in India because it is headquartered in the US the US can tell that company “you can’t supply to the Indian consumer”.

There are very strict investment controls tech transfer controls export controls. That limits the amount of collaboration that companies can do on their own. That’s where Quad governments come in. In this bubble they can reduce these restrictions and all four stand to benefit.

What have they announced already so far?

They have recently announced a Quad semiconductor supply chain initiative. Initially they are going to map the entire supply chain and then look at what they can do together to bolster the supply chain security.

For me the big reason to celebrate was – first there is a change in mindset that you need to do things together not on your own. And second is that they chose semiconductors. Because the US has a list of 20 critical and emerging technologies and there was no prioritisation. But this is a meta-critical element they need to focus on and that’s what has been announced.

Let’s see where it goes. This was the first time the word semiconductor has been mentioned by the Quad.

If the US had to work on a grouping focused on this why does India fit into it better than say South Korea or another actual treaty ally?

I wouldn’t say that only the Quad should do this. For example Taiwan will remain important. So maybe after Quad starts you can look at Taiwan South Korea EU can be involved. But at this moment the only formation that is ready to put money and take on China is the Quad. There are other formations but they are all airy-fairy at the moment. They are not firm on what needs to be done with China. Look at the EU. They are still thinking internally.

The Quad has clarity. You want to ensure that China doesn’t become an adversary that dominates the Indo-Pacific. That is very clear though the word China is not mentioned. Given that you have a political alignment which is very clear it easy for you to bring in action.

Otherwise you can stumble. For example the US and EU have been thinking of what to do together on technology. But the EU has problems with how US companies handle data privacy. US has problems with how companies are taxed in the EU. There is a whole gamut of issue which you will start talking about and never conclude.

With the Quad there is clarity. Start with this. And you can obviously expand on that bubble and add more countries.

Ultimately this is not just a government-to-government operation. It involves governments nudging companies to cooperate. What do you make of India’s capacity to manage something like that not just at a bilateral level but at a quadrilateral one?

There are questions of mindset and capacity. On mindset: We can’t think of this as a steel industry that we can indigenise. Foreign policy will play a major role if we want to achieve something in high-tech industry. Right now we don’t see that link. Foreign policy is thought of as something distinct. But you have to use foreign policies to get other countries investing increase tech transfer reduce trade barriers.

That’s how Taiwan got started. It didn’t emerge suddenly. A lot of tech transfer happened from the US. And with this AUKUS deal there is probably a chance that the US is rethinking how it visualises tech transfers in the new era. That’s the opportunity for India to get tech transfer from some of these countries.

The second thing – the massive challenge – is the importance of getting our business environment right. Getting our law enforcement for intellectual property protections right. That spooks a lot of companies. India has been trying to make a manufacturing facility since 2006. This hasn’t worked.

Can we keep our economy open so that these companies keep investing in design? Maybe those companies will be American but if there is expertise in India it will benefit us.

From the Indian government angle I think the start is to not think of 5 nanometers 28 nanometers which is the focus of the world. Can we take a baby step and do things like 65 nanometers specialised analog fab that can go into 5G broadband? Can we start small build the ecosystem before putting a huge amount of government money into a facility where returns are not guaranteed?

That’s where I think there is a change of mindset needed. Thinking of it in an allied fashion. The word allied itself is a no-go in foreign policy circles. But from a high-tech angle I think it is important to think of keeping our economy open.

Do we have the capacity? I don’t think we do. I hope we can build it.

Is there a risk of negotiations on things like this falling prey to a broader Indo-US conflict on tech policy which is going on currently?

More than Indo-US tech conflict I think this idea of Atmanirbhar India can push all these engagements back by many decades. Because if Atmanirbhar is taken to mean that we have to do import substitution then it will lead to things like increasing import duties and that is going to turn away not just the US.

There have been reports saying that Taiwan wants to invest in India on the semiconductor front but the one thing they have flagged is high import duties because all manufacturing equipment has to be imported.

These are the concerns. What we have argued is that you shouldn’t think of Atmanirbhar think of Atmashakti. You want to build strength and power. Whether it comes from US companies investing in India that should be immaterial.

If we go down this path of import substitution no other company will do tech transfer no other company will want to invest. Then we can’t do things on our own. This is not a domain where you can suddenly build things on your own. It requires knowledge and many billions of dollars of investments.

And I would say India has a lot of strengths. We are not just asking for tech transfer. Design requires many thousands of engineers and we have the critical mass. No other country apart from China can compete and we are even better than China on this respect.

On the assembly part of it because it is labour-intensive we have an advantage. Already you would see a lot of final device assembly is happening in India. We can think of going one step lower and think of assembly and testing of chips. We have the cost advantage. We need to play to our strengths.

How would China respond to the Quad actually moving forward on this?

When an adversary wants to respond they might not respond in the same domain. Maybe China will expand the scope where it has the strengths. In this domain I don’t think China controls any important levers where it can stop the combined might of these four countries. But maybe in say 5G they can create their own standards that make it difficult for others to access. There are other domains in the broader realm of tech in which they may choose to retaliate.

Are there misconceptions about this space that you find yourself having to correct all the time?

I have a long list. One is the term “strategic autonomy”. When people think of this they often actually mean “tactical autonomy”. They think of whether with each decision we are giving away more and whether we could have gotten more out of it. That’s not strategic that’s tactical.

Strategic autonomy can be built for India only when India is the power. And if building power requires you to cooperate with others to give more on some issues we should do that. In my view we don’t think of strategic autonomy in the way it means.

The second thing is in foreign policy we ignore opportunity costs. If you ask any question in foreign policy to any analyst they’ll say “yes India should do BIMSTEC India should do engagement in Nepal India should do more in the Indo-Pacific India should do everything.’

But do we have the capacity? Have you looked at prioritisation? Resources are limited. I don’t think in foreign policy spaces they think if you had to prioritise between engagement with the US and engagement with the neighbourhood on particular issues which would you prioritise? I don’t see that happening. Neglecting opportunity costs is common across public policy domains. But I see it acutely in foreign policy.

Yours is one of the only papers that looks in detail at the semiconductor question from the Quad perspective. Do you have a wishlist of data or research that you had access to in this domain to deepen our understanding?

A lot of data in this sector is not available in the public domain. What is the revenue share across many industries? Many parts of the supply chain? You have to pay industry bodies thousands of dollars to get access to this data it’s beyond the means of an ordinary researcher.

Second there are many technical elements to this. So there are great engineers who know the nuts and bolts much better than I would but they wouldn’t appreciate the geopolitics point of view. And there are researchers who wouldn’t appreciate the technical angle. If we are able to bring together the people who are experts in this industry with the foreign policy analysts we can generate excellent recommendations for the path ahead.

I’ll give you an example. A lot of people will say Taiwan became what it is because its government invested billions of dollars. But we haven’t studied in great detail what are the things they did. For example the fabs they made in the 1980s were hugely polluting. So what were the opportunity costs? What trade-offs did they make? How did they manage to overcome the resistance that would have come up? Those studies are not in the public domain.

They started liberalising their import duties right in the 1950s. What were the tech transfers that the US gave to them? Why did they give this to them? The intersection of economics macroeconomics and technology we need a lot more connections to be made.

Recommendations for those interested in reading more on this subject?

Going beyond the specific domain of semiconductor geopolitics I have picked books that are “metacritical” for anyone interested in public policy.

Policy Paradox by Deborah Stone is a favourite book of mine. It has frameworks that apply across many public policy domains.

The Lessons of History by Ariel & Will Durant is packed with insights on a range of issues concerning the State and government.

Factfulness by the Roslings demolishes many widely-held beliefs and provides a better understanding of human progress.

Here's another indicator to pile on top of a mountain of indicators that I have been covering over the past few months all flashing RED . The S&P real terms dividend yield is now LESS than at the dot com bubble peak! In fact one would need to go back to the depths of the early 1980s' inflationary depression to reach such poor returns.

Real terms dividend rate is another harbinger for lower stock prices or at least sustained stagnation. So whilst stocks do tend to be leveraged to inflation however that is only if earnings and dividends are able to keep pace with inflation and as we have seen inflation is surging higher whilst dividend yields are not.

FED Balance Sheet

Not to forget the inflation mega-trend courtesy of rampant central bank money printing to monetize government debt coupled with the fake inflation indices where up until recently the Fed had succeeded in hoodwinking the masses that US inflation was just 1%. Instead at that time I warned it was more like 6%! Now it's more like 10%. Anyway the money printing binge now totals $8.4 trillion up from $4 trillion at the start of 2020.

The bottom line is forget what the bond market is implying because interest rates are manipulated instead the real impact of money printing 'should' be seen in a falling Dollar though every central bank is printing money so it's going to be a bumpy ride. In the meantime if you think there is deflation compare the price of the stuff that you really want against what they were selling for a year ago! That's if you can get what you as illustrated by the tech market which tends to be OUT OF STOCK of GPU's CPUs and MEMORY! A market that is seeing price hikes on a near DAILY basis to typically DOUBLE MSRP! Hence my message for the duration of 2020 to buy your big ticket items now before the price hikes materialise which are now materialising for instance in the UK even the price of 2nd hand cars has gone up in price by typically 18% compared to a year ago! Maybe a good time to get rid of my Land Rover and buy a Tesla?

Of this amount the top 10 wealthiest people in the world account for US$1153 trillion or roughly 88 percent which is impressive when you consider that they represent around 036 percent of billionaires. Below are some of the individuals currently considered the wealthiest as at end of September 2021.

Jeff Bezos

Age: 57

Residence: Seattle

Founder and executive chair: Amazon

Net worth: US$177 billion

Amazon ownership Stake: 11 (US$178 billion)

Other assets: Blue Origin (US$715 billion private assets) The Washington Post (US$250 million private assets) and US$134 billion in cash

In 1994 Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com in a garage in Seattle shortly after he resigned from the hedge fund giant D.E. Shaw. In fact he had originally pitched the idea of an online bookstore to his former boss David E. Shaw who wasn’t interested.

Though Amazon.com originally started out selling books it has since morphed into a one-stop-shop for everything under the sun and is arguably the world’s largest retailer. At any rate it is hard to dispute its self-description as the “Earth’s most customer-centric company”.

Its pattern of constant diversification is evident in some of its unexpected expansions which include acquiring Whole Foods in 2017 and launching its own branded over-the-counter drugs in August 2017

In 2020 Amazon’s share price skyrocketed on the heightened demand for online shopping as lockdowns forced consumers to stay home. On July 5 2021 Bezos stepped down as CEO of the e-commerce giant and transitioned to his new role as its executive chair.

Bezos originally took Amazon public in 1997 and went on to become the first man since Bill Gates in 1999 to achieve a net worth of more than $100 billion. Bezos’ other projects include aerospace company Blue Origin; The Washington Post which he purchased in 2013; and the 10 000-year clock also known as the Long Now. On July 20 2021 Bezos his brother Mark aviation pioneer Wally Funk and Dutch student Oliver Daemen completed Blue Origin’s first successful crewed flight reaching an altitude of just above 62 miles before landing safely.

Elon Musk

Age: 50

Residence: Austin Texas

Co-founder and CEO: Tesla (TSLA)

Net worth: US$151 billion1

Tesla ownership stake: 20 percent (US$125 billion)

Other assets: Space Exploration Technologies (US$298 billion private assets) and The Boring Company (US$101 million private assets)

Elon Musk has had his hands in several different companies over the years. Originally enrolled at Stanford University Musk deferred his attendance to launch Zip2 one of the earliest online navigation services. A portion of the proceeds from this endeavour was then reinvested to create X.com an online payment system that later became PayPal. While both of these systems were eventually sold to other companies Musk has maintained his status as CEO and lead designer of his third project Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) which aims to make space exploration more affordable.

In 2004 Musk became a major funder of Tesla Motors (now Tesla) which led to him being retroactively declared a cofounder and his current position as CEO of the electric vehicle company. In addition to its line of electric automobiles — which include sedans sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and the “Cybertruck” announced in 2019 —Tesla also produces energy storage devices automobile accessories merchandise and through its acquisition of SolarCity in 2016 solar power systems.

In 2020 Tesla’s stock price experienced an astronomical surge having risen 705 percent from the start of the year to mid-December. It joined the S&P 500 that same month the largest company added thus far.

In 2016 Musk founded two more companies Neuralink and The Boring Company with him serving as the CEO of the former. Neuralink is developing brain-machine interface devices to help individuals suffering from paralysis and potentially allow users to mentally interact with their computers and mobile devices. The Boring Company meanwhile develops boring machines for the purpose of drilling tunnels for underground public transportation systems which would mitigate traffic congestion in major cities. It also (briefly) sold a handheld flamethrower.

Warren Buffett

Age: 91

Residence: Omaha Nebraska

Net Worth: $96 billion

Berkshire Hathaway Ownership Stake: 38001 percent ($103 billion total)

Other Assets: Wells Fargo & Co. Equity ($766 million public assets) US Bancorp equity ($502 million public assets) Seritage Growth Properties equity ($38 million public assets) and $110 billion in cash

The most famous living value investor Warren Buffett filed his first tax return in 1944 at age 14 declaring his earnings from his boyhood paper route.56 He first bought shares in a textile company called Berkshire Hathaway in 1962 becoming the majority shareholder by 1965. He expanded the company to insurance and other investments in 1967. Now Berkshire Hathaway is a half-trillion-dollar company with a single share of stock trading at more than $410 000 per share in mid-2021.5758

Widely known as the “Oracle of Omaha” Buffett made the majority of his fortune through purchasing shares in companies with easy-to-understand business operations. While many investors have been piling into tech companies Buffett has opted for a more cautious approach only buying from well-established companies that are easier to understand such as IBM and Apple. He is also a noted Bitcoin skeptic.61 Additionally Buffett has also outright purchased a lengthy list of companies over the years including Dairy Queen Duracell GEICO and Kraft Heinz.

Outside of investing Buffett has directed much of his wealth toward philanthropic endeavors. Between 2006 and 2020 Buffett gave away $41 billion — the majority of which went to either the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation or his children’s charities. Buffett launched the Giving Pledge alongside Bill Gates in 2010.

Larry Ellison

Age: 77

Residence: Lanai Hawaii

Co-founder CTO and Chair: Oracle (ORCL)

Net Worth: $93 billion

Oracle Ownership Stake: 354 percent ($743 billion)

Other Assets: Tesla equity ($111 billion public assets) and $166 billion in cash

After dropping out of the University of Chicago in 1966 Larry Ellison moved to California and worked as a computer programmer for several companies over the years. First in 1973 he was an employee of the electronics company Ampex where he met future partners Ed Oates and Bob Miner. Three years later Ellison joined Precision Instruments serving as the company’s vice president of research and development.

By 1977 Ellison had founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) alongside Oates and Miner which two years later released Oracle the first commercial relational database program to utilise Structured Query Language. The database program proved so popular that SDL would change its name to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1982. Additionally Ellison joined Tesla’s board in Dec.

Oracle is the second-largest software company and provides a wide variety of cloud computing programmes as well as other software such as Java and Linux and the Oracle Exadata computing platform. The business has also grown through the acquisition of several major companies including human resources management systems provider PeopleSoft in 2005 customer relationship management applications provider Siebel in 2006 enterprise infrastructure software provider BEA Systems in 2008 and hardware-and-software developer Sun Microsystems in 2009.70

Ellison has spent millions in luxury real estate over the last decade predominantly in California. Likely his most impressive expenditure Ellison bought nearly the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million building a hydroponic farm and luxury spa there.71 He has also donated millions of dollars to charitable causes over the years particularly to medical research. Most recently in 2016 Ellison gave $200 million to the University of Southern California for a new cancer research center.

Larry Page

Age: 48

Residence: Palo Alto California

Co-founder and Board Member: Alphabet (GOOG)

Net Worth: $91.5 billion1

Alphabet Ownership Stake: 6 percent ($115 billion total)

Other Assets: $13.8 billion in cash73

Like several tech billionaires on this list Larry Page’s claim to fame got its start in a college dorm room. While attending Stanford University in 1995 Page and his friend Sergey Brin came up with the idea of improving data extraction capabilities while accessing the Internet. The duo devised a new type of search engine technology they dubbed “Backrub” named after its ability to analyze “backing links.” From there Page and Brin went on to found Google in 1998 with the former serving as CEO of the company until he stepped down in 2001.7475

Google is one of the largest Internet search engines on the planet accounting for more than 70 percent of global online search requests. In 2006 Google (the company) expanded by purchasing YouTube the biggest platform for user-submitted videos.76 Then 2008 saw the release of the first mobile phone utilizing the Android operating system which was originally developed by Android Inc. prior to Google acquiring the company in 2005. Today Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet a holding company for which Page served as CEO from 2015 to 2019.79

Page is also a founding investor of Planetary Resources a space exploration and asteroid-mining company. Originally established in 2009 the company was acquired by blockchain firm ConsenSys in 2018 amid funding problems. He has also shown an interest in “flying car” companies having invested in both Kitty Hawk and Opener.

Sergey Brin

Age: 48

Residence: Los Altos California

Co-founder and Board Member: Alphabet (GOOG)

Net Worth: $89 billion1

Alphabet Ownership Stake: 5 percent ($110.1 billion total)

Other Assets: $13.9 billion in cash82

What makes Google unique compared to the other companies featured on this list is that its co-founders are relatively close in terms of total wealth. Sergey Brin’s involvement in Google follows a similar path to Page’s. After the duo founded the company in 1998 Brin served as co-president alongside Page until Eric Schmidt took over as CEO in 2001. Similarly after founding Alphabet in 2015 Brin acted as the holding company’s president before stepping down in 2019 when Sundar Pichai took over as CEO.

In addition to being a highly popular search engine Google also offers a suite of online tools and services known as Google Workspace which includes Gmail Google Drive Google Calendar Google Meet Google Chat Google Docs Google Sheets Google Slides and more.85 In addition to software Google also deals in a wide variety of electronic devices including its Pixel smartphones its Pixelbook computers and tablets its Nest smart home devices and its Stadia gaming platform.

Brin spent much of 2019 focusing on X Alphabet’s “moonshot” research laboratory which is responsible for innovative technologies like the Waymo self-driving cars and Google Glass smart glasses. He has also donated millions of dollars toward researching a cure for Parkinson’s and partnered with The Michael J. Fox Foundation to devise new drugs against LRRK2 one of the greatest genetic contributors to the disease.

Mukesh Ambani

Age: 64

Residence: Mumbai India

Chair and Managing Director: Reliance Industries

Net Worth: $84.5 billion1

Reliance Industries Ownership Stake: 42 percent ($86.09 billion total)

Other Assets: Mumbai residential property ($410 million private assets) and $975 million in cash.

Reliance Industries was originally founded as a small textile manufacturer by Dhirubhai Ambani in 1966. In 1979 Dhirubhai’s son Mukesh moved to Palo Alto California to attend Stanford Business School. A year later Mukesh returned home at the behest of his father to oversee the construction of a new polyester mill during which time he also joined Reliance Industries’ board. Rather than moving back to the U.S. to finish his university program Mukesh remained in India to lead Reliance’s backward integration initiative. During the 1990s he spearheaded the company’s efforts to create—as well as acquire—multiple petrochemical plants and petroleum refineries.

In 2002 Dhirubhai suffered a stroke and passed away. The lack of a will resulted in a feud between Mukesh and his brother Anil over how their father’s empire would be distributed. Three years later as the result of a settlement brokered by their mother the siblings agreed to split the business with Mukesh retaining control over refining petrochemicals oil and gas and textile operations.91 This didn’t completely ease the tension between the two brothers as they would neither settle a legal dispute over sharing natural gas nor dissolve their non-compete agreements until 2010.

In 2013 Mukesh and Anil seemingly buried the hatchet with the announcement of a $220 million pact to share a fiber-optic network between their two companies.

Reliance Industries has established several highly successful subsidiaries under Mukesh’s leadership including Reliance Retail and telecommunications company Jio. He is also a member of The Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum an elected Foreign Member of the United States National Academy of Engineering a member of the Global Advisory Council of Bank of America and a member of the International Advisory Council of The Brookings Institution."
OTIS,Otis Worldwide,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpZHNidXJnaC5vcmcvdGhpcy1pbm5vdmF0aXZlLXByb2dyYW0taXMtYnJpbmdpbmctdG9tb3Jyb3dzLXRlYWNoZXJzLW9mLWNvbG9yLXRvLXBpdHRzYnVyZ2gtdG9kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This innovative program is bringing tomorrow's teachers of color to Pittsburgh today,"Earlier this month four young women arrived in Pittsburgh for a visit that could shape their future careers—and in the process may also impact the lives of all students in the region.

Educators have known for many years that representation matters: Research has shown that learning from even one Black teacher between grades three and five decreases the likelihood that Black students will drop out of high school and increases the likelihood that these students will attend a four-year college.

But students in Allegheny County often go their entire school career without learning from even one teacher of color. During the 2019-20 school year data examined by the think tank Research for Action showed that 42% of all schools in Allegheny County had zero teachers of color. That’s 112 schools in the Pittsburgh region without a single teacher of color.

These numbers echo the lack of educators of color statewide: In 2019-20 the data shows that half of Pennsylvania’s public schools only employed white teachers.

This problem of course isn’t new: Research for Action found that from the 2013-14 school year through the 2019-20 school year the percent of students of color in Pennsylvania increased from 30.5% to 35.8%. But in that same timeframe the percent of teachers of color in Pennsylvania only increased from 5.4% to 6.0%.

This impacts students of color and it also means that many white students don’t learn from or learn about people of color in their communities.

So while a visit from just four young women—all undergraduates at Howard University studying elementary education—may seem like a small thing it’s the beginning of something meaningful. These “preservice” teachers make up the inaugural cohort of an innovative program called OTIS: Operation Teacher (of Color) Irrigation System which aims to change these problematic numbers.

The program is the brainchild of South Fayette School District’s director of diversity equity and inclusion Dr. Chuck Herring.

He came up with the “irrigation system” concept to convey that the Pittsburgh region doesn’t need one narrow pipeline—especially given all the negative connotations that “pipeline” now carries in the world of education. Instead Herring aims to “flood the region” with talented teachers of color from around the country by introducing them to Pittsburgh while they’re in college.

It all began in Washington D.C. just weeks before the pandemic erupted in early 2020.

Showing Instead of Telling

On Feb. 29 2020 Herring found himself spending Leap Day at the NEMNET career fair for teachers of color. After 25 years as an educator in the Pittsburgh region he was eager to inspire young teachers at this event in the nation’s capital to consider a career in southwestern PA.

Herring is a font of positive energy and a skilled public speaker. His natural enthusiasm should have made it easy to sell the idea of applying for teaching jobs in Pittsburgh. But the students and early-career teachers that he met that day had outdated visions of industrial-era Pittsburgh.

No matter how much he spoke about Pittsburgh’s “eds and meds” evolution Herring remembers “I couldn’t get anyone to understand what we have here in Pittsburgh.”

They needed to actually see Pittsburgh and experience it.

“Life is show and tell” Herring says. But if you’re going to inspire someone and convince them to launch their future in a part of the country they’d never considered before you definitely “need more show than tell.”

So even as the pandemic shut down schooling worldwide Herring began mapping out a method for doing the showing.

Introducing Our Ecosystem

More than 18 months later OTIS finally kicked into gear earlier this month. The four preservice teachers arrived on a Thursday and were picked up at Pittsburgh’s airport in a yellow school bus.

They were warmly welcomed at South Fayette’s middle school for meetings with teachers and administrators and even cheered on the school’s football team that Friday night. But their visit included more than just a sense of what life inside a K-12 school in a Pittsburgh suburb looks like.

These future teachers ventured out into the region’s learning ecosystem visiting the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Urban Education for a sit-down with Dr. T. Elon Dancy the Center’s executive director. They also visited Carlow University where several administrators and professors made time to speak with them including the university’s president Dr. Kathy W. Humphrey.

“Dr. Humphrey is a Black woman” Herring says “and she is just amazing. … You talk to her and she just has this presence. So for these 20-year-olds they have an opportunity to talk to someone who 40 years ago was where they are and now look at where she is. That was really powerful and impactful.”

These kinds of meetings will continue on the group’s next visit likely in the spring of 2022. But life for teachers as for all people is made up of much more than work. So Herring plans to invite church leaders and other Black community members including Black hairstylists to meet with the group during future trips.

“We’ll bring them to people who are of their culture” Herring says so that they can make connections and really envision themselves teaching and living in Pittsburgh.

Assuming funding is available this group of future teachers will continue making regular visits for the next two years. And hopefully more cohorts will be formed to bring more preservice teachers of color to the Pittsburgh region. Howard University generally sends students to international locations for their months of student teaching but one goal is to have OTIS participants do their student teaching in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Herring is the first to acknowledge that the dearth of teachers of color in the Pittsburgh region won’t be shifted through easy solutions or quick fixes.

But attracting new teachers of color to this region—and inspiring these future teachers to tell others what they’ve seen here—is an important step. And small shifts can have a meaningful impact.

“If we had close to 10% teachers of color” Herring. says “it would be more than enough to really start helping all students.”

Jeffrey and Michael Derderian claim that 'sound foam' installed in the West Warwick club was actually 'cheap packing foam' that helped the deadly fire spread burning the building to the ground in just three minutes.

The brothers are speaking out in their first public interview with 48 Hours.

'We wanted the full story to come out not just some of it and that for people who want to come to their own conclusion on what happened that night' Jeffrey Derderian told 48 Hours' Jim Axelrod a three-minute snippet of which was released on Thursday.

'We understand the enormity of what happened. People suffered enormously' Jeffrey told the Boston Globe in a separate interview prior to the premiere of their upcoming 48 Hours segment.

'We don't want sympathy but it never leaves us.'

The scene inside The Station nightclub on February 20 2003 when soundproofing foam ignited due to pyrotechnics killing 100 and injuring 200 more

On February 20 2003 the nightclub was packed for a Great White concert when a pyrotechnical mishap caused a massive fire as trapped patrons scrambled to exit the fully-engulfed venue.

One of the fireworks ignited soundproofing foam on the club's walls and ceiling which then burst into flames before filling the nightclub with toxic smoke as the venue continued to burn.

The brothers insist that they ordered 'sound foam' from American Foam Corporation and didn't want cheap material foam on the walls which were installed three years before the deadly blaze.

Along with the 100 dead there were more than 200.

After the fire the company representative who serviced the venue sent an anonymous fax to the attorney general's office and the press which revealed that the company was not honest with their customers about the dangers of the foam.

The two brothers have posted copies of that document on Facebook while adding that prosecutors had withheld it from the grand jury at the time of their sentencing.

The Derderian brothers broke their silence after the recent release of 'Trial By Fire' a book about the tragic incident by investigative reporter Scott James.

James told WBZ-TV there were still so many questions about that night that remain due to the fact there was no trial following the fire.

The brothers instead opted to for a plea deal and were sentenced for 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter in 2006.

Michael was sentenced to four years in a minimum security prison while his brother Jeffrey was sentenced to three years of probation and 500 hours of community service. Civil lawsuits from 65 defendants were settled out of court for a total of $176 million according to the Globe.

Daniel Biechele the tour manager who lit the pyrotechnics served 16-months of a four-year sentence.

James said that even the legal capacity of the venue which was believed to have been exceeded the night of the fatal fire is still a mystery to this day.

'It was believed the legal capacity of the nightclub was 300 people and that was reported for weeks' James said.

'But it wasn't 300. It was more than 400 and there is a question about whether or not they really exceeded the legal capacity.'

The brothers insist the club was not over capacity on the night of the blaze and remain adamant that they never allowed the band to use pyrotechnics in the first.

James added that although the two brothers remained silent for so many years Jeffrey in particular has always wanted to talk about the fire according to CBS Boston.

'He said to me repeatedly that he always wanted to talk because he always felt that the people who didn’t talk when he was a reporter he always concluded well they must be hiding something they must be guilty' James said.

'So he wanted to talk.'

The story of the Derderians took an emotional turn during sentencing over 15 years ago when James said the brothers were forced to determine which of the two would take the prison sentence.

'The twist of the story that had not been reported was that they allowed one of them to stay free and one of them could go to prison' James said.

'And the way the deal worked the state said they could decide amongst themselves which of the two brothers would be the one to serve. And so there's a scene in the book where we see them in a Dunkin' Donuts where they're having this discussion about who’s going to be the one better suited for prison. And they decide that Michael is.'

Derderians said they are not looking for sympathy after breaking the nearly two decades of silence.

'It's not a redemption tour. It's about the truth' Michael said. '

'It's the right thing to do and it needs to be done ... to make sure the people who are entitled to hear the truth get the truth.'

For months a team of security experts raced to help victims of a high-profile ransomware group quietly recover their data without paying their digital assailants a dime.

It started in late summer after the cybercriminals behind the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack known as DarkSide emerged under a new name BlackMatter. Soon after the cybercriminals made a glaring mistake that most likely cost them tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars.

Ransomware criminals encrypt a victim’s data and demand a ransom payment sometimes millions of dollars to return access.

Minderoo Pictures will work with creative teams globally to develop produce and assist ambitious screen projects that inspire change with an initial commitment of $10 million.

The first four projects in development will span themes of ocean conservation plastics and human health and early childhood development in Indigenous communities including a feature film collaboration between Academy Award winner Louie Psihoyos (The Cove The Game Changers) and Josh Murphy (Artifishal) Blueback helmed by Robert Connolly (The Dry) Honey Ant Dreamers directed by Michael Cordell (Year of the Dogs Bondi Rescue) and Emily-Anyupa Butcher and First Born produced by Workshop TV.

Psihoyos said: “Film is a powerful force for creating social change. We are excited to partner with Minderoo Pictures to create films that can change the world.”

Richard Harris who has more than 20 years’ experience in the film industry having held leadership roles at Screen Australia and the South Australian Film Corporation is appointed executive producer.

Minderoo Foundation Chairman Andrew Forrest said: “Our initiatives are tackling some of the most significant global challenges from plastic pollution to modern slavery and cancer research.

“Lasting change doesn’t just happen by itself. To have real impact we must motivate people companies and governments to act to reassess their behaviours or start a movement. This is what we hope to achieve through Minderoo Pictures.”

Minderoo Foundation Co-chair Nicola Forrest said: “The arts enrich our lives and nourish our souls and they can also be a powerful communication tool.

“Long form storytelling through film speaks to us in a unique way. It has the capacity to cut through it can create movements for change and even trigger cultural shifts. Minderoo Pictures is seeking projects that will reach new audiences and inspire them to work towards a better fairer world.”

Executive Producer Richard Harris added: “Minderoo Pictures is an exciting new player in the global impact film space at a time when there is a burgeoning demand for films with something to say.”

“Minderoo Pictures will be a strategic and active collaborator seeking the best films the best teams and the best ways to invest across the film value chain from development through to production and release. At its heart Minderoo Foundation believes in the transformative power of the arts to change the world. Minderoo Pictures will work to cut through and inspire global change.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhZ2xpdHouY29tL2lsYXlhcmFqYS1nb2xkLXJpbmctZ2lmdC10by1zbmVoYW4ta2FubmlrYS10YW1pbC1uZXdzLTI5OTA5NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snehan-Kannika meet Ilayaraja - Check the amazing gift he gave - Tamil News,"Popular songwriter and poet Snehan got married to actress Kannika Ravi a few months back officiated by Kamal Haasan.

The Thunder’s home opener against the Philadelphia 76ers begins a three-game home stand that includes clashes with the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers the last two Western Conference teams to win the NBA title. It will be a challenging and rewarding experience on the floor for Thunder players this week but the moments will be even richer because they’ll be competing in front of the people they represent each night – Oklahomans.

“It's going to mean so much to have fans back in the building” said point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. “The energy they bring night-in night-out it's gonna be electrifying. It's gonna give us a boost as a team. I'm super excited for it. Fans have a huge impact on the game especially in Oklahoma City.”

On Media Day back in late September forward Darius Bazley gazed up into the highest rows of Loud City scanned across the club level boxes and down to the seats across from the Thunder’s bench in the 100-level. He soaked in the recognition that within a month those seats would be populated by thousands of loyal Thunder fans who swell with pride every time they see “Oklahoma City” stitched across the team’s jerseys.

With that emotion filling them up Thunder fans are notorious for swinging momentum in games be it buoying their guys during a tough stretch or giving the team an extra gear during a crucial run. With their understanding of the game recognition of the small moments of hustle plays and willingness to lose their voices Thunder fans have earned their reputation as some of the very best in the league.

“To have fans back it means everything” said Bazley. “As a group last year we tried to do the best that we could bringing our own energy but there's nothing like having fans in there to rally behind you.”

“Fans can have a huge impact on the game” added veteran forward Mike Muscala. “When you're going on runs when you need that extra boost the energy to get a stop or to turn things around.”

The Thunder has five rookies on the roster along with a pair of second year players in Aleksej Pokuševski and Théo Maledon all of whom have never played in front of a Thunder crowd. Like all players who join the Thunder this year’s rookie class visited the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum this summer getting the chance to understand the depth of the community connection in town. With a knowledge of some major aspects of the city’s history Thunder players are better able to internalize their responsibility to uphold the Oklahoma Standard of work ethic and resilience.

“I've heard so much about it – how good the crowd is and how supportive the fan base is” said rookie forward Josh Giddey. “I've seen it on TV and on video so I'm looking forward to being involved in that myself.”

On the other end of the spectrum 12th year forward Derrick Favors who played 9 and a half seasons for the Northwest Division rival Utah Jazz may still have the din of Oklahoma City’s fans rattling around his head from past road trips to face the Thunder. Needless to say he’s looking forward to having all that crowd noise serve as wind in his sails as opposed to trying to slow him up.

“They're loud” chuckled Favors. “They're into the game the whole game. They stand before you score the first point.”

“Sometimes during the season obviously we get tired” Favors added. “Sometimes mentally physically you're just tired you're really not feeling it that day. But when you play in an arena where you have fans cheering for you gives you that extra juice.”

As Bazley mentioned over the last 20 months Thunder players have been training themselves to ratchet up their own energy in the absence of the spirit the fans provided for over a dozen years of games in Oklahoma City. The team will continue doing that – providing the crowd with as much energy as it is receiving.

Perhaps the man who is most naturally gifted at being a self-activated defibrillator is Luguentz Dort. When the third-year wrecking ball and his teammates rush out on the floor on Sunday night showered with cheers from courtside to the rafters there will be a blissful feeling of togetherness in the building.

“It feels amazing just the fact that we haven't seen everyone in so long” said Dort. “It's just so fun to play in front of the Oklahoma City fans and for the community to be able to come back and watch us play.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5va2xhaG9tYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzEwLzIzL3RodW5kZXItZmFucy1yZXR1cm4tdG8tcGF5Y29tLWNlbnRlci1mb3ItZmlyc3QtbmJhLXJlZ3VsYXItc2Vhc29uLWdhbWUvNjE0MTI0OTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Definitely give us that spark': Thunder fans return to Paycom Center for first time in 600 days,"Exactly 600 days have passed since fans attended a regular-season Thunder home game. A game that was actually played that is.

But that 109-94 loss to the Clippers is a faded memory. What happened eight days later on March 11 2020 will never be forgotten.

A Thunder-Jazz tilt halted seconds before tip-off symbolized the start of the COVID-19 shutdown in America. The NBA like everything else in life was put on hold. The 2019-20 season eventually resumed in the bubble at Disney World.

Last season looked closer to normal in most NBA markets but not in Oklahoma City. The Thunder primarily due to health and safety reasons was the only team in the league to not open its doors to fans.

In the words of Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt: “Well my friends the wait is over.”

Thunder vs. 76ers:Three things to know lineups tip-off info

The Thunder (0-2) will host the 76ers (1-1) at 6 p.m. Sunday.

Loud City will roar again.

“Oh man I’m looking forward to it” forward Kenrich Williams said. “I know the fans are ready to see some basketball.”

It feels like Williams has been a Thunder fan favorite for years yet fans have never been inside the arena to watch him play a regular-season game. The Thunder played two preseason home games in front of small crowds but nothing officially on the books.

Mark Daigneault was an assistant coach to Billy Donovan the last time fans were in the seats. Of the 17 players on the roster only five — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Luguentz Dort Darius Bazley Mike Muscala and Isaiah Roby — have ever played in front of the home fans.

“Our new boys in blue may look different” Holt said in a video he posted Friday. “We may need to make some introductions but we’ve been here before. Those who are once unfamiliar become part of our city’s fabric pretty fast.

“Shai Dort Poku Giddey Baze all the rest these are our guys. They are our Thunder and they are back.”

Holt’s video had the feel of a locker-room speech only he was addressing fans and not players. Needless to say the mayor was fired up.

“I think having fans back will definitely give us that spark” Williams said “that energy that we need.”

This season will test the loyalty of Thunder fans — who are known as some of the best in the NBA but who are also used to cheering for a winner.

There have only been two losing seasons in Oklahoma City. The first after relocating from Seattle in 2008-09 and last season. The Thunder qualified for the playoffs 10 times in the 11 seasons in between with four trips to the conference finals.

Ticket demand of past seasons is certainly not there though COVID is still a factor. There’s no capacity limit at Paycom Center but fans must either be vaccinated or have a negative test taken within 72 hours of tipoff. That policy alone has turned some off.

Tickets for the home opener can be had for as little as $4 on the secondary market. That being said concerns about the team relocating are baseless. The Thunder made money last season without fans in the seats and they’ll be profitable again this season.

Just look at its salary sheet. After spending years in the luxury tax the Thunder now has the lowest payroll in the NBA. It’s cheaper to field bad teams than good ones regardless of how many people are in the seats. Plus that’s far from the only revenue stream.

Still not everyone is interested in watching the slow growth of a rebuild. There’s just no such thing as a fast rebuild in a small market.

“I think especially when the team got here from what I understand the relationship between the community and the team kind of transcended the outcomes” Daigneault said Friday.

“It was putting a team on the court that Oklahomans can relate to and I think that the qualities of humility and commitment and togetherness and hard work and not expecting anything earning everything you get — those are all traits that I know a lot of people in the state hang their hat on and we can do that every night.

“We represent the organization and we represent the community. We believe if we do that and we do that well the fans will get behind us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9zaXhlcnMvc2l4ZXJzLXRodW5kZXItYW5kcmUtZHJ1bW1vbmQtam9lbC1lbWJpaWQtaW5qdXJ5LXJlcG9ydC0yMDIxMTAyMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andre Drummond listed as doubtful Joel Embiid questionable for Sunday's tilt at OKC Thunder,"Sixers reserve center Andre Drummond is doubtful for Sunday's game with sprained right ankle.

Power forward Georges Niang or second-year power forward/center Paul Reed could be options to start if Embiid and Drummond are unavailable to play. Niang and Drummond were signed this offseason to provide front-court depth.

Shake Milton (right ankle) Ben Simmons (personal reasons) and Grant Riller (left knee) will remain sidelined for the Sixers (1-1). The Thunder (0-2) have lost their two games by an average of 27 points.

PayPal did not respond to multiple requests by Reuters for comment on the accusations and demands for Palestinian access to its services part of a campaign launched this month by Palestinian digital rights group 7amleh.

Local entrepreneurs say they have lost opportunities after foreign clients learned they could not use PayPal to receive money transfers a service the payments giant offers to Israeli bank account holders including settlers in the West Bank.

""With PayPal not operating in Palestine it's like another checkpoint that's stopping us from moving"" website designer Rafiq Hamawi said referring to Israeli checkpoints in West Bank territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

Hamawi said he lost a website design contract after a potential client in Australia asked to pay him using PayPal. ""Not all means of cutting people off from the world are physical"" he said.

While Palestinians can use other means to receive money from abroad - Apple Pay is available locally and Palestinian banks are part of SWIFT the global system for cross-border payments - PayPal is the world's leader in e-commerce payment processing according to the 7amleh group.

""Without the international brand recognition and versatility of PayPal Palestinians are still lacking the necessary access to financial markets to improve their economic situation"" it said in a report.

""It remains unclear as to why PayPal is reluctant to offer its services to Palestinians with bank accounts in the West Bank and Gaza as this could be a clear way for PayPal to support economic development and equality in Palestine.""

'Helping Hand'

Credit card companies like Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc  as well as money transfer firms like Western Union  have operated for years in the West Bank and Gaza where the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) exercises oversight.

The PMA is part of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank while the Islamist Hamas movement rules the besieged Gaza Strip.

The PMA has said it is taking steps to thwart fraud and money laundering in online payments. These include implementing recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force a global financial crimes watchdog.

In a statement to Reuters a PMA spokesperson hinted that PayPal's services could be made available to Palestinians in the near future.

""We trust that the coming few weeks will carry new news with regard to PayPal services in Palestine as a result of our collaboration with international interested parties.""

With unemployment hovering around 17% in the West Bank and 48% in Gaza many Palestinians have turned to freelancing online or launching local digital ventures to get by.

The founders of one such company online marketplace ""sook.ps"" say they have had to rely on risky cash-on-delivery payments because local electronic payment alternatives like the Ramallah-based service PalPay were too costly.

""We prepare and dispatch the parcel and unfortunately the customer can send it right back because they haven't paid for it in the first place"" one of the founders Samah Ayyad 24 told Reuters.

""PayPal was a small company which grew because the sky was the limit. We could also grow and become the number one online market in Palestine if they gave us a helping hand.""

PayPal a popular online payment processor will be launched in Bangladesh in December this year said Salman F Rahman the prime minister’s adviser for private industry and investment.

“Paypal a payment gateway used in the gig economy and make online buying easy is planned to be launched in December this year” he said while visiting the Walton factory at Chandra in Gazipur on Saturday. Allowing the operation of PayPal in the country was a long time demand of more than 650000 freelance professionals working in international marketplaces such as freelancer.com and upwork.com.

Authorities concerned said the sector to be worth nearly $1 billion in Bangladesh.

They dubbed the gateway as an easy transaction system and said its absence made purchases and directly working for the clients on online marketplaces complicated. Freelancers say it is vital to work directly for the clients as the marketplace takes a good share from their payments.

They find the available payment systems not safe and hassle-free as PayPal.

PayPal’s transaction fee is around 3 per cent.

“If Paypal starts to offer its services in Bangladesh it will help our freelancing community immensely. Freelancers can easily accept payment from direct clients and can also use Paypal as a payment gateway in their personal websites to sell digital products and services.

To mark Nutrition Month and World Food Day series of sessions were organized featuring over +250 corporates and +150 colleges across the country. In addition a special panel discussion in collaboration with CII on ‘Be The Real Fit’ was organized featuring Manoj Sarkar leading badminton athlete and Arjun Awardee.

Other eminent panelists included Vinita Bali Chairperson CII National Committee on Nutrition Inoshi Sharma Executive Director FSSAI Dr. Jagmeet Madan National President Indian Diabetic Association and Consulting Nutritionist Priya Prakash Founder and CEO HealthSetGo and Pavitra Singh CHRO PepsiCo India. The panelists spoke about pandemic impacting dietary and lifestyle habits of people and demystified what being real fit is. The panelists also spoke on the importance of incorporating wholegrains protein-rich food locally available fresh fruits and vegetables to improve the nutritional quality of daily diet.

A nutrition series on “Be The Real Fit” was launched to create awareness around healthy eating and active lifestyle and to explain their linkages with health. Special sessions were conducted to address the growing concern on weight management immunity and to build awareness on importance of wholesome breakfast & timely meals. In addition free expert dietician consultation service will be extended as part of this programe where people can get 1:1 diet guidance from dieticians. These initiatives are in line with PepsiCo India’s commitment towards creating awareness about safe food healthy and sustainable diets.

Speaking about the program Ms. Vinita Bali Chairperson CII National Committee on Nutrition said “this pandemic has made people realise the value of health and the need to treat it as a priority. More people are reaching out for information on nutrition and health and hence the importance of the “right information” has become even more imperative. Nutrition communication is a very important part of the solution framework. Leveraging credible sources and platforms to provide authentic information including guidance on nutrition assessment identification of nutritional risks both symptomatic and asymptomatic has never been more important. CII continues to play the role of Convener for this dialogue and action"".

Ms Inoshi Sharma Executive Director FSSAI emphasised on the three broad pillars i.e. Safe Healthy and Sustainable food which can easily be adapted in any setting as an effective and core strategy to eradicate not only malnutrition but also risings NCDs and food-borne illnesses. She also spoke about key initiatives and framework being provided by FSSAI including Eat Right Campus programs focused on youth consumers and industry collaboration opportunities to collectively address the nutrition agenda.

Arjuna Awardee and Bronze Medallist Tokyo 2020 Paralympics- Mr. Manoj Sarkar emphasized on the importance of balanced nutrient-dense and timely meals and its effective utilization to keep the body balanced both physically and mentally based on the tailored nutrient requirements we have. As a key takeaway he urges all the youth and budding sports enthusiasts to follow a healthy diet regime with physical activity to achieve sustainable health goals and not to go by experimenting short-cuts for quick results.

On the sidelines of the panel discussion Pavitra Singh  CHRO PepsiCo India said “Covid-19 has forced us to re-evaluate the ways in which we live work learn and consume information. The pandemic brought more attention and focus to the importance of health and wellness. A recent study by Euromonitor and Quaker highlighted 44% of urban millennials skipped breakfast and delayed meals due to increased household chores and late start to the day and over 60 percent were driven towards healthy immune system. As an organization we understand these nuances and the importance of giving employee ‘me’ time that helps them to balance both their personal and work life. Under our Pepfit initiative we ensured guidelines are in place to help set work boundaries ensured breaks in between meetings and defined ‘no-meeting’ time zones to enable personal time.

As per a recent survey by London-based market research major Euromonitor International and PepsiCo India through its brand Quaker 44% of urban millennials skipped breakfast and delayed meals due to increased household chores and a late start to the day and 64% of urban millennials were driven towards a healthy immune system. The survey also stated that 71% of urban millennials leaned towards the popularity of fad diets including keto intermittent fasting and weekly detox plan among others to maintain weight. The study further pointed out that increased consumption of fruits vegetables and whole grains including oats emerged as the key trend during COVID-19.

Key Highlights Sunlight may cause the plastic chunks to emit greenhouse gases. Climate change and marine plastic pollution are intertwined and so we need joint solutions to save humankind.

New Delhi: Earth is facing enormous challenges due to anthropogenic activities. Plastic pollution flowing into oceans and other water bodies on our blue planet has increased rapidly in recent years and is expected to become more than twice worse by 2030 a United Nations Environment Programme report has revealed this week. The disclosure of this human-generated degradation has highlighted the need for a big cut down on unnecessary and avoidable plastic.

Human beings do not exist in a terrestrial bubble. Marine plastic pollution presents grievous threats to human health and the global economy. Apart from this problematic plastics rapidly cascading down into water bodies is increasingly pushing us closer to an abyss as it influences climate change - the biggest danger that threatens the existence of human civilisations.

Plastics can change Earth's carbon cycling through their impact on planktons in marine freshwater and terrestrial systems. Marine ecosystems particularly mangroves seagrasses corals and salt marshes perform a crucial role in carbon sequestration. The more harm anthropogenic factors cause to oceans and coastal areas the more difficult it is for these ecological spaces to both counteract and show resilience against the climate crisis.

What is even more disturbing is that plastic fragments have been found on Arctic ice. The melting of ice due to rising temperature will let plastic fragments make their way into water bodies increasing pollution there and therefore perpetuating the cycle of damage. Furthermore sunlight may cause the plastic chunks to emit greenhouse gases resulting in a worrisome feedback loop. With rising temperatures plastic fragments break down into more GHGs such as methane and ethylene accelerating the pace of climate change.

The compounding consequences of the two problems exacerbate the worrisome situation. Both issues are intertwined and so we need joint solutions to save humankind",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1bmphYm5ld3NleHByZXNzLmNvbS9wdW5qYWIvbmV3cy9wdW5qYWItYmVjb21lcy1wcmVmZXJyZWQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1kZXN0aW5hdGlvbi1mb3ItZm9yZWlnbi1wbGF5ZXJzLTE1MTY2NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Punjab becomes preferred investment destination for foreign players,"CHANDIGARH: Having strong ecosystem business friendly policies and excellent factors of production Punjab has become a preferred investment destination for the global firms in last few years.

Several different COVID-19 vaccines are currently available to combat this pandemic some of which include messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines and classic inactivated virus vaccines.

Study: Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinopharm: A Comparative Study on Post-Vaccination Antibody Titers. Image Credit: MR.AUKID PHUMSIRICHAT / Shutterstock.com

Background

All COVID-19 vaccines act by activating the innate and adaptive immune responses. Adaptive immunity involves the activation of B-cells which multiply and increase in response to vaccines to ultimately support the production of antibodies.

Most COVID-19 vaccines are designed to elicit spike protein-specific antibodies as these have been reported to be effective in combating the disease. Further anti‐spike protein receptor-binding domain (anti‐S‐RBD) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels play a role in determining immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The antibody titers elicited by COVID-19 vaccines can be measured using serological diagnostic tests.

In a recent study published in the journal vaccines researchers compare antibody titers elicited by the Pfizer‐BioNTech mRNA vaccine and the classic inactivated virus vaccine Sinopharm in order to identify the most effective vaccine. This study explored both IgM and IgG antibody titers; however the researchers concentrated more on IgG as it has been reported to be the most prevalent antibody in human plasma that plays a role in long-term immunity conferred by vaccinations. The findings from this study may help enhance the existing vaccine therapies for COVID-19.

Study design

The current study was performed on Jordanian adults and was conducted between March and April 2021 as a prospective observational cohort study. The participants consisted of individuals who had received two doses of either Sinopharm or Pfizer‐BioNTech COVID‐19 vaccines with an interval of 21 days. All participants were enrolled in the study six weeks after the second dose.

IgG and IgM levels in human serum or plasma specific for SARS‐CoV‐2 were measured using Vitek Immuno Diagnostic Assay Systems which is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Pfizer‐BioNTech performs better than Sinopharm

The group of participants receiving either Pfizer‐BioNTech or Sinopharm vaccines was compared based on demographic characteristics past medical history and prior COVID-19 infections.

A total of 141 participants received the Pfizer‐BioNTech COVID‐19 vaccine of which 93% exhibited positive IgG titers. Comparatively 147 received the Sinopharm vaccine of which 85.7% showed positive IgG titers.

The mean titer for IgG amongst the Pfizer‐BioNTech vaccine group was 515.5 ± 1143.5 BAU/mL and the Sinopharm vaccine group was 170.0 ± 230.0 BAU/mL. No statistically significant difference was observed in IgG positivity or IgM titers between the two vaccine groups.

Age-related differences were apparent between individuals in the IgG positive and negative groups with 86.4% of those with negative IgG titers aged more than 60 years. Among the subjects who were administered the Sinopharm vaccine 90.5% of those with negative titers were aged more than 60 years whereas 9.5% were between 40-60 years old.

Notably only one subject in the 20-40 year age group showed negative IgG titers amongst the Pfizer-BioNTech group. Further it was observed that 54.5% of subjects who had negative IgG titers had diabetes and 40.9% were suffering from cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases.

IgM titer positive and negative groups of individuals were also compared six weeks after vaccination based on characteristics like age gender body mass index (BMI) smoking habits and positivity for IgG titers. These groups exhibited significant differences in mean IgM and IgG titer values.

Multivariable regression analysis was performed which revealed that Pfizer‐BioNTech vaccine administration had a statistically significant positive effect on IgG titer positivity. Comparatively the presence of cardiovascular diseases had a statistically significant negative effect.

Study limitations

The study had certain limitations. Samples were collected from the study subjects only at a single time point of six weeks post-vaccination which prevented the possibility of exploring antibody or immunity decay.

Though the VIDAS diagnostic test was reported to have a sensitivity of 88.3% and specificity of 98.4% there is a possibility that it may not have accurately estimated the antibody titers. The test reliability may also be compromised due to cross-reactivity between the SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibodies and endemic coronaviruses.

Implications

The present study compared the efficiency of the Pfizer‐BioNTech mRNA vaccine to a classic vaccine Sinopharm. In diagnostic assays the Pfizer BioNTech elicited high IgG titers levels when compared to Sinopharm.

Furthermore the multivariate analysis showed that the Pfizer vaccine had a positive effect on IgG positivity. High antibody IgG titer levels are associated with higher and long-lasting immunity. Taken together the findings from this study show that the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine may provide better protection against COVID-19 when compared to Sinopharm. the presence of cardiovascular diseases was found to have a significant negative correlation with IgG titers levels after vaccination thereby suggesting that this patient population may need special attention.

Further studies are required to confirm if booster doses are needed for individuals who have already received Sinopharm and those with specific conditions who did not exhibit IgG titer positivity after vaccination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8yMy9mZGEtc2NpZW50aXN0cy1zYXktYmVuZWZpdHMtb2YtcGZpemVyLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmUtY2xlYXJseS1vdXR3ZWlnaC10aGUtcmlza3MtZm9yLWNoaWxkcmVuLWFnZXMtNS10by0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FDA scientists say benefits of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine 'clearly outweigh' the risks for children ages 5 to 11,"Scientists at the Food and Drug Administration presented an analysis late Friday showing that the protection offered to children between the ages of 5 and 11 by the Covid vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech “would clearly outweigh” the risk of myocarditis a heart-related side effect that the vaccine appears to cause.

The FDA’s analysis was made public ahead of a Tuesday meeting of outside scientists convened to make a recommendation on authorizing the vaccine for children in that age range. An agenda for the meeting shows sessions dedicated to the vaccine’s effectiveness and to the potential risk of myocarditis an inflammation of the heart. The FDA is not bound by the votes of its advisory committees but it generally follows their advice.

New data from Pfizer were also made public on Friday. They show that the vaccine is about 91% effective in preventing Covid-19 in 5- to 11-year-olds.

“While benefits of vaccination were highly dependent on Covid-19 incidence the overall analysis predicted that the numbers of clinically significant Covid-19-related outcomes prevented would clearly outweigh the numbers of vaccine-associated excess myocarditis cases over a range of assumptions for Covid-19 incidence” agency researchers wrote.

However the researchers noted if the rate of Covid-19 was to fall to levels seen in June 2021 there would be more vaccine-associated myocarditis cases than Covid-19 hospitalizations. But even then the FDA staff said given the more severe nature of Covid-19 hospitalization “the overall benefits of the vaccine may still outweigh the risks under this low-incidence scenario.”

Much of the committee’s discussion is likely to center on the benefits of the vaccine which dramatically reduces the chances a child will become infected with SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes Covid-19 as well as its potential risks. In older boys and young men the vaccine has been linked to myocarditis. It has occurred in somewhere around 1 in 10000 boys and men between the ages of 16 and 19 who received a second dose though estimates of the risk vary.

New data in the briefing documents show that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine not only cuts the risk of infection but also reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 in children who do become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among the 1518 children in the study who received the vaccine there were three cases of symptomatic Covid-19. Among the 750 children who received placebo there were 16 cases of the disease — meaning the vaccine was 90.7% effective. Previously only data about children’s ability to produce antibodies against Covid-19 after vaccination and not its effectiveness at preventing illness were available.

Symptoms among the vaccinated children who developed Covid were very mild. None had fevers. By contrast 10 of the 16 children who were not vaccinated who developed Covid-19 developed fevers and generally had worse symptoms. Common side effects were generally similar to those caused by the adult vaccine and included headaches and fevers. The pediatric shot is 10 micrograms or one-third the adult dosage.

Of the volunteers in the study 52% were male 79% were white 6%% were Black and 6% were Asian American.

Data were also included in an expansion group of 1591 additional children who received the vaccine and another 788 who received placebo although all have not been followed for 2.5 weeks. For these children information is available only about side effects. It appears that the FDA may be willing to make a decision on the vaccine without data from this extension study.

Because children are less likely to experience severe consequences of Covid-19 the panel will likely discuss whether the benefits of protection outweigh the small risk of myocarditis or other side effects. Covid-19 itself can cause myocarditis at a much higher rate than the vaccine.

Too few younger individuals have been treated to have a clear idea of the risk of myocarditis. Researchers still do not fully understand why it occurs. Although some patients with vaccine-induced myocarditis have needed intensive care the FDA said most had their symptoms resolve with “conservative management.”

Because myocarditis occurred only rarely in clinical trials it’s difficult to estimate exactly how often it occurs. In its briefing documents the FDA said that myocarditis and pericarditis a related inflammation of the heart’s lining were reported to the U.S. government’s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) at a rate of 71.5 cases per million in vaccinated males ages 16 to 17 and 42.6 cases per million in males ages 12 to 15. That equates to about one case per 12000 for 16- to 17-year-olds and one case per 24000 for 12-to-15-year-olds.

But the FDA also analyzed a database of claims from Optum part of the insurer UnitedHealth Group. In that database the estimated excess risk of myocarditis and pericarditis approached 200 cases per million in fully vaccinated males aged 16 to 17 and 180 cases per million in vaccinated males aged 12 to 15 years of age. That’s about one case per 5000 vaccinated boys.

The question though is not just what is the risk of myocarditis but whether the benefit of the vaccine outweighs that risk. And the benefit of vaccinating anyone depends on how many cases of Covid-19 are occurring.

The FDA modeled how many hospitalizations would be prevented by vaccinating a million boys in the 5 to 11 age range at six different points in the pandemic. Most of the time the vaccine would prevent 200 to 250 hospitalizations per one million vaccinated boys. But at one point in June 2021 when cases were plummeting nationwide the vaccine would only have prevented only 21 hospitalizations per one million boys.

At any point the number of myocarditis hospitalizations caused by the vaccine would be the same: the FDA estimated it as 98 hospitalizations per million boys vaccinated. So normally even in the highest-risk group the number of Covid-related hospitalizations prevented would be double the number of hospitalizations due to myocarditis. But when the virus is under control the number of myocarditis-related hospitalizations in boys in this age group would be slightly more than Covid-related hospitalizations because Covid-19 cases would be so low.

The FDA argues that even in this case outcomes for those hospitalized with Covid-19 would be worse than those with myocarditis and that it chose to model a high rate of myocarditis meaning the condition may be less common.

In Pfizer’s briefing documents made available ahead of the meeting the company cited data from Israel where its vaccine is the main one in use and data on myocarditis have been closely tracked.

In these data the risk of myocarditis after a second dose in 12- to 15-year-old boys was 1 in 12000 Pfizer said about half that in males aged 16 to 19. That’s based on 12 cases that occurred in 255444 adolescents. Only one of those cases was in a female vaccine recipient.

Pfizer said in its documents that assuming the 90% efficacy figure on the vaccine holds up vaccinating one million 5- to 12-year-old children would prevent 33600 cases and 170 hospitalizations over 120 days. During the same period of time there would be 21 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis.

A draft agenda for Tuesday’s meeting shows that the committee will view presentations on myocarditis and other risks and on the benefits of the vaccine. According to the briefing documents the panel will consider whether based on the totality of scientific evidence the benefits of the two-dose vaccine outweigh its risks for use in children 5-11 years of age.

If the FDA decides to authorize the vaccine its use will then be evaluated by a separate panel convened by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. If that committee also recommends its use and the CDC director agrees the vaccine will be made available.

Correction: A previous version of this story misstated Pfizer’s modeling about the number of hospitalizations the vaccine would prevent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8yMy8yMjc0MTcwMi9jb3ZpZC0xOS1wZml6ZXItdmFjY2luZS15b3VuZy1jaGlsZHJlbi01LXRvLTEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer's clinical data puts the US one step closer to a Covid-19 vaccine for younger kids,"A Food and Drug Administration review this week determined that Pfizer/BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective for children ages 5 to 11 paving the way for a shot to be authorized for that age group as soon as early November.

Pfizer also announced on Friday that the vaccine is more than 90 percent effective at protecting school-age children from serious illness or hospitalization from Covid-19 similar to the level of protection it provides in adults.

The FDA analysis looked at data from Pfizer clinical trials in four different scenarios and concluded that any risks — in particular a vaccine-related pediatric myocarditis that typically lasts a few days — were negligible in comparison to the benefits for the age group.

Previous data from Pfizer showed young children were able to tolerate the vaccine well and produced a strong immune response and the results of Friday’s FDA review are further confirmation of its effectiveness.

The 2268 children ages 5 through 11 in Pfizer’s clinical trials received doses a third the size of an adult vaccine dose spaced 21 days apart.

Now that the initial review is complete there are just a few steps left before Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine can be authorized for the approximately 28 million American children ages 5 through 11.

Next week the FDA’s panel of independent experts will examine the research and make specific recommendations to the FDA about administering the Pfizer vaccine to this age group.

Much as with recommendations about booster shots the advisory committee is able to offer specific granular guidance about the vaccine’s safety and necessity. For example in September after the Biden administration had planned a widespread rollout of vaccine boosters the FDA panel recommended that only certain populations receive an additional shot.

However as Vox’s Dylan Scott points out “the groups already okayed by the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for booster shots are quite broad and cover much of the adult population.”

The FDA panel will meet Tuesday and offer its assessment. The FDA typically follows the advice of its expert panel but its guidance isn’t binding.

If the committee’s advice conforms with the agency’s initial review of the data the FDA will likely authorize the vaccine soon after.

After that Pfizer then must present its data to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP. It’s a similar body to the FDA’s advisory committee — a rotating independent panel of scientists and other experts who can make specific recommendations to the CDC about administering the vaccine. That panel is scheduled to meet November 2 and 3 to discuss pediatric vaccines according to CNN.

Then ultimately it’s up to CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky to guide the CDC’s decision on pediatric Covid-19 vaccines. As with the FDA’s advisory body ACIP’s recommendations aren’t binding but the CDC typically follows them.

Both bodies have to authorize the vaccine; the FDA is first and foremost concerned with the safety of anything submitted for emergency use authorization or full regulatory approval. That means asking not only whether the drug itself is safe but also inspecting manufacturing facilities and practices while the drug in question is licensed. Meanwhile the CDC’s concerns are geared more toward how the drug should be administered and to whom in addition to its safety and efficacy.

As the White House waits for authorization President Joe Biden announced a plan earlier this week to distribute pediatric vaccines in 25000 pediatrician’s and primary care offices as well as in children’s hospitals and school- and community-based clinics. The administration has already purchased enough doses to inoculate all children in this age group; the shots come in reconfigured packaging with smaller needles for smaller arms.

“Kids have different needs than adults and our operational planning is geared to meet those specific needs including by offering vaccinations in settings that parents and kids are familiar with and trust” Jeff Zients the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator told reporters on Wednesday.

The plan aims to avoid the bumpy chaotic rollout adults faced earlier this year as well as to build trust with families who may be hesitant to vaccinate their children by relying heavily on trusted sites like pediatricians’ offices and messaging through schools.

Children aren’t as vulnerable to Covid-19 as adults but they’re still testing positive

The likely authorization of a vaccine for younger stands to make schools a much safer place as Covid-19 continues to spread in the US.

Though children don’t often experience symptoms from Covid-19 as Vox’s German Lopez explained earlier this month the combination of the delta variant and a return to classrooms last month resulted in a sharp rise in pediatric Covid-19 cases relative to earlier in the pandemic.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics almost 6.2 million children have tested positive for Covid-19 since the pandemic began. In just the six weeks prior to October 14 1.1 million children tested positive.

About 280 children under the age of 18 died of Covid-19 between January and September this year according to CDC data.

“In this latest wave of Covid-19 particularly down south there have been thousands of children hospitalized. And frankly it’s an embarrassment in a developed country to have even 100 children like we’ve had die of infectious disease that’s preventable” Dr. Peter Marks director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said at a town hall earlier this month.

Since US school districts have implemented a patchwork quilt of vaccine and mask recommendations — with some states like Texas and Florida ignoring scientific evidence on the efficacy of masking and banning mask and vaccine mandates in school systems — both students and teachers are vulnerable to the illness.

And despite the eagerness of many children teachers and parents to get students back in the classroom high infection rates across the US mean there have been some stops and starts from quarantining exposed students to shutting down whole campuses after an outbreak. Vaccinating school children would help reduce the virus’s spread — not to mention reduce the number of disruptions to the school year.

Despite the upsides some parents say they are still wary of vaccinating their children or will opt not to do so. According to a September study by the Kaiser Family Foundation only about a third of parents surveyed — 34 percent — said they would vaccinate their 5- to 11-year-olds as soon as that age group becomes eligible. Thirty-two percent said they would “wait and see” how well the vaccine works before having their child get the shot and 24 percent said they wouldn’t have their children vaccinated at all.

More vaccines for more children are likely coming soon

The authorization of a Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 would mean that nearly everyone in the US is eligible for a vaccine and drug companies are already making headway on shots for even younger children.

Pfizer which along with BioNTech manufactures the only vaccine authorized for use in children under 18 is also performing clinical trials on children ages 2 to 5 and separate trials for children as young as six months.

Data from those trials is expected before the end of the year according to Pfizer.

Moderna which manufactures the other mRNA vaccine authorized for US adults is also recruiting for its pediatric clinical trials on children ages 6 months to 11 years. The company submitted its clinical trial data on the vaccine’s effectiveness in teenagers ages 12 to 18 in June but the FDA has paused before authorizing it due to a possible elevated risk of myocarditis in young men. Health authorities in Sweden and Denmark have stopped administering Moderna vaccines to people under 18 in those countries due to this possible elevated risk.

With more authorizations on the horizon many parents will likely be relieved to add Covid-19 shots to their kids’ vaccination schedules: As Friday’s FDA review confirmed the vaccine is safe and effective for young children and the Biden administration plans to make it widely available as soon as it’s authorized. And if Covid-19 is something we’ll have to live with as a society as experts increasingly believe then getting one step closer to making the Covid-19 vaccine routine for young kids is good news indeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdG9vbmFtaXJyb3IuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC9wZml6ZXItY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS05MS1lZmZlY3RpdmUtaW4tY2hpbGRyZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer: COVID-19 vaccine 91% effective in children | News Sports Jobs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.altoonamirror.com/news/2021/10/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-91-effective-in-children/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdG9vbmFtaXJyb3IuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC9wZml6ZXItY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS05MS1lZmZlY3RpdmUtaW4tY2hpbGRyZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbmV3czEuY29tL29oL2NvbHVtYnVzL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC8yMS9jb3ZpZDE5LXZhY2NpbmUtZm9yLWNoaWxkcmVuLTUtdG8tMTEtZGlmZmVyZW50LXBlZGlhdHJpYy1mb3JtdWxhdGlvbi1wdXJwbGUtY2Fwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer vaccine formulation for kids to ship with orange caps,"COLUMBUS Ohio — As vaccine providers prepare for an anticipated authorization for kids ages 5 to 11 they are placing orders for the lower-dose pediatric formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which will ship in vials with caps that are orange instead of purple.

What You Need To Know

An ordering process is underway for providers to get the pediatric version of the Pfizer vaccine



Ohio Governor explains why it could be difficult for small providers to offer vaccines the first week



One large primary care practice said it is hoping for 15000 pediatric doses to begin the rollout

When the eligibility age was first lowered in May for children 12-17 getting immunized was just a matter of finding a provider that had the Pfizer vaccine in stock.

If the authorization is expanded again possibly as soon as the first week of November newly eligible children will receive a 10 microgram dose one-third of what is authorized for those 12 and older.

Trials showed the lower dose still generated a strong immune response in kids. Each vial of the pediatric vaccine will contain 10 doses compared to 6 from the adult vaccine.

Because there would not be enough volume for an injection from one-third of an adult dose there is a distribution process getting underway for the pediatric version.

Pediatrician Dr. Bonnie Pugh in Dublin president of Central Ohio Primary Care’s board of directors said their practice asked for 15000 doses of the pediatric vaccine to offer centralized clinics and in-office immunizations to patients of their approximately 100 pediatricians.

“We may not get exactly what we are hoping for. I know that Pfizer has said to us that they will meet the demand — it just may not all be in the first week and so I think we have to be patient like we were with the initial rollout last year when the vaccine came out” Pugh said.

The Ohio Department of Health reported that the state has reserved the entire allocation that it has been offered from the federal government spokesperson Alicia Shoults said Thursday.

“We have placed our initial reservation for the maximum amount Ohio has been allocated from the federal government for the first of three initial ordering waves 138900 doses. We will continue to place orders over the coming days within the maximum amount allocated from the federal government approximately 347000 doses” Shoults said.

Gov. Mike DeWine said that as of Thursday the state has received orders for 172000 doses for the first week of distribution. He explained that providers can still place orders for the first week even if they missed the first of the three ordering periods.

The governor said he expects that many more will place orders beginning the second week because providers can only place orders for 300 doses or more the first week. The minimum will drop to 100 in the second week.

“The federal government did something that we have to live with and they made the decision that for the first week all orders had to be at least 300 doses. That has inhibited some providers particularly pediatricians' offices from ordering for that first week” DeWine told reporters Thursday during an event for the unveiling of a new license plate design.

Larger providers like Central Ohio Primary Care and major hospitals are ordering thousands of doses for the first week so the minimum isn’t a significant consideration.

But for Harrison County one of the least populous counties in the state one 300 dose shipment is likely to cover a large portion of the county’s needs according to the health department.

So far about 160 children in Harrison County aged 12 to 17 have been vaccinated said Garen Rhome the health district administrator. That is less than a third of the demographic but it’s on par with neighboring counties in southeast Ohio he said.

“We’ve got our doses on order and the ancillary supplies come from ODH so we stand ready” he said.

The health department is capable of standing up large clinics for hundreds of residents to get vaccinated in a day — they did it in the winter for adults — but officials don’t expect that to be necessary for an expanded pediatric rollout Rhome said.

Their walk-in clinic at the health department which has capacity for several dozen people per day should be adequate he said. The health department is prepared to offer vaccines during evenings and weekends.

DeWine said his administration believes it’s important for vaccines to be available in every county the first week and he said they are getting close to that goal.

Starting the second week the state intends to begin an operation where workers will divide shipments into more manageable allocations that can be sent to smaller providers DeWine said.

""Following the initial rollout of the pediatric vaccine in future weeks the Ohio Department of Health’s Receipt Store and Stage warehouse will break down shipments into smaller packages for providers needing less vaccine. This will be managed by ODH staff with Ohio National Guard assistance if necessary as the Guard has done throughout the pandemic"" Shoults added.

About 66 pediatricians' offices have ordered doses for the first week and about a fourth of the state’s school districts have indicated a plan to hold at-school clinics the governor said.

In Ohio 55% of all residents and 64.3% of those eligible have received at least one dose according to state data. For the 12-17 age group 42.9% have started the vaccination process.

The state has announced a $2 million vaccine incentive program that will award scholarships to Ohioans 25 and under. There will be 150 $10000 scholarships and five $100000 scholarships with the drawings expected to begin sometime after children 5 and older become eligible for vaccination.

While children’s hospitals aren’t quite as busy with COVID-19 patients as they were last month DeWine said there remains a troubling number of kids who are very sick including some in intensive care units. In rare cases children after contracting COVID-19 develop a post-inflammatory syndrome which can impact the heart lungs kidneys and other organs.

DeWine said the next phase of the vaccine rollout is going to be critical and his administration will be vocal along with health officials to encourage pediatric vaccination.

“In the next week two weeks there’s going to be real emphasis on why it's important to have your children vaccinated so information is the most important thing I think that we can do” he said. “We're going to continue to put the focus on kids.”

Pugh said that in addition to preventing the relatively uncommon cases of severe illness among children expanded vaccine authorization would help reduce illness among those who are more vulnerable.

“We have to remember that kids are really great vectors of disease so despite them not necessarily getting as sick as an adult or an immunocompromised person or an elderly person if you have a grandparent or a baby at home that can't get vaccinated getting our school-aged children vaccinated really does make a difference in preventing spread of disease” she said.

The pediatric vaccines will ship with smaller needles which is typical for child immunizations because kids have smaller arms Pugh said. Even though there will be more logistics to vaccination with the introduction of a pediatric vaccine alongside booster shots including the Moderna half-dose she said health care workers are trained to keep track of it all.

“As with any drug administration vaccines pharmaceuticals there's always a double-check system. There has to be. We have to know exactly what we're giving and we have to double-check our lot numbers” she said. “Things like the different colored cap are helpful because it's a trigger for people and it's a good reminder.”"

Ugochukwu who stands 6-foot-3 is a three-star prospect and the No. 274-ranked player in the 2024 class according to the 247Sports composite rankings. Listed as the No. 43-ranked combo guard he is expected to handle the point guard responsibilities at Miami.

""Divine is great young prospect out of Houston who had a tremendous senior season"" head coach Jim Larranaga said in a statement. ""He is a high-IQ point guard with elite athleticism and a great feel for the game. We are very excited to add a player like Divine to our freshman class.""

He averaged 17.6 points 4.4 rebounds 6.2 assists and 1.8 steals per game as a senior leading the Rangers to a 32-1 season with the only loss in the UIL Class 6A state championship game. He shot 54.6 percent from the field 37.3 percent from 3 and 75 percent from the free-throw line. He scored over 1500 points in his high school career and earned Texas Association of Basketball Coaches Class 6A All-Region III Team honors and was a finalist for the Guy V. Lewis Award given annually to the top player in the Houston area.

He played for Houston Hoops on the Nike EYBL circuit in 2023 averaging 6.6 points 3.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 12 games. He shot 54.7 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from 3.

Ugochukuwu joins Miami's 11th-ranked recruiting class which also includes guards Jalil Bethea and Austin Swartz and forward Isaiah Johnson-Arigu who each signed letters of intent in November and will be one of eight newcomers on the 2024-25 roster after a large turnover following Miami's 15-17 season.

Ugochukwu received an offer from Baylor last month. He also had offers from SMU and Texas A&M among others early in the recruiting process.

Clements also features 2026 shooting guard Aziz Olajuwon son of Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon and recent Marquette commit Joshua Clark.

Miami still has three scholarships remaining for the 2024-25 season.

Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson's rapid ascension has been on full display during an exceptional playoff run this season but is it enough to unseat Steph Curry as the league's best point guard? Draymond Green certainly doesn't believe so.

During an episode of ""The Draymond Green Show"" the Warriors star took questions from fans with one asking if Brunson's elite playoff performances have vaulted him to the top of the NBA's point guard hierarchy to which Green swiftly offered an NSFW response in defense of his future Hall of Fame teammate Curry.

""F--k no. Steph Curry [is] in the NBA are you crazy?"" Green promptly replied. ""What? Come on no. That's ridiculous. Steph Curry is still in the NBA he's still great. Come on. Stop it what?""

.@Money23Green answers a mailbag question about Jalen Brunson being the best PG in the NBA… pic.twitter.com/7370ZwAmyF — The Volume (@TheVolumeSports) May 9 2024

Brunson is averaging an eye-popping 36.5 points per game in eight playoff appearances for the Knicks this season including a streak of four consecutive 40-point games in the postseason. The 27-year-old has been beyond impressive as the leader of a scrappy New York team that currently holds a 2-0 series lead over the Indiana Pacers after dispatching the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

However gaudy Brunson's numbers might be there still is a massive gulf between his career accolades and the lengthy resume Curry has accumulated which includes four NBA titles two league MVP awards nine All-NBA selections and 10 All-Star nods. The 36-year-old also won the 2024 NBA Clutch Player of the Year award this season.

What Brunson and the Knicks are doing during the 2023-24 NBA playoffs is inspiring but don't get it twisted -- Curry still remains the gold standard at the point guard position.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times. They were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder this year with Williamson unavailable due to a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-in tournament loss to the Los Angeles Lakers."

Increasingly aggravated at the amount of time it took to compile the pedigrees of the mares he was buying and selling all over the Midwest in the 1960s the late Richard F. Broadbent III began thinking of a way to ease not only his own burden but those of countless other horse traders and breeders throughout the country.

His solution would become the first of many innovations Broadbent revolutionized in the horse industry and birthed a company still going strong after half a century.

***

From a family with roots in southern Indiana Broadbent was born in Shelbyville Kentucky in 1937. After marrying Martha Haggin in the late 1950s Broadbent settled in Indianapolis where he and a brother ran a Phillips 66 gas station.

However it was almost impossible for the horse bug not to eventually bite Broadbent for Martha was the daughter of Keeneland president Louis Lee Haggin II and a granddaughter of Hal Price Headley Keeneland’s co-founder and a prominent horseman in his own right.

Brisnet.com founder Richard F. Broadbent III

“My dad started dabbling around buying fillies off the racetrack. He actually met Norm Casse in Indianapolis” said Broadbent’s son Happy referring to the father of Hall of Fame trainer Mark Casse. “They would look at the (Daily Racing Form) see potential fillies they could buy and could flip quickly for a thousand or two thousand. Casse and my dad would get into a pickup truck with a trailer behind them and they would go to these different racetracks and buy these fillies and bring them back to Indiana.

“At some point my dad realized that this was something he wanted to continue to do.”

Buying a farm on the outskirts of Louisville next to Hermitage Farm in Goshen Broadbent began breeding mares while continuing to buy and sell off the racetrack. Although he had built his own library in his basement at the farm in order to research the pedigrees of the horses that were passing through his hands spending two or three days compiling all of the necessary information on their bloodlines began to wear on him.

What was needed Broadbent thought was a single go-to source. And it needed to be compiled using the latest technology available at the time.

Enter the American Produce Records

…Broadbent spent considerable graveyard shift time at the KFC headquarters using the company’s computer system to input the data necessary…

“He came up with the idea of producing these books called the American Produce Records (APR) which were introduced in 1971” Happy Broadbent said. “These 12-volume set of books basically enabled anyone to determine a pedigree within a matter of minutes by flipping through and determining the offspring of particular broodmares.”

American Produce Records

With the help of a friend Kentucky Fried Chicken mogul and future Kentucky governor John Y. Brown Jr. Broadbent spent considerable graveyard shift time at the KFC headquarters in Louisville using the company’s computer system to input the data necessary to produce the books.

“My dad was never big on flying so he basically bought a mobile home and went from sale to sale all over the country and sold these books” Happy Broadbent said. “They were about $400 (about $2700 in current dollars) and you could get a leather-bound or buckram-bound set. They revolutionized the way you could research a pedigree.”

With the million or so dollars of proceeds from the sale of the first edition of the APR Broadbent set up an office in Lexington and invested in his own computer and mainframe system to compile and produce the books on an annual basis. Bloodstock Research Information Services (BRIS) was born.

The arrival of royalty in a new age

One year I think they had 14 graded stakes winners off the mares they had produced….

Although the popularity of the APR was undiminished by the mid-1970s the computer age was beginning to make encyclopedia-like sets of books increasingly impractical for bringing up-to-date information to the masses. Broadbent also began to see the need to enhance the product line BRIS could provide with the pedigree information at its disposal.

“He started spinning off into other things they could do statistically with the books and information he was compiling” Happy Broadbent said. “He was able to work a deal out with The Jockey Club to get registration information. He also went to Daily Racing Form to get all the racing information charts and input that into his mainframe system. Any sales of products derived from that information they were getting a commission or royalty off of that.

A 1970s era portable terminal was used to access the Brisnet database

“It was about 1977 that customers were able to log into the mainframe system to pull down pedigrees and racing information on horses that we had programmers develop and create. At the time to access the mainframe system all you had to have was a phone receiver and [a standard office computer terminal].”

Many prominent breeders and farm operations throughout the country soon became interested in the wide variety of statistical data BRIS produced.

“One of the things we have in the world of breeding is nicks or nicking reports. If there was somebody who authored all that it was all derived off of what my dad came up with” Happy Broadbent said. “Using the computer system my dad would determine what stallions were best to mate to particular mares. A lot of success these farms had in the early 1980s was related to some of those nicking patterns.

“The one he had the most success with was Newstead Farm in Virginia. They only had a broodmare band of about 20 mares. Some of those were Miss Oceana White Star Line and Larida. One year I think they had 14 graded stakes winners off the mares they had produced. Miss Oceana brought $7 million (at a 1985 dispersal).”

The consulting side of the business proved huge for finding stallion prospects as well. Using BRIS data Broadbent advised Spendthrift Farm owner Leslie Combs to obtain the Florida-based stallion Exclusive Native.

“One of the things we determined using statistical data was that Exclusive Native was really moving his mares up. He was having tremendous success with the cheaper mares he was being bred to in Florida” Happy Broadbent said.

Exclusive Native sired Affirmed and Genuine Risk the Hall of Famers who won the Kentucky Derby (G1) in 1978 and 1980 respectively.

The French stallion Caro was another Broadbent advised on importing to the U.S. After his arrival at Spendthrift Caro sired Kentucky Derby heroine Winning Colors grass champion Cozzene and Canadian Triple Crown winner With Approval.

Cutting Edge

BRIS was so cutting edge in the early 1980s that it began attracting attention from national media and important figures. The company was featured in the New York Times and Science Digest and the CBS newsmagazine “Universe” hosted by Walter Cronkite also profiled Broadbent’s creation.

Broadbent’s impact was profiled in a 1981 New York Times Magazine feature

But the biggest event in the company’s history occurred in October 1984 when Broadbent hosted a visit from Queen Elizabeth II to the BRIS offices. She had been intrigued to see firsthand what BRIS was doing after hearing about it from her racing manager Lord Porchester whose son Harry Herbert was a BRIS employee at the time.

“The one thing I’ll say about my dad is he was the hardest working” Happy Broadbent said. “He was a workaholic. He’d work 18-hour days. His mind was always constantly thinking about what the next thing was and what the next thing that was going to be good for our industry. It was neat to see growing up.”

By the mid-1980s forward thinking on the part of Broadbent would become essential as swift changes to the industry’s health and the threat of increased competition to the company’s long-standing business emerged.

John Reginald Wright 78 was extradited to Queensland state from Western Australia after being charged last week with nine counts of indecent dealing with children. The charges related to alleged incidents in the early 1980s in Brisbane and Rockhampton.

Wright was due to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Saturday but his case was delayed for two days for medical reasons. He didn't appear when the case was mentioned in the court on Monday and his duty lawyer didn't apply for bail.

Wright is set to face the same court on Nov. 15.

His arrest followed an investigation by Queensland state police that started after the Australian Broadcasting Corporation aired allegations the coach sexually abused boys he coached.

After the unexpected death of an Olympian who alleged he'd been sexually abused by his swimming coach the ABC uncovered stories of two more swimmers who say they were abused by the same coach at the same pool in Australia.

A former world-ranked South African swimmer also told the ABC that he was abused by the coach over a period of six months in 1998.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

The 16-storey Class-A office tower was built in 1987. It’s LEED platinum certified and has seven elevators car-charging stations and a café.

One underground unreserved parking space is available per 1000 rentable sq ft. Highway 401 and six GO Bus routes are nearby and there is direct underground access to the Yonge-Shephard subway station.

Hopson’s responses are as follows:

Policy 1: Homelessness/Criminal Justice Reform: Currently the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances criminalizes homelessness in various ways. One of these ways is the prohibition on monetary solicitation (panhandling) in large geographic areas called “Restricted Monetary Solicitation Zones” (RMSZ’s) Code Part II Ch. 106-85(11)… Would you support (again) repealing RMSZ’s given that aggressive panhandling would still be banned and panhandling within ten feet of ATM’s egresses etc. would still be banned?

Yes. Some homeless people have their own community have their own place to live and panhandling is a viable way to maintain expenses. There are a lot of homeless people who do not want to align with society in that regard and we should allow space for those individuals who for one reason or another prefer to live that way.

I would probably spend more time finding comprehensive services for homeless people than limiting their actions with regard to how they live and eat.

Policy 2: Homelessness/Criminal Justice Reform: Currently the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances criminalizes homelessness in various ways. One of these ways is through curfew laws making it a crime to be outside while under the age of eighteen during the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Curfew laws currently exempt children or teens who are working going to or from school running an errand for a parent etc. There currently are no exemptions for homeless or emancipated minors putting them at risk for being arrested merely for being homeless or emancipated. Would you support amending Code Part II Ch. 106-227 to add exemptions from the curfew law for homeless minors and emancipated minors?

Yes.

Policy 3: Affordable housing: Currently the City of Atlanta has an ordinance on the books requiring a housing inventory so that policymakers and the public will have good data regarding the City’s housing stock and the affordability of each housing unit Code Part II Ch. 54-6. However like many City policies it is not being enforced. One obstacle to enforcement is lack of data. Would you support updating the City’s business license requirements contained in Code Part II Chapter 30 to require that any residential lessors required to have a business license to provide annual data on the prices of their rental units within the City of Atlanta as part of their annual renewal paperwork?

Yes.

Policy 4: Democracy: Currently the City of Atlanta Charter (Sec. 2-501) and Code of Ordinances (Part II 2-40) provide for voter-initiated referenda whereby a voter could come up with a policy and submit it to the Municipal Clerk; and if enough voters sign a petition the policy will go on the ballot for citywide consideration. However upon belief and knowledge this process has never been used due to the high signature burden and other obstacles. Would you support reducing the petition requirement from fifteen percent of registered voters to fifteen percent of actual voters (or potentially even lower)?

Yes.

Policy 5: Democracy: Currently the City of Atlanta Charter (Sec. 2-501) and Code of Ordinances (Part II Sec. 2-40) provide for voter-initiated referenda whereby a voter could come up with a policy and submit it to the Municipal Clerk; and if enough voters sign a petition the policy will go on the ballot for citywide consideration. However upon belief and knowledge this process has never been used due to the high signature burden and other obstacles. Would you support eliminating the requirement contained in Sec. 2-40 that the Municipal Clerk check that voters are up-to-date in paying their property taxes in order to sign a petition a requirement which amounts to a quasi-poll tax?

Yes.

Policy 6: Environment: Currently there are seven Council Committees but none prioritize environmental stewardship. Would you support amending the Code of Ordinances Part II Ch. 2-131 and 2-135 to create a new Standing Committee on the Environment whose task will be to consider the environment first on all policy matters and advance environmental policy?

Yes.

Policy 7: Democracy / Public Comment: Currently the Code of Ordinances allows Committee Chairs to restrict public comments to only items on the committee agenda. Do you support amending Code of Ordinances Part II Ch 2-136 to allow public comment on any matter within the subject matter purview of the Committee whether or not the specific matter is not on the agenda of the committee (i.e. – a policy that the Committee is not currently considering but ought to consider)?

Yes.

Policy 8: Economy: Currently the City of Atlanta relies primarily on expensive bond financing and other borrowing to fund capital-intensive initiatives. Cities and states around the country are exploring the possibility of launching public banks that would be used to fund things like affordable housing small businesses and solar panel installations with low-interest loans. Would you support a Study Committee to launch a public bank in Atlanta?

Yes.

Policy 9: Affordable housing: Currently the City has three Inclusionary Zoning zones the Beltline Overlay Westside Overlay and Westside Park Overlay (Code Part III Part 16 Ch. 36A Sec. 16-36A.004; Ch. 37 Sec. 16-37A.004; Ch. 41 Sec. 16-41A.004). The Beltline and Westside Overlays currently require developers to set aside either (a) fifteen percent of units as affordable at 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI) or below; or (b) ten percent at 60 percent of AMI. However the Westside Park Overlay added a new compliance option (c) where developers can set aside five percent of units at 30 percent of AMI or below. Would you support amending the Beltline and Westside Overlays to add this third option to serve low-income families in Atlanta?

Yes. Yes I am for that and I think we should do more.

Policy 10: Environment: The City of Atlanta has yet to declare a climate crisis. Do you support passing a resolution declaring a climate crisis?

Yes.

Policy 11: Democracy / Transparency: Currently Council Committees are struggling to meet the requirements of the Georgia Open Meetings Act O.C.G.A. 50-14-1 et seq. especially when committee chairs call votes so quickly as to prevent the recording of vote details. Do you support amending Code Part II Sec. 2-133 to require committee chairs to call all votes in a manner that permits the committee analyst to record the mover seconder yeas nays abstentions and absences for each vote?

Yes.

Policy 12: Democracy: Currently members of the public have only two minutes to speak per person in Full Council Meetings. However seniors are often observed struggling to make their comments within the allotted time. Research shows that cognitive processing time declines at age 67 a half standard deviation from the mean and a full standard deviation at 79. (Murman 2015; Ebaid et al. 2017; Emory University 2019.) Would you support amending Code Part II Secs. 2-104 to provide additional public comment speaking time for seniors and for persons with disabilities requiring reasonable accommodation: specifically an additional minute for those seniors 67 and above; an additional two minutes for those above 79 (and an appropriate case-by-case accommodation for persons with cognitive or speaking-related disabilities)?

Yes.

Policy 13: Criminal Justice Reform: Currently the City of Atlanta has higher penalties for drug crimes occurring within “Drug-Free Commercial Zones.” The Council recently rejected adopting a new Drug-Free Commercial Zone in District 4/West End because the zones tend to be in high-minority areas and because they send the wrong signal to police regarding proportionality of enforcement. However the Council has not repealed the City’s existing Drug-Free Commercial Zones. Do you support repealing the existing zones contained in Code Part II Ch. 106-403 such that drug crimes will still be illegal in the City of Atlanta but there will not be heightened enforcement or penalties in certain areas?

Yes.

Policy 14: Affordable Housing: Currently the City has three Inclusionary Zoning zones the Beltline Overlay Westside Overlay and Westside Park Overlay (Code Part III Part 16 Ch. 36A Sec. 16-36A.004; Ch. 37 Sec. 16-37A.004; Ch. 41 Sec. 16-41A.004). The Beltline and Westside Overlays currently require developers to set aside (a) fifteen percent of units as affordable at 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI) or below; or (b) ten percent at 60 percent of AMI or below. The Westside Park Overlay added a new compliance option (c) where developers can set aside five percent of units at 30 percent of AMI or below. However under this framework a developer would choose only one price point for compliance with the affordability requirement instead of providing a mix of incomes. To promote mixed-income communities would you support for large projects of fifty units or more amending all three IZ areas to require a “3-3-3″ plan: at least three percent of units affordable at 80 percent AMI; at least three percent at 60 percent AMI; and at least three percent at 30 percent AMI?

Yes.

Policy 15: Affordable Housing: Currently the City of Atlanta has no consistent citywide policy around using zoning and land use incentives to negotiate voluntary commitments to affordable housing (i.e. – a Voluntary Inclusionary Zoning policy). The Code has a few zones with density bonuses that are under-utilized because height would be a better incentive. Do you support amending Code Part III Part 16 Ch. 28 adopting a citywide Inclusionary Zoning policy to empower neighborhoods to self-designate as Height Bonus Areas whereby development projects would be eligible for additional height by providing affordable housing units?

Yes.

Policy 16: Democracy / NPU’s: Currently NPU’s are empowered to make recommendations regarding any matter of public policy to the City of Atlanta per Code Part III Part 6 Sec. 6-3013(c). However the Department of Planning only routinely communicates recommendations regarding only certain zoning matters and other specific categories of policy matters to the City Council and the Mayor. This means it is up to each NPU to communicate their recommendations to the Atlanta City Council and Mayor. Do you support amending the Code to require the Department of Planning to provide a monthly report to the Atlanta City Council of all NPU votes on matters not otherwise included on the Full Council Meeting Agenda; and that this monthly report shall be included in any Full Council Meeting Agendas as an attachment for any meetings that fall within that month?

Yes.

Policy 17: Democracy / NPU’s: NPU’s make recommendations regarding policy to the City Council but NPU’s do not (and legally cannot) have veto power over City Council decisions with which they do not agree. However NPU’s often wonder whether Council Members are listening to them especially when Council Members go against the wishes of one or more NPU’s. Would you support the creation of a “Responsive Statement to Neighborhoods” – whereby one or more Councilmembers may provide an optional statement called a Responsive Statement to Neighborhoods by which they explain how they considered the input of one or more NPU’s with respect to one or more legislative items; and all Responsive Statements to Neighborhoods shall be attached to the appropriate meeting agendas?

Yes.

Policy 18: Democracy / NPU’s: Currently the Code allows NPUs to utilize representative voting whereby individual residents and businesses lose their individual voting rights to vote on matters at NPU meetings; and whereby in certain NPU’s only neighborhood association delegates and business community delegates vote on what recommendations to make to the City Council. (Code Part III Part 6 Sec. 6-3012(3). Do you support repealing the language allowing “representative voting” in NPUs restoring the principle of one person-one vote?

How can it be they ask that ""conservative Calgary"" has elected such a distinctly un-conservative council ?

Why is it they wonder that Toronto's mayors are named ""Rob"" and ""John"" and Calgary's are named ""Naheed"" and ""Jyoti""?

Just what exactly is going on out there?

Let's be honest: Calgary has a reputation as a conservative place. When we don't live up to it — for instance when a member of the UCP cabinet tells Calgarians on election day to ""vote right"" and Calgarians respond with a friendly ""No thanks!"" — Canadians elsewhere are flummoxed.

So let's tackle this reputation. Is Calgary really all that conservative?

The answer is yes — sort of.

It depends a lot on the issue and the level of government. On some issues like energy policy Calgarians have distinctively conservative tendencies. And there's a deep connection between Calgary and the federal Conservative Party. This makes us seem — and think of ourselves as — conservative.

But and this is the important part vis-a-vis the cognitive dissonance we provoke Calgarians tend to hold clearly progressive policy attitudes in municipal politics.

In short: We're ""policy progressives"" but ""symbolic conservatives.""

Let me explain what that means and why it matters for our municipal elections.

Ideology cooked two ways

I know dear reader that your appetite for social science jargon is limited. But here's just a morsel of jargon that I think is actually quite useful: the distinction between policy ideology and symbolic ideology.

Policy ideology is the name we give to our left-wing or right-wing policy preferences. These are the left-right patterns in our actual policy views.

Symbolic ideology is about how we think of ourselves — where we feel we belong on the left-right spectrum.

Usually policy ideology and symbolic ideology are closely related. But the way we think of ourselves can sometimes be different from our actual policy views.

And as we'll see this can even be true of a whole city.

Conservative Calgary?

The best way to understand how conservative Calgarians really are is to compare ourselves with other Canadians using the biggest survey data set available: the 2019 Canadian Election Study a massive survey of more than 38000 Canadians including more than 1500 in Calgary.

The 2019 Canadian Election Study survey is a treasure trove for politics nerds. It contains questions that allow us to dig into both policy and symbolic ideology. We can compare Calgarians with other Canadians with similar personal characteristics (things like age gender and education) and who live in similarly urban environments.

The result: sure we're conservative. On both policy and symbolic ideology we're about five points more conservative on a 100-point scale than otherwise similar Canadians.

On my measure Calgary is the 82nd-most-conservative of Canada's 250 largest municipalities — far from the most conservative of the bunch but distinctively right-leaning among Canada's big cities.

But here's the catch: policy ideology is about underlying left-right attitudes across lots of policy issues. And for Calgarians it turns out that nearly all of our ""conservatism"" comes from conservative preferences in one area: energy policy.

Calgarians tend to have especially conservative positions on issues like pipeline construction and carbon taxes. Hardly surprising.

On many other issues from medically assisted dying to foreign trade our views are indistinguishable from demographically similar Canadians outside of Calgary. That is we look like broadly progressive urban Canadians.

And when it comes to municipal issues we tend to look even more consistently progressive.

Big-city issues

In the Canadian Municipal Election Study which we completed in July and August of this year we asked a random sample of 2200 Calgarians how they would have voted on a number of municipal issues had they been on city council in the past term.

On average we found Calgarians would have voted to reintroduce fluoride (68 per cent) reduce residential speed limits (54 per cent) refuse municipal funding for the NHL arena (59 per cent) approve the Green Line LRT (74 per cent) endorse the Guidebook for Great Communities (59 per cent) and reallocate $20 million in police funding to mental health and addictions programs (63 per cent).

These positions are hardly conservative.

Canada's big-city residents tend to incline toward the progressive end of the ideological spectrum and when it comes to municipal policy issues the average Calgarians holds views that are largely in keeping with what we'd expect to find in any big Canadian city.

This affects our municipal elections.

Identities and policies

Years ago a political scientist made the argument that many American citizens are ""symbolic conservatives"" but ""policy liberals"" — they think of themselves as conservatives but hold liberal attitudes on many policy issues.

In Calgary municipal politics I think we see something very similar.

Calgarians have a longstanding connection to the Conservative Party of Canada — a connection that traces its roots all the way back to John Diefenbaker. This history combined with conservative policy views in a few important domains means Calgarians tend to think of themselves as conservative even as they enthusiastically defend progressive policy positions on municipal issues.

This has consequences for how municipal candidates run for office.

Left-leaning candidates have the advantage of defending municipal policy positions that often align with the average Calgarian's preference (though these can vary from ward to ward). But because Calgarians tend to self-identify as more conservative left-leaning municipal candidates often avoid defining themselves as ""left-wing"" ""liberal"" or ""progressive.""

Right-leaning candidates face a different challenge: how to connect with the conservative identity that many Calgarians share without advocating specific policy positions that will alienate voters.

One sensible solution is to emphasize fiscal policy (taxes spending) and economic growth. Another option is to try to shift the terms of the debate itself reconceptualizing what is at stake in municipal politics not as left-versus-right but instead as a debate between ordinary Calgarians and corporate elites — a difficult but potentially powerful approach that political scientists call (jargon alert!) heresthetic.

Jyoti Gondek's victory in Calgary on Monday was historic and the attention to her victory across the country was well deserved.

But for those of us who live here it was hardly a shock. The last time this city elected a candidate with clear ties to provincial or federal Conservative parties the Allied invasion at Normandy was a recent memory.

So is Calgary conservative?

The only way to answer is with one more piece of highly technical scientific jargon: Kinda.

Polling details and methodology:

The poll was conducted by Forum Research on behalf of the Canadian Municipal Election Study with the results based on a telephone recruit-to-web survey of 2209 randomly selected eligible voters in the city of Calgary. The poll was conducted between July 6 and Aug. 4 2021.",,,,,,

This article is published on finews.first a forum for authors specialized in economic and financial topics.

We call them «private» as opposed to the «public» markets in which listed liquid assets are traded. Private assets are illiquid by their nature and mainly comprise private equity private debt real estate and investments intangible assets and infrastructure.

According to Prequin the market is currently worth 72 billion euros in Switzerland and it has historically been supported by various cyclical and secular factors. In particular these include new regulations introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. For large financial institutions tougher prudential standards regarding the amount of capital they must hold and their liquidity ratios have forced them to reduce their corporate finance activities and companies have therefore had to find other sources of liquidity.

«Bond yields have almost evaporated»

Although tech unicorns account for only part of the huge pool of companies seeking private capital they provide a good example. Goldman Sachs recently found 392 unicorns i.e. unlisted companies that have achieved valuations of over $1 billion with the support of private financing alone. In 2006 there were only three.

Bond yields have almost evaporated prompting investors to take a greater interest in the potential remuneration offered by private markets. As an alternative to large-scale investments in emerging-market debt or high-yield bonds with the higher volatility they entail private assets compare well.

Their illiquidity premium – the additional return received by investors in return for being unable to sell their assets immediately – has not diminished. That premium lies between around 2.5 percent for private debt and over 4 percent for private equity for example these are very attractive numbers in the current era of very low interest rates.

«The global economy does not look capable of withstanding large-scale or rapid rate hikes»

In their quest to achieve the best risk/return profile investors have spotted this which has resulted in large amounts of money flowing into private markets. The trend is likely to continue. The global economy does not look capable of withstanding large-scale or rapid rate hikes by central banks.

In addition governments have taken on a lot of debt to counter the recessionary impact of the pandemic and cannot allow their debt servicing costs to rise too much. Unless inflation surges therefore bond yields are set to remain low for a long time to come.

«For private clients private assets particularly real estate and infrastructure»

Until now private markets have mainly been of interest to institutional investors but their appeal has suddenly grown significantly among private clients. Institutional investors have long sought to harness the potential offered by private markets to boost returns and diversify their portfolios.

Another benefit of these illiquid assets is that they generally do not have to be marked to market which means that investors do not have to recognize capital losses in their year-end accounts if assets fall temporarily in value.

For private clients private assets particularly real estate and infrastructure offer an alternative to low-yielding bonds but also real protection against stock market volatility – such as that which appeared at the start of the Covid-19 crisis – and against inflation.

«A recent regulatory change has removed some of that limitation»

Yet private markets still make up a relatively small proportion of asset allocations in Switzerland. Regulations limit alternative investments by Swiss pension institutions. However a recent regulatory change prompted by the need for private financing to support the energy transition has removed some of that limitation.

Following the latest amendments to the Swiss occupational pension plan ordinance (OPP2) pension institutions can now make direct investments in infrastructure which can account for up to 10 percent of their assets.

This includes energy mobility supply-chain and healthcare infrastructure. The aim is to enable pension funds and other pension institutions to invest more money in environmentally sustainable projects in Switzerland or abroad.

«Private markets are set to play a major role in this effort»

As a result although private equity currently accounts for a third of private market inflows infrastructure investments are now likely to see the strongest growth. In its most recent report on Europe Preqin found that assets under management in the infrastructure segment rose 30 percent in 2020.

This increase was driven by considerable expenditure related to the post-Covid recovery and by the transition to a more sustainable and socially just world: the G20 estimates the overall amount of infrastructure investment required at $3700 billion.

Private markets are set to play a major role in this effort and the recent regulatory changes mean that they are highly likely to see a sustained increase in investor attention.

Bloomberg News

Donald Trump’s sagging fortune is suddenly poised to get a massive boost from meme-stock mania.

News this week that the former president’s nascent media enterprise Trump Media & Technology Group is planning to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) has sent retail investors into a frenzy even with few details released. The stock gain drove the implied value of the new venture to more than $8.2 billion.

Based on figures from press releases and filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission it appears Trump will own more than 50% of the combined company. At its current value that would make him the richest he’s ever been up from his estimated net worth now of $2.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

In the roller-coaster world of Reddit-fueled trading and grandiose SPAC hype those gains are hardly firm. But the money betting on a Trump media conglomerate marks a sharp turnaround for a post-presidency that hasn’t been kind to the billionaire’s business empire.

His Washington hotel which was first put on the market in 2019 is still for sale while the flagship midtown Manhattan tower that bears his name has growing vacancies. This summer the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization was charged with tax fraud. Trump’s net worth has declined by about $500 million since he entered the White House with the pandemic and fallout from January’s Capitol riot delivering added blows to his business interests.

Now comes the arrival of the social-media outlet that Trump the leader in polls for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024 has been teasing at for some time. There are many reasons to be skeptical of the valuation. It will be months before the new venture publicly releases its first product a social-media platform called Truth Social. And there are already technical issues. On Thursday the Truth Social page was hacked to make it appear that Trump shared a photo of a defecating pig.

It’s also unclear how Trump plans to build a social-media platform on the scale of Twitter over the next few months let alone a streaming service which is the next phase of Trump Media’s plans according to the press release announcing the company. That statement was light on numbers even by SPAC standards.

“We have no financials. We have no business plan. We don’t know how they got to the valuation. We have no information” said Kristi Marvin chief executive of research firm SPAC Insider. “That’s the fundamental problem.”

Representatives for Trump and Trump Media didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The business has ambitious plans that also include a potential “tech stack” to compete with Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Google’s Cloud among others according to a presentation on Trump Media’s website. As of now Digital World’s board is light on members with media experience. Its chief executive officer Patrick Orlando is a former Deutsche Bank AG derivatives trader who co-founded a sugar-trading company and started a banking firm Benessere Capital before more recently embracing SPACs.

So far retail investors have little concern. Shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp. the shell company merging with Trump’s new venture to take it public closed Friday at $94.20 – up from $9.96 before the deal was announced Wednesday. It’s also an increase of more than 800% from a $10 offering price that’s typically used in a SPAC merger agreement.

The press release said the new company would have an initial enterprise value of $875 million. Assuming that calculation used a $10 a share offering price and the $293 million Digital World has in trust the SPAC’s owners will get about 42% of the combined company after accounting for shares the sponsor receives if a deal gets done.

That leaves 58% for Trump and any partners he has in Trump Media. That stake is worth nearly $4.8 billion based on Digital World’s last price. The whole enterprise is being valued by the market at about $8.2 billion compared with Twitter Inc.’s almost $50 billion equity valuation.

With the new media company’s valuation dwarfing the $875 million enterprise value agreed to by Trump he may have been able to negotiate a sweeter deal. Terms of the agreement will need to be more fully disclosed and could still change before an agreement gets voted on by shareholders an event that is probably months away.

Most of Trump’s current wealth is tied to the Trump Organization a sprawling real estate business that has been hurt by the pandemic and legal troubles. There’s also at least $590 million in debt coming due in the next four years linked to the company’s properties more than half of which is personally guaranteed by Trump.

In April the company scored a win when its partner in two skycrapers Vornado Realty Trust refinanced debt tied to its San Francisco tower bringing $617 million to its owners. The Trump Organization also appears to be closing in on a sale of Washington’s Trump International Hotel which was a hotspot for political allies lobbyists and conservative media figures during his administration.

“We are one of the most under-leveraged real estate companies in the country relative to our assets” Trump’s son Eric Trump said at the time of the Vornado deal. On paper he and his brother Donald Trump Jr. have been leading the Trump Organization. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg stepped down from his various roles after his indictment. The company was also charged with 15 felony counts in New York.

Trump hasn’t signaled that he’ll return to the Trump Organization. His focus now is on dominating the Republican party and his new media project which would give him an avenue to connect with supporters and raise money after he was banned from Facebook and Twitter. That would be key if he chooses to seek a second term in 2024.

When Trump first ran for president he claimed to have a fortune of $10 billion. Now the retail trading frenzy may bring him somewhat closer to getting there.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A “polecat” is a Eurasian mammal but in rural Tennessee the word is slang for “skunk” — appropriate as what Lockheed Martin’s “Skunk Works” was to modern aviation the Polecat Training Center is to road racing. At once an ultra-modern training facility hosting both the PTC Driving Academy and Milspec defense training center it is also a throwback to road race tracks pre the super-sanitary endless-asphalt era of track design.

Uniquely PTC’s 19 corners are each purpose-designed to teach something as if the late Piero Taruffi’s long-out-of-print hardcover reference “The Technique of Motor Racing” had somehow been translated from words to to pavement. A few of its corners mimic some of North America’s more well-known bends such: Turn 5 at Road America the Carousel at Mid-Ohio and others.

The track swoops rolls and flows with the landscape with 120 feet of elevation change from Turn 1 to Bistro (Turn 16 — so named because a gourmet restaurant there at the top of the hill is in the plan for Phase 3 of PTC’s expansion.)

PTC aka “Polecat” is the multi-million-dollar dream of Tennessean Paul Arnold real estate developer experienced race car driver (both a former NASA Eastern States and Factory Five Challenge champion) and enthusiast whose brainstorming dinner with friend and veteran Skip Barber Race School instructor Keith Watts plus a stack of cocktail napkins in 2015 morphed into a serious action plan.

“This whole thing was the result of Divine intervention” said Arnold “from finding the land to getting the permits to designing and laying down asphalt to building a classroom and shop. As we needed them so many good people just came on board …”

Permission to start clearing and building a track on the expansive farmland Arnold acquired between Fayetteville and Lynchburg was only the first of many challenges. Local government was initially opposed as close neighbors voiced noise concerns; one in particular raised objections to the plans for military training and shooting range.

In the end though greatly helped by across-the-street farmers closest to the property being in favor and carefully winning over the nearby Mennonite community with sincere and open channels of communication (and no small amount of business for their lumber mill) Arnold Watts and Co. got their permissions.

Since then new mayor Bonnie Lewis who saw in PTC another tourist attraction to add to the popular Jack Daniels Distillery tour that Lynchburg is known for become another Polecat advocate.

Early on a third local Arnold’s long-time friend Randy Anderson an experienced utility and grading contractor was thrown into the mix his all-around construction know-how filling out the management team. Together this trio of doers began tree clearing and earth moving in early 2017. Incredibly a very serious race track with a modern classroom and huge workshop opened just three years later in fall 2020.

Arnold had the vision financing and know-how but Watts’ contributions have been considerable and his skill as a driver key to the track’s steady refinement: From the beginning PTC was to be the ultimate teaching environment incorporating every conceivable corner situation — slow to fast; camber/off-camber; suspension load/unload; blind and wide open.

To that end once the land was cleared and the paving begun Watts and Arnold drew up plans for the school that would become the Polecat Driver Academy. When they heard entire fleet of ex-Skip Barber Mondiale-Dodges was headed to bankruptcy auction the pair headed to Atlanta. Intending to purchase a handful they wound up purchasing the whole lot — 44 cars all partially damaged few in running order.

Calling on a variety of friends from the Nashville area PTC has so far restored 18 cars to running order all immaculate and featuring a variety of safety upgrades. Watts and long-time friend from nearby Georgia Sean Rayhall spent most of a week in early August tuning adjusting and equalizing 10 of the cars to make available for fall schools — and for hosting Jeremy Shaw’s 2021 Team USA Shootout.

Spend more than five minutes with Arnold Watts and Anderson — better yet get an at-speed 10-lap “guided tour” with Arnold in one of the school’s pair of Corvette C8.Rs — and you’re pulled into this dream right alongside them: Phase 2 of this ongoing project will include necessary safety improvements — tirewalls and other barriers and more tree-cutting; an extension to the track adding one long sweeping corner connecting Turns 5 and 9 (which will add a second long straight to an otherwise tight and twisty back section); and a second workshop.

Phase 3 will include an upscale restaurant overlooking two key sections of the track; likely a second track extension onto recently acquired additional property; and expansion of revenue streams unique to any American circuit: cattle raising (45 head currently there is a small herd on the property tended by the across-the-street neighbor); honey production (Arnold and Watts recently harvested honey from a pair of hives); and truck farming (with multiple acres set aside for vegetable-growing).

Soon there will be lodging available on the grounds with plans drawn up for several cabins. And one of the most intriguing ventures is an internship program developed with the Atlanta Georgia-based Lanier Tech which already uses an ex-Skip Barber single-seater in its race car engineering program. The first group of graduate students set to arrive in mid-October to assist with the acquisition and set up of new CNC milling and other machines. The first group of graduate students landed in mid-October and were taken through every step of race car care and feeding from fluids to nuts-and-bolts to several laps on track behind the school’s Corvette.

Ultimately those future race engineers will assist with the acquisition and set-up of modern CNC machinery as PTC looks to expand its fabrication capabilities.

“I have a passion for young people with a dream” said Watts whose Driving Academy clearly aims to encourage those dreams both on- and off-track.

As for the 2.1-mile track itself: “It’s not easy to learn this place in just a couple of laps“ said Indy Car champion Josef Newgarden a suburban Nashville resident who’d “heard about PTC” but saw it for the first time in late August.

Newgarden joined fellow alum Andy Lally and Aaron Jeansonne in attending the Aug. 25-26 Team USA Shootout to offer instruction and support for the six young drivers competing for this year’s scholarship. After a handful of laps in one of PTC’s two Corvette C8.Rs Newgarden clambered out beaming: “It’s a wicked track super technical — off-camber decreasing radius on that last corner. Really something.”

A “polecat” is a Eurasian mammal but in rural Tennessee the word is slang for “skunk” — appropriate as what Lockheed Martin’s “Skunk Works” is to modern aviation the Polecat Training Center is to road racing. At once an ultra-modern training facility hosting both the PTC Driving Academy and Milspec defense training center it is also a throwback to road racetracks pre the super-sanitary Alan Wilson era of track design.

Uniquely PTC’s 19 corners are each purpose-designed to teach something as if the late Piero Taruffi’s long-out-of-print hardcover reference “The Technique of Motor Racing” had somehow been translated from words to to asphalt. A few of its corners mimic some of North America’s more well-known bends such: Turn 5 at Road America the Carousel at Mid-Ohio and others.

The track swoops rolls and flows with the landscape with 120 feet of elevation change from Turn 1 to Bistro (Turn 16 — so named because a gourmet restaurant there at the top of the hill is in the plan for Phase 3 of PTC’s expansion.)

PTC aka “Polecat” is the multi-million-dollar dream of Tennessean Paul Arnold real estate developer experienced race car driver (both a former NASA Eastern States and Factory Five Challenge champion) and enthusiast whose brainstorming dinner with friend and veteran Skip Barber Race School instructor Keith Watts plus a stack of cocktail napkins in 2015 morphed into a serious action plan.

Hall and Ben Cherry in Ellen Simon’s Ass which had its world premiere Friday night at Pioneer Theatre Company. Photo: PTC

“Narcissism is the birthright of genius” world-renowned sculptor Jule Waterman proclaims toward the end of Ellen Simon’s comedy Ass which made its pandemic-delayed world premiere Friday night at Pioneer Memorial Theatre.

And Simon—herself the daughter of an artistic genius the late playwright Neil Simon—does make some sharp observations about the ways in which we indulge the creative and famous.

But at bottom this is a play about family and connection.

“The specifics have nothing to do with my family” Simon explained in an interview ahead of the show’s opening “but when you sit and watch you will get a little bit of what it felt like to be in my family.”

And indeed the parent-child interactions in Ass though hilariously heightened are likely to feel at least somewhat familiar to anyone who sees the show.

World-renowned sculptor Jule Waterman like the alabaster work-in-progress that dominates Jo Winiarski’s set design is larger than life and T. Ryder Smith luxuriates in the artist’s extravagant ego. “I am shaken to the core by my own brilliance” he exults as he explains the inspiration behind his forthcoming masterpiece. Jule specializes in three-dimensional synecdoche sculpting single body parts—an ear a big toe a neck—so masterfully that viewers can see the whole person.

But Jule’s son Will doesn’t feel wholly seen despite having parts of his body immortalized in two of the world’s finest art museums. A financial emergency brings Will to his childhood home but it quickly becomes clear that money is the least of the things he needs from his father.

Ben Cherry last seen at PTC as an arrogant journalist in The Lifespan of a Fact deftly reveals Will’s insecurity and resentment layer by layer so that even when the character reaches peak unlikeability we’re invested enough to forgive him.

Elizabeth Ramos plays Ana Will’s wife who does see him as a whole person and helps the audience to do the same. Her role is a less showy one but Ramos invests it with warmth.

Vince McGill likewise brings emotional weight to Ray Jule’s well-grounded dialysis nurse who pushes Jule and Will to open up. Laura J. Hall plays Jule’s grasping trophy wife Tory with such verve that she’s a delight to watch despite the character’s breathtaking lack of self-awareness.

The pace relaxes occasionally as the characters achieve tiny epiphanies and moments of self-reflection though Karen Azenberg’s direction is at its best when the banter is flying.

Simon’s witty script never feels self-conscious or sitcommy. this is a genuinely funny play in which all the jokes and one-liners arise organically from the characters. Almost all of these people behave in ways befitting the show’s title at some point (though none of them can outdo the audience member who took a phone call during Friday night’s premiere).

But they also reveal a humanity that renders them likable—or in Tory’s case almost likable.

The production runs through November 6 at the Roy W. and Elizabeth E. Simmons Pioneer Memorial Theatre; 801-581-6961 or pioneertheatre.org

According to the agenda the item was requested by Councilmember Jovita Mendoza after the city received a letter from Moms Demand Action.

The Brentwood Police Department will compare and contrast what guidelines are being requested by Moms Demand Action versus current guidelines and what could be improved.

Captain Doug Silva confirmed Friday that Moms Demand Action is proposing a more restrictive ordinance than state law and that the council is looking for clarifications before taking action.

Within the staff report:

CRIMINAL STORAGE OF FIREARM

Criminal storage of a firearm is covered under California Law (25100 PC):

(a) first degree: child obtains firearm and causes death or great bodily injury to the child or any other person.

(b) second degree: child obtains firearm and causes injury other than great bodily injury to the child or any other person.

(c) third degree: a person negligently stores or leaves a firearm in a location where the person knows or reasonably should know that a child is likely to gain access to the firearm.

Current Law:

A PERSON CANNOT KEEP A FIREARM INSIDE A RESIDENCE AND NEGLIGENTLY STORE OR LEAVE THE FIREARM IN A LOCATION WHERE THEY KNOW OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW THAT A CHILD IS LIKELY TO GAIN ACCESS TO THAT FIREARM WITHOUT TAKING REASONABLE ACTION TO SECURE THE FIREARM.

Proposed Safe Storage Ordinance by Moms Demand Action:

ALL FIREARMS KEPT INSIDE A RESIDENCE SHALL BE SECURED IN A LOCKED CONTAINER OR DISABLED WITH A TRIGGER LOCK.

The Netherlands Forensic Institute said it decrypted Tesla's heavily guarded data storage system.

The lab was able to obtain unknown information about Tesla's Autopilot system according to the report.

Tesla's Autopilot feature has been criticized in the US by regulators and lawmakers for giving drivers a false sense of security behind the wheel.

A lab operated by the Dutch government said it has decrypted Tesla's heavily guarded data storage system which could be vital in investigating dangerous accidents.

According to a report released on Thursday the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) discovered more data than investigators were previously aware of detailing Tesla's vehicle operations and driver assistance systems called Autopilot.

The NFI report unearthed unseen findings on vehicle speed accelerator pedal position steering wheel angle and brake actuation. The findings provide ""a wealth of information for forensic investigators and traffic accident analysts"" and may help inform criminal investigations involving fatal accidents or injuries according to Francis Hoogendijk a digital investigator at the NFI.

""It would be good if this data would become available more often for forensic investigations"" Hoogendijk said in a statement. ""Now that we know what kind of data can be obtained from a Tesla certain data can be requested even more specifically for the purpose of finding the truth after an accident.""

According to the report the NFI says it has successfully obtained information from Tesla models S Y X and 3. By determining what data the cars store NFI was able to figure out how the car's registration system works the report explains.

Tesla stores some data for over a year depending on the car's usage. Although this information is heavily encrypted the company does make it possible for owners to request their user data including footage from vehicle cameras in the event of an accident the NFI said.

Tesla also has the ability to request this data remotely meaning the company can use the data to improve its product or fix malfunctions after accidents.

Tesla's Autopilot feature has been criticized in the US by regulators and lawmakers who say the name makes drivers think the cars are autonomous when they aren't. The technology has also been the subject of an investigation by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) after a number of Teslas using driver-assist Autopilot struck vehicles at first-responder scenes Insider reported.

NFI's report comes after Tesla outpaced Wall Street expectations on Wednesday reporting 57% year-over-year revenue growth to reach $13.8 billion in its third quarter pushing shares to record highs on Friday and bringing Elon Musk's net worth $250 billion.

Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment on NFI's discovery.

Hoogendijk said he is in favor of international legislation and regulations to make car manufacturers more transparent about which data is stored and how it's monitored according to NFI's statement.

""My research ensures that we know what information is now present in Teslas. It was a time consuming process"" Hoogendijk said. ""It would be good if it was made public by the car brands themselves in the future.""

Instead the release would likely be more focused on efficiency than anything else and according to this benchmark comparison that rumor was true. Still it is egregious to see a flagship chipset unable to compete with an A12 Bionic a custom silicon Apple released three years ago.

Tensor Fails to Beat the A12 Bionic in Both Single-Core and Multi-Core Tests

The performance comparison provided by 9lekt on Twitter shows Geekbench 5 scores belonging to the Tensor and the A12 Bionic. Sadly Apple’s chipset from three years ago beats the Tensor in both single-core and multi-core tests and naturally these figures would have potential customers confused. The first thing they will likely ask themselves is why Google refrained from using Qualcomm as its supplier for the Snapdragon 888.

In this way the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro would at least remain competitive with the rest of the Android flagship smartphone camp. While we agree that these numbers are beyond disappointing keep in mind that benchmark results only tell half the story and what you are seeing does not necessarily translate into real-world performance. We also have to take into consideration the optimization bits.

Google Pixel 6 Pro (2021) vs iPhone XS Max (2018) Geekbench result

Qualcomm’s chipsets were no stranger to overheating as evidenced when using the Pixel 5a which does not even use a flagship SoC from the San Diego chip giant. With the Tensor Google may have sacrificed the performance aspect of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro but with its added control on both hardware and software it is possible that the operating system runs significantly smoother on the latest flagships than it does on competing handsets with minimal dips and stutters.

The disappointing single-core and multi-core scores could also attribute to the energy-efficient side of the Tensor and it is possible Google intentionally wanted this chip to underperform so it could provide the best battery life for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro owners. Oftentimes you will sift through the hardware specifications of a smartphone and be thoroughly impressed with what is published on paper only to be left bitterly disappointed and livid at the atrocious levels of software optimizations.

Well yes Whitechapel is a 5nm chip with current performance on PVT units closer to SD870 they are not trying to match SD888. Google's focus is on ML & so the raw AI performance is matched to that of other leading mobile chips. Plus that Mali GPU is performing good under stress. — Yogesh Brar (@heyitsyogesh) May 24 2021

Google might have a different plan altogether with its Tensor but we are not expected to see those results this early. When the first commercial Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro reviews are out we will update our readers accordingly so stay tuned.

Xiaomi 11T Pro





The Xiaomi 11T series has just arrived in the Philippines. In this article we take a look at the new high-end model called the Xiaomi Mi 11T Pro.





To recap it features a large 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a max brightness of 1000 nits. Inside is the 5nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Adreno 660 LPDDR5 RAM UFS 3.1 storage and a massive 5000mAh battery with 120W fast charging via USB-C.





In the Philippines the smartphone starts at PHP 27990 for the 8GB RAM and 256GB model.





We have the device today so let's take a look.





Unboxing/Accessories

Xiaomi 11T Pro box



The Xiaomi 11t Pro comes in a white box with rose gold and gray text and branding.

Inside the box









Inside the box is the Xiaomi 11T Pro documentation silicone transparent case SIM ejector tool USB Type-A to Type-C cable and 120W charger.





There are no included earphones. The screen protector is preinstalled on the phone by the factory.





Build Quality/Design

Rear design



The Xiaomi 11T Pro is stunning. It has an eye-catching design and is built with a fine fit and finish. The front panel is made of Gorilla Glass Victus protected glass. The inner frame is made of polycarbonate while the back panel feels and sounds glasstic. Both the front and rear panels are fingerprint magnets.





Great build!





The rear camera module also has a glass panel on top of the camera lenses while on top of the LED flash and the 108MP camera branding is a glasstic panel.

SIM tray with red rubber gasket





The SIM tray can hold up to two nano-SIM cards. There is no microSD card slot. The SIM tray also has a red rubber gasket which is a major component in water sealing. This means that the Xiaomi 11T Pro may have underrated water and dust resistance.





For the design the back of the phone curves which makes it easier to hold but the rear glasstic panel is slippery. We recommend wearing the included silicone transparent case as soon as you get it to prevent accidental slippage.

Punch hole display with slim bezels





In front it uses a large 6.67-inch AMOLED display with 1080p resolution and an extra-smooth 120Hz refresh rate and 1000 nits peak brightness. It supports Dolby Vision MEMC P3 wide color and is Gorilla Glass Victus protected.





GREAT DISPLAY!





The display has slim bezels all around. Though the chin bezel is slightly thicker than the rest. There is a punch hole on the upper part of the display.





Xiaomi claims that the display got an A+ rating from Displaymate while the stereo speakers are tuned by Harmon Kardon and support Dolby Atmos.





On top is the speaker grill microphone IR sensor and Harman Kardon branding. When we opened the box and saw the phone for the first time we saw a scratch on the top part. This could be an isolated case or a quality control issue. While at the bottom is the SIM tray microphone USB-C port and the second speaker grill.

Left and right sides





On the left is a smooth surface while on the right side is the volume rocker and the power button that doubles as the fingerprint scanner.





The device measures 164.1 x 76.9 x 8.8 mm and weighs 204 grams. The phone is easy to hold but is slippery. The large camera module also protrudes so as mentioned earlier we recommend wearing the included silicone case.





Xiaomi 11T Pro 5G Specs Display: 6.67-inch flat Gorilla Glass Victus protected AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate 480Hz touch sampling rate MEMC HDR10+ FHD+ 2400 x 1080 resolution at 395 ppi CPU: 2.84GHz 5nm Snapdragon 888 octa-core processor GPU: Adreno 660 RAM: 8GB/12GB LPDDR5 ROM: 128GB/256GB UFS 3.1 Back Camera: 108MP f/1.75 w/ PDAF + 8MP f/2.2 120-degree ultra-wide-angle + 5MP f/2.4 telemacro 3-7cm + dual-tone LED flash Selfie Camera: 16MP f/2.45 Battery: 5000mAh w/ 120W HyperCharge OS: Android 11 w/ MIUI 12.5 Connectivity: WiFi 6 5G SA/NSA 4G LTE Bluetooth 5.2 OTG NFC GPS (L1+L5) A-GPS GLONASS BeiDou Galileo (E1+E5a) dual SIM Sensors: Accelerometer light orientation proximity gyroscope sound magnetic Others: Side-mounted fingerprint sensor face unlock IR Blaster stereo speakers Harman Kardon audio Dolby Atmos Hi-Res Audio Certification X-axis linear vibration motor Vapor chamber cooling system USB-C Colors: Meteorite Gray Moonlight White Celestial Blue Dimensions: 164.1 x 76.9 x 8.8 mm Weight: 204 g Price: PHP 27990 (8GB/256GB) PHP 29990 (12GB/256GB)

As of the moment

AnTuTu results





On paper this is the most affordable smartphone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Adreno 660 LPDRR5 RAM UFS 3.1 storage Harman Kardon stereo speakers and 5000mAh battery with 120W fast charging.





It even features a 108MP f/1.75 main camera 8MP f/2.2 120-degree ultra-wide camera 5MP f/2.4 telemacro (3-7cm) with an LED flash and microphone While on the punch hole in the front is a 16MP f/2.45 front-facing camera.





The dis play is great out of the box and it shows why it got an A+ rating from Display Mate.







We also noticed that there is no way to expand the internal storage. Our last concern is that the unit we received had a scratch on the top part out of the box. We hope that his is an isolated case and is not a quality control issue.

What actions have states taken more recently?

At press time states that had banned or restricted products containing delta-8 THC included Colorado and Washington – where recreational and medicinal use of marijuana is legal.

Noting that the Revised Code of Washington views all compounds of THC as Schedule I substances the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board in April issued a policy statement declaring that the production and sale of synthetically produced delta-8 products violates state law.

That same month Vermont clarified that the manufacture and use of hemp products containing delta-8 are prohibited under the state hemp program while the Kentucky Department of Agriculture declared delta-8 THC a Schedule I drug stating that distributing products containing delta-8 is illegal and could prompt “potential expo-sure to criminal prosecution.”

Several other states have taken steps to regulate delta-8 including Michigan. In July Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) signed legislation effective Oct. 11 that regulates the chemical compound allowing only licensed cannabis retailers to sell products containing delta-8 THC.

Rosman praised the action as a “very smart progressive approach” to the issue.

“Consumers won’t have to worry about potential heavy metal contamination chemical residues residual sol-vents microbiological contamination” he said. “And they can be assured that the potency that is on the label is accurate.”

A recent analysis of 38 products containing delta-8 THC by the CBD educational platform Leafreport shows that the chemical compound wasn’t clearly listed on the label or product description of 13 of them (34%) while 68% contained the incorrect amount.

In September the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a Health Alert Network advisory addressing concerns related to unclear labeling of products containing delta-8. The agency reminds the public to “be aware of possible limitations in the labeling of products containing THC and CBD” noting that labels displaying only the concentration of delta-9 but not total THC “may underestimate the psychoactive potential.”

NSC in a position statement writes: “Requiring cannabis or cannabis-derived products to have accurate information on packaging will improve public safety and allow authorized users of cannabis to use it in a safe and appropriate manner. It is imperative that consumers know what they are putting into their body and effective labeling requirements and oversight will directly benefit public health.”

What’s happening at the federal level?

Under an interim final rule published by the Drug Enforcement Administration in the Aug. 21 2020 Federal Register all synthetically derived THC remains a Schedule I controlled substance. Still the Farm Bill doesn’t reference DEA having oversight authority Caldwell said.

A DEA spokesperson told S+H that the agency was still reviewing public comments on the interim final rule and hadn’t yet made it final.

“As DEA is currently undergoing the rulemaking process regarding the implementation of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 – which includes the scope of regulatory controls over marijuana tetrahydrocannabinols and other marijuana-related constituents – we would be unable to comment on any impact in legality of tetrahydrocannabinols delta-8 included until the process is complete” the spokesperson said. “We are in the process of reviewing thousands of comments and do not speculate on what could happen as a result.”

During a June 16 webinar presented in conjunction with lab services provider Quest Diagnostics Caldwell said that “the world tilted on its axis in December of 2018 when the Farm Bill was passed” as certain types of cannabis no longer were considered Schedule I substances.

One ripple effect was an impact on employer drug testing Caldwell told S+H. For instance the departments of Transportation and Health and Human Services don’t accept CBD or hemp use as a reasonable explanation for a positive test for marijuana.

Under federal regulations motor carriers must conduct preemployment drug testing in addition to random testing. Employees who test positive are prohibited from performing safety-sensitive functions which includes operating a commercial motor vehicle.

In February 2020 DOT issued a compliance notice offering caution about CBD products.

“It remains unacceptable for any safety-sensitive employee subject to the Department of Transportation’s drug testing regulations to use marijuana” the notice states. “Since the use of CBD products could lead to a positive drug test result Department of Transportation-regulated safety-sensitive employees should exercise caution when considering whether to use CBD products.”

Is delta-8 detectable in drug testing?

Laboratories under the federal drug testing program screen for delta-9. Caldwell said she is aware of at least one lab that performs specialized delta-8 testing.

“The question is: Is there a demand for it? That would have to be developed” Caldwell said. “Do they have the ability? Sure. Most labs would. But it’s not widespread if at all.”

With confusion surrounding the legality of delta-8 THC therein lies another conundrum.

“Then of course the question is: What action do employers take if it is found in a specimen?” Caldwell said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTIwMjEtcGxheS02MC1yZWNhcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2020-2021 Play 60 Recap,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYnB1bHNlLmNvbS9kaXNlYXNlcy9pbmZlY3Rpb3VzL2FydGljbGUvMTUyOTk4NDIvZGlhZ25vc3RpY3MtYnktZHJvbmUtaXQtbWF5LWJlLWNsb3Nlci10aGFuLXlvdS10aGlua9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diagnostics by drone? It may be closer than you think,"The future is closer than you think. Unmanned aerial vehicles -- or drones -- delivering diagnostic tests or essential medicines to people may sound like science fiction. But drones are slowly being incorporated into the clinical laboratory workflow.

""Even though I spent four years working pretty intensely on medical drones for a long time I was feeling like 'Oh that will never happen'"" said Dr. Timothy Amukele PhD. ""But in fact it is happening.""

Amukele who is an assistant professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the associate director for clinical pathology programs for Pathologists Overseas has used drones on several clinical and medical projects in Africa.

The key benefit of using drones in medicine is their ability to provide access to healthcare in challenging settings such as in remote locations where there are no roads in urban high-traffic areas and in poor countries where access to medicines and diagnostic laboratories is limited by both distance and bad roads.

However drones are not yet a turnkey solution to all of healthcare's problems. Amukele spoke on drones and the clinical laboratory during a September 28 session of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry's annual meeting.

Drones meet diagnostic testing

Most of the exciting work in using drones for healthcare is occurring outside of the U.S. according to Amukele. For instance for the past five years drones have been delivering blood in Rwanda a country with difficult terrain. A drone can cut the time of blood delivery in the country from four hours to 15 minutes according to World Health Organization article.

Other examples include the 2016 UNICEF pilot drone program for rapid HIV testing of infants in Malawi. In 2017 a humanitarian drone corridor was set up in the region with help from UNICEF to deliver emergency medical supplies vaccines and samples for laboratory diagnosis.

Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit Malawi along with Rwanda and Ghana used drones to deliver regular medical commodities COVID-19 supplies and medical samples according to a UNICEF report.

In the U.S. the COVID-19 pandemic spurred a pilot program in 2020 among Quest Diagnostics DroneUp and Walmart to bring COVID-19 self-test kits to residents in parts of the U.S. including Cheektowaga NY Las Vegas and El Paso TX.

Medical samples delivered by drone

Amukele also noted a partnership in the U.S. that is ongoing: UPS and Matternet a technology platform-as-a-service company that was founded in 2010 in Mountain View CA.

The partnership was established in 2019 to deliver medical samples by drone across WakeMed a major healthcare system in North Carolina. During the pandemic the two companies collaborated on different projects including delivering COVID-19 vaccines to Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina.

Infectious disease testing is ""a great use case"" for Matternet according to Jon Michaeli global head of sales and business development at the company.

""If you're thinking of COVID-19 and PCR tests and things like that then response turnaround time is really important"" Michaeli said. ""First if [patients] are sick you need to get the treatment. And secondly are they contagious? Then they need to quarantine otherwise it can spread -- and quite quickly. Having a drone on demand ... to be able to provide the delivery to a lab for analysis means quicker turnaround time for the clinician and for the patient.""

With respect to the integrity of the COVID-19 swab samples Michaeli explained that samples are not affected by movement of the drones or from pressure changes resulting from altitude since the drones are not flying very high.

In September 2021 Matternet announced a partnership with Abu Dhabi-based technology company SkyGo. The companies announced a successful demo of a flight transporting patient PCR tests from Zayed Sports City Abu Dhabi to a laboratory. They plan to begin commercial operations delivering medical supplies medicine and blood units vaccines and samples between laboratories pharmacies and blood banks across healthcare facilities around Abu Dhabi in 2022 according to a release on Matternet's website.

What about lab samples?

As a laboratorian Amukele also wondered: Would drone flights affect lab samples?

He and his colleagues ran experiments that replicated how lab samples are transported and processed. In one such study published in the Journal of Clinical Pathology the group flew human blood samples across 161 miles of Arizona desert for three hours while a paired sample waited in a vehicle.

There were similar results for samples flown by drone and those delivered more traditionally for red blood cell white blood cell and platelet counts and sodium levels among other results. Statistically significant but small differences were seen in glucose and potassium levels due to temperature differences according to a release by John Hopkins.

The study indicated that drones can be an effective safe and timely way to quickly transport medical samples from remote sites to laboratories the release noted.

How does a laboratorian get involved with drones?

For laboratorians interested in incorporating drones into the lab workflow Amukele suggested staying current on the latest news on drones and health and working on a remote pilot license through the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

""The biggest thing is to stay abreast of what's happening in drones and health"" he said. ""A lot of the most exciting work is happening outside the U.S. for example the use of drones to deliver blood products in Rwanda -- that's been going on for about five years now.""

But the regulatory environment in the U.S. is hindering progress Amukele said.

""So far we have these proof-of-concept work going on mostly in poorer countries because it's just easier to kind of get going"" he said. ""Even if you wanted to just add an apple to a child's lunchbox you know here in the U.S. we would have to ... meet with committees.""

He added that rules in the U.S. state that ""you can't fly close to people or over people ... and you can't fly things that are potentially biohazardous which sounds fine. Except as laboratorians we know the whole point of hospitals -- that you have to get close to people. If you're sort of flying out in the desert it's not really that useful.""

In addition to the regulatory challenge Amukele cited other challenges to scaling up the use of drones in healthcare: low (but rising) public opinion engineering and infrastructure challenges and no industrywide quality standards among other issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi8yMDIxLzEwLzIzL3VudG9sZC1zdG9yeS1ob3ctZGl5LWV4cGVyaW1lbnRlcnMtd2FnZWQtd2FyLWNvdmlkLzYxMzQwODcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biohackers at the gate: The untold story of how DIY experimenters waged war on COVID,"Emily Baumgaertner

Los Angeles Times

In an old bank building in Brooklyn New York amateur microbiologists were tinkering with DNA when the anarchist appeared. Then came a robotics expert coders and other industry revolutionaries. Before long this collection of inventive if wildly independent experimenters would reimagine COVID-19 testing in the fight against a globe-crippling pandemic.

That moment in the spring of 2020 was emblematic of how disrupters upend the status quo to advance science and technology. Will Canine a biohacker and former Occupy Wall Street organizer and his team of idealists and iconoclasts launched a Kickstarter campaign to build a robot that they hoped would bypass elite labs and corporate monopolies to change the world. They succeeded.

The federal government and corporations such as LabCorp had failed to scale up COVID-19 testing which often involved a tedious liquid transfer process called pipetting. Canine and his fellow biohackers developed an automated robot platform to speed things along. The platforms have since been shipped to more than 40 countries with dramatic results: In New York City for example the turnaround time for test results went down to 12 hours from two weeks helping to quickly isolate infectious people and reduce the virus' reach.

Without the robots the pandemic probably would have killed thousands more in its early days. The platforms are now detecting and tracking new coronavirus variants and helping test for dozens of other infections including HIV and the flu. Few people have even heard of Opentrons. But the company — valued a year ago at $90 million — is now worth $1.8 billion.

The story of Canine's low-cost robot called OT-2 is part a broader movement by amateur scientists to democratize biotechnology in order to avert or correct catastrophic failures by the establishment.

Public access to biotech tools is accelerating at a pace that makes the software revolution of the late 20th century seem archaic. It presents monumental ethical challenges and makes law enforcement officials anxious over security threats. But COVID-19 has altered the political landscape of biotech exposing both the failures of a traditional diagnostic bureaucracy and the little-known army that came to its rescue using the lifesaving potential of open-source science.

Megan Palmer a biological engineer at Stanford who studies the intersection of security and biotech called it ""a moral imperative — a moment of pivotal global reflection where we decide: Are we going to build platforms to let everyone innovate?""

Long before the robot the microbiologists signed a lease in Brooklyn.

In 2013 every tenant at 33 Flatbush Ave. — the converted bank — appeared to be a hacker at heart: foam sculptors biofuel-inspired costume designers and a tech-artist group called Dark Matter Manufacturing. The buzzer of the building had been rewired to blast native birdcalls; sidewalk passers-by often glanced over their shoulders as a bald eagle clucked.

In the penthouse the lab called Genspace had a leaky roof and no air conditioning or heat. But it was better than the living room where the microbiologists had met before. Every inch of the lab overflowed with computers plants and projects. Concerned that such hacker spaces can attract unwanted attention one of the founders Daniel Grushkin announced safety guidelines and reached out to the FBI to dispel any rumors the group was dangerous.

Biohackers — homegrown geneticists who manipulate the code of life — had been mischaracterized for decades. They fell under increasing scrutiny after a string of biological incidents in the spring of 1995: a Japanese cult launched a deadly sarin attack in the Tokyo subway system; the Oklahoma City bomber killed 168 people using little more than corn fertilizer the explosive Tovex and drag-racing fuel; a neo-Nazi sympathizer Larry Wayne Harris stored three vials of a plague-causing bacteria in the glove compartment of his Subaru.

Fears over such attacks and other threats multiplied. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks about a decade before Genspace moved into the bank — a time when Canine was a troublemaking eighth grader reading comic books in the heart of Silicon Valley — law enforcement was responding to anthrax mailings and bracing the nation for a new era of terrorism.

———

FBI Special Agent Ed You had a particular interest in biological threats.

""Most weapons of mass destruction require very specific materials and knowledge; they're pretty well-tracked and well-regulated"" said You a former cancer researcher at Amgen. ""But biology is the opposite: The tools are naturally available. It's open-source by definition.""

Just as collaborative community labs proliferated in old bottle-cap factories and cellars so did the number of Americans plotting deadly attacks with chemicals blended in their bathtubs. To a layperson sinister concoctions and those meant to do good were indistinguishable.

In 2005 after dozens of FBI agents in hazmat suits had raided the home of a harmless bioartist — confiscating computers and petri dishes of nondangerous specimens — You realized how far behind the agency was at understanding legitimate biothreats. He swapped his lab coat for a badge joining a field office's terrorism task force and then the Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate.

His goal was to develop inroads with do-it-yourself biologists such as the ones who formed Genspace to encourage innovation and prevent disaster. He became the agency's biohacking insider courting the amateurs clanking beers at local lab parties and building a Rolodex of contacts. He was hard to miss: bald animated and often in his ascot cap.

You entered a world of colorful if often suspicious pioneers that included the likes of Aaron Traywick who injected himself with a homemade herpes treatment in front of a live audience. You met Thomas Landrain a Parisian with thick curls and a beard who'd designed biosensors or microscopic eyes and ears planted onto bacteria; once engineered those organisms could alert militaries to unseen dangers in thick woodlands or the Pacific.

He knew of the biohacker in Germany who used dog saliva on tennis balls to discern which neighbor was allowing a pet to poop on his front lawn and a breeder who used human sperm to test out gene-editing ideas before introducing them to puppies. There were still more: biohackers trying to cure cancer create home-brewed insulin implant chips under their own skin.

You discovered that most biohackers live by the software revolution's concept of the Cathedral and the Bazaar: the notion that when knowledge and power are concentrated society sees great losses in efficiency. Their approach is to propel grassroots innovation to tear down the cathedrals and convert them into open-source bazaars.

""DIY-Bio actually started educating the FBI telling them how people could modify yeast to make opioid precursors. It was 'Breaking Bad' to Brewing Bad"" You said. ""I knew we were going to need these guys.""

———

Canine was looking to experiment. He wanted to extract and read DNA from his inside cheek but his unsteady hand kept bungling the pipetting process at Genspace. That's when the robot idea struck him.

He had no background in molecular biology but his ties to Occupy Wall Street — he'd twice gone to jail for his protesting — convinced him that DIY-bio was part of a larger movement hedging against a capitalist takeover. It infuriated him that only the most elite labs used automated machines often designed decades ago that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. And as a student of artistic engineering Canine who had experience with 3D printers imagined a better way.

""I could download a unicorn head and print it out — so why couldn't I download and print this experiment?"" he asked.

""Biotechnology is how we heal ourselves. It's the most important technology yet the least accessible"" he added. ""I wanted to give people tools to have a new type of power.""

Canine enlisted a techie from a DIY-Bio listserv — Chiu Chau who had already built a first model of Canine's robot idea in his New Jersey garage. The two recruited software gurus to design a robot interface that let lab technicians choose various ingredients and commands. Once materials were loaded tiny syringes called micropipettes plunged into wells in unison and transported fluids thousands of times. Canine's company Opentrons was born.

Community biologists could now quicken and expand their lab work and share protocols around the world. That to Canine was power. And to biohackers everywhere it was a perfect bazaar.

In 2014 the Opentrons invention was accepted into Haxlr8r a summer-long hardware accelerator in Shenzhen China that turned the robot into a mass-manufacturable product. Then on Halloween at a microbe-engineering competition in Boston two worlds briefly crossed orbits.

Dressed in a blue sport coat Special Agent You was mingling among thousands in the convention center. Canine was there with his new robot prototype. He was hard to miss wearing a glow-in-the-dark skeleton costume sneakers a boyish haircut — and a big grin.

""He came right over and he said 'Can I show you what we got?'"" You recalled.

That day Opentrons launched its Kickstarter campaign. Its success meant the robot team had to expand outside Genspace. Its members migrated down to the fourth floor at 33 Flatbush beside a Marxist journal's headquarters the windowless suites stacked floor to ceiling with socialist theory books and mechanical arms.

After getting into Y Combinator — a seed accelerator used to launch startups such as Airbnb and DoorDash — Opentrons brought on Jonathan Brennan-Badal as its new chief executive. Brennan-Badal had helped ComiXology a digital comic book platform outpace Apple and Amazon. He'd transformed one industry and wanted to do it again.

As Opentrons published papers and coded robots seeking the right market fit none of its biohackers knew a disaster of graphic novel proportions was about to unfold.

———

The American health care system was in free fall in February 2020. The novel coronavirus was rippling across the nation and the only way to slow transmission was to detect cases. But budgets had been gutted. Government testing criteria were too narrow. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's assay fell flat. At the pinnacle of all the federal agencies President Donald Trump simply proposed a biohacking solution of his own: Try injecting yourself with Clorox.

Traditional companies such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics vowed to test and isolate coronavirus patients across the country. But their supply chains buckled and with them any hope of delivering test results while they were still relevant. By late March more than 150000 samples had piled up at Quest unprocessed — about half of the total number the company had received.

The fragmented and siloed world of laboratory science became the crux of the crisis; the fate of millions rested upon hand pipettes and fax machines. But when the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations to allow more competition the regulatory barriers once faced by Opentrons evaporated overnight. The company shipped hundreds of OT-2 robots to U.S. cities and beyond. They were deployed to pop-up labs built in shipping containers in London. At one hospital in Spain grateful lab technicians named each robot after a loved one lost to COVID-19: Joan. Javier. Paco.

———

Today behind the scenes of America's COVID-19 testing infrastructure OT-2 robots are helping screen millions for the virus: elementary school students nursing home residents patients headed in for surgery. The tests often cost as little as a dollar per person resulting in savings of $150 million.

Customers include the Mayo Clinic Harvard Stanford Caltech MIT and even BioNTech the German company that developed a COVID-19 vaccine with Pfizer. More than 2000 scientists from across the world are now plugged into Opentrons hardware-software ecosystem. Its largest impact has been in New York City where a 5000-square-foot facility can handle up to 50000 patient samples per day.

""A lab is an orchestra of machines"" said Julian Moncada the company's head of strategy and innovation who works among a staff of 120 scurrying in blue coats and gloves along an around-the-clock assembly line. ""But the software is the conductor.""

Since January 2021 OpenTrons has sequenced 25000 genomes from positive coronavirus test samples in New York helping scientists detect new variants: in February the beta variant; in April the delta variant; in June the delta-plus — a virus with a blend of mutations first detected in India and South Africa.

Opentrons — which has grown to more than 500 employees — wasn't the only biohacking firm to mobilize against COVID-19. A generation of disrupters has emerged from the shadows. When a respirator company depleted its inventory but refused to share its design startup engineers built them out of snorkeling masks and 3D-printed valves. Maker's Asylum a hackerspace in India recruited volunteers with laser cutters in 42 cities to produce more than a million face shields.

You the FBI agent is not surprised. He recently finished a national security detail to the Department of Health and Human Services for the pandemic response and is back doing the work he loves most: hanging with hackers. He's focusing on the convergence of cyber and biohacking threats including those coming from foreign governments to undermine health systems and upset the battle against COVID-19.

""Whether you're part of a major lab workflow in the U.S. like Opentrons or you're working on code in your home lab there are brand-new vulnerabilities — a lot at stake"" he said. ""Wouldn't it have been nice if someone like me had met with Steve Jobs back in the beginning?""

Everyone is the looking for the next breakthrough innovation. Genspace the dynamic community founded in the Brooklyn bank building has moved to a palatial space in Sunset Park. It is hosting in-person classes for biotech denizens with big imaginations: genome editing kombucha papermaking painting with microbes.

Last weekend it offered a biohacker boot camp pipetting and all.",,,

— Tom Brady says he's not one for collecting a lot of mementos documenting his many accomplishments during an unsurpassed 22-year career. Becoming the first player to throw 600 career touchdown passes is pretty special though.

In that improbable moment Kennedy a 29-year-old St. Petersburg High alumnus literally was handed a priceless NFL memento by Evans himself — only to hand it right back moments later.

“I was hesitant to give it back” Kennedy said.

Seated in the front row of the north end zone at Raymond James Stadium with longtime buddy (and season ticket holder) Riley Carvalis Kennedy watched Evans snag a 9-yard Tom Brady touchdown pass in the first quarter’s waning moments. Unbeknownst to him — and Evans evidently — it was Brady’s 600th touchdown toss.

“I was taking a video and I switched it to my face and then I went to switch it back to facing (the field) and when I did that Mike Evans was running at me” said Kennedy a resident at Largo Medical Center. “Right when I looked down he jumped up and gave me a hug and handed me the ball.”

Shortly thereafter a Bucs staffer approached Kennedy indicating Brady wanted the ball.

“I said ‘You’re going to have to go give that guy two jerseys to get that ball back’” Bucs coach Bruce Arians said. “It was like ‘Either give him two of Tom’s (jerseys) but you need to get that ball back for him.’”

Brady who brought the ball (concealed in a duffel bag) to his postgame news conference called Kennedy’s gesture “pretty cool.”

“He’s going to get something nice in return so we’ll get him a helmet or a couple of jerseys or some other stuff” Brady said. “It was really cool of (Kennedy) to do that.”

The Bucs on Monday said they are giving Kennedy two signed jerseys and a helmet from Brady a signed Evans jersey Evans’ game cleats a $1000 credit at their team store and two season passes for the remainder of this season as well as next season and Brady was giving him a Bitcoin.

Evans wasn’t made available to reporters after the game but later tweeted: “Sorry big bro glad that priceless legendary item was retrieved” followed by praying hands and goat emojis.

Ken Goldin founder of Goldin Auctions (specializing in collectibles trading cards and memorabilia) indicated via Twitter that the ball “easily” could go for $500000.

“I knew how much it meant to Tom” said Kennedy who was given a different ball after handing over the historic one “and I was willing to trade.”

EASILY $500000

People saying no have zero clue about the memorabilia and trading card market. And it could easily go for $900000 aslikely as it goes for $500K

Compare that to 500 HR balls in baseball that can sell for $250k + and been done 28 times. This is one of a kind and — Ken Goldin (@KenGoldin) October 24 2021

Brady 44 became the first player in NFL history to throw at least 600 career touchdown passes during the regular season Sunday.

Brady accomplished the feat by throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mike Evans with six seconds left in the first quarter helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers take a 21-0 lead on the Chicago Bears at Raymond James Stadium.

Brady threw four touchdowns in the first half and the Buccaneers beat the Bears 38-3.

With several months' worth of FSR integration into games and over three years of increasing DLSS use among games and game engines we're now equipped to shed a bit more light on how the two technologies compare.



We've selected four games that each support both technologies so we can provide direct comparisons between them. We've also tested on one AMD and one Nvidia GPU for each game. This will allow us to compare performance scaling between the different rendering modes as well as comparing image quality.



There's more to life than pure performance though we do track that in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy. Image quality and perhaps more importantly image quality while reaching high frame rates is what we really want. DLSS and FSR tackle this problem in very different ways which we'll briefly cover here before getting into the results of our comparisons.

Nvidia DLSS Overview

(Image credit: Nvidia)

Nvidia created DLSS to improve performance without drastically reducing image quality but just as important Nvidia wanted a good way for modern games to render at lower resolutions and then upscale so that things like real-time ray tracing would be more viable on mainstream hardware. To that end Nvidia added tensor core hardware to it's RTX 20-series GPUs and basically doubled down on the tensor core performance with the RTX 30-series.



Tensor operations aren't something Nvidia invented as they've been used and discussed in machine learning circles for a while now. The basic idea is to create special-purpose hardware that has enough precision combined with tons of compute to make the training and inference processes associated with artificial intelligence run better.



The RTX GPUs use FP16 (16-bit floating point) operations and each tensor core on the RTX 20-series can work with 64 separate pieces of data while the RTX 30-series GPUs can work on 128 chunks of data. The RTX 30-series also supports sparsity which basically means that the hardware can skip multiplication by zero and effectively double its performance. The net result is that an RTX 2070 has a potential 59.7 TFLOPS of FP16 compute while the RTX 3070 has a potential 163 TFLOPS of FP16 compute.



All of that computational power gets used to upscale and enhanced frames using inputs from previous frames the lower resolution current frame and an AI network trained on how to make lower resolution images look like they were rendered at a higher resolution.



Nvidia offers four DLSS modes: Quality mode renders at half the target resolution balanced renders at one third the target resolution performance uses one fourth the resolution and ultra performance is one ninth the final resolution. Or at least that's the theory. In practice it seems games have a bit of leeway in their rendered resolution.

AMD FSR Overview

(Image credit: AMD)

AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution involves far less computational work. It's a post-processing algorithm that has been designed to upscale and enhance frames but without all of the deep learning stuff tensor cores and massive amounts of compute. Basically it upscales an image using a spatial algorithm (it only looks at the current frame) and then has some edge detection and sharpening filters to improve the overall look — or if you want specifics it's Lanczos upscaling with edge detection.



While that may not sound as impressive as DLSS FSR does have some pretty major advantages. The biggest is that FSR can run on pretty much any relatively modern GPU. We've tested it on Intel's UHD 630 AMD GPUs going back as far as the RX 500-series and Nvidia GPUs from the GTX 900-series and it worked on all of them. Also FSR is open-source meaning others are free to adopt it modify it etc.



The FSR algorithm basically uses the shaders that are part of all modern GPUs to do the heavy lifting. As with DLSS there are four modes commonly available: ultra quality quality balanced and performance. AMD uses different scaling factors of 1.3x at ultra quality 1.5x for quality 1.7x for balanced and 2.0 for performance. Those scaling factors apply in both horizontal and vertical dimensions so performance mode ends up being 4x upscaling (the same as Nvidia's performance mode).

DLSS vs. FSR Test Setup

We've selected four games that support both FSR and DLSS for this article. The latest release is Back 4 Blood which came out earlier in October — you can read our full Back 4 Blood benchmarks article for more details on how that game runs and what settings are available. The Myst remake also came out in August 2021 and it uses Unreal Engine 4 to allow you to walk around a fully rendered world unlike the original point and click adventure of the 90s. Next is Deathloop (and I refuse to capitalize the whole name silly Arkane) which released in September. Last (and perhaps least) Marvel's Avengers originally launched without DLSS support but it was added a month later in October 2020 with FSR support added in July 2021.



That's three relatively recent games plus an older game but there are a few others as well. Baldur's Gate III (RPG) supports both DLSS and FSR in the latest early access branch. Other games with FSR and DLSS include Chernobylite (sci-fi survival) Edge of Eternity (a JRPG) Enlisted (multiplayer war shooter) F1 2021 (race car sim) The Medium (adventure) and Necromunda: Hired Gun (shooter). Chernobylite and Necromunda both use Unreal Engine for their DLSS and FSR support just like Myst and we'll probably see quite a few Unreal Engine games in the future with both DLSS and FSR.

Test System for GPU Benchmarks

Intel Core i9-9900K

Corsair H150i Pro RGB

MSI MEG Z390 Ace

Corsair 32GB DDR4-3600 (2x 16GB)

XPG SX8200 Pro 2TB

Windows 10 Pro (21H1)



For testing we're using our standard GPU testbed with a Core i9-9900K CPU 32GB RAM and a 2TB M.2 SSD. We used the GeForce RTX 2060 and Radeon RX 5600 XT in Back 4 Blood since it's the least demanding of the four games and we wanted to look at performance scaling on slightly older and less capable GPUs in that game. The other games we tested with the GeForce RTX 3060 and the Radeon RX 6700 XT. Both have 12GB of VRAM which generally ensured we didn't run into VRAM limitations. The other three games also support ray tracing which we enabled for all of our testing.



The RX 6700 XT normally outperforms the RTX 3060 by a decent amount (by 34% in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy) so we're not really comparing AMD vs. Nvidia performance but rather looking at how DLSS and FSR affect performance. However the use of ray tracing does narrow the gap some as Nvidia's GPUs generally offer better RT performance. And with that out of the way let's look at the results from the four games.

DLSS vs. FSR: Back 4 Blood

We have separate AMD and Nvidia charts since only the Nvidia GPUs support DLSS. Starting with the RTX 2060 even in ultra performance mode DLSS only improved performance by a bit less than 50% while FSR in performance mode boosted framerates by over 90%. Each higher upscaling factor in DLSS improved performance by about 10% with a slightly larger jump going from performance to ultra performance mode.



For FSR each level of upscaling improved performance by closer to 20% on the RTX 2060. It's possible our use of previous generation hardware was a factor in how much performance improved but in general Back 4 Blood wasn't a super demanding game and so CPU bottlenecks can start to be a factor.

Somewhat surprisingly the RX 5600 XT showed slightly lower overall scaling compared to the RTX 2060. Framerates improved by up to 87% using performance mode just a bit lower than the 91% we measured on the RTX 2060 — and most of the other levels are also 1–2% less of an improvement with the exception being ultra quality mode where both GPUs improved by the same 18%.



At least when looking at Turing and RDNA GPUs then FSR doesn't appear to favor AMD's architecture at all. But performance as we said in the beginning is only part of the story. Let's take a look at image quality.

You'll want to open up those 4K images and view at full magnification to see the finer details. We also saved using maximum quality JPG files so there shouldn't be any noticeable loss in quality compared to the source PNG files (which were about 14MB each).



There's a minimal loss in visual fidelity going from no upscaling to FSR ultra quality — you can probably spot a few small details that get blurred out but nothing particularly noteworthy especially when the game's in motion. FSR quality also looks quite good while FSR balanced starts to look a bit blurry and finally there's a clear loss in crispness using FSR performance mode. The branches and needles grass fences ground corrugated metal roof panels and other elements all look a bit fuzzy using the balanced and performance FSR modes. However in motion — this is a fast-paced zombie shooter after all — a lot of those differences become far less noticeable.



Move on to DLSS upscaling and again there's a minimal loss in detail using quality mode a bit more fuzziness with balanced mode and more noticeable blurring and lack of fine details with the performance and ultra performance modes. In motion you might register the fuzziness during less intense parts of the game but when you're fighting zombies it's all good. Which is surprising when you consider the 1280x720 source resolution with DLSS ultra performance mode.



If all of the DLSS and FSR games we tested looked and performed like Back 4 Blood we'd be quite happy. Unfortunately this is one of the better results for image quality using FSR. It's not clear why some of the other games look noticeably worse but let's see for ourselves.

DLSS vs. FSR: Deathloop

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Deathloop was promoted by AMD but it added DLSS with an update and also changed the 120 fps cap to 240 fps — both welcome changes in our book. DLSS ultra performance mode isn't supported so that's one less scaling option to choose from this time.



We're using faster GPUs this time but the performance scaling from the various modes ends up favoring Nvidia quite a bit for some reason. Perhaps it's because we're also using ray tracing but we still would have expected similar gains from the FSR modes. DLSS performance scaling was also markedly better in Deathloop.



For the RTX 3060 DLSS quality mode boosted framerates by 55% balanced improved performance by 87% and performance mode was over twice as fast — 111% faster to be precise. Sticking with the 3060 FSR ultra quality improved performance by 47% quality mode gave an 80% increase balanced was 111% (the same as DLSS performance mode) and FSR performance mode yielded a 153% improvement in fps. Note that the starting point was just 28 fps however and only FSR performance mode got the RTX 3060 to a (mostly) steady 60+ fps.



On the RX 6700 XT the gains were generally quite a bit lower. FSR ultra quality only improved performance by 18% quality mode bumped that to 45% balanced mode gave a 64% increase and performance mode slightly more than doubled performance with a 102% gain. Interestingly performance at native resolution without FSR was 31 fps while FSR performance mode ended up at 62 fps so the RX 6700 XT started out faster than the 3060 but ended up slower. (Note: I may need to retest just to verify these numbers because they're a bit odd.)

Again you need to click the enlarge button and access the full-size images to see the details better. This time unfortunately the image fidelity comparisons don't do FSR any favors. We've got two sets of images and there's some clear aliasing present at higher FSR levels on the first set (right below the ""Expand Your Mind"" sign). But the ultra quality and quality modes can be used pretty much without complaint.



DLSS image quality is interesting because this time there are things that look better with DLSS quality mode than at native — look at the railing above the roof for example. In fact DLSS performance mode still looks almost the same as native mode which is quite impressive.



In the second set of images look at the rock face of the arch the writing on signs and other fine details like the lights on the red arrow sign and you see a very noticeable drop in details even with FSR quality mode and it only gets worse at the higher upscaling settings. DLSS doesn't look better than native this time but all three modes look very close to the same.



I do wonder if standing still for a screenshot perhaps benefits DLSS too much. It uses temporal data — meaning data from previous frames — to help recover lost detail and it could be that standing still presents a perfect opportunity for it to look nearly perfect. Still it's when you're not really moving around that the fine details are actually noticeable and DLSS works wonders in that case.



Based on performance gains this time DLSS gets the nod. You can play using performance mode at 4K and still get a very good overall experience visually while FSR boosts performance but causes a noticeable loss in fine details for some areas of the game. FSR ultra quality is still worth a shot but I wouldn't want to use the balanced or performance modes if I could avoid it.

DLSS vs. FSR: Myst 2021

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Myst performance improvements are a bit better than what we saw in Deathloop but still tended to favor the RTX 3060. Ultra quality FSR boosts fps by 51% on the 3060 and 44% on the 6700 XT quality mode yields an 86% gain on the 3060 vs. 71% on the 6700 XT balanced was 121% compared to 100% and performance increased by 175% versus 132%. These are both the latest GPU architectures so it's interesting that FSR actually appears to run better on Ampere than on RDNA2 at least in some cases.



As for DLSS ultra performance mode basically matched FSR performance mode with a 178% increase in fps. DLSS performance mode likewise matched FSR balanced mode at 121% higher fps while DLSS balanced mode gave a 91% improvement and even quality mode boosted framerates by 63%. Myst isn't a fast-paced action game so high fps isn't really required but both GPUs easily managed more than 60 fps at 4K with the right upscaling settings — DLSS balanced or FSR quality or higher for the RTX 3060 and the RX 6700 XT got slightly more than 60 fps even with native rendering.

Image quality again ends up a bit of a blurry mess with FSR at higher scaling factors. It's not awful but the trees and other details all start to look noticeably worse with the balanced and performance modes. DLSS looks better at least up until the ultra performance mode.



Our second image test scene ended up being worthless as you can see from the screen captures. All the swirling fog makes it hard to tell what's changing from upscaling and what looks different from the fog which is a good illustration of times where you can get away with even FSR performance mode and not really notice the loss of fidelity.



Overall DLSS looked better and performed well in Myst but non-RTX users can certainly run FSR in the ultra quality or quality modes and get higher performance for a relatively unobtrusive drop in crispness and detail.

DLSS vs. FSR: Marvel's Avengers

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Last we have the oldest game of the bunch Marvel's Avengers. It has some oddities that immediately stand out with DLSS specifically that the balanced and quality modes perform basically the same — actually quality mode performed slightly better. Other than that one oddity though things mostly make sense.



The AMD and Nvidia GPUs we tested were a lot closer in scaling this time with the biggest difference being just 3% — the RTX 3060 ran 59% faster with FSR quality mode vs. native while the RX 6700 XT improved by 57% for example.



DLSS ultra performance mode ended up providing the highest performance on the 3060 though again the 9x resolution upscaling was definitely noticeable. Either way you can potentially double your performance in Avengers with the highest upscaling modes from FSR and DLSS.

As with the second image set in Myst there's a lot of vapor and clouds and such swirling around in Avengers which makes it a bit more difficult to see what changed due to FSR and DLSS and what changed just because of the weather. DLSS quality mode is visually indistinguishable from native rendering though and it's equally difficult to spot any differences between native and FSR ultra quality. FSR performance on the other hand certainly looks blurrier. The trees and shrubberies also show more blockiness with FSR than with DLSS.



But when you're in the middle of a fight? Yeah it all sort of blends together. Which is why so many console games have used upscaling in various forms for years without too many complaints from the gamers.

DLSS vs. FSR the Bottom Line

(Image credit: Shutterstock AMD Nvidia)

If you were hoping to see a clear winner there are far too many factors in play. DLSS certainly seems to be more capable of producing near-native quality images especially at higher upscaling factors but it requires far more computational horsepower and at times doesn't improve performance as much as we'd like. More importantly it's an Nvidia-only technology and not just that an RTX-only tech. All the Nvidia users with GTX cards are out of luck as are AMD card owners and Intel GPU users.



FSR doesn't win the image quality matchup particularly in higher upscaling modes but if you're running at 4K and use the ultra quality or quality mode you'll get a boost in performance and probably won't miss the few details that got lost in the shuffle. FSR performance mode however can look pretty bad. In fact I'd prefer running a game at 1080p and letting my monitor stretch that to 4K rather than using FSR performance mode. Balanced mode likewise should only be used if you're in dire need of improved performance.



The wildcard in this discussion is Intel's upcoming XeSS. It sounds a lot like DLSS and one of the people who helped design DLSS left Nvidia to go work for Intel. It will supposedly work on most modern GPUs —Intel AMD or Nvidia — but how well it works is very much unknown. It will use Intel's version of tensor cores for Arc and fall back to DP4a calculations for other GPUs. Plus making a good upscaling algorithm isn't the same as getting it adopted by game developers.



We also didn't get into more traditional forms of upscaling which quite a few games have been using for years. Temporal or spatial upscaling techniques that only drop performance a few percent exist and many games even have dynamic scaling where you target your monitor refresh rate and the game adjusts the resolution on the fly. It may not look quite the same but there are a lot of times where you won't even notice or care.



In terms of adoption rates Nvidia DLSS still leads AMD FSR thanks to its lengthy head start. AMD FSR has been announced or released in at least 27 games at present while Nvidia DLSS is now available in at least 119 games (though many on Nvidia's DLSS list are lesser known indie games). With Unreal Engine and Unity both supporting DLSS and FSR now though we expect we'll see plenty more games incorporating both technologies going forward — and maybe even XeSS as well.



Ultimately games and game developers now have several choices available and that's a good thing. As shown here adopting one of the technologies doesn't preclude supporting the other. Over time we hope to see continued improvements in both algorithms and it's something we'll continue to monitor going forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9udmlkaWEtcnR4LWEyMDAwLXdvcmtzdGF0aW9uLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtc2hvd2Nhc2VzLWltcHJlc3NpdmUtbWluaW5nLWVmZmljaWVuY3ktdXAtdG8tNDEtbWgtcy11bmRlci03MC13YXR0cy_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXJ0eC1hMjAwMC13b3Jrc3RhdGlvbi1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkLXNob3djYXNlcy1pbXByZXNzaXZlLW1pbmluZy1lZmZpY2llbmN5LXVwLXRvLTQxLW1oLXMtdW5kZXItNzAtd2F0dHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA RTX A2000 Workstation Graphics Card Showcases Impressive Mining Efficiency Up To 41 MH/s Under 70 Watts,"It looks like the smallest NVIDIA Ampere workstation graphics card the RTX A2000 offers the best mining efficiency of all GPUs so far. Tested by Mining channel Dizzy Mining the RTX A2000 delivers some impressive efficiency figures when mining Ethereum.

NVIDIA RTX A2000 Is The Most Efficient Mining GPU Ever! Produces Up To 41 MH/s at Just 66W

The NVIDIA RTX A2000 features the Ampere GPU architecture. In terms of specifications the RTX A2000 rocks the GA106 GPU which is equipped with 3328 CUDA cores 104 Tensor cores and 26 RT cores all of which offer a nice performance bump over the previous generation offerings. In terms of memory the card is equipped with 6 GB GDDR6 capacity that runs across a 192-bit bus interface and the DRAM features ECC support for error-free computing.

The RTX A2000 itself comes in a small form factor design featuring a half-height and half-length board. The card even has a small blower type-fan on the shroud. Since this is a 70W TDP card there are no power connectors. It's a simple plug-and-use card that offers great efficiency in a compact design. There are four Mini DisplayPorts (1.4) near the rear panel IO shroud which also comes with a small vent to exhaust hot air out.

As for mining performance the NVIDIA RTX A2000 delivers up to 41 MH/s at just 66W when tuned. The core clock was increased by +100 MHz while the memory clock was adjusted to +1500 MHz. In terms of power limit the slider was moved to 95% while the fan speed is pushed to 100%. The card peaks at 51C at full load in mining. Interestingly enabling ECC while mining hammered the mining performance a lot so it's better to keep it disabled if you plan on mining on the workstation card. In terms of mining efficiency the RTX A2000 now takes the lead over the RX 6600:

AMD RX 6600 XT (Tuned) - ~33 MH/s @ 55W (0.59 PPW)

~33 MH/s @ 55W (0.59 PPW) AMD RX 6600 Non-XT (Tuned) - ~30 MH/s @ 50W (0.61 PPW)

~30 MH/s @ 50W (0.61 PPW) NVIDIA RTX A2000 (Tuned) - ~41 MH/s @ 66W (0.62 PPW)

Availability and pricing is another thing though. The NVIDIA RTX A2000 is priced at $649.99 US and will be hitting retail outlets in December. Since the video went live many miners have started pre-ordering the graphics card and are expecting delivery by the mid of November.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvYXBwbGUtbTEtbWF4LWNydXNoZXMtZmlyc3QtZ2VuLW0xLWluLWxlYWtlZC1iZW5jaG1hcmtz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple M1 Max Smokes First-Gen M1 In Leaked Benchmark But Is Obliterated By RTX 30 Laptops,"



The M1 Max MacBook Pro unsurprisingly thumps the M1 Mac mini



Regardless the M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pro posts some pretty impressive performance in the Geekbench Compute benchmark. Running with Apple's low-level Metal API it posted a score of 68870.





That's pretty fast but not entirely unheard-of. We took some of our own Apple hardware as a point of comparison to see just how far Apple's GPU technology had come. Of course we had to include our M1 Mac mini along with the iPhone 13 Pro that we recently reviewed. But more importantly how do these scores hold up to PC hardware?





Well we've got a couple laptops available as points of reference: The MSI GE76 Raider that we reviewed back in September and a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme that will be reviewed soon. The MSI is big heavy and ridiculously fast—the GPU's 125-watt TDP is nearly as high as the 140-Watt MacBook charger is capable of delivering to the whole system. Meanwhile the ThinkPad is a lightweight machine with an 11th-gen Tiger Lake Core i9 and a GeForce RTX 3060 mobile GPU which is closer in size class to the 16-inch MacBook Pro.





The end result was not particularly close at either end of the spectrum. Starting with Apple versus itself comparison the leaked M1 Max obliterated the previous generation M1 with scores we obtained ourselves on a 2020 Mac mini. Apple's latest silicon if the leaked score proves accurate is more than three times faster in this benchmark.







However when we turn our attention to Windows laptops the end result was not closer either though not in the M1 Max's favor. The MSI GE76 Raider more than doubled up on the supposed MacBook Pro. The Vulkan test flat-out refused to use the discrete GPU and relied on the built-in UHD graphics of the Core i9-11980HK posting sub-8400 point scores with NVIDIA's latest drivers installed. On the other hand the ThinkPad X1 Extreme is probably a better comparison due to its lower size and weight but even then it still gave Apple a hefty defeat.





Apple's GPUs might be able to keep up with a GeForce RTX 3080 in GFXBench but it seems that NVIDIA has the absolute performance upper-hand on the compute side.

Right about a year ago Apple announced the first Macs with its own home-grown processor technology dubbed the M1. The first 13-inch MacBook Pro MacBook Air and Mac mini shipped with the company's new wonder-chip and even the base model $700 Mac mini knocked our socks off at the time. However CPUs don't stand still and in the intervening year the company's rivals have released newer processors while Apple was happy to merely add the M1 to new iMacs. That is until this past Monday when the newly-designed 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros became official.Apple spent a considerable amount of time bragging about how fast its new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors are but it's hard to take any company's marketing numbers seriously. Sometimes performance claims can't be fully appreciated when they're just numbers on a slide in a keynote presentation. That's why it's good to see that M1 Max performance numbers have started to leak online. Over the last year it seems Apple has made some serious strides with its latest processors putting the lowly M1 to shame.Poke around the Geekbench database for a while and we're starting to see results for a model named ""MacBookPro182"" which is apparently one of the new machines. This particular example is armed with the M1 Max chip which has either a 24-core or 32-core GPU. What's unfortunate is that Geekbench doesn't know the difference between the two. However the 24-core GPU is only available in custom orders where the 16-inch model with an M1 Max has the 32-core GPU. For that reason we are guessing this is the 32-core model (but don't hold us to it).It remains to be seen what the power draw on the revamped MacBooks end up being and the big question is whether that was truly the top-end 32-core GPU in the leaked benchmark. Personally I'm eager to get my hands on one of those MacBooks for myself but Apple's quoted ship dates are already slipping into late November. Meanwhile enthusiasts who are looking for a speedy thin 16-inch notebook would do well to hang on for our ThinkPad X1 Extreme review coming before too awful long.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3ZpZGVvY2FyZHouY29tL25ld3ovaW50ZWwtY29yZS1pNS0xMjYwMGstYWxkZXItbGFrZS1jcHUtaXMtbmVhcmx5LTQ3LWZhc3Rlci10aGFuLXJ5emVuLTUtNTYwMHgtaW4tbXVsdGktdGhyZWFkZWQtY3B1LXotdGVzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i5-12600K Alder Lake CPU is nearly 47% faster than Ryzen 5 5600X in multi-threaded CPU-Z test,"Intel Core i5-12600K is 46.7% faster than Ryzen 5 5600X in the multi-threaded test

The performance of the upcoming Core i5 CPU based on Alder Lake silicon has been revealed by two leakers.

The results of the upcoming Core i5-12600K processor featuring 6 Performance and 4 Efficient cores have been revealed @9550pro and @TUM_APISAK who posted screenshots from the CPU-Z test of the processor. According to the data posted by @9550pro at stock the CPU scores 746 points in the single-threaded test and 7058 points in the multi-threaded. The result posted by @TUM_APISAK supposedly showing overclocked performance increases the numbers to 79X points and 72XX points respectively. Unfortunately neither of the two leakers confirm the clock speeds and the settings used for the test. Furthermore the OC score was supposedly taken using Windows 10 while the stock score is from Windows 11.

Such performance puts the processor above the current flagship from the 11th Gen Core Rocket Lake-S series which scores 746 and 6563 points in single and multi-threaded tests. The i5-12600K is also a lot faster than Ryzen 5 5600X which scores 624 and 4811 points respectively which means that Alder Lake SKU is 19.5% and 46.7% faster.

However compared to 2018's Arm technology the newest Arm GPU is boasting workloads at speeds of almost five times faster.

Next-Gen Arm GPUs Offer Almost Twice The Performance Improvement & 4.7x Increase In FP32 & Machine Learning Workloads Respectively

Ian Bratt Senior Director of Technology for the ML Business Unit at Arm premiered a demonstration of the speed of the machine learning performance with Arm's newest technology. The Arm GPU architecture for 2022 will now produce 4.7 times faster FP32 ML workloads than the Mali-G76 when focusing on per-core performance quality.

It is still unknown how the new performance specifications for the FP32 ML affect overall performance in wattage and games in general. The Arm Mali G-710 offers ""35% higher ML performance and a 20% higher graphics performance in an ISO-process node GPU configuration compared to a Mali-G78 implementation.""

ML's performance is integral to Arm's future. The manufacturer will need to give developers the tools to utilize their latest next-gen tech which can be easier said than done.

""It's more than just adding instructions and improving hardware IP we also have to provide the software the tools the libraries to enable that ML performance."" — Ian Bratt in an interview with The Register

With Arm recently acquired by tech giant NVIDIA it is unsure the evolution of Arm's technology considering that in the last several years Arm went from a semi-stagnant company to increasing development and supply for the GPU architectural developments for the company.

Arm Limited is a Santa Clara California-based company and is also ""the world's largest supplier of discrete GPUs as well as compute GPUs used for a variety of workloads including machine learning."" With NVIDIA recently acquiring the company it will be interesting to see how Team Green will utilize Arm's technology to build more discreet and powerful integrated GPUs as well as standard GPU and other areas of development such as AI and even more advanced machine learning workloads.

In September the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would allow licensed pharmacists to administer certain COVID-19 therapies. While REGEN-COV is not FDA approved it is authorized under an emergency use authorization.

""We are one of the only community pharmacies who got approved for the treatment"" said Marwa Bakr owner and pharmacist at Infinity Pharmacy.

More than a year and a half into the pandemic COVID-19 treatment options for some are now available.

Just last week Bakr received her first shipment of REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) a monoclonal antibody treatment from Regeneron.

""The monoclonal antibody treatment helps to neutralize the effect of the COVID-19 virus and reduce the progression of the virus and minimize the hospitalization rate of the patient"" said Bakr.

The treatment is administered to patients at the pharmacy through four subcutaneous injections – in the upper arms thighs or abdomen. All four injections are given in the same visit.

""It's 70% effective"" said Bakr.

To be eligible to receive REGEN-COV you must:

Be at least 12 years old

Test positive for COVID-19

Experience mild to moderate symptoms not severe

Get the treatment within 10 days of symptom-onset

Have an underlying health condition

At Infinity Pharmacy appointments are necessary for this treatment. Patients should expect it to take 90 minutes as the pharmacist will need to monitor the patient for one hour post-injection.

Possible side effects of REGEN-COV include pain bruising soreness and swelling near the injection sites. Other side effects are possible. The treatment is still being studied so according to Regeneron ""it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time.""

The treatment is currently being paid for by the U.S. government and is free to patients.

The goal of the treatment Bakr says is to prevent severe progression of coronavirus symptoms and hospitalization. Still she is urging community members to roll up their sleeves for a different shot first.

""It's very crucial to be vaccinated"" said Bakr. ""This treatment is not a replacement for the vaccine.""

Infinity Pharmacy is still administering all three available vaccines: Pfizer Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Those who are eligible can also get their booster shot at the pharmacy. Plus the pharmacy offers both PCR and rapid antigen tests for COVID-19.

A young goalkeeper with big aspirations he had been left restless and frustrated by a spell in Levante's academy. When Brighton called he listened.

He's glad he did. Seven years on the impatient teenager so determined to succeed that he left his family behind moving from Spain to England alone without speaking a word of the language to a city he had barely heard of is achieving everything he set out to do.

At 23 Sanchez is Brighton's number one arguably the best young goalkeeper in the Premier League and as of last month a Spanish international too. It's little wonder he's smiling as he reclines in his chair in a quiet corner of Brighton's sprawling training ground.

""Obviously I was a little bit scared when I came here"" he tells Sky Sports. ""Everything was different and I missed the family a lot. But I was also excited to come to a new place experience a new culture play a new kind of football and learn a new language.""

Sanchez was housed with a local family and another Spanish academy player Luis Garcia who later moved to Sevilla. ""We were like big brother and little brother"" he says smiling. ""We would go to Brighton go to the cinema go for food. He's still one of my best friends.""

Sanchez was well looked after. ""The club academy-wise is unbelievable"" he says. ""They help you with your studying and your football but also mentally which is the most important thing for a young kid. They made me feel like I had a family here.""

He took his inspiration from a player who had made the same move from Spain to England four years earlier.

""I always said David De Gea was my idol"" he says. ""He obviously moved to England and I think that made it easier for me. If De Gea had come here I thought it must be good. It took bit of time to get used to things but now it feels more like home than Spain.""

Live: SNF

Sanchez was overlooked by Spain at youth level - ""I remember the first call I had with them they told me they didn't even know I was here I was that young when I left"" he says - but he now counts his boyhood idol as an international team-mate.

A player previously courted by England for whom he is also eligible received his first Spain call-up in March and has featured in every squad since making his debut as a substitute in the recent 4-0 win over Georgia while De Gea watched on from the bench.

Spain boss Luis Enrique rates Sanchez highly and he is not alone. Since his breakthrough last season he has started 34 consecutive Premier League games helping Brighton keep 14 clean sheets commanding his area superbly and earning plaudits for his distribution.

This season he has conceded only five goals in eight games. Only three goalkeepers - Edouard Mendy Aaron Ramsdale and Jordan Pickford - have saved a higher percentage of shots. Only one - Illan Meslier - has completed more passes.

Sanchez is indebted to Graham Potter for giving him his chance - ""he is an unbelievable manager and we are so lucky to have him"" he says - but nobody not even Potter has played a bigger role in his rise to prominence than the club's goalkeeping coach Ben Roberts.

""I think all young kids can be a bit radical in different situations but Ben calmed me down"" says Sanchez. ""I would say he has helped me mentally as much as he has technically.

""He taught me that mistakes can happen that I don't need to feel down about them and to always be mentally positive always smile and if I do make a mistake just go again without showing any emotion which is what the top-level managers like.""

'He can be anything he wants in the game' Brighton manager Graham Potter on Robert Sanchez:



""He had some big shoes to fill Mat Ryan was a great goalkeeper and a fantastic servant but Rob’s attributes and qualities are at such a high level that he can be anything he wants in the game.



“He’s got huge potential. The challenge for him is to be playing in the Premier League and deal with what that throws at you which he has done really well so far.



“He’s got amazing ability and as a young man he wants to learn he wants to improve he’s ambitious and he wants to help the team so we just need to carry on helping him.”

Sanchez exudes calm now but it is not so long ago that he was crying down the phone to Roberts after making a costly error in one of his first appearances on loan at Forest Green Rovers in League Two.

""I felt really really bad but he said no matter how you play one game is not everything"" says Sanchez. ""You make a mistake and yeah people will talk about it. But if you have a good game in the next game they will forget about it.

""It was about developing that kind of mentality of going again and accepting that if I make a mistake I can't repair it. I just have to get back to that level where I'm in the zone.""

Sanchez initially resisted the idea of going on loan believing he was already good enough to break into Brighton's first-team but his time at Forest Green taught him humility and it was followed by an even more valuable spell with Rochdale in League One.

""As a young boy you always think you're better than everyone that going on loan is a bit stupid and you don't want to do it but looking back now they were the best decisions ever"" he says.

""The first one was a bit harder because I didn't want to go but once I had that experience behind me and Brighton wanted to send me on loan again I was like 'Let's go' because I knew how it would benefit me and my football. The second loan was massive for me. It taught me a lot of things.""

Sanchez won praise for his performances in cup games against Manchester United and Newcastle that season - ""he looked right at home on that sort of stage"" one Rochdale coach told Sky Sports in March - and when he returned to Brighton in the summer of 2020 he was deemed ready for a run at the number one shirt.

Soon enough it was his. Sanchez made his Premier League debut in a 2-1 defeat to Tottenham last November and Ryan was duly dispatched on loan to Arsenal in January. A few weeks later in February Sanchez was handed a new four-and-a-half-year contract.

They were proud moments for his family watching from afar.

""When I was in Spain they always saw me. They would come to my games and come to see me training. But when I left they just had to count on me to do well to try to make the dream come true knowing one day I might get released and go back home.

""Now after seven years I'm playing in the Premier League and going with the national team which is the biggest thing you can do in Spanish football so it's unbelievable for them.""

His family have seen how far he has come but not the hours of work that have gone into honing his game on the training pitch.

""As a 'keeper technically I think I have improved everything"" he says. ""I think my distribution is my best quality now. I'm really calm and I can play every single type of pass using different techniques.

""But if you saw me seven years ago I literally couldn't kick the ball it was unbelievable. I just listened to my coaches and practiced practiced practiced. That's what go me to this level.

""My positioning on the pitch as well"" he continues. ""I used to stay on my line all the time but now I try to keep a really aggressive position on the pitch. I come for crosses and try to stop cut-backs.

""Any goalkeeper of a high level if they have good positioning on the pitch it's really hard to score against them. Most goals unless the striker puts it in the top bins are scored because the positioning of the goalkeeper is not good.

""Any goalkeeper who has worked his whole life and got to this level it's for a reason it's because they are the best. They've got the power the ability and the speed to make saves. So if they don't and a goal looks easy it's almost always because of positioning.

""That's one of the things I think I've improved the most but also moving fast and being set when the ball leaves the striker's boot. If you're still moving when he shoots you ain't getting there. Being set allows you to move quickly. I've improved that a lot too.""

Sanchez's appetite for self-improvement is obvious and on Saturday afternoon at the Amex Stadium he is relishing the opportunity to test himself against Manchester City's Ederson another goalkeeper with a flair for starting attacks as well as stopping them.

""Playing against him I like to call it a distribution competition to see who can do best on the day"" says Sanchez with a grin. ""I really enjoy watching him. I've looked at a couple of points in the way he plays and tried to put them into my game.

""I'm really excited to play against him and the whole City team. We have started the season really well and we are playing the way we want to. There is a little bit of pressure on us to keep that level now but everyone is really happy and really comfortable.""

Nobody more so than Robert Sanchez.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvZm9vdGJhbGwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDEyMzQ2OS9CYXllcm4tTXVuaWNoLTQtMC1Ib2ZmZW5oZWltLVJvYmVydC1MZXdhbmRvd3NraS1zY29yZXMtVEVOVEgtQnVuZGVzbGlnYS1nb2FsLXNlYXNvbi5odG1s0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9hcnRpY2xlLTEwMTIzNDY5L2FtcC9CYXllcm4tTXVuaWNoLTQtMC1Ib2ZmZW5oZWltLVJvYmVydC1MZXdhbmRvd3NraS1zY29yZXMtVEVOVEgtQnVuZGVzbGlnYS1nb2FsLXNlYXNvbi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bayern Munich 4-0 Hoffenheim: Robert Lewandowski scores TENTH Bundesliga goal of the season,"Bayern Munich top scorer Robert Lewandowski struck again as the German champions demolished Hoffenheim 4-0 on Saturday to remain top of the Bundesliga a point ahead of Borussia Dortmund.

With Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this week his side still managed another flurry of goals.

Serge Gnabry opened the account in the 16th minute after an earlier goal by the Germany international was disallowed following a VAR review.

Robert Lewandowski scored his tenth Bundesliga goal of the season in a dominant home win

Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 4-0 with Serge Gnabry opening the scoring for the hosts

The Pole has now scored 26 goals in 34 league matches in the calendar year of 2021 just six shy of the all-time Bundesliga record set by Gerd Muller in 1972.

It appears that defense is the team’s biggest problem although much attention has been given to new addition Russell Westbrook and whether he will fit in.

Oct 23 2021

AceShowbiz - Robert De Niro's estranged wife Grace Hightower won't get half of the actor's earnings a court has ruled.

The ""Raging Bull"" star filed for divorce from Hightower his wife of 21 years in December 2018 with his ex demanding half of the actor's $300 million (£217 million) fortune despite signing a prenuptial agreement in 2004.

Hightower claimed the wording of the contract also grants her 50 per cent of De Niro's earnings since they exchanged vows in 2004 which she believes to be around $300 million thanks to the 38 movies and 35 lucrative business investments he made during the union. His total fortune is estimated at $500 million (£362 million).

However the Appellate Division rejected Hightower's arguments and upheld the Manhattan Supreme Court ruling from February as they said in their decision ""The husband's income earned during the marriage and other business assets acquired during that time are his separate property.""

De Niro's lawyer Caroline Krauss told Page Six after the ruling ""The decision speaks for itself. We obviously agree with the conclusion.""

Hightower will still walk away with millions from the divorce as she and De Niro will sell their $20 million (£14.5 million) former marital home and put $6 million (£4.3 million) from the sale towards buying a house of her choice that she can live in with their two children.

De Niro will also pay his ex $1 million (£725215) a year in alimony until she remarries or one of them dies as per the terms of their prenup.

Hightower and De Niro first headed to divorce court in 1999 after just two years as husband and wife. They subsequently reconciled and remarried in 2004."

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Daniel and Tami Manofsky were forced to close their family-run Keagan Ross Furniture store off U.S. 280.

What they didn’t know at the time was that this turn of misfortune would lead them into a new career and the opening of a new business.

They briefly reopened the furniture store when government restrictions ended but the price of wood had soared so high that they could no longer afford to continue operating Tami Manofsky said. “There was no way we could make a living like that” she said.

Daniel is highly skilled at bicycle repairs and had started helping fix bikes for some of his Greystone neighbors as a hobby and quickly found himself in high demand. People were looking for outdoor activities and started getting their bicycles out again and lots of them needed repairs Tami said. Then a lot of requests began to come from Mt Laurel she said. “It just started piling up fast.”

Tami grew up with BMX bikes and has gotten into the repair side of it as well. The bicycle repairs gave the Manofskys some much-needed income and sparked the idea to open a new business.

“There seemed to be a huge backlog at other repair shops and not much service available in the U.S. 280 corridor” Tami said. “Also there seems to be a shortage of affordable quality bicycles.”

People were having to pay $5000 or $10000 for a bike or buy a much lower-quality bike at a general merchandise store like Walmart she said.

So the Manofskys decided to open a new shop called Anatole’s specializing in bicycle skateboard and surfing merchandise and apparel. They opened the 1200-square-foot store on Nov. 20 in the new Cahaba Market strip center next to Cavender’s western wear store on U.S. 280.

The name “Anatole’s” comes from a children’s book that featured a mouse who rode a bicycle to work.

The Manofskys anticipate bicycle sales and repairs to be the primary part of their business but they want to offer skateboard and surfing merchandise and apparel as well. They also will sell stand-up paddle boards and recreational equipment for lake living such as tubes and boogie boards that can be pulled by boats on the lake.

Anatole’s will specialize in BMX bikes because most of the bike stores seem to specialize in street bikes and mountain bikes Tami said. They’ll sell the other types of bikes too but focus on BMX she said. It helps that there is a BMX track nearby at Oak Mountain State Park she said.

Also the bikes will be more affordable than at most bike specialty stores but of higher quality than can be found at general merchandise stores she said. Prices likely will range from about $100 to about $3000 she said. “Anybody with any income can come in and buy a bike.”

With bike shortages plaguing the industry right now Anatole’s plans to sell more American-made bikes so the wait is not so long to receive orders Tami said. The store also will be the first dealer to sell Wildcat mini-bikes which are tiny freestyle bikes for tricks she said. Rad Power Bikes named one of the 100 most influential companies by Time magazine in 2021 will be another supplier she said. “We have a lot of manufacturing partners.”

The Manofskys are trying to give Anatole’s a California family-friendly beach vibe not the dark punk vibe that some bike and skate shops have Tami said. It will be a lot like a Ron Jon Surf Shop but with bikes she said.

The store also offers bike parts electronic bikes and classes for kids to make designs for skateboards on computer tablets.

The city of Hoover’s economic development team helped the Manofskys formulate their business plan to get up and running. Economic developer Greg Knighton said he’s excited to see homegrown businesses take off. “I think it’s a great success.”

Fain voiced what we’ve all been thinking for a long time now. It’s time to move past the pandemic. In a video update the Chairman and CEO of the Royal Caribbean Group believes that although the pandemic is certainly not over the focus should now be on the future of cruising.

Speaking from the Royal Caribbean headquarters in Miami the company chairman and CEO hopes that conversations will soon go back to the everyday business of cruising instead of the current dialogues.

Ships Remain the Safest Vacation Option

Many people have said in recent times that cruise ships are now considered to be one of the safest vacation options out there. And for a good reason ships sail with a large majority of guests fully vaccinated onboard upscaled sanitation levels and air filtration systems that guarantee a clean environment aboard. It is one of the reasons why Richard D. Fain feels we should be looking to the future not to the past:

“We at the Royal Caribbean group will continue to devote stringent protocols to protect against COVID-19. But every conversation doesn’t need to be about the disease. We don’t need to start every chat with how much we miss going to the theater or to a restaurant. We’ll be able to live our lives more normally without face masks and without panic and cruising.”

You can watch Fain’s full video message below:

Also Read: Which Royal Caribbean Cruise Ships Have Resumed Operations?

On the topics of safety onboard Richard D. Fain draws the comparison between counties in the United States which are for the large part painted red meaning many infections while ships should be in the blue category given the low amount of infections onboard:

“On ships the vast bulk of the people are vaccinated. We can control our sanitation including air filtration et cetera. And we can establish strict protocols as a result. We can make ships safer than shore-based alternatives.“

“Although the CDC doesn’t do a comparison I believe a fair reading of all the data taking into account all the factors would color this ship blue which is the lowest category. Certainly better than the bulk of counties in America. And that’s why I’m going to stop talking about the disease. The time has come to look forward. The time has come to focus on how we come out of the panic and out of the pandemic rather than how we should live during it.”

What Does the Future Hold for Royal Caribbean?

Demand is certainly on the up for the cruise industry and Royal Caribbean. The cruise line has started increasing capacity onboard its ships and is investing heavily in environmental solutions. But most importantly for the Royal Caribbean Group is to bring travel agents back into the business.

So far Royal Caribbean has seen online bookings reaching higher numbers than before but the personal touch that travel agents offer is something that cannot be beaten.

“There still will be many who prefer to buy cruises online and the internet does make that very easy but it was the personal contract contact from travel advisors that built up the knowledge and awareness in the first place. It was the expertise of the travel advisors that gave people the impetus to cruise.”

With more businesses entering the cruise market think JetBlue last week the market for travel agents is becoming more and more saturated. At the very least they can count on The Royal Caribbean Group for support in a time when most travel agents will be in the process of rebuilding.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3BkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWFubm91bmNlcy0yNzQtbmlnaHQtdWx0aW1hdGUtd29ybGQtY3J1aXNlLXZpc2l0aW5nLTE1MC1kZXN0aW5hdGlvbnPSAXpodHRwczovL3dwZGUuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tYW5ub3VuY2VzLTI3NC1uaWdodC11bHRpbWF0ZS13b3JsZC1jcnVpc2UtdmlzaXRpbmctMTUwLWRlc3RpbmF0aW9ucw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean announces 274-night 'Ultimate World Cruise' visiting 150 destinations,"Royal Caribbean is offering a 274-night cruise that reaches all seven continents.

Cruise operator Royal Caribbean has announced an epic new cruise which will last nine months (274 nights) and stop in 150 spots around the world.

The Ultimate World Cruise which the company is billing as the “longest and most comprehensive world cruise out there” will sail from Miami in December 2023 and make stops in 65 countries across all seven continents before ending in September 2024.

Some 57 of the stops planned will be new ports for the cruise company: the ship will stop at unusual locations including Qaqortoq in Greenland Antarctica Moorea and Tahiti in French Polynesia and Okinawa in Japan - as well as bucket-list big hitters such as Rio de Janeiro India for the Taj Mahal China for the Great Wall and Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.

Bookings for the epic journey - which will be taken by the Serenade of the Seas vessel with capacity for 2490 passengers - open today.

Entry-level interior cabins for the full voyage cost from £46409 including flights taxes and fees while suites are on sale for just under £85000.

The longest world cruise until now was Viking’s 245-night Ultimate World Cruise which set sail from London in August 2019 and was set to return the following May before the coronavirus pandemic halted all cruises in March 2020.

The vessel had been aiming for a spot in the Guinness Book of Records but was forced to end the journey early.

In February Bloomberg reported that 130+-day world cruises were selling out years in advance - heartening for an industry that has lost billions in the past two years.

US giant Carnival reported losses of $10bn in 2020 while in September Cruise Lines International Association estimated that 200000 jobs that depend directly or indirectly on the industry had been lost in Europe alone.

Cruises resumed in August with all operators instating Covid protocols and upping sanitary measures.

Nevertheless the FCDO advice on cruising in Covid times remains cautious saying: “Although operators have taken steps to improve infection control cruise ships continue to experience COVID-19 outbreaks affecting passengers and seafarers. The confined setting on board and combination of multiple households enables COVID-19 to spread faster than it is able to elsewhere.

Cruises with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases have previously been denied permission to dock or to disembark passengers. This can have serious implications for passengers and seafarers on board. You should check the protocols of the cruise operator to ensure you are comfortable with safety measures.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQ5MjNhYjE0LTUxNzctNDBhYy1iZTc2LWVmMDQyMzdiMDA0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leading through the pandemic: keeping a cruise company afloat,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Ron DeSantis has appointed engineering emergency management and medical services executive Carlos Duart whose company has received hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID-19 contracts to the Florida International University Board of Trustees.

DeSantis’ office made the announcement Tuesday. The appointment pends confirmation by the Florida Senate.

No comment from the Governor was included in the announcement which was sent by email at about 5 p.m.

Duart is president of CDR Maguire a Miami-based company that provides nationwide services for engineering design emergency management construction management disaster relief and health and infectious disease aid including COVID-19 test site logistics and alternative care sites according to its LinkedIn page.

DeSantis and former Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz gave CDR Maguire a significant chunk of federally funded state contracts for COVID-19 response. By January the Tampa Bay Times reported the state had signed at least $246 million in purchase orders with CDR Maguire since the pandemic began.

The company reached 1 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in Florida in March with partner Coastal Cloud.

Duart earned both a bachelor’s degree in accounting and a master’s degree in taxation from FIU. He is a recipient of FIU’s Outstanding Alumnus Medallion and School of Engineering Torch Award. He’s also served on the FIU Foundation board and is a member of the school’s Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame.

Though DeSantis’ announcement did not say whether Duart will replace a current FIU trustee the group’s present membership includes several notable names.

The Board of Trustees webpage shows 12 members. They include board Chair Dean Colson a partner at law firm Colson Hicks Eidson; Vice Chair Rogelio Tovar president and chair of investment firm RT holdings which owns numerous car dealerships across the country among other businesses; Cesar Alvarez chair of law firm Greenberg Traurig; health care entrepreneur Jose “Pepe” Armas chairman of MCCI Medical Group; Donna Hrinak senior vice president for new corporate affairs at Royal Caribbean Group; Natasha Lowell senior vice president at First National Bank of South Miami; Gene Prescott president of the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables and principal shareholder of Seaway Hotels Corp.; Joerg Reinhold a professor of physics at FIU’s College of Arts Sciences & Education; Chanel Rowe general counsel and partner at global asset placement agent and fintech platform Stonehaven; Mark Sarnoff partner at Miami law firm Schutts & Bowen; former U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States Carlos Trujillo now a partner at consulting firm Continental Strategy; and FIU Student Body President Alexander Rubido who has interned for Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and law firm SMGQ.

The group is scheduled to next meet Oct. 29 when it will discuss among other things matters regarding the FIU College of Communications Architecture + The Arts and a $40 million gift author MacKenzie Scott the former wife of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and one of the wealthiest women in the world and her new husband Dan Jewett gave the school in June.

A past president of Miami-Dade County-headquartered firm Metric Engineering Duart has donated to political campaigns since at least 2013. He gave nearly $20000 to a political action committee backing former President Donald Trump in 2019. That same year he donated $1000 to Democrat Charlie Crist’s bid for Congress. Last year he wrote a $50000 check to a PAC backing President Joe Biden in 2020."

Kennedy Jr. said got into his head.

Sarah Sherman had the honors of dressing up as a worm and took a jab at Vanderpump Rules star Tom Sandoval who became known as “the worm with a mustache” after co-star James Kennedy yelled that out during the Season 10 reunion.

“RFK’s body was a worm’s paradise” Sherman said as the brain worm. “Not a single drop of vaccine in sight. My whole parasite posse hung out in there. Shoutout to hookworm… that fish that swims up your pee stream and my man Tom Sandoval.”

Sandoval remains in infamy after his cheating scandal exploded into the mainstream. The Bravo star had been in an almost decade-long relationship with co-star Ariana Madix and was exposed to be having an affair with another co-star Rachel Leviss in what became known as “Sandoval.”

In February SNL had already called out Sandoval on Weekend Update labeling him a “narcissist.”

Weekend Update co-host Colin Jost also cracked a joke at his own expense referring to the Staten Island ferry he and former SNL co-star Pete Davidson bought.

Jost informed viewers that this year marked the first time since 2009 that a Marvel Studios production had not kicked out the summer movie season.

“[It] better be a one time thing because a lot of people rely on Marvel movies to pay for the ferries they bought” Jost joked.

Jost is married to Scarlett Johansson who portrayed Black Widow across the MCU.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

The 6-foot-2 202-pound Riley committed to the Buffaloes on Saturday a week after taking an official visit to Colorado. He worked with the Hurricanes' first-team defense this spring along with Jaden Harris.

Georgia Tech Michigan Missouri and Penn State were among the other programs that pursued Riley as a transfer in recent weeks.

""What's most important … is true development"" Riley said of his upcoming decision in an interview with 247Sports recently.

In 2023 Riley played 343 defensive snaps and posted 48 tackles as a rotational player at Vanderbilt. He graded out at 63.0 from Pro Football Focus last season.

While participating in the on-field drills at the NFL Combine Oladapo suffered a broken toe. He had surgery on it a few weeks before the draft and the hope is that he will be good to go for training camp in August.

However in the meantime while Oladapo will still be involved in the team meetings he’s not going to have the opportunity to apply what he’s learning in the practice field.

“Just staying in the training room getting the swelling down getting my range of motion back” said Oladapo. “And then just staying locked in mental reps on the sideline and then meet with the coaches after make sure I get the game plan.”

Not that Oladapo will have the same fate as Grant DuBose – Oladapo’s path to contributing as a rookie is much more clear – but we saw just last offseason how an injury during this time of the year derailed any sort of roster push DuBose was hoping to make. He didn’t return to the practice field until mid-August and was playing catch up at that point.

At a minimum Oladapo figures to be a core special teams player for the Packers. Defensively while versatile like Javon Bullard and Evan Williams Oladapo fills more of the traditional safety role as GM Brian Gutekunst described it able to fill both the “free and strong safety role” who can also line up as the “big nickel Sam linebacker.”

“As we can move him around more” said defensive backs coach Ryan Downard “the walk throughs are going to become vital because these guys you teach them what you can but until you go out and do it and walk through it that’s to me where the real learning takes place.

“You can sit in a classroom and learn something but until you either have to teach it back or you take them out there physically let them walk through it that’s I think where the growth takes place.”

Downard added that Oladapo’s intelligence and football IQ will help him stay up to speed throughout this process. Downard liked what he saw from him during rookie minicamp and made sure to fire questions Oladapo’s way to keep him engaged.

The addition of Oladapo – along with Bullard and Williams – provides that interchangability that GM Brian Gutekunst was looking for at the position. Increased versatility at the position opens up the playbook for Jeff Hafley from a game-planning perspective and makes it more difficult for opposing offenses pre-snap not knowing who will have what responsibility.

Another element that these three players bring is speed and physicality. Along with finding the right players from a schematic standpoint there is a certain play-style that the Packers want to have under Hafley.

“I’m comfortable anywhere on the field” said Oladapo. “Whatever the team needs me to do: be in the box be in the post blitz guard tight ends guard slots. I can do it all. I feel comfortable just having my two feet on the grass.”"
CRM,Salesforce,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjEwOTg4Ni9jb2xpbi1wb3dlbGwtbWFyYy1iZW5pb2ZmL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What I Learned From Colin Powell | TIME,"In many ways we came from completely different worlds. Colin Powell was born in Harlem raised in the South Bronx and as a young R.O.T.C. cadet in the late 1950s endured the injustice of the segregated South. I was born in San Francisco and grew up in the 1970s amid the summer of love marches for women’s rights and where neighbors proudly flew rainbow flags.

He rose through the ranks of the military and Washington with a deep respect for institutions hierarchy and tradition. I first made my mark building adventure games for the Atari 800 and later by starting my own software company in an industry that celebrates innovation and breaking old models with new transformative technologies.

But when our paths unexpectedly crossed in 1997 Colin Powell helped change the way I see business and the role of companies in the world.

I was in Philadelphia for the President’s Summit for America’s Future chaired by Powell and his nonprofit America’s Promise dedicated to lifting up at-risk youth. Five living presidents and the top 100 CEOs in the world were in attendance. I was a thirty-two year-old Silicon Valley techie looking for inspiration and I’ve never forgotten what the former general said when he took the stage:

“This is a time for each and every one of us to look into our own heart to look into our own community find someone who is in need find someone who is wanting find someone who is looking up to us and for each and every one of us to reach down to reach back to reach across to lift up a fellow American and put him on the road to success in this wonderful country of ours.“

Colin Powell told us that day that business could do more than simply make money. We had to be a force for good and a platform for change. It was the best advice I’d ever heard and in the years that followed he became one of the most important mentors in my life.

I went back to work at my job at Oracle a fast-growing software company ready to change the world. Inspired by General Powell’s words I came up with the idea for Oracle’s Promise which would provide computers to schools all over the world.

For our first project we went into MacFarland Middle School in Washington D.C. — a school General Powell had adopted — to install computers.

Unfortunately it was 100 degrees and the busiest time of the year at Oracle and not enough people showed up to get the job done. So I called General Powell to let him know the situation. I said “I’m sorry I’m not going to be able to get the computers in. We have it all there ready to go.” He hung up the phone on me. I knew we’d let him down. About 30 minutes later a battalion of marines arrived and all of the computers were quickly installed. That day he taught me not only what leadership and integrity meant—but also that it’s good to be a general.

Shortly after I founded Salesforce in 1999—inspired by General Powell to include a new model of philanthropy as a fundamental part of our company—pledging one percent of our equity product and time to our communities. In 2014 I invited General Powell to join our board of directors. I wanted our company to benefit from his wisdom operational expertise and the core values that guided his extraordinary life.

He served on our board for seven years. With his military discipline he never missed a call. I came to appreciate the qualities that presidents of both parties clearly valued in him—his integrity his honesty his pragmatism and his focus on problem-solving. He called me Marc but I always called him “Sir.” When he offered his advice—whether on the importance of transparency or communicating clearly so people know where you stand—I realized that he was still mentoring me.

He often told me “You recruit a soldier but you retain a family.” I’ve tried to follow his example building a culture that brings our families and communities along with us. General Powell was incredibly passionate about helping veterans especially the enlisted troops and inspired the creation of Salesforce Military a job training and career program for service members veterans and military spouses. Through his vision we’ve reached 40000 veterans placed 1200 in jobs and built a network of 500 employers that help support their career success. He became part of our Salesforce family we became close friends and I relied on him tremendously.

Colin Powell knew that at this moment in history when there is so much public mistrust in institutions leaders need to make trust one of their highest values. He was the first to admit that he wasn’t perfect. He acknowledged mistakes held himself accountable and demanded the same of others. He spoke out courageously when he felt our nation or its leaders were falling short of our ideals. When I screwed up he let me know it too.

He knew that to build trust companies need a purpose beyond profit. In one of his now-famous 13 leadership lessons he explained that “great leaders inspire every follower at every level to internalize their purpose and to understand that their purpose goes far beyond the mere details of their job.” Our world would be a more equal just and sustainable place if more CEOs recognized that they have obligations not only to their shareholders but to all their stakeholders including employees communities and the planet.

Specifically Colin Powell knew that business could not sit on the sidelines in the march for equality. As a board member he often joined our all-hands conference calls with many of our 75000 employees. On one call after the brutal murder of George Floyd he recalled being a young soldier fighting in Vietnam while his wife Alma back home in Birmingham Alabama guarded their house at night from racist mobs led by police chief Bull Connor. “We’ve come a long way” he told us “but we’ve got a very long long way to go yet.”

Finally Colin Powell knew that one of the best antidotes to inequality is education and that business has a responsibility to help. As a child of immigrants he credited his parents and teachers with his meteoric rise. On our calls he spoke with pride about his work with underserved youth and the City College of New York where he graduated. Thanks to the philanthropy he helped to inspire Salesforce has so far granted $120 million to public schools. We have “to do everything we can” he told us “to keep bringing these kids along.”

Today many CEOs I talk to struggle with how to have a purpose beyond profit. Many Americans feel we’re hopelessly divided as a country. Yes these are difficult days. But I share Colin Powell’s perpetual optimism. Because if we need a lodestar for how to live and work and serve others we could ask for no greater example than the trailblazer from the South Bronx who taught us to embrace our duty to each other—as neighbors as Americans and as fellow human beings.

The Oct. 13 event featured AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond and Chicago labor leaders recognizing the many contributions of Chicago’s building trades to the changing downtown skyline CISCO (Construction Industry Service Corporation) reported in its newsletter.

The Chicago River structure adjacent to Merchandise Mart is the final of the three-phase Wolf Point development.

The event honored the more than 225 union tradespeople currently on-site building one of the largest construction projects in Illinois.

“I want every worker to have the same chance as my family the chance to join a union to work on projects like Wolf Point and to succeed in achieving the dignity and respect all working people deserve. I want every worker to feel the power of the labor movement as a change agent for prosperity” AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Fred Redmond told the gathering.

The BIT is the equity investor for all three phases of the development investing union pension capital to generate more than $1.5 billion in total development in downtown Chicago.

“The BIT’s comprehensive labor policies will generate over 6 million hours of work for union constructions trades on the site” CISCO reported. “In Chicago over $3.9 billion in total economic benefit has been created through construction investments made by the BIT.”

“The impact of BIT’s investments begins with you the hard-working men and women of the building trades. However please know that your hard work today will pay dividends to workers and our great city for years to come. The labor movement should be proud of this impact in our backyard” said Illinois AFL-CIO president Tim Drea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmFseXRpY3NpbnNpZ2h0Lm5ldC9jbG91ZC1jb21wdXRpbmcvY2FyZWVyLWluc2lnaHQtb24tY2xvdWQtcmVsaWFiaWxpdHktZW5naW5lZXItcm9sZXMtcmVzcG9uc2liaWxpdGllcy13aXRoLW9ubGluZS1jb3Vyc2XSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW5hbHl0aWNzaW5zaWdodC5uZXQvYW1wL3N0b3J5L2Nsb3VkLWNvbXB1dGluZy9jYXJlZXItaW5zaWdodC1vbi1jbG91ZC1yZWxpYWJpbGl0eS1lbmdpbmVlci1yb2xlcy1yZXNwb25zaWJpbGl0aWVzLXdpdGgtb25saW5lLWNvdXJzZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Career Insight on Cloud Reliability Engineer: Roles & Responsibilities with Online Course,Roles and Responsibilities: It is also popularly known as Cloud Site Reliability Engineer who holds responsibilities for availability performance monitoring and other functionalities of the platforms of a company.

(BPCL) has multiple business units including LPG cylinders CNG stations petrol pumps lubricants and an aviation business. Like most of its peers in the oil ang gas sector BPCL had to embark on a digital transformation journey to optimise operations and also give its customers a single view of all of the services available with the company. At the backend BPCL has engaged in multiple technology implementations to track its fleet of 25000 lorries and 15000 retail outlets. On the frontend it is deploying tools such as the chatbot Urja and other applications for a seamless customer experience.

In an interview Rahul Tandon Head of Digital Transformation at BPCL elaborated on this digital journey and the challenges of marrying legacy applications with new-age ones. Edited excerpts:

How are you going about the task of digital transformation?

We have a sturdy enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution which acts as a source of truth where all the transactions happen. But when it comes to delivering business models we have more than 130 applications and systems in place. They served their purpose but were not integrated and were not scalable as a whole. We had to redesign the digital spine of BPCL to accommodate new ways of functioning. While we have adopted technology solutions from different vendors we have made the integration pieces remain within BPCL.

Currently we have a standard product from Salesforce for our CRM for the customer engagement platform we utilise SAP Hybris for rewards management we have Capillary and the chatbot of choice is through Yellow.ai. These four solutions are common across all businesses. We had to rewrite our business philosophy recraft business to leverage out of the box features of these solutions.

How is the customer experience being enhanced with the digital transformation drive?

We deal with a product that is a necessary evil — it is not seen or felt by anybody but customers can’t survive without it. When the visibility of the product is less and the whole service is commoditized the only differentiator that we can provide is the experience that we give to the customer. The customer gets in touch with us through multiple touchpoints such as an LPG distributors retail outlets could engage in a B2B interaction or it could be an aviation customer; the goal is to make the interactions with the customers seamless and efficient. BPCL has six marketing units which worked separately as specific strategic business units this meant that the experience was different from different units. We were not able to get a unified view of our customer and at the same time we were not able to give a single view of BPCL to them this has become the singular objective for us. To provide the user with a uniform and consistent customer experience across all touchpoints.

How is the chatbot Urja helping your operations?

Our customers mostly talk to us through channel partners delivery men driveway salesmen dealers but we have never interacted with customers on a direct basis. Urja is the voice of BPCL to interact with customers at their convenience. We carried out extensive surveys including ethnographic surveys interacted with customers with different persona and geographies to create Urja. Urja can currently communicate with customers in 13 languages. You will be surprised to note that 40% of interactions stem from the rural part of India while 40-45% of interactions are in languages others than Hindi and English. We have already had 20 crore interactions with customers on Urja and about 5 million unique customers interact with Urja frequently for the past few months. The average time of interaction with the chatbot is more than three minutes which means it is intelligent enough to keep the customer engaged in conversation for more than three minutes. We have currently trained Urja for over 600 use cases.

What challenges did BPCL face when marrying legacy applications with new-age ones?

Integrations with some of the applications were very smooth and comfortable. However such was not the case with all legacy systems. Integrations of new-age applications with legacy applications with good quality updated documentation and a knowledgable support team did not face any major hurdles whereas integrations with legacy systems which do not have the above are very time and effort consuming.

A lack of in-depth knowledge on the nitty-gritty data models database relations and changes made over a period of time gives rise to tremendous challenges. While we have been fortunate enough in BPCL to face these challenges in only a few cases this experience re-emphasizes the criticality of detailed and up-to-date documentation the focus towards which many a times is lost in the pressure to meet timelines. Also limitations on scalability flexibility and replicability of legacy systems poses a lot of problems thereby resulting in us deciding to sunset most of them and go in for greenfield solutions.

How much of your on-premise data has been moved to the cloud?

We have deployed a mix of Platform as a Service and Software (PaaS) and cloud solutions such as SAP Hybris. But solutions such as IRIS and Urja are hosted on our own private cloud from Microsoft. Going forward an important thing we are working on is our non-fuel ventures. We are working closely with our non-fuel team to come up with the technology landscape and functioning. Our fueling solution SmartDrive is going to be up and hosted in the next couple of months and a new B2B platform will be live in a month from now.

How is BPCL using the Internet of Things (IoT) in its supply chain to help its business?

The use of IoT has enabled BPCL to integrate more than 16000 retail outlets 76 retail terminals 53 LPG plants and over 25000 tankers onto a single platform to provide an integrated view of the entire operating value chain. With the above integration IRIS the Digital Nerve Centre of BPCL is capable of accepting more than 3 million inputs per second from Local Automated systems cameras and IoT devices deployed at key locations like retail terminals and LPG plants along with the associated tank trucks for product delivery and also across our entire Lubes manufacturing to marketing value chain.

Some of the key examples of the use of IoT technology in BPCL are for fore-court controllers at retail outlets vehicle tracking systems electromagnetic locking systems for monitoring of violations visual analytics based monitoring through edge devices quality checks during bottling of cylinders and ensuring the firefighting systems are at optimal performance in LPG plants.

Is IoT being implemented in your lubrication business unit as well?

For lubricants we have around 800 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) which are distributed through a complex supply chain network consisting of manufacturing plants distributor and retail outlets and customers. Currently we have no visibility of the products across the supply chain. To address this we have enabled IoT and QR Codes in our products at multiple levels which helps us track our products across various nodes of the supply chain.

The entire solution communicates on a real time basis with our ERP System as well as our customer engagement platform. This helps us in not only identifying the consumption points of our products but also give us the flexibility to control the sales of these products by customizing schemes.

Can you provide an overview of how your IT team is structured?

Our technology partner is Deloitte who carry out the integration of all these applications in BPCL. The user stories running sprints on development integration and others are carried out by a team of 200 developers working from the Deloitte team. The dedicated team working under project Anubhav has 20 members including an IRIS team a cloud expert and technology architects. We have digital SPOCs (single point of contact) from each business unit there are roughly a team of 400 people within BPCL who are aligned to work together on this project.",,,

New giant sculpture silences ships in New York

An imposing statue of a woman’s head with his index finger pressing to her lips now looks out over lower Manhattan along the Hudson River inviting the chaotic metropolis to stop and listen.

“When water moves it makes a special very special sound” says the Barcelona artist Jaume Plensa.

The message of his 24-meter (80-foot) “Soul of Water” Plensa’s greatest work to date is “keep quiet … listen to the deep noise of the water that speaks to us.”

The White Head overlooks a panoramic view of the river in front of Newport’s high-rise buildings which is located directly across from Greenwich Village and four miles from the Statue of Liberty

On a recent morning when Plensa saw the fully assembled part for the first time her call to silence was rivaled by the hum of diesel engines from the nearby Hoboken train terminal the roar of helicopters and the screams and laughter of children. who traveled in strollers. the river walkways.

But that’s not the kind of noise Plensa says his artwork is directed at.

“I mean the noise of the information and the messages they send us” he said at the Galerie Lelong Co in New York where an exhibition of new work will open on October 29.

Plensa 66 was commissioned to create the piece about two years ago by LaFrak and Simon Property Group who have developed the area that juts into the river where “Water’s Soul” is located.

The piece was manufactured with polyester resin fiberglass and marble dust at Plensa’s studio in Barcelona and shipped in 23 containers to the site for assembly.

The sculpture whose official unveiling is Thursday is visible from everywhere leaving some locals who have seen the piece assembled since August scratching their heads.

Plensa said that the sculpture is not sending a message to Manhattan and that she is not “keeping quiet” but is asking for silence in silence.

“The soul of the water” can be seen better from the river

“It’s a piece that pays a lot of homage to water and it’s in the water that you can enjoy it the most” he said.

Guests flooded into Freedlander and Christmas Run pools boosting attendance records for 2021 and making up for a lost swimming season last year.

The city swim team reached its highest member count in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic. That combined with the increase in attendance resulted in the pools bringing in more money this year than during 2020 when COVID-19 vaccines were not yet available.

""2021 was a banner year for us"" said Jeff Battig the city's Recreation and Community Center manager.

Attendance increased by 129% the city's two pools. That's a 19522 difference from 2019 which saw 15103 guests.

While attendance has yet to fully recover to the pre-pandemic 2019 count of 48670 guests Battig said the numbers show how much they were able to recover in just one year.

After membership for the swim team fell by three in 2020 to 139 swimmers locals came out in force driving that number up to 171 by the end of the summer this year Battig said.

Wooster pools rebound after 2020 pandemic slump

By Battig's estimates nearly two-thirds of municipal pools in Ohio were closed due to COVID-19 concerns but most local pools in Wooster Holmes County and Orrville remained open.

With capacity limited and pre-registration required to set aside pool times as per CDC COVID safety guidelines Freedlander Pool saw a steep decline in attendance.

""We expected there to be grief but people were actually really happy"" Battig said. ""They were probably glad we were even open.""

Despite Christmas Run Pool being closed last year for construction attendance at Freedlander was better than he anticipated.

With so many pools closed in surrounding counties or communities because of the pandemic visitors flocked to Freedlander he said.

""We had people from Mansfield driving here to swim"" said Alexis Gunn recreation coordinator. ""Then there was a swim team from Columbus that drove here pretty frequently.""

Orr Park in Orrville required swimmers to fill out a waiver before arriving. The first 100 guests were welcome. Any more were turned away.

""People who traditionally went to Orrville came here because we had some availability"" Gunn said.

Both Wooster pools opened with no capacity limits this past summer and both Battig and Gunn hope 2022 will be just as successful once renovations and maintenance work on both pools is complete.

The consequences of Thanos’ snap will keep playing out in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for years to come. And we have already seen the aftereffects of this massive event. We have witnessed how the absence of Captain America and Iron Man has affected everyone left behind. We have also seen the effects of half the population returning after the Endgame’s Blip.

However what we haven’t seen yet is the effect of Mad Titan’s snap on the supernatural elements of the universe. We are seeing a few things such as Doctor Strange taking on a greater role in the MCU with Agatha Harkness returning to her WandaVision spinoff. The snap could possibly give rise to the undead and give their rival Blade a long-awaited debut.

Thanos’ Snap: How It Empowers the Vampires?

We know that Thanos’ snap wiped out more than half of the living beings in the universe. This loss allowed the survivors to unite and stand against the unprecedented times. However with limited resources the collapse of several major cities and society itself humans are taxed to their limits. Earth and humans are in survival mode and things are just falling like dominos.

However Thanos’ snap might have not affected a certain supernatural element of the universe and that is Vampires. Since they are already dead creatures predating on humans they wouldn’t have been wiped out from the earth. In fact they would have grown in power and become stronger since there was no one to oppose them. Doctor Strange was lost five years after the snap so vampires had an open chance to exploit the already distraught humans. Moreover the surviving Avengers would be busy holding on to what’s left of the planet and humanity to give any attention to vampires.

In What If…? we have seen how zombie outbreaks wreaked havoc on humanity. This particular story took place before the snap and took the heroes by surprise. Similarly it will be too easy for a coordinated group of vampires to take over and show their dominance. Although they are a serious threat to humanity they can draw some opposition. And Marvel has the right candidate for that.

Thanos’ Snap: How It Created an Opportunity for MCU’s Blade?

Now vampires are certainly powerful creatures. However one thing to note is that why they couldn’t take over humanity in the five years between snap and blip. One reason could be their rival Blade keeping them in check. Although Blade’s MCU debut remains still on the horizon this is the best way to bring the character into the picture.

On the off-chance Blade can make an appearance in Hawkeye as he is one of the people who used Ronin’s identity. If not this there is a high chance he might take interest in the Tracksuit Draculas who are shown as vampires. However a more logical debut for Blade will be him operating in secret and keeping vampires in check.

Blade has worked with other teams over the years. This practically makes him a part of the Avengers. In fact he was a main member of Avengers when they were caught between two groups of vampires fighting one group led by Dracula. In the future he can play a similar role if the team encounters a vampiric threat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LXRvLWFkZC1tdXNpYy1zbmFwY2hhdC1zdG9yaWVzLW1lc3NhZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Add Music to Your Snapchat Stories and Messages,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LXRvLWFkZC1tdXNpYy1zbmFwY2hhdC1zdG9yaWVzLW1lc3NhZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L3RlY2gvMjAyNC8wNC8xMjlfMzE3NTIyLmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL20ua29yZWF0aW1lcy5jby5rci9wYWdlcy9hcnRpY2xlLmFtcC5hc3A_bmV3c0lkeD0zMTc1MjI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[INTERVIEW] Snapchat aims to improve presence in Korea,"A Google Pixel 6 phone user uses Snap's photo messaging app Snapchat.

And they drove off into the sunset.

“Selling Sunset” star Heather Rae Young and “Flip or Flop” star Tarek El Moussa are married after two years of dating.

“MR. & MRS. EL MOUSSA!!!” Young 34 captioned an Instagram post on Saturday. “I married the love of my life today. My sweet man my everything. Cheers to forever and then some.”

El Moussa 40 also posted a snap of the happy couple writing “WE’RE MARRIED!!!! Flipped her name for good. 🙏♥️”

The couple wed at a hotel near Santa Barbara Calif. according to People magazine.

Young — who wore a dress made by Israeli designer Galia Lahav — teased on Instagram Oct. 14 that the pair’s wedding was fast approaching posting photos of the couple holding their marriage license.

“One step closer to becoming Mrs. El Moussa !!! 💍🤍👰🏼‍♀️🤵🏻” she captioned the snap with El Moussa leaving red heart emojis in the comments section.

3 The pair obtained their marriage license on Oct. 14. Instagram

On Oct. 18 she also revealed that she had her “final dress fitting” and “finished” writing her vows.

“Now let’s get me married!!” she added asking fans to guess what style gown she chose as the one.

In September the bride gave fans a sneak peek at their wedding location although did not disclose the venue at the time.

“Standing in the exact place we’ll have our first dance as husband and wife” she wrote.

Meanwhile the pair celebrated their last moments of single life together holding a joint bachelor/bachelorette party in Palm Springs earlier this month.

The LA real estate reality TV stars got engaged back in 2020 on the one-year anniversary of the day they met. El Moussa popped the question while the couple was on a boat trip to Catalina Island off the coast of California.

After originally proposing with an 8-carat emerald-cut diamond the pair later had it upgraded with even more bling.

While this was Young’s first time down the aisle El Moussa was previously married to Christina Haack whom he divorced in 2018. They share two kids: Taylor 11 and Breyden 6.

Young says she loves being a “bonus mom” to El Moussa’s kids but doesn’t “feel the need” to have her own.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL3RoZS1tYXJ2ZWxzLWNhcHRhaW4tYW1lcmljYS10aGUtc25hcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Marvels Director Nia DaCosta Blames Captain America for the Snap,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL3RoZS1tYXJ2ZWxzLWNhcHRhaW4tYW1lcmljYS10aGUtc25hcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Why do people add an “s” to the end of so many words that don’t need it?

This is more of a Grammar Guru musing than a lesson but it’s a worthwhile and hilarious one. The idea was sparked by an entertaining Twitter discussion on Nashville-based author Mary Laura Philpott‘s Tweet below.

Why do we just LOVE to add the letter “s” to business names? Krogers? Nordstroms? Aldis? If you don’t do this you likely know someone who does.

I’ve heard tales of the companies themselves accidentally adding an “s” in marketing materials. I’ve heard of employees having to deal with people writing checks to the misspelled business. I’ve heard of career-long employees not saying their own employer’s name correctly. Apparently even the audio recording of the book The Queen’s Gambit includes the word Krogers.

In my hometown of Charlotte NC everyone said Eckerds and JC Penneys despite neither business ever having had an “s” on the end. Ever. So why do we do this who does it the most and what are some of the worst mistakes?

Common brands and businesses we INCORRECTLY add the letter “s” to I asked a lot of people and did a lot of research to find businesses that people attack with an unwarranted “s” most often. I tried to write these in order of most commonly to least commonly misspelled/misspoken. I left them without any apostrophes for clarity’s sake but will tackle that below.

Belks

Nordstroms (This actually used to be the correct spelling until the 1950s but most people who say this did not live in the 1950s.)

Barnes & Nobles

JC Penneys

Krogers

Aldis

Sbarros

Costcos

Piggly Wigglys

Winn-Dixies

Benihanas

Sonics

Walmarts

Why do we do this?

This Grammar Guru/language lover believes it’s a combination of these three phenomena.

REASON 1: This is a concept carried over from the past which is why older generations do it more than the younger ones. Department stores food markets and restaurants have a long history of being named after their founders and taking on the possessive form. In a Southern Living article on department stores of the past the majority of the 19 stores mentioned end in “s” and most of those are possessive names: Rich’s Loveman’s Davison’s Foley’s Joske’s Neilson’s Gayfers (which was originally Gayfer’s but dropped their apostrophe in 1970) Ivey’s McRae’s Burdine’s Furchgott’s Tapp’s… the list goes on. Almost all the places my grandparents’ generation patronized had a single person’s name or a family name behind them. The Meijer grocery chain in the Midwest was once “Meijer’s Thrifty Acres” so locals say “Meijer’s” constantly.

REASON 2: Many businesses that we frequent end in “s” or the “s” sound. Whole Foods Trader Joe’s Walgreens Starbucks and Publix to name a few. So perhaps we just want them all to sound the same?

REASON 3: Perhaps it rolls off the tongue. When people shorten Neiman Marcus they say Neiman’s instead of Neiman. I am guilty of adding an “s” to Barnes & Noble because I think it makes sense for both names to end the same way. There is a concept called “productivity” in linguistics that basically states that we use processes to form words. Adding an “s” happens a lot in English — to make something plural or to show possession. So it just makes sense in our brains to add an “s.”

Are we making it PLURAL or POSSESSIVE?

It could be both. Since this is mainly a spoken error it’s hard to know whether someone means to convey an “s” or with an apostrophe for the possessive. Most people interested in this topic think that these errors are not pluralizing but rather making the name possessive. Again likely harkening back to when you would quite literally walk down to Friedman’s and Mr. Friedman would greet you by name with a smile. It makes sense to relate a place of business to its owner.

Is this just a Southern thing?

It’s actually not! This happens everywhere my research finds. I read a lot of articles (and their comments sections) about people doing this in the Midwest and the Northeast and even in the UK and Australia. It seems this particular slip of the tongue slips all over the English language.

Some brands have purposefully dropped the apostrophe.

This is a tangent but an interesting one. Some businesses that have had the possessive “s” for decades have dropped the apostrophe EVEN THOUGH it’s still possessive. Starbucks Harrods Michaels and Tim Hortons are some examples. There are many reasons these companies slashed the apostrophe. Some wish to distance themselves from the person who founded the company. Some strive to be uniform succinct and able to fit into the digital age with ease (URLs and social media handles don’t have apostrophes). Maybe some save a little money on signage without the extra character. This is much to the dismay of many purists who know how silly it is to have a possessive WITHOUT an apostrophe.

If your mind is blown by this here is an article that dives deeply into the topic.

Do the companies CARE about this?

Not as much as the grammar snobs and NextDoor App trolls do apparently. Kroger did post this hilarious meme about the topic though seemingly in jest.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kroger (@krogerco)

Some brands have publicly said that the personification of their name (assuming it is possessive) is endearing and that they love it. It’s like the customer is approaching their store as if it is someone’s home. It shows familiarity and perhaps some nostalgia for the shopping days of old. Don’t get me wrong — there are some people who irrefutably do not know that it’s Nordstrom and not Nordstrom’s. Or maybe they do know but don’t care.

Whatever the reason there is rarely any confusion as to what you’re saying so let’s chalk this up to a quirky linguistic slip that has perhaps been born from previous generations. Whether or not it will stand the test of time is yet to be seen but I’m not correcting anyone’s grandma when she tells about all the deals she got at Krogers yesterday.

50000 additional points after spending a total of $12000 on purchases within the first 12 months of account opening

I wouldn't typically categorize a sign-up bonus as a ""credit card benefit"" but these bonuses are so large that they can fast-track you to one of the best deals in travel — the Southwest Companion Pass. After meeting minimum spending requirements all in the same calendar year you'll have at least 112000 Southwest points. That's just 13000 points away from earning the famous Southwest Companion Pass which is awarded after you achieve 125000 qualifying Southwest points in a calendar year.

The Southwest Companion Pass allows you to bring a travel buddy with you every single time you fly Southwest for just the cost of taxes and fees (valid through the calendar year in which you earn it as well as the following calendar year). It's hands-down one of the best deals in travel. After all Southwest flies to many fun destinations all over the continental U.S. Hawaii Caribbean Mexico and even Central America.

However Southwest's downfall is that it doesn't fly anywhere else.

But what international travelers may not realize is this: The Southwest Companion Pass is an absolute boon for cheap flights to just about anywhere. With this simple trick whether you want to visit Europe Asia or Africa the Southwest Companion Pass can make your trip potentially hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars cheaper.

The secret: Use the Companion Pass for ""positioning flights""

(Photo by Wyatt Smith/The Points Guy)

Positioning flights are tickets you book to other U.S. airports so you can catch a cheap flight to your international destination.

The cheapest international flights are usually from big U.S. hubs like New York Atlanta Dallas Los Angeles Chicago etc. Incredible sales pop up all the time from these cities. If you're looking for a ticket to an international destination it's wise to look at flights from the nearest hub instead of your home airport. Then you can book a cheap positioning flight to those airports.

For example if I want to buy a coach ticket to Sydney (SYD) from my home airport of Cincinnati (CVG) I should expect to pay $1900+ per person round-trip.

But hub airports are likely to have cheaper flights to Sydney. Here's a look at flights from Los Angeles (LAX).

(Screenshot courtesy of Google)

Tickets to Sydney are a full $1100 cheaper per person when flying from Los Angeles instead of Cincinnati (or any other nearby airports). The problem is I don't live anywhere near Los Angeles.

That's where the Southwest Companion Pass comes in.

I can consistently fly round-trip to Los Angeles for around 22000 Southwest points per person. 22000 Southwest points are worth $330 per TPG valuations. If my wife and I want to go to Sydney I can fly to Los Angeles and take her with me for a total of 22000 points and $22.40 in taxes and fees thanks to the Companion Pass.

By paying 22000 Southwest points for two round-trip flights to Los Angeles we'd literally be paying $2200 less than if we had just flown from Cincinnati. Subtract $330 in Southwest points and my wife and I would have saved nearly $1900.

Southwest Companion Pass comes in handy for both paid and award flights

This strategy is most helpful for anyone booking paid flights to international destinations. If you follow flight deals you know how often $300-$400 round-trip tickets to Europe pop up from random U.S. hubs. With the Southwest Companion Pass you and your travel companion can start jumping on those deals without negating your savings on positioning flights.

However this can also be helpful to anyone wanting to book international award flights. You can book super cheap award flights across the ocean from select airports. For example you can fly to Madrid from Chicago (ORD) Boston (BOS) or New York (JFK) on Iberia during off-peak travel dates for:

17000 Iberia Avios one-way in coach

34000 Iberia Avios one-way in lie-flat business class

You'll pay significantly more from other airports — so shuttling back and forth to these three airports is an excellent use of the Companion Pass.

Bottom line

All three personal Southwest credit cards are offering up to 100000 bonus points after meeting tiered spending requirements. Once you earn the full bonus you'll be nearly 90% of the way toward earning the Southwest Companion Pass.

After you've successfully earned 125000 Southwest points you'll have:

$1875 in travel with Southwest (as each point is worth 1.5 cents)

A Companion Pass that allows you to bring a travel buddy with you for just the cost of taxes and fees for the year you earn it and the following calendar year (effectively doubling the value of your points)

In other words you and your travel companion can book $3750 in free Southwest flights before you'll have to resume paying cash for domestic and close-in international airfare.

That's a fantastic deal — but you can parlay those points into many thousands of dollars in savings for low-priced airfare around the world. Simply research cheap flights between U.S. hubs and your bucket-list destinations and travel to those hubs with your Southwest points and Companion Pass to catch your cheap flights.

Contrary to popular belief Southwest is useful for worldwide travelers ... just maybe not in the most obvious way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lcy8yMDIxLzEwLzIzL2hvbGlkYXktdHJhdmVsLWlzLXNvbWVob3ctZXZlbi1tb3JlLXVuY2VydGFpbi10aGFuLWEteWVhci1hZ28tYWZ0ZXItYS1zdW1tZXItb2YtYWlybGluZS10dXJidWxlbmNlL9IBqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lcy8yMDIxLzEwLzIzL2hvbGlkYXktdHJhdmVsLWlzLXNvbWVob3ctZXZlbi1tb3JlLXVuY2VydGFpbi10aGFuLWEteWVhci1hZ28tYWZ0ZXItYS1zdW1tZXItb2YtYWlybGluZS10dXJidWxlbmNlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Holiday airline travel faces uncertainty after summer turbulence staffing issues,"Dallas travel agent Alex Ramsey is getting questions daily from customers uncertain about booking holiday trips.

“Are Americans allowed to travel to Europe?”

“Will hotels and restaurants have enough employees?”

And the newest query brought on by recent turbulence: “Will my flight be delayed or canceled?”

“I’m telling people that the first thing they need to pack is their patience” said Ramsey president of All Aboard Travel. “If you are a type-A personality that needs everything to go perfectly you will run into trouble.”

Even after a summer of packed airplanes flight cancellations and face mask battles airlines are preparing their biggest flight schedules in nearly two years while also scrambling to replenish staffing levels and amid employee pushback over government-required vaccine mandates.

And gone are the perks of flying during a pandemic. Prices will be higher and planes will be more packed than they were a year ago.

It’s a backdrop that’s giving travelers pause especially with the chaos of Columbus Day weekend fresh in their memories. That’s when Dallas-based Southwest Airlines canceled thousands of flights citing weather and staffing issues while stranding travelers at airports around the country. It cost the airline $75 million in lost revenue.

The holiday travel season is typically more stressful with planes loaded with leisure travelers eager to arrive at destinations on time and winter storms looming as a constant threat.

“You do have to wonder if these airlines are prepared for the holidays when there could be significant problems with weather and pressure is high over a short period of time” said Henry Harteveldt a travel analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.

Are airlines prepared?

The airline and travel industry is anticipating a 2021 holiday season that will be much bigger than last year’s but still down slightly from the 2019 holidays.

Southwest’s flight schedule is about 12% smaller than it was in 2019.

Fort Worth-based American Airlines is planning to put more than 6400 flights in the air during its busiest day this season Nov. 28 the Sunday following Thanksgiving according to Diio by Cirium. That’s only about 5% fewer flights than it had in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet airline executives spent the last two weeks trying to convince travelers and investors that flight delays and cancellations plaguing the summer and fall months won’t be a repeat occurrence during the holidays.

Southwest Airlines said Thursday that it will further reduce its upcoming travel schedule — fallout from being forced to cancel more than 2000 flights earlier this month because of weather and air traffic control backups during a single afternoon in Florida. Southwest said it had relied on staffing models that it used before the pandemic.

“We had 15000 people that were out on leave so an assumption I made was that we were going to call them and say ‘OK it’s time to come back’ and they are going to show up and everything was going to be just like it was” Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said. “And it’s just not.”

Aggressive flight schedules to capitalize on consumer demand can push airlines to a breaking point when all doesn’t go to plan. Southwest Airlines’ Columbus Day weekend schedule was its busiest since the pandemic began and the Florida-centered problems resulted in pilots and flight crews being out of sync with subsequent flights.

That meltdown was followed by rumors that pilots had walked off the job to protest a White House mandate to require COVID-19 vaccinations for federal contractors such as Southwest Airlines. Both the airline and the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association denied any attempt by pilots to disrupt flights. However the union has sued the airline in federal court to stop the mandate.

The CEOs at Southwest and American spent last week trying to assure employees that they wouldn’t be fired if they weren’t vaccinated at least as long as they sought an exemption for religious or medical purposes.

“We are not going to let this disrupt any of our customers’ travel especially during the busy holiday season” Kelly said.

American Airlines President Robert Isom said demand is strong from passengers.

“We’re getting ready for the holiday season and we expect a lot of passengers and tremendous pent-up demand especially as vaccinations take hold [and] infection rates decline” Isom said. “We’re going to be ready. We’re doing our best to make sure that we have the right people in the right places at the right time.”

Airfares and labor shortages

Travelers could be looking at a far different experience than last year.

Some Christmastime airfares are approaching what they were in 2019 said Adit Damodaran an economist with travel website Hopper.

Advertisement

This year the average roundtrip ticket for flying within the U.S. is selling for about $300 for Thanksgiving and $390 for Christmas according to Hopper. That’s compared to 2020 when tickets were $245 at Thanksgiving and $250 at Christmas. Roundtrip tickets in 2019 were about $335 at Thanksgiving and $390 at Christmas.

That means this year’s fares are about 55% higher than last year when prices hit the lowest point in decades due to weak customer demand.

“Things have really taken off in the last few weeks with the decrease in cases from the delta variant” Damodaran said. “The best time to buy is usually before Halloween before November starts.”

After vaccination rates took off in spring more people grew comfortable with traveling over the summer months said Erin Francis-Cummings president of consumer research firm Destinations Analysts.

Now they’re ready to get back on planes again she said.

“Connecting with family and friends is still the driver for the holidays” she said. “It’s heart-warming to see that people still need one another and those connections are so powerful that they overcome some of the other worries.”

Holiday travel will be focused on domestic destinations mostly people visiting friends and family. Once travelers arrive at their destinations they’re likely to encounter other pandemic-related problems.

Hotels and restaurants are understaffed said Ramsey the Dallas travel agent. “You just can’t expect the kind of service you had before.”

Advertisement

Ramsey estimates that 50% or more of travelers are delaying trips particularly major vacations.

“Before the delta variant spike people were planning trips for Christmas but then they started canceling in September” she said. “It’s going to take time maybe years because this is the new normal. This isn’t going away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzI0L2F1c3Rpbi1haXJwb3J0LWRlbGF5cy13aGVuLXRvLWFycml2ZS1sYXRlc3QvNjE2NTkzODAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flying out of Austin Texas?

For those with international flights the airport is recommending passengers arrive 3½ hours early.

Arrive even earlier if you expect to check luggage or need to return a rental car.

The weekend of Formula One racing at Circuit of the Americas was expected to have a total attendance of more than 350000 and the crowd for Sunday's race topped 140000 — the largest single-day sporting event in the Austin area's history and one of the biggest in the nation since the pandemic began.

Airport officials encouraged use of both the lower- and upper-level curbsides for drop-offs.

For faster screening passengers are advised to pack their F1 souvenirs in carry-on bags not checked bags and ensure that carry-on bags do not have prohibited items such as firearms or liquids larger than 3.4 ounces.

Passengers may check in for their flights online or use the self-serve kiosks near the airline’s ticket counters to skip those lines.

The many seasonal and limited edition flavors of Starbucks Japan's Frappuccinos comes in a wide variety of flavors but they have a habit of dressing up on Halloween. For past celebrations of everyone's favorite fright night Starbucks has released Halloween Witch and Princess renditions as well as a bloody red night masquerade flavor of their popular Frappuccinos.

That tradition continues this year with the release of the new Treat with Trick Frappuccino. The new beverage is actually a Halloween twist on their fall favorite Roasted Sweet Potato Frappuccino which puts a Halloween costume on top of the Frapp in terms of both aesthetic and taste.

The new beverage takes the Roasted Sweet Potato Frappuccino's base ingredients but darkens its appearance with a dose of chocolate powder and gives a ""spooky"" drizzling of purple potato flavored syrup on top.

In addition customers can pay an extra 108 yen (110 yen if you drink in store) to add ""Popping Topping"" candy (a fizzle and pop in your mouth candy like Pop Rocks but with white chocolate flavor) to their drink for a fizzling ""Halloween Trick"" for their tastebuds.

The Treat with Trick Frappuccino will be available at Starbucks throughout Japan until Oct 31 in limited quantity.

Your favourite Starbucks treat is back again this coming week.

Starbucks 1-for-1 Promotion

That’s right – Starbucks Singapore will be offering a 1-for-1 treat from 25 – 28 October (Mon – Thu) and it will be available all day redeemable at any store islandwide.

There are three Frappuccino drinks to choose from which includes:

Dark Mocha Frappuccino

Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino

Strawberry Cream & Waffle Crisp Frappuccino

Dark Mocha Frappuccino

Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino

Strawberry Cream & Waffle Crisp Frappuccino

As for the last drink it looks like this will be Starbucks new drink which will be introduced shortly next week so stay tuned.

We think it might be similar to the Strawberry Choux Cream Frappuccino that was available in June earlier this year.

However do take note you will need to order Venti sizes (yes the largest one) for the drinks to enjoy the 1-for-1 treat so don’t forget to jio your buddies or family along if you can’t finish it all by yourself.

Development at a Blackpool leisure park looks set to be kickstarted after plans were revealed for a Starbucks drive-thru coffee shop on the site.

Preston-based company Austringer Capital Ltd has applied for planning permission for the scheme at the 8.5 acre Festival Leisure Park on Rigby Road.

The outlet – set to be the third new Starbucks in the south side of Blackpool – would be built next to the existing Frankie and Benny’s restaurant on land currently used for parking.

Other tenants on the site include the Odeon Cinema Bannatyne’s Gym and a Macdonalds restaurant.

Construction work stopped on a £7m new Club 3000 bingo hall last year but is expected to resume.

It was granted planning permission on appeal in 2019 along with a drive-thru restaurant after the council had refused the application.

But the latest blueprint is seeking permission for detailed designs related to the Starbucks brand and amendments to the car park and circulation routes.

A new vehicle entrance to the site is set to be built from Rigby Road and if the latest development goes ahead it will mean the total number of parking spaces on the site is 497 compared to the original number of 604.

A design brief accompanying the application says: “The proposal is to provide a new Starbuck drive thru building with surrounding car park and access road around the building designed in line with the brand standards.

“The application also incorporates redesign of the surrounding car park to serve the new building and to improve the existing circulation around the site including access for delivery vehicles.”

Town hall planners will now consider the application.

PORTLAND Maine — Portland Police have arrested a man following a more than five hour standoff on State Street in Portland on Sunday.

According to Portland Police spokesperson David Singer police arrested Carlos Dubon 26 of Portland. Police say they were called to the area of 62 State Street shortly after 11:30 a.m. for reports of a man pointing handgun at traffic.

Singers says when officers arrived a person could still be seen holding the firearm. According to police the suspect refused to follow commands of Portland Police Officers and fled into 62 State Street.

The Portland Police Department Special Reaction Team and Crisis Negotiations also responded to the call. Officers worked to get additional residents out of the apartment building safely.

According to police after hours of negation chemical munitions were used to help draw out the suspect from the building. According to Police Dubon was arrested shortly before 5:00 pm.

Dubon was transported to Maine Medical Center for precautionary reasons according to police. He will then be held at Cumberland County Jail.

Dubon is charged with Criminal Threatening with a Dangerous Weapon Reckless Conduct Refusal to Submit to Arrest Violation of Conditions of Release and Creating a Police Standoff. Singer says officers served a search warrant on Dubon’s apartment after he was in custody and collected evidence.

Police say Jose Dubon also from Portland was also arrested on scene and charged with Obstructing Government Administration and Refusal to Submit to Arrest.

According to Police Police Major Jason King crews were also ventilating the building.

The scene cleared shortly before 6:00 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzI0LzI3MTAwNjAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man pointing gun at passing traffic prompts hourslong standoff in Portland,"Two men were in custody Sunday night following a police standoff at an apartment building on State Street in Portland that lasted for more than five hours. The incident began when police responded to a report of a man pointing a gun at passing motorists.

Carlos Dubon 24 and Jose Dubon 26 both of Portland were arrested following the standoff at 62 State St. a four-story brick apartment building.

Carlos Dubon was taken by ambulance to Maine Medical Center “for precautionary reasons” and was later to be transferred to the Cumberland County Jail where he will be charged with criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon reckless conduct refusal to submit to arrest violation of conditions of release and creating a police standoff Portland police spokesman David Singer said in a press release. Officers served a search warrant on Dubon’s apartment in the building after he was in custody and collected evidence.

Jose Dubon was charged with obstructing government administration and refusal to submit to arrest Singer said. It was not clear whether the two men are related or whether both lived in the same building.

The standoff began late Sunday morning when Portland police officers responded to the call about a man – later identified as Carlos Dubon – pointing a handgun at passing traffic.

When officers arrived around 11:33 a.m. they encountered a man brandishing a firearm. He refused to obey police commands and fled inside 62 State St.

Members of the Portland police Special Reaction Team responded along with the department’s crisis negotiators. Other tenants were safely evacuated but Carlos Dubon remained inside.

“After hours of negotiations chemical munitions were used to extricate the male from his apartment” Singer said.

Maj. Jason King of the Portland Police Department told reporters near the building around 5 p.m. that the suspect was in custody and that the standoff had come to an end. Though it was unclear exactly what took place inside the building there were no reports of injuries to law enforcement officers or bystanders.

King said that crews from the fire department would need time to ventilate the building at Danforth and State streets. Two officers both wearing gas masks received medical treatment in a waiting ambulance shortly before King announced the suspect was in custody. Paramedics rinsed their faces with water and gave them eye drops.

A large crowd of onlookers gathered at the scene Sunday while a number of police officers many carrying long guns surrounded the building which is located diagonally across the street from 75 State Street an independent living and assisted living community for seniors in Portland’s West End.

During the standoff police blocked off sections of Danforth and State streets to traffic while a large police presence filtered into the area. In addition to the Crime Scene Investigation unit and the department’s Crisis Negotiation team the Portland Fire Department sent its Rescue 1 truck which specializes in handling hazardous materials. The police department’s Special Reaction Team is trained to respond to incidents that exceed the capabilities of standard patrol resources. Situations could include high-risk search or arrest warrants armed barricaded subjects hostage rescue and apprehension of dangerous suspects according to its website.

Earlier during the standoff some officers had long guns drawn and pointed at the building. At one point an officer walked toward the building with a shield.

Around 3:20 p.m. officers carrying what appeared to be gas masks entered the building and a short time later police escorted people out.

Portland police shared on social media shortly before 1 p.m. that the “situation is contained” but officers were still on the scene hours later.

Church celebrates 150 years of worship in Savannah,"SAVANNAH Ga. (WTOC) - Area and national black church leaders gathered today in Savannah to celebrate a milestone anniversary for the St. Paul C.M.E. Church.

The historically black church was founded 150 years ago this month.

It was a full house inside the Tiger Arena around noon at Savannah State University - as area leaders gathered to celebrate. There was song and dance but most of all prayer.

St. Paul’s Christian Methodist Episcopal Church established in October of 1871. It evolved out of a passion to worship God by enslaved African Americans who came together for services according to the church website. While St. Paul’s is located on Barnard Street church leaders held the anniversary worship at Tiger Arena to have more space for pandemic precautions.

The anniversary sermon was delivered by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Rev. Da’Henri Thurmond Sr is the current senior pastor.

“The celebration of our anniversary is really a recognition of what God has done for us not only for us but for our ancestors” Thurmond said. “And then I believe it’s a recognition of what God is doing moving forward so even the generations that will come after us will be able to recognize this day as a significant and sentimental moment in the history of our church.”

Notably those in attendance included: Bishop Thomas L. Brown Sr of the CME 6th Episcopal District Rev. Thurmond Tillman of First African Baptist Church in Savannah former Savannah mayors Otis Johnson and Edna Jackson Ahmaud Arbery’s father Marcus Arbery Sr. and Arbery’s mother Wanda Cooper Jones with family attorney Lee Merritt.

Modern battlefields course with massive quantities of signals traffic: radio control links to remotely command drone aircraft and ground vehicles communications networks keeping soldiers at the frontline in touch with distant higher headquarters and active radar emissions reflecting off of hostile aircraft and incoming missiles.

Electronic warfare (EW) is the dark wizardry that seeks to turn these indispensable sensor and communications links against their users. Transmissions can be listened in on to gain compromising intelligence (COMINT) or used to identify what units are in a theater (electronic intelligence or ELINT). Electromagnetic sensors called Electronic Support Measures (ESM) can even geo-locate a transmitter’s position precisely enough for targeting with deadly attacks. Electronic Attack capabilities (jammers) can drown out communications and blind radars when they’re needed most. Even offensive hacking can disrupt or mislead adversary systems.

The U.S. Army is now seeking to wrap all of these potent capabilities in one tidy armor-plated box having announced on September 27 it was awarding $9.6 million to Lockheed Martin to equip several of its Stryker armored vehicles with an electronic warfare system combining an unprecedented trifecta of capabilities: cyberwarfare signals intelligence and electronic attack.

This followed a sixteen-month competition in which Lockheed and DRT/Boeing both submitted three proof of concept vehicles for evaluation. The Army has requested a further $39 million for the program presumably to fund testing and early procurement of the new EW vehicle.

The electronic warfare Stryker is opaquely designated the Terrestrial Layer Systems-BCT because it will have the mobility and armor protection to accompany on the ground mechanized Brigade Combat Team (BCT) at the forefront of the fighting.

The Stryker is a family of 8x8 wheeled armored personnel carriers armored against mines small arms and artillery shrapnel. Besides the basic M1126 troop carrier model the Army is also inducting a Short-Range Air Defense model called the Stryker M-SHORAD designed to protect U.S. mechanized units in battle against low-flying aircraft missiles and drones using Stinger and Hellfire missiles and a 30-millimeter gun. There’s also a Stryker-DE model armed with a laser for more efficient defense against drones.

The Stryker BCT-TLS variant however is based on the eighteen-ton M1133 armored ambulance model because it has the necessary additional electrical outlets. Lockheed’s concept art for the Stryker BCT-TLS shows three large dome antennae on the vehicle’s center and rear hull as well as side hull-mounted sensors. Undoubtedly cramming together so many powerful antennae in one hull poses significant technical challenges. An Army presentation also notes it will use machine-learning to automate electronic attack missions and feature fast tuning directional finding capabilities.

The Army’s Electronic Attack Renaissance

The TLS-BCT is quite a comeback because at the end of the Cold War the Army retired its electronic attack capabilities. In the 2000s the service only focused on fielding short-range jammers to protect convoys in Iraq and Afghanistan from remotely detonated Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).

Instead U.S. Air Force and Navy EC-130H Compass Call and EA-18G Growler aircraft respectively took on electronic and cyber-attack roles. But these could not persistently protect ground units when combating a more formidable adversary with powerful air defenses.

Lethal conflicts in the 2010s suggest the pivotal role ground-based electronic warfare may play in future conflicts. In the war in Eastern Ukraine in 2014-2015 Russian electronic warfare companies were able to geolocate Ukrainian headquarters and hack into soldiers’ cellphones allowing targeting of artillery strike that killed hundreds. Jamming also crippled Ukrainian command and control capabilities just as Russian offensives were underway. A U.S. Army study group concluded that the Russian EW units were extremely effective and that highly networked U.S. command posts would prove vulnerable to them if they didn’t adapt.

Then in 2020 Turkish ground-based KORAL jamming systems seemingly played an important role in disrupting Russian-built air defense systems in Syria allowing tactical combat drones to overcome them in battles of attrition.

Now the Army plans to field TLS-BCT vehicles in an Electronic Warfare platoon in each maneuver brigade’s Military Intelligence Company.

Currently field formations are fielding several lighter and less versatile stop-gap EW vehicles. Mechanized units use the Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) mounted on a basic M1126 Stryker hull. Light infantry use the TEW-Light on a Flyer72 special operations truck which can only perform ESM duties. These are supplemented by AN/MLQ-44A Prophet signals intelligence trucks. All will be passed down to National Guard units as the Army begins receiving TL-BCTS.

However Armada International reported in December 2020 that these won’t all use the Stryker TLS variant. Instead armored brigades equipped with Bradley fighting vehicles will receive the equipment on tracked Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPVs) which use largely the same hull as the Bradley. Light infantry brigades would also get their own vehicle presumably on a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)-style chassis. However there’s been little information since regarding additional TLS-BCT variants.

Regardless TLS-BCT has open architecture and can integrate with other systems using its shared C5ISR/EW Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS)  including a drone called the MFEW-Air-Large. This will actually be a pod mounted on the standard MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone already used by brigade Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) companies which will be able to detect and geolocate emitters up to an estimated 240 miles away and attack with its own jammer. However funding for MFEW-AL was removed from the 2022 defense budget but may be restored in later years.

The Army is also interested in a smaller pod system (MFEW-AS) with a range estimated at 173 miles for mounting on a smaller Class 3 drones like the RQ-7B. This system pegged for delivery in 2030 could serve in a more forward outrider role compared to the larger drone. There’s also an obscure MFEW-Rotary program to defensively support future Army scout helicopters.

Thinking Big: TLS-Echelon Above Brigade

TLS-BCT and the MFEW drones both will be connected to higher headquarters using the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EW-PMT) which can output to the laptop-based Raven Claw system.

EW-PMT synthesizes signals intelligence from multiple sources to generate a global picture of electronic activity in a battlespace and also manages friendly systems on the electronic spectrum to make sure they don’t interfere with each other. Future “capability drops” are planned to make it capable of remotely controlling EW assets from afar enhance targeting of electronic attacks and integrate more cyber-capability.

Higher-level headquarters also need electronic warfare assets so the Army plans to introduce a longer-range system called the TLS-EAB for “Echelon Above Brigade” that will be used by Divisional and Corps-level electronic warfare companies as well as being integrated into the Army’s unique new brigade-sized Multi-Domain Taskforces.

The two types of TLS-EAB systems will be situated further away from the frontline and won’t require armor protection so they’ll be installed on Oshkosh FMTV medium tactical trucks.

The first variant will effectively be a longer-range version for the TLS-BCT and have a crew of eight divided between SIGINT and EW personnel and combine signals intelligence jamming radio direction-finding and hacking capabilities.

However there will also be a High-Energy Defensive Electronic Attack version with the mission of defending headquarters and other vital rear-area units using jamming and hacking to disable or misdirect incoming drone and missile attacks. It may even be able to prematurely detonate radio-fused artillery shells. This will apparently be networkable with the Army’s IBCS air defense network to enhance response time against incoming threats as well as with national technical means (ie. missile-warning satellites).

Given the pivotal role electronic warfare already played in the twentieth century its fielding of the TLS arguably is a reassuring sign that the Army grasps that both field formations and rear-area support units will need beefy electronic warriors to survive on potential battlefields of the future.

The redundant power supplies in the server are 400W units. These are 80Plus Platinum-rated units. It is common in this segment to see single PSUs as well as PSUs that are only Bronze or Gold-rated so this is actually a relatively nice solution for this segment.

We saw an idle of around 33W. We saw maximum power consumption of just over 130W. Practically this is very important because it was easily able to exceed 110-120W even without a fully populated configuration. In this market that is important because one of the key target markets is the dedicated server/low-cost web hosting and colocation market. These systems with higher-end CPUs can exceed the maximum power of inexpensive 1A 110V/120V hosting plans. It does require higher-end workloads to hit these power figures but it is something to keep in mind when configuring the system. There are lower power processors in the 65W TDP range that one would likely not have to worry about. On the other hand if one adds high-end cards like DPUs high-end NICs RAID controllers and a full set of drives it will go over the maximum power budget for these plans. Of course technology is marching forward so power consumption in data centers is rising quickly outside of this segment.

Note these results were taken using a 208V Schneider Electric / APC PDU at 17.0C and 62% RH. Our testing window shown here had a +/- 0.3C and +/- 2% RH variance.

STH Server Spider: Supermicro SYS-510T-MR

In the second half of 2018 we introduced the STH Server Spider as a quick reference to where a server system’s aptitude lies. Our goal is to start giving a quick visual depiction of the types of parameters that a server is targeted at.

This is a fairly good all-around server but it is clearly not designed for density. In an age where we can get 1U servers with 128 cores/ 256 threads 4TB+ of memory and many NVMe SSDs/ accelerators an entry-level server is optimized around cost instead of density. As such this system has a solid number of configuration options. These allow the system to address a number of use cases at the lower-density end of the spectrum.

Final Words

This server at least has an easy feature to call out as our favorite the Supermicro X12STH-SYS motherboard. That fun aside this is an interesting system. On one hand there are clear areas where the entry server platform is advanced. Rocket Lake-E has PCIe Gen4 and DDR4-3200 support.

The Intel Xeon E-2300 series does not add one important feature new cores whether they are performance or efficient cores to the segment. As a result some may look at Intel’s platform here and call out stagnation. Beyond that though Supermicro has added new updated features to its servers such as the AST2600 BMC updated management interface support for an internal SD HBA/ RAID controller and so forth. It certainly feels like this is a solid generational evolution but not necessarily a revolution in terms of capacity. Still if you are purchasing a server it will be harder to recommend the previous generation.

Overall the Supermicro SYS-510T-MR is a solid server that brings a host of new features and functionalities to the entry-level server market. These new features come from both the underlying Intel Xeon platform as well as the new features that Supermicro is adding to the platform bringing more parity between this and its higher-end servers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

JACKSONVILLE Fla. – Truck drivers wanted.

This comes after a supply chain shortage has impacted the country.

Driver Thomas Glass gassed up his truck Sunday and cleaned off his windshield before he headed out for another busy week on the road.

“I’m always busy” Glass said. “I’m running between 3500 miles a week” Glass said.

Glass is not the only driver spending a lot of time on the road lately.

“This past week I probably did somewhere around 3000 miles” said driver Larry Williams.

The truck drivers’ busy schedules come as more drivers are needed to help with the supply chain shortage.

The American Trucking Association estimates the industry is facing a shortage of approximately 80000 truck drivers.

“It’s a great field to be in I’ve been doing it for about 30 years” Williams said.

Some trucking companies are offering bonuses for drivers who apply. Distributor Sysco is offering salaries of up to $110000 per year along with a $15000 bonus.

Glass said the company he works for even has a referral program.

“The bonus has been between three to five thousand dollars just to refer somebody to drive” said Glass.

The job requires mental focus and being on the road for long hours. Glass said it is rewarding.

“It’s a good career. It going to allow you to see some things that you’ve never seen before. You’re going to experience some things you’ve never experienced before” Glass said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5ubWVkaWFza24uY29tL3BhY2lvdXMtcHRlLWx0ZC1kb25hdGVzLTQwLWZvb3QtY29udGFpbmVyLW9mLWRyeS1mb29kcy10by1hc3Npc3QtaW4tbmF0aW9uYWwtcmVzcG9uc2UtdG8tY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pacious PTE Ltd donates 40 foot container of dry foods to assist in national response to COVID-19 pandemic | WINNFM ...,"Basseterre St. Kitts (SKNIS): Chairperson of the National COVID-19 Task Force Mr. Abdias Samuel has lauded the efforts and thanked Mr. Gurdip ‘Dev’ Bath a national of St. Kitts and Nevis and Pacious Pte Ltd for their support towards the COVID-19 response in St. Kitts and Nevis.

The answer is complicated,"Google's new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro introduced at Google's Oct. 19 Pixel event both seem poised to rival the iPhone 13 and the Galaxy S21 as the best phones of 2021. They boast impressive cameras fast processors and stylish designs. Where Google appears to differ from its Apple and Samsung rivals at least on the first few days of preorders is in whether its new phones will work with the latest 5G networks.

The short answer? It's complicated particularly if you're looking to buy a phone directly from a carrier or unlocked from Google itself or from a third party like Best Buy. Whereas you can buy a new iPhone 13 put your SIM card in and know that it will be able to use the latest networks from your carrier the same can't be said right now about the Pixel 6.

At issue appears to be interpreting a mix of several unclear web pages from the search giant. Google's main Pixel 6 and 6 Pro tech specs pages all list two different models: one that supports all flavors of 5G -- millimeter-wave and ""Sub-6"" (which is a term that encompasses mid- and low-band 5G) -- and another that supports Sub-6 networks but not millimeter-wave.

A support page meanwhile says the Pixel 6 will support all flavors of 5G in the US while the 6 Pro will be limited to just the millimeter-wave flavor.

It's a mess but here is what we know right now and what you should know if you're thinking of buying Google's latest phones.

The Pixel mess

Andrew Hoyle/CNET

With the Pixel 6 Google initially appears to be sending mixed messages. Depending on which page and fine print you look at the device may or may not have been listed to work with all versions of your carrier's 5G network.

And there does seem to be a discrepancy both in the devices and the pricing. Verizon confirmed to CNET that buying a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro directly from Verizon will get you a phone that works on all of its flavors of 5G millimeter-wave and Sub-6.

There is however a premium for the Verizon Pixel 6. When buying directly from Verizon the phone will cost you $700 or roughly $100 more than Google charges for an unlocked Pixel 6 purchased directly from the Google Store. The 6 Pro starts at around $900 from both Google and Verizon.

AT&T tells CNET something similar. When buying directly from AT&T both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro will support millimeter-wave and Sub-6 versions of 5G. AT&T's issue? Its pricing starts at $740 for the Pixel 6 and $940 for the 6 Pro both higher than what Google charges for unlocked versions. A representative for the carrier did not share a reason why its pricing is more expensive.

T-Mobile meanwhile matches Google's pricing of $599 for the Pixel 6 but its model only supports the midband and low-band versions of 5G not millimeter-wave. For the 6 Pro T-Mobile supports all flavors of 5G and the price is similar to Google's.

On Wednesday afternoon Google confirmed to CNET that the unlocked Pixel 6 available from its store will only support Sub-6 5G networks at all three US carriers. The unlocked Pixel 6 Pro however will work with both millimeter-wave and Sub-6 versions of 5G.

The different flavors of 5G

James Martin/CNET

As people have been holding onto their phones for longer it makes sense that when buying a new device today you'll want it to be capable of tapping into the latest 5G networks for the next few years.

US carriers namely Verizon and AT&T have been actively deploying millimeter-wave 5G across parts of several dozen cities (plus stadiums arenas and airports) around the country. Verizon in particular has been touting its millimeter-wave network (called ""Ultra Wideband"") in its early 5G marketing over the last few years.

T-Mobile has done some millimeter-wave 5G rollouts but has largely focused on the other Sub-6 forms of 5G.

Millimeter-wave is the fastest version of 5G. It has download speeds that can reach several gigabits per second but it suffers from severely limited coverage particularly outdoors where it can be limited to just a few select blocks in a city or sections in a stadium. It also struggles to penetrate indoors.

Low-band 5G offers the best coverage and can work fine indoors but it often has speeds equivalent to a good 4G LTE connection.

Midband 5G as its name implies offers a middle ground between the two: significantly faster speeds than 4G LTE while still covering a wider area and working indoors. T-Mobile has been the most active of the US carriers with deploying midband 5G thus far (what it calls Ultra Capacity) and has previously said it plans to cover 200 million people nationwide with this service before the end of 2021.

AT&T and Verizon have each spent billions of dollars this year buying up midband spectrum known as C-band and both plan to begin deploying these networks at the end of this year and into early 2022.

Both carriers said on Oct. 19 that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro they're selling should be compatible with their respective C-band networks. T-Mobile said on Oct. 20 that both Pixel phones would support its C-band network that's slated to start rolling out at the end of 2023.

Google said on Oct. 21 that unlocked Pixels will be able to get a software update to enable support for C-band but that it will be up to the carriers to certify the unlocked phones to allow the devices to work on their respective networks.

What should you do?

Currently carrier support for the Pixel 6 is a big problem. Nobody wants to buy a phone find out it doesn't work as expected and then have to return it and go through the process again. But right now the only way to know you're getting a Pixel that works with your carrier is to buy directly from that carrier.

For T-Mobile users the Pixel 6's lack of a higher-frequency 5G such as millimeter-wave is far from a deal-breaker for the regular Pixel 6 at least in the short term. The carrier already has a robust midband 5G network has not really deployed millimeter-wave and its C-band network isn't coming until the end of 2023.

For those with AT&T or Verizon if you're able to take advantage of a trade-in or upgrade deal then buying directly from the carrier might not be a bad option. The promotion and trade-in could offset the price difference between buying from a carrier or buying from Google.

Buying this way seems to be the safest way to ensure that the Pixel you're getting will work with the major network improvements both carriers are set to deliver over the next few years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1cmlzdC5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL3VzLXRyYWRlLWNvbW1pc3Npb24tZGV0YWlscy1pbnZhc2l2ZS1kYXRhLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tcHJhY3RpY2VzLWJ5LW1ham9yLWlzcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US trade commission details invasive data collection practices by major ISPs,"A staff report from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found Thursday that many internet service providers (ISPs) are collecting and sharing large amounts of data from their customers without offering them meaningful choices regarding the use of such data.

The information report stems from a series of orders issued by the US FTC in 2019 under Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act and covers data collection practices of six major ISPs including AT&T Verizon Wireless T-Mobile and Google Fiber.

These ISPs together make up 98% of the mobile internet market in the US. They also offer a range of other services including voice content smart devices advertising and analytics which increases the volume and type of consumer data they can collect.

The report identified “troubling data collection practices” among several of the ISPS including combining data across product lines; categorizing customers into sensitive categories such as race ethnicity sexual orientation political affiliations economic status and religious beliefs; targetted advertisement through combining personal app usage and web browsing data; and sharing real-time location with third party customers.

Although many ISP companies provided privacy protections and promised not to sell consumers’ personal data they allowed this data to be “used transferred and monetised” by third parties. They were also hiding disclosures about such practices in fine print leading and nudging customers towards sharing even more information. Thus while these ISPs claimed to offer customers choices about the collection and use of their data their privacy policies made it difficult for customers to exercise this right effectively.

The Chair Lina Khan said the report highlights fundamental questions around conditioning the use of essential technologies. The FTC has said it will use its legal authority to “put in the nondiscrimination rules privacy protections and other basic requirements needed to create a healthier market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZXNtYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVzaWMvMjAyMS8xMC8yMy9hY2wtZmVzdC0yMDIxLXBob3Rvcy1hdXN0aW4tY2l0eS1saW1pdHMtbXVzaWMtZmVzdGl2YWwtcG9ydHJhaXRzLWFydGlzdHMtbGluZXVwLW11c2ljaWFucy82MTA1Njc3MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ACL Fest 2021 photos: Never-before-seen Austin portraits of artists,"No commitment required.

The clubs which had hoped to stop other teams being promoted or relegated accuse soccer chiefs of seeking a monopoly.

Real Madrid FC Barcelona and Juventus — the three clubs still behind the Super League — are reported to be planning legal action against football authorities. The three sides say they want to dismantle a “monopoly” that prevents the creation of rival contests.

Britain’s Financial Times newspaper has reported seeing documents that the clubs are filing with the European Court of Justice. The newspaper said the sides will ask judges to decide whether European football’s governing body UEFA can continue to act as a regulator.

According to the court documents the Super League accuses Uefa and Fifa of abusing their dominant position. “Contrary to other sporting competition markets Uefa and Fifa keep and fiercely defend a monopolistic position in European football that goes against competition law despite efforts from other operators to access the market” it said.

They claim the UEFA should not be able to sanction clubs while profiting from organizing tournaments such as the Champions League according to the document.

""Many internet service providers (ISPs) collect and share far more data about their customers than many consumers may expect—including access to all of their Internet traffic and real-time location data—while failing to offer consumers meaningful choices about how this data can be used"" the FTC said.

This was found as part of a study started in 2019 into the privacy practices of U.S. broadband companies and related entities and how they collect retain use and disclose info about consumers and their devices.

The six broadband providers included in FTC's report are AT&T Mobility Cellco Partnership (aka Verizon Wireless) Charter Communications Operating Comcast (aka Xfinity) T-Mobile U.S. and Google Fiber.

The FTC also included in the study three advertising entities affiliated with these companies: AT&T's Appnexus rebranded as Xandr Verizon's Verizon Online and Oath Americas rebranded as Verizon Media.

Together the six companies currently control roughly 98 percent of the nation's mobile Internet market according to the FTC.

The FTC also noted that these tech giants have expanded beyond fixed residential internet and mobile internet services into other areas.

By including voice content smart devices advertising and analytics services they could further increase the volume of customer data they can collect and share with third parties.

Troubling data collection protection and sharing practices

""The report identified several troubling data collection practices among several of the ISPs including that they combine data across product lines; combine personal app usage and web browsing data to target ads; place consumers into sensitive categories such as by race and sexual orientation; and share real-time location data with third-parties"" the FTC said.

As the FTC further discovered the ISPs amass huge pools of sensitive consumer data and use it in ways their customers do not expect and could cause them harm primarily when classifying them by demographic characteristics including race ethnicity gender or sexuality.

Although many ISPs claim to offer consumers choices the choices they provide are often a sham at times nudging them toward even more data sharing.

""Even though several of the ISPs promise not to sell consumers personal data they allow it to be used transferred and monetized by others and hide disclosures about such practices in fine print of their privacy policies"" the FTC added.

""For example several news outlets noted that subscribers' real-time location data shared with third-party customers was being accessed by car salesmen property managers bail bondsmen bounty hunters and others without reasonable protections or consumers' knowledge and consent according to the report.""

Furthermore because of their problematic privacy practices and protections they can be at least as privacy-intrusive as large advertising platforms given that they have direct access to their consumers' entire unencrypted internet traffic.

Even when connecting to sites that encrypt their traffic or using VPNs ISPs can still collect the domains their customers connect to and analyze their browsing behavior.

Former FCC Chair Ajit Pai blamed for current state of things

U.S. Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement following FTC's report that Ajit Pai the former head of the FCC is likely the one who made it possible for tech firms to disregard their users' privacy by harvesting and using their data for business purposes.

""If Congress needed any more proof that America desperately needs a consumer privacy law the Federal Trade Commission's report about internet service providers' rampant abuse of their customers' private personal browsing information should be enough to get Washington to act"" Wyden said.

""Whether it's advertisers tech companies or Big Cable corporate America is showing absolute contempt for the idea that consumers can control personal details about their lives. Democrats have introduced multiple comprehensive privacy bills that would crack down on this flagrant abuse.

""Finally it's worth remembering that former Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai opened the floodgates to ISPs' unchecked use of browsing data when he repealed the Obama-era broadband privacy and net neutrality regulations.

""The FCC needs every tool available to stop cable companies from gouging consumers and selling their data."""

Rivian’s filings to the NHTSA have revealed something very interesting — the name and what appears to be the main specs of the company’s all-electric delivery vans. Based on these VIN filings it appears that Rivian may have plans to sell its all-electric delivery vans to clients beyond Amazon in the future.

Immediately noticeable from Rivian’s VIN filings was the fact that there are three listed trims for its delivery van each with a different drivetrain option. The names of the Rivian electric delivery van are “500 LHD Van” “500 RHD Van” and “700 Van.” As noted in the Rivian Owners Forum the names of the vehicles seem to be a reference to their cargo capacity.

With this in mind it appears that the company is looking to initially release versions of the electric delivery van with a capacity of 500 cubic feet and 700 cubic feet respectively. The vehicles will also be offered in 2x single-motor AWD dual-motor FWD and single-motor FWD options. Speculations are abounding that Rivian would be releasing a 900 cubic foot variant of the vehicle in the future as well.

Perhaps the most interesting portion of Rivian’s filings however lies in the specific trims of the 500 LHD Van 500 RHD Van and 700 Van. As could be seen in the document the vehicles would be offered in two trims: the “S” and “Z.” The “Z” variant is specifically listed as an “Amazon” vehicle while the “S” trim was listed simply for “Service.” Whether this pertains to Rivian’s plans to release its electric delivery vans to clients beyond Amazon in the future remains to be seen but a trim that’s set apart from the e-commerce giant is quite interesting nonetheless.

While Rivian R1T deliveries to employees are now underway reports have recently emerged hinting that the company is laser-focused on releasing some of its electric delivery vans by the end of the year. Back in July for example CEO RJ Scaringe noted that while deliveries of the R1T pickup truck would be delayed the electric delivery vans for Amazon were still being rolled out as scheduled. Sources close to Rivian’s operations have also told Bloomberg that the company is looking to produce as many as 300 Amazon delivery vans by the end of the year with 10000 being produced in 2022.

Rivian currently has an order for 100000 units of its all-electric delivery vans from Amazon with the vehicles due for delivery by the end of the decade. On the other hand the news outlet’s sources have noted that Rivian has so far received refundable deposits for over 48300 R1T pickup trucks and R1S SUVs. With this in mind it would be quite unsurprising if Rivian ends up really focusing its production on vehicles that Amazon ordered.

“Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition will feature across-the-board upgrades including graphical improvements and modern gameplay enhancements for all three titles while still maintaining the classic look and feel of the originals… To prepare for launch we will begin removing existing versions of the classic titles from digital retailers next week.”

Original Article – ‘Grand Theft Auto’ Remastered Trilogy Currently In Development

Rockstar Games’ Grand Theft Auto franchise has been mired in what seems like an endless procession of rumours lately and we’re not just talking about the long-overdue sixth instalment that’s slated for 2025. Fresh reports are now indicating a remastered Grand Theft Auto trilogy – GTA III GTA: Vice City GTA: San Andreas – is in the works from Rockstar’s Dundee Studio in Scotland with a tentative release date of late October slash early November this year.

Compatible with every console from PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox One Xbox Series X | S Nintendo Switch to Stadia – eventually arriving to PC and mobile devices in 2022 – the possibility has been discussed for some time now; but only recently alluded to by Rockstar’s parent company Take-Two Interactive which confirmed plans for three unannounced refreshes of classic titles (although some speculate this could involve the likes of Max Payne Bioshock and Bully instead).

According to an unnamed inside source who has spoken to Kotaku all three games are being remastered using Unreal Engine blending a mix of “new and old graphics.” One particular source who claims to have witnessed a snippet of the games in action firsthand stated the visual component was extremely reminiscent of the classic GTA titles’ heavily modded versions. Throw in the fact an entire shotgun spray of DMCA takedowns were fired off to remove said classic GTA mods as the remastered games were announced and suddenly it all makes sense.

The UI for each game is facing something of an overhaul as well though will retain a good portion of the same classic style. At this stage no details have been revealed about gameplay – on the unofficial front or otherwise – although Kotaku has on good authority that the coming trilogy will “… [try] to stay true to the PS2-era GTA games as much as possible.” Which is certainly a comfort for the more nostalgic operators among us.

The goalposts for a GTA remastered trilogy has apparently been shifted due to COVID-19. Initially the intention was to release all three games in a single package gifted to players who purchase the upcoming next-gen re-releases of GTA V and GTA Online as a “thank you” bonus of sorts. Now it seems like Rockstar Games wants to make some actual dosh.

If all goes well in the old sales department this could potentially lead to a remastered edition of the original Red Dead Redemption.",,,,,,

I still think the Polestar 2 is an overall better car but the Model 3 is a better EV if that makes any sense. My thoughts on this may not be popular here but I'm going to say it like it I see it.I did two test drives each of Polestar 2 (fully loaded Performance+Pilot+Plus) and Model 3 (first M3LR then M3P) and got to put each car through its paces. Here's my ""short"" form comparison...Model 3 pros:1) [USA] supercharger network: Coverage. There's a notable gap in public DC fast charging in an area I drive around regularly.2) [USA] supercharger network: Number of plugs per site. Lots of big supercharger sites nowadays whereas EA and EVGo are like 1 to 5 plugs per site. If a big supercharger site is full there will be turnover soon but if a tiny EA or EVGo site is full you might be waiting a while...or wasting energy driving around trying to get lucky at a different tiny site. Right now those EA and EVGo sites may be mostly empty but the Mach-E ID.4 etc seem to be selling pretty well I think that's going to change quick.2) [USA] supercharger network: Charging UX. With a supercharger you just show up and plug in. The stories I've read of trying to pay/active public DC chargers sound horrible. I've no interest in fiddling with my phone digging out lost RFID cards from under my seat etc. There is a public charging standard called Plug & Charge that should give Tesla-style charging UX but Polestar hasn't promised to support it. (And I did pester their sales reps about it multiple times.)3) Range. Real world difference is less than EPA difference from what I've seen but it's still real Model 3 is more efficient and has usefully more highway range (where it matters most usually).4) Visibility. Model 3 has tall glass and low beltline by modern car standards. I like this. Whereas Polestar 2 is a bit bunker-feeling.5) Model 3 center infotainment display is much bigger and sharper.6) M3P accelerates quicker from a dig / low speeds. (At highway speeds the Polestar 2 M3LR and M3P all feel roughly comparable to me. Basically Polestar 2 felt approximately like M3LR or MYLR in terms of acceleration.)7) I think Tesla is solidly past the risky-new-car-company stage now. They're going to be here supporting their cars for many years to come and the USA is home base. Whereas Polestar as an independent-ish car company is very new. Will they succeed? Will they succeed *in the USA*? Will they be able to support the China-made Polestar 2 in the face of geopolitical issues? Polestar's next car will be USA-made and USA-focused but at the moment their supply+manufacturing chain looks riskier to me than Tesla's for long-term support of the car.8) The Model 3's super quick steering ratio (10:1 ?) is fun. (But the Polestar 2 Performance has quicker steering reactions even with its slower steering ratio.)9) Tesla has a much stronger set of EV features. Leave climate on / camp / dog modes scheduled charging builtin to the car supercharging is plug-n-play etc. Polestar got some things right e.g. starting the car is same as in a Tesla (press brake + shift into D/R) so they may catch up via software updates but for now Tesla is still ahead in this.Polestar 2 pros based on testing a fully loaded Performance+Pilot+Plus version:1) It's a hatchback/fastback. Cargo space is no bigger than Model 3 maybe even smaller because Polestar 2 is shorter but the hatchback opening is more useful than a trunk. (Yes Model Y has a hatch and way more space than a Polestar 2 but the Y drives like *sugar* in comparison - sorry Y owners.)2) Polestar 2 Performance handling (with stock Öhlins dampers) is night-and-day better than M3P or M3LR. I can't overstate how much better the Polestar handled for twisty roads especially uneven back roads. M3P and M3LR are a sloppy mess in comparison. Even on smooth road it's much better quicker to react more stable etc.3) Polestar 2 Performance ride quality was also much better than Model 3 (LR or P). It was definitely firm and sporty but smaller bumps were completely smoother over and large bumps were felt but never harsh. The ride/handling balance was in a whole different league than Model 3.4) Polestar 2's lift-off regen (in max setting) is much sharper and quicker-reacting than any Tesla I've driven where the regen always feels a little slow and mushy to react. I liked this very much.5) As a tall-ish person I find Polestar 2 back seat a lot more comfortable than Model 3. Yes there's less legroom but the seat is much higher off the floor Model 3 back seat is so low it's very uncomfortable. Polestar 2 has just enough legroom that I could plausibly sit behind myself for a long drive.6) The Polestar 2 front seats seemed to hold me better in turns than Model 3. Not sure if better bolstering or just gripper material.7) I think Android Automotive has potential to become better infotainment than Tesla. Lots of automakers are getting onboard I expect the app ecosystem will grow and eclipse Tesla's functionality soon especially for streaming apps.8) Polestar 2 has all the regular driver's controls. There is a wiper stalk/knob no need for touchscreen to control wiper settings. And the turn signal stalk works the normal way where I can feel what it's set to. I hate how the Model 3/Y stalk always returns to center. Hopefully I'll get used to it...10) Polestar 2 has a driver's display.11) Polestar 2 ACC on my test drive was smoother than my M3P's TACC. Note I've only used it once on each car so this is very tentative comparison. I have used TACC many times on Model S loaners over the years and I actually feel like Tesla TACC has regressed my M3P seems worse at it than those older Model S.12) Polestar 2 Performance package comes with forged wheels. And tires with some actual sidewall (not too much). And the tire width looked matched appropriately for the wheels not overly stretched like the 2021 M3P stock tires.13) I think Polestar 2 highway wind noise was a little lower than Model 3. (Definitely lower than Model Y.)I really like my M3P and I'll be addressing its suspension flaws via Redwood Öhlins coilovers. But I do think Tesla needs to step up some aspects of their cars before their range+charging advantage becomes less of a thing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZHV0Y2gtbGFiLWRlY3J5cHRlZC10ZXNsYXMtZHJpdmluZy1kYXRhLXN0b3JhZ2Utc3lzdGVtLTIwMjEtMTDSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2R1dGNoLWxhYi1kZWNyeXB0ZWQtdGVzbGFzLWRyaXZpbmctZGF0YS1zdG9yYWdlLXN5c3RlbS0yMDIxLTEwP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dutch lab decrypted Tesla's driving data storage system,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

Tesla’s vehicles can record both video and driving data a capability that has foiled many miscreants over the years from car thieves to lawsuit scammers to malicious auto reviewers. Antisocial types don’t like having their actions recorded and it’s safe to assume that they aren’t fans of Tesla’s industry-leading data-collecting and connectivity features.

Above: Tesla's Model Y (Twitter: Above: Tesla's Model Y (Twitter: Tesla Greater China

However it isn’t just freelance fraudsters that are camera-shy. Authoritarian governments are famously suspicious of documentation of all kinds from reporters with notepads to online videos—unless they’re the ones doing the recording.

This could prove to be a problem in the world’s largest and most powerful authoritarian regime a country that Tesla is counting on for a dragon’s share of its future growth. China recently enacted a set of new restrictions on how automakers store and use their ever-growing troves of data. Among other things companies will now be required to store important data within the country. A new video from the Wall Street Journal looks at the risks for Tesla and other global brands.

Autocrats crave control and China’s bosses surely want to keep their mitts on Tesla’s data for (at least) two reasons. First the vehicles record a lot of valuable data—routes driven performance Autopilot usage—that Chinese automakers would probably like to have access to. Second the vehicles’ cameras could theoretically be recording things that the powers-that-be don’t want recorded at all.

Back in April in response to Chinese suspicions of spying Tesla went so far as to say that the cameras in its cars are not activated outside of North America. “Even in the United States car owners can freely choose whether to turn on [the camera system]. Tesla is equipped with a network security system with world-leading security levels to ensure user privacy protection” a company spokesperson posted on a Chinese social media site.

“There’s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information” said Elon Musk. “If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere we [would] get shut down.”

The new policy is already having practical effects on the company. In March China banned Teslas from entering military facilities. The government has also reportedly restricted military personnel and employees of certain state-owned companies from driving Teslas.

Above: As China tightens its grip Tesla and other global brands are now required to keep data within the country (YouTube: Wall Street Journal)

The details of the restrictions aren’t clear—does this mean that no one who works for the military is allowed to own or even ride in a Tesla? Samm Sacks a Senior Fellow at Yale Law School and an expert on China’s cybersecurity policy tells the WSJ that the past few months have brought “a regulatory storm” and that foreign automakers will have to “walk this dance between Beijing and DC—a high-wire act navigating between pressure from Washington...as well as increased pressure from Beijing.”

Cybersuspicion runs in both directions—the US government has targeted Chinese firms such as Huawei and TikTok—and companies that handle large amounts of data are caught in the crossfire. These days that definitely includes automakers and especially Tesla.

Auto firms have had to take several steps to comply with the new rules which went into effect October 1. Tesla says it has set up data centers in China to store all data generated by its cars. Sacks points out that this represents a loss of control. In the future Tesla could have no choice but to share data with local authorities. The government can request access to any data considered “sensitive” which includes among many other things information about traffic and EV charging stations.

Various “damned if you do damned if you don’t” situations aren’t hard to imagine for Tesla and other foreign firms. They could be asked to turn over data that they consider proprietary and threatened with dire consequences if they don’t comply. They could also be accused fairly or not of enabling unauthorized snooping. If they try to play it safe by disabling certain kinds of data collection it could hobble some desirable features. Will Chinese drivers not be allowed to use handy features like Sentry Mode or dashcam footage?

Just complying with China’s data security rules could complicate Tesla’s development efforts. For example as the WSJ points out if all data collected in China has to stay in China that could prevent Tesla from sharing valuable Autopilot usage information with R&D teams in other parts of the world. Having to develop Autopilot algorithms separately in different countries could add another layer of costs.

It’s understood that good relations with the government are the number-one requirement for business success in China. When Tesla announced the construction of Gigafactory Shanghai the Middle Kingdom rolled out the red carpet and it’s been full speed ahead ever since. For now the relationship between the strange bedfellows—all-American libertarian disruptor and repressive Communist regime—is a mutually beneficial one. Tesla needs the sales that the world’s biggest EV growth market can provide and China needs Tesla’s technology to help it seize a coveted seat at the top table of the global auto industry.

On Friday all four Tesla Models received late-night price increases ranging from $2000 for the Model Y Long Range and Model 3 Standard Range+ to $5000 for the Model S and Model X Long Range configurations.

Tesla’s mass-market Model Y in the Long Range variant which has a May delivery projection was increased from $54990 to $56990 on Friday evening. Additionally the Model 3 Standard Range+ which was Tesla’s only vehicle under $40000 just two months ago is now $43990 from $41990. The Model 3 SR+ has increased from $37990 to $43990 this year and is set for delivery in June 2022.

Tesla’s revamped versions of its flagship vehicles the Model S and Model X also both received price bumps late Friday night. The price increases only affected the Long Range configurations of the S and X and not the ultra-performance Plaid variants. The Model S Long Range increased to $94990 from $89990 and is scheduled for June delivery. The Model X Long Range is now $104990 from $99990 and deliveries are set for September.

It is no secret that Tesla’s demand continues to increase while the company’s production output slowly broadens. Tesla is currently producing vehicles at the Fremont factory in Northern California and Gigafactory Shanghai in China. However the company plans to open two new production facilities in the next few months although the automaker is uncertain that these new manufacturing lines will be ready before the end of 2021.

During the Q3 2021 Earnings Call Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said:

“So it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our first production cars before the end of the year. So you know there is quite an execution journey ahead of us. But that remains our target and all of our plans are oriented around that. We should not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories even if we do produce them — so homologation regulatory reasons.”

Production capacity for Tesla will undoubtedly increase in 2022 but it may not occur by the end of the year like the company planned due to regulations in Germany and Texas that could delay initial production efforts. In 2022 Tesla will spend “a bulk of the year working on ramping these factories” so that demand can be handled on a global scale.

It is unknown whether the price increases are due to the extensive backlog or due to parts shortages. Tesla has been able to avoid many bottlenecks that have affected other carmakers but the company was transparent during the Earnings Call that it was challenging to keep things running while supply chain uncertainties still lingered.

In the final week of Q3 2021 Tesla (TSLA -2.04%) CEO Elon Musk claimed it would be the ""most intense delivery week ever"" for the company. In a Motley Fool Live segment recorded on Sept. 28 Motley Fool contributor John Bromels explains to Motley Fool contributor Toby Bordelon why Tesla is always rushing to fulfill its end-of-quarter deliveries.

Tesla is on the list -- but there are nine others you may be overlooking. Click here to get access to the full list! *Stock Advisor returns as of September 17 2021

John Bromels: So Tesla isn't like a traditional automaker which sells cars to its dealerships and then the dealerships sell them to customers. Tesla the manufacturer sells directly to the consumer which means that the company technically owns that vehicle until it's actually delivered to the buyer and paid for. It doesn't matter if they build it it doesn't matter if someone has signed up to buy it it doesn't matter if that person has put their down payment down. Until the keys -- I don't know if they even have keys anymore -- until that vehicle in the hands of that consumer and they have taken possession of it Tesla doesn't get to book that as a delivered car and they don't get to book that revenue for selling the car. Regardless of whether Tesla has built a lot of vehicles during the quarter if they haven't been delivered that quarter's going to look worse for them financially because they can't book that revenue and it won't show up on their quarterly results.

This is why Tesla tries to build vehicles that it's going to export early in the quarter and then it saves up its vehicles that it's delivering locally later in the quarter to allow for transit because if they build early in the quarter and it takes time to ship it overseas probably going to get to the consumer. But all those local late deliveries -- and of course California near the Fremont plant this is a huge market for Tesla -- they are trying to pump these out get them out the door get them delivered. But what that means is there are these massive efforts to deliver the vehicles and get them in the hands of customers before the end of each quarter and these are called ""delivery waves"" or ""delivery pushes."" That's why Elon Musk is saying ""We've got to do this we've got to get this done. This is going to be our biggest delivery push ever.""

The reason it's so big this quarter as opposed to in past quarters is because there have been all these supply chain issues with car components things like semiconductors especially that have slowed down the manufacturing process. Of course if the car doesn't get manufactured on time then they can't get it out the door get it in transit on time. Elon Musk has said he hopes or he thinks that a lot of these supply chain issues are going to resolve themselves before the end of the year. But for now the supply chain issues mean that Tesla still has this mad push to get these vehicles into the hands of consumers so they can book the revenue before the end of the quarter and it will show up on their quarterly statement which of course is what a lot of analysts are going to look at when they decide how to react to Tesla's quarterly results at the end of Q3.

That is why perhaps Elon Musk is going to get A's like Barry Goodrich and not like me. By the way Barry Goodrich you know who you are. If you're watching great to see you Buddy: hope I'll see you at the next class reunion.

Toby Bordelon: Nice. Thank you John. That's great to understand. I like that. I want to say this right here lest our viewers think that the Tesla way of selling direct to the customers is problematic and they should adopt a more traditional automaker model. I'll throw this out there: Ford has recently gone in the Tesla direction a little bit in that they have announced they are doing a lot of made-to-order vehicles and that the customer order is exactly what you want. Now it's still delivered and sold through a dealer but it's not a situation where the dealer is just taking a whole bunch of inventory. When they get this car on their lot they know who's buying it because you ordered through the dealer and you're probably going to drive off with it the next day. Very similar. The amount of time that it's actually on that dealer's inventory is going to be minimized because it's essentially going from Ford Corporate's inventory to the customer with only maybe a couple of days' lag time in there when the dealer is making arrangements for you to show up and take it.

John Bromels: Other automakers are starting to adopt this online sales model. I know Chrysler is doing that where you can go onto its website. You can build your car from start to finish and pick exactly the features you want. You can pick the color. You're not limited to what's on the dealer's lot. Then all you need to do is you pick what dealership you want to actually take delivery of the car in. However for Chrysler this is still essentially the same model they're building the car they're selling into the dealership and you're getting it from the dealership. Still there's a production-delivery paradigm there but it's not as important for them to get that car into your hands and off their books because if you don't show up at the dealer to pick your car up for a day or a week or a month it's not going to matter to Corporate and to their bottom line.

Toby Bordelon: That's right. Again most of these auto dealers the dealers aren't actually public companies so they didn't report quarterly. They care a lot less in terms of what the public thinks about what their revenue looks like on any given quarter. Now the salesmen care obviously the people who are getting quarterly bonuses care but the public at large just doesn't even know or have anything to do with that. There's less pressure there on the dealer side.

John Bromels: Also they are not Tesla. The public doesn't know or care [laughs] about them either.

Toby Bordelon: Exactly.

John Bromels: That's not true. You should care about other car companies besides just the one.

Toby Bordelon: The other thing too that strikes me: we heard last quarter when Elon Musk said that the supply chain shortage the shift toward it wasn't affecting Tesla as much because they were able to mitigate it to some extent. I wonder if other automakers when they're looking at ""Hey let's go to this direct online purchase model"" are sitting there thinking there may be some benefit to what Tesla is doing in terms of mitigating the supply chain issues and that being I'm not just making a random car and sending it to a dealer. What Tesla is doing is saying ""Hey what do you want to buy?"" You order it. They have a higher degree of confidence that the car they're able to produce -- and there may be limitations on when they can produce given the supply chain shortages -- but what they are able to produce is more likely to be bought because someone has said ""This is the exact thing I want."" Ford Chrysler GM might be looking at that and saying there's a benefit to that because if we're constrained in what we can produce -- and they are we've all seen pictures of I think Ford F-150s sitting in empty airport parking lots because they don't have that last chip in there they need for production to be finished. If you can maximize the vehicles that you are producing and say ""I've matched these with the buyer already"" you're going to maximize your ability to generate revenue and sell cars in a constrained environment. I think we may be seeing some of that some of the automotive space like ""hey that's not a bad idea when I have limits on what I can actually produce"" right?

John Bromels: Exactly. Let's face it: having a bunch of cars on the dealership lot is not necessarily great for the dealer itself. I mean kind of in that someone who is shopping for a car can see multiple models if they want to have a look or sit in them themselves but far easier though for a dealer to have the vehicles that people are interested in and the vehicles that people want and the vehicles that are in demand. Because what you're going to find of course -- and I found this out when shopping for a new minivan over the summer which are in by the way short supply especially if you're trying to buy a new one -- what you find is that the popular models the popular colors and things get sold out quickly. Even if you're a dealer who is hoping to have a lot of variety on your lot if something's popular it's going to sell fast and then people who show up can't see it or buy it anyway. It's a very interesting paradigm. Of course it's very disruptive but it's interesting that so many other auto manufacturers are -- I'm not going to say they're embracing this whole hog -- but they are taking steps in that direction to have people actually order these vehicles and make them to order or at least some of them.

Toby Bordelon: Yeah. Thanks this is so fascinating."

The company delivered the first of 12 production aircraft to Naval Air Systems Command for further delivery to Bahrain on September 30. The company is delivering the helicopters as part of the 2019 foreign military sales (FMS) contract.

According to the company the helicopter will be prepared for shipment to Bahrain with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) before being transported to Bahrain in 2022.

It should be noted that the company completed the helicopter a little over six months after officially starting assembly work in April at its Bell Amarillo production facility.

“This is an extraordinary achievement by the H-1 program and brings the Royal Bahraini Air Force a step closer to fielding the advanced capabilities of the AH-1Z” said Mike Deslatte Bell H-1 vice president and program director. “The men and women of Team Viper a group of premier suppliers have done an exceptional job of delivering to the US government on time and on contract.”

Bell designed the AH-1Z Viper to meet operational requirements of the US Marine Corps which focus on full marinization and a reduced logistical footprint. The aircraft has an integrated glass cockpit and the ability to carry a variety of munitions.

The composite rotor system further enhances the Viper’s ability to provide close air support to ground forces in any environment while the fully integrated Target Sight System (TSS) enhances pilots’ capabilities to identify clearly acquire track and engage targets beyond maximum weapon range.

“The Viper will provide significant benefits to the Bahrain Defence Force as they modernize their fleet of attack helicopters” said Deslatte. “Having a proven state-of-the-art platform will help contribute to the security of Bahrain while improving interoperability with US forces.”

In addition to Bahrain the Czech Republic has also ordered the AH-1Z Viper while the helicopter is in service with the US Marine Corps (USMC). AH-1Z replaced the two-bladed AH-1W Super Cobra while the UH-1Y Venom replaced the UH-1N Huey in USMC service.",,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s no denying that going on vacation has become a lot more complicated due to Covid-19.

Well over a year into the pandemic border restrictions are still constantly changing as new variants emerge while PCR and antigen tests have become part and parcel of traveling.

Many countries require travelers to produce negative Covid test results on entry regardless of vaccination status and in some cases take follow-up tests while some destinations including the US require people to produce a negative test result before their return trip.

But what happens if you test positive after you’ve arrived in a new destination?

This is a predicament that a number of travelers have found themselves in over the past year or so.

Back in August South Carolina couple April DeMuth and Warren Watson (pictured top) were getting ready to return to the US after a two-week trip to Greece when a positive Covid test result stopped them in their tracks.

“We took the test in the morning” explains DeMuth. “So we’re in the airport the agent is pulling us over so that we can check our luggage in and we’re pulling up our test results [on our phones]. That’s when he [Watson] said it.”

Just hours before they were scheduled to board their flight back to the US they discovered that Watson had tested positive for Covid-19.

As Greece allows fully vaccinated travelers to enter without restrictions the couple who are both vaccinated were not required to submit any PCR tests prior to the trip. However they needed to provide negative Covid test results in order to fly home.

Positive on arrival

Shortly after receiving the results DeMuth and Watson got a call from the Greek authorities and arrangements were promptly made for them to be transferred to a quarantine hotel provided by the Greek government.

Although most travel insurance policies cover quarantine-related costs the pair had not taken out insurance for their vacation.

“We were very fortunate that Greece has quarantine hotels that the government pays for” says Watson who had been experiencing some mild Covid symptoms in the days before he received a positive Covid result.

“They delivered three meals a day to us. We were treated very well and it didn’t cost us anything. I know in other countries it’s quite expensive.”

Thankfully Watson’s symptoms continued to be mild while in quarantine (DeMuth never tested positive) and he received a negative result after taking his next PCR test. The couple were able return home seven days later without incurring any extra costs.

“I would never travel without [insurance] now” says DeMuth. “We were just fortunate that we were in a country that was very gracious with what they do but we’d never want to rely on that.”

Things could certainly have been very different if they’d chosen to holiday in another destination. For instance visitors to Italy are required to pay their own quarantine fees up front if they test positive after they arrive.

“Travel insurance with Covid-19 quarantine coverage is designed to help cover the lodging and accommodation expenses you might incur should you test positive for Covid on vacation” Narendra Khatri President and CEO of Insubuy which provides international travel medical insurance from various US-based companies tells CNN Travel.

“The benefit amount depends entirely on the policy you choose. Most plans provide a minimum of $2000 in quarantine lodging and accommodation expenses and trip interruption up to 100% of the trip’s cost.

“Should the traveler choose many policies offer the option to purchase additional coverage up to $7000 to cover quarantine costs and a trip interruption benefit of up to 150% of the trip’s cost.”

While Watson did not require any medical treatment during his time in Greece and made a full recovery others have not been so lucky.

Costly experience

Back in 2020 Gloria and Jose Arellano from California tested positive for Covid-19 after traveling to Mexico for a vacation.

Although Gloria recovered her husband’s condition worsened and he was admitted to a local hospital.

Unfortunately Jose’s health continued to deteriorate and he was flown by air ambulance to the Naval Medical Center in La Jolla where he died from a lung infection on December 28.

The medical and transportation costs incurred during the process were staggering and the family launched a GoFundMe account to help with payments as their insurance did not cover the full amount.

While cases like this are not necessarily typical Khatri advises travelers to consider the costs they’d run up in a worst-case scenario when choosing a travel insurance policy.

“Is $2000 going to cover your lodging expenses for the entire length of quarantine in your destination country?” he asks.

“Is a $50000 policy maximum going to be enough if you need a helicopter ride from an island to the closest emergency room?

“If there’s a chance it won’t you’re better off purchasing a policy that can provide more coverage. It’s far better to spend a little more now on insurance than to be stuck with huge medical or hotel bills in a far-off destination.”

Destinations like the Bahamas and Costa Rica have gone as far as to stipulate that all visitors must have obtained specific coronavirus-related coverage before they are permitted to enter.

Khatri also stresses that travelers should ensure that their insurance provides coverage for their entire trip.

“If you test positive for Covid or have some other medical issue on a Thursday while you’re flying but your coverage doesn’t begin until you land on Friday your insurance isn’t going to cover it” he explains.

“It would be considered a pre-existing condition. Get insurance covering you from the beginning to the end of the trip.”

But while travel insurance can help to ensure that Covid-positive holidaymakers avoid paying extra costs for quarantine or medical treatment most have little choice but to remain where they are until they can produce a negative Covid result.

Medical evacuation

However Covac Global a medical evacuation company that launched in August 2020 provides a special program that allows travelers who’ve tested positive while abroad to be transported home via a certified ambulance with medical personnel – one of the “extremely limited” circumstances in which a traveler infected with Covid is allowed to re-enter the US.

The service which is described as “the first and only fully indemnified membership program” is available to members who’ve received a positive Covid test result after arriving at their destination and display at least one self-reported symptom.

Membership rates start at $675 for 15 days of coverage while an annual membership costs $2500.

Founder Ross Thompson says the company is seeing a significant rise in membership numbers month to month and the average age of its members is becoming younger with more professionals in their 40s choosing to sign up to the program.

Most of Covac Global’s evacuations are from hotel to home and the company has been called to places like Uganda the Bahamas and the Maldives to retrieve travelers.

“We’ve picked up people in speedboats from their over-water villas in the Maldives and from their hotel rooms in islands off the coast of Central America with a helicopter” says Thompson. “So we’ll come to get you wherever you are. If you can get there we can get there. And then we’ll take you home. Very few cases require us to take you to a hospital.”

But transporting a Covid-positive patient is no easy feat particularly if they’re based in a remote location or in a country where there’s civil unrest.

“We did an evacuation not too long ago from Ethiopia” says Thompson. “We had to get the permits in coordination with Ethiopian government.

“There was a significant amount of civil unrest going on in Ethiopia [at the time] so we had to get our security teams involved to make sure that we got everybody into the country safely.”

Testing times

John Gobbels COO of medical evacuation company Medjet says the possibility of testing positive for Covid-19 and requiring hospitalization while in a destination where there are no ICU beds available is one of its members’ biggest concerns along with getting “stuck” in a hospital miles away from their friends and family.

Medjet added air medical transport for travelers hospitalized by Covid-19 to their membership back in October 2020.

“We added that benefit at our own cost risk” explains Gobbels. “Transport for merely testing positive is not a membership benefit but can be arranged at the member’s sole cost.”

But what can travelers do to make sure they are better prepared for the possibility of testing positive for Covid while they’re on vacation?

Gobbels recommends that holidaymakers take at-home Covid test kits by “approved” brands on vacation with them so that they can test themselves early on.

“Don’t wait for the ’72 hour in advance’ window to test yourself” he says. “You’ll need to fulfill that requirement but knowing early that you may fail will give you more time to make fallback plans.

“And because there are sometimes false-positives if you test positive immediately run another test.”

Unfortunately as Covid case infections remain high in various parts of the world the possibility of testing positive while on vacation is a reality that travelers will likely continue to face for a while to come.

“I think this is something that we’re gonna have to live with now” admits Thompson. “Just like after September 11 people added the security evacuation to their travel insurance or their travel memberships because that’s just the world we live in now.

“I think Covid-19 evacuation cover is going to just be commonplace when you travel.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLW5pbmUtbW9udGgtd29ybGQtY3J1aXNlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tbmluZS1tb250aC13b3JsZC1jcnVpc2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean announces nine-month world cruise,"CNN —

It would’ve been unthinkable 12 months ago as the cruise industry reeled from the effects of Covid but one operator is now offering an epic new voyage that will last nine months and take travelers to more than 150 destinations.

Royal Caribbean Cruise Line’s Serenade of the Seas is set to commence sailing in December 2023 from Miami sailing for 274 nights before returning to Florida in September 2024.

In a statement Royal Caribbean International president Michael Bayley said the trip – dubbed “The Ultimate World Cruise” – is designed to help travel-starved cruisers “make up for lost time.”

Voyaging the globe

Serenade of the Seas has been a stalwart of the RCCL fleet since 2003. The 965 feet long ship has 13 decks and can accommodate up to 2476 guests according to Royal Caribbean’s website.

Upon leaving Miami on the world cruise in late 2023 the vessel is set to travel around the Caribbean before scheduled stop offs in Central and South America including trips to the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro and Argentina’s Iguazu Falls.

Also on the globe-spanning itinerary are landmarks including the Great Wall of China the Taj Mahal and the Pyramids of Giza.

Travelers can book the full nine-month experience or schedule a specific chunk of the trip and just join for the Americas and Antarctica for example.

Royal Caribbean told CNN Travel the price range for the full excursion is between $66000 to $112000 per person plus taxes and fees.

World cruises were a staple of the cruise scene pre-pandemic but usually topped out at 150 days or so.

Viking Cruises scheduled a 245-day trip from August 2019 to May 2020 on board Viking Sun but this voyage was cut short when Covid-19 shut down the cruise industry in Spring 2020.



In the wake of the pandemic some round-the-world cruises opted to continue their months-long voyages – just without any passenger stops – due to closed ports and increasing concerns around Covid.

Cruising has since recommenced in many markets with cruise companies keen to prove a vacation at sea is a safe and viable holiday option.

It’s still over two years until the Serenade of the Seas is set to embark on its globe-spanning trip but travelers can reserve their cabins now.",,,,,,,,,

ATLANTA — Eddie Rosario's hot bat led the Atlanta Braves to a World Series matchup with the Houston Astros and earned him the NL Championship Series MVP award.

Less than three months after he was traded by Cleveland the 30-year-old outfielder had six multi-hit games against the Dodgers. He hit .560 with three homers and nine RBIs giving him a 1.040 slugging percentage and 1.647 OPS.

He hit safely in all 10 postseason games batting .474 with 11 RBIs. With 14 hits he tied the record for a postseason series a mark he shares with Albert Pujols Hideki Matsui Kevin Youkilis and Marco Scutaro.

The Braves beat the Dodgers 4-2 on Saturday at Truist Park in Atlanta to win the National League Championship Series in six games.

ATLANTA — With the Atlanta Braves headed to the World Series a lot more eyeballs are going to be on the team - and on Truist Park. And not all those folks are necessarily caught up to speed with the club.

One example? As the Braves clinched their spot in the Fall Classic on Saturday night by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2 (and 4-2 in the best-of-7 series) the giant ""44"" they have in center field became a trending search topic on Google.

If you're not familiar with the team or baseball in general it might seem like a confusing addition to the field: The reason it's there though is to honor the team's greatest legend - one of the greatest legends ever to play the sport for any team.

“They always saw themselves fighting to prove something” Ben Mezrich who spent a year hanging out with the so-called Winklevii for his book “Bitcoin Billionaires” told The Post. “They never viewed themselves as privileged. They have always been underestimated [in tech] because they are jocks.”

But no one should underestimate Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’ ahead-of-the-curve instinct.

The twins were on the ground floor of Facebook’s creation before they allege Mark Zuckerberg used their idea to start a competing social network. Their Gemini Cryptocurrency Exchange founded in 2015 is one of the largest marketplaces for crypto and the Winklevosses are two of the first Bitcoin billionaires. They now stand at the forefront of the NFT movement with their Nifty Gateway clearinghouse for digital art and already have their next ventures lined up.

5 Soleymani paid for a “reproduction” NFT by artist Beeple — and has filed suit. Beeple

Through their company Gemini Capital the 40-year-old brothers are poised to launch a credit card with a twist: Instead of wooing customers with airline miles the card will reward them with fractions of cryptocurrency for each dollar spent. And last month it was announced that Winklevoss Capital had invested in a company looking to end “extinction” by bringing back the woolly mammoth.

But Amir Soleymani doesn’t think of the brothers as champions or underdogs.

“They are bullies” said Soleymani a 45-year-old art dealer in Liverpool England. “They have a habit of being greedy and trying to take everything for themselves.”

In court papers filed as part of an ongoing legal matter with the Winklevosses’ Nifty Gateway he alleges that the company has frozen his digital wallet which contains art purchased for hundreds of thousands of dollars — and now Solemani told The Post worth more than $1 million — and is holding it until he pays $650000 for art he does not want and did not realize he was purchasing at auction.

A spokeswoman for Nifty Gateway said the rules of the auction were straightforward: “Mr. Soleymani’s evolving story about his experience on Nifty Gateway continues to be detached from reality and the experience of other participants on our marketplace. Unlike Mr. Soleymani’s story the structure of our auction was clear to participants and never changed.”

Soleymani disagreed. “The auction was like a trap” he said. “ Once you were in there was no way out.”

It’s not just their jock reputations that have tarnished the Winklevosses in Silicon Valley. Utopian-leaning boosters of crypto and NFT view the brothers with a suspicion that dates back to the Oscar-winning 2010 film “The Social Network” about the founding of Facebook. In it the brothers are portrayed as all-business villains while Zuckerberg is seen as the revolutionary rebel.

Initially according to “Bitcoin Billionaires” the brothers were so despised that start-ups refused to take their money for fear of alienating Facebook. But they found entry into the cryptocurrency world as investment partners with a pothead computer wizard Charlie Shrem. After Shrem was arrested in 2014 and sent to jail for charges that included money laundering the twins founded Gemini Cryptocurrency Exchange specializing in the buying selling and storing of crypto.

“Sometimes [the Winkleviosses] claim that they got into Bitcoin because of the philosophy” said Merav Ozair a financial technology professor at Rutgers Business School. “But I think they got into it because they could make money. The [original] premise of cryptocurrency was ‘for the people by the people’ but greed got in the way and it all became lurid.”

Now some say the NFT market is going the same way. In March a digital-only artwork by Beeple — aka South Carolina graphic designer Mike Winkleman — sold for $69.3 million at Christie’s made him the third most valuable living artist. (This despite critic Ben Davis of Artnet News describing Beeple’s work as “BroBible-level brain farts.”) The twins wanted in on the action: In May Nifty held an auction for Beeple’s “Abundance” which features what looks like a tall naked Golum with wings.

Soleymani’s troubles with the Winklevii began when he finished third in the bidding for “Abundance.”

“The price went to $650000 and I bowed out” said the collector. “Then I got a call from a [Nifty Gateway] staff member named Tommy. He said to me ‘Mate when are you going to pay the $650000?’ I told him that I was not going to pay $650000 because I did not win the auction.” (The top bidder at $1.2 million was Taylor Gerring founder of a cryptocurrency called Ethereum.) “Tommy told me that I needed to read the terms.”

The terms decreed that the first 100 finishers would pay their losing bid for a group of pieces by Beeple including a higher-numbered edition of “Abundance.”

5 Digital collage titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by Beeple. AP

But Soleymani said that the clause was added less than 24 hours prior to the auction. “I feel that they hid this information. I wanted ‘Abundance’ number 1 not number three” he said.

When he refused to pay Nifty locked Solyemani’s access to around 70 NFTs he had purchased through the company.

“Because Nifty Gateway keeps my work in a wallet on its site they have the ability to freeze my account” said Soleymani. “I knew they could freeze my account [for non-payment] but I did not think they could freeze my assets. It was a betrayal.”

A source close to the company told The Post “Since July 23 [Soleymani] has been able to withdraw his assets from the platform.” But Solyemani said his account was still inaccessible as of Friday.

Nifty lawyers filed private arbitration against Soleymani in an effort to get the money that the company believes it is entitled to. Soleymani’s attorney fired back with a claim of particulars asking that the case be tried in England.

“The High Court [there] is public; I want this to be tried publicly rather than in an office behind closed doors” Soleymani said. “If the law [publicly] finds Nifty which is owned by the Winklevoss twins at fault they are done. They will lose the trust of [the NFT] community.”

Even though the brothers are according to Forbes now worth a combined $6 billion “Money is irrelevant [to them]” Mezrich said. “If they think they are in the right they go until the end. Honor and right-and-wrong are what make them tick.”

Tyler and Cameron are what’s known as “mirror twins.” Mezrich described it in Boston magazine as such: “If one mirror twin has a birthmark on his right shoulder the other has one on his left. When one of the twins is a lefty the other favors the right hand. Where Tyler Winklevoss is more left-brained and analytical Cameron is more empathetic and goofier. Interviewing them together is like interviewing a single source because they not only complete each other’s sentences they also actively think together.”

The twins grew up in the privileged and well-manicured environs of Greenwich Conn. Their father a college professor devised a software that became widely used in the pension industry and the brothers attended Harvard and Oxford.

After accusing fellow Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea for the creation of what eventually became Facebook the twins landed a $65 million settlement from the company in 2008. They took the money in stock and cash a move that was seen as a gamble at the time.

“The success of Facebook was not a lock at that point” said Mezrich. “It wound up being worth half-a-billion-dollars [after Facebook went public in 2012].”

Time has not healed wounds though. “They harbor ill will toward Mark [Zuckerberg]” Mezrich said. “And Mark does not like seeing them as billionaires.”

The author added that the competition goes beyond money. “[The brothers] feel that they are better off now than they would have been if they had stuck with Facebook” Mezrich said. “It’s incredible how everything has turned on its head. Facebook is now the establishment Mark is on top of it and looked at as the villain.”

The Winklevii definitely seem to be having more fun than the beleaguered Zuckerberg who’s plagued with issues of censorship government investigations and allegations of intentionally addicting children to Instagram which Facebook owns.

The twin’s punk-and-emo cover band Mars Junction rocked the Knitting Factory this past summer. They’ve been seen partying in the Hamptons with Christie Brinkley and have dated models Natalia Beber (Cameron) Amanda Salvato (Cameron) and Marina Theiss (Tyler). “They ski in the mountains they vacation in St. Barts they have been to the Met Ball with supermodels” Mezrich said. “They are a great second-act story and in America we love second acts. They’re winning now.”

But Soleymani thinks they’re acting like losers. “I really don’t care about those guys” he said. “I want to expose wrongdoing on the platform. The Winklevosses? Who are they?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the time of COVID-19 people are looking for ways to make their shopping trip as efficient as possible or even avoid perusing the shelves in-person altogether and opting for delivery instead. Luckily browsing new arrivals is easier than ever—and Kroger just dropped new frozen items on its website.

Under their ""New Arrivals"" section is an array of products that might help get you closer to finding everything you need all in one place to avoid that second grocery run. Some of these products will be available at your local store but since there are 2700+ Kroger stores in 35 states some items may not be at the one in your neighborhood yet. In any case here are six brands debuting 13 new items to stock your freezer with in October 2021.

Beyond Meat

Kroger is bringing more options for vegan and vegetarian shoppers with these two Beyond Meat products. Sizzle up a couple juicy protein-packed sausages with breakfast or toss some Italian-seasoned ""meatballs"" in a warm marinara-coated pasta.

Beyond Meat Beyond Breakfast Classic Plant-Based Sausage Links comes with 8 links per pack for $4.99 and Beyond Meat Italian Style Plant Based Meatballs includes 12 per pack for $4.99.

These pea-protein substitutes are made with all-natural non-GMO ingredients so that you can enjoy a convenient meal even if you're giving up meat or trying to cut saturated fat and sodium content from your diet. Both items are soy-free and gluten-free in case you were worried about those too.

Morning Star

These two MorningStar Farms additions to the freezer aisle can also help if you're quitting meat but still craving the taste of your favorite beef-flavored go-to's.

If you prefer your vegetarian-friendly sausage in patty-form look no further than the MorningStar Farms Veggie Breakfast Plant-Protein Hot and Spicy Meatless Sausage Patties with 8-ounces of meatless protein for $4.29.

Dreaming of a burger? The MorningStar Farms 16g Protein Grillers Prime Veggie Burgers could hit the spot. As you're taking in the last days of warm grilling weather or preparing game-day food for football season the charred flavor on these veggie burgers will leave you as satisfied as the real thing. The four-burger package runs for $4.29.

However both of these items do contain wheat. So if you're avoiding gluten opt for a different choice.

Totino's

Who doesn't love a convenient way to eat pizza? Kroger is adding Totino's Frozen Triple Cheese Party Pizza Pack to their aisles giving you a treat to bring to your socially-distanced get-togethers. One box holds 4 pizzas and can be prepared in a toaster oven in just 15 minutes.

With a listed serving size of only half a pizza this grocery cart add-on is something you can use in a pinch but we wouldn't recommend stocking up on this one every week.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Red Baron

Three new thick-crust Red Baron frozen pizzas arrived to suit any kind of pizza lover – Five Cheese Pepperoni and Supreme (stacked with pepperoni sausage peppers and onions). It's not suited for an everyday indulgence but at $7.49 for a 6-slice pie this might be handy to store in the back of your freezer for a rainy day to share.

Tyson

Kroger is bringing a handful of Tyson fully cooked options for when you don't want to think about food prep or venture out into the cold for fresh groceries. There are 4 varieties: Tyson Fully Cooked Chicken Nuggets Tyson Fully Cooked & Breaded Chicken Patties Family Pack Tyson Fully Cooked Crispy Chicken Strips and Tyson Fully Cooked and Breaded Southern Style Chicken Breast Tenderloins.

The chicken meat is free of antibiotics and contains no added hormones or steroids. While it can't help you with a well-balanced diet it does make a great occasional snack for $9.99.

Raised & Rooted

Even meatless customers love a good nugget and this one carries some heat. The Raised & Rooted Spicy Plant-Based Nuggets offer less saturated fat than traditional snack-sized chicken. This item is 8-ounces for $4.99 and chock-full of protein made up of vegan-friendly alternatives.

Though this option eliminates meat it carries 580 milligrams (25% daily value) of sodium in a single serving so just be careful if you're monitoring your salt intake.

Tipped workers most of them restaurant workers have experienced increased wage theft this year compared to last according to a recent report by nonprofit restaurant advocacy group One Fair Wage. In a Facebook Live event last month the group’s President Saru Jayaraman said: “We are seeing a real uptick in violations of workers’ rights in this industry.”

Wage theft—when employers fail to pay workers what they’ve earned—has a disproportionate impact on the tens of millions of minimum wage and subminimum wage workers. That’s in part because the Department of Labor the agency responsible for investigating those violations is under-resourced. The report notes that in 2015 even though the workforce had undergone massive growth the number of investigators in the DOL’s Wage and Hour Division has remained nearly the same as it was 70 years ago. As a result people of color women and immigrants who make up a large share of low-wage workers have missed out on earnings.

More than a third of workers reported that their tips and additional wages fail to bring them up to the state’s minimum wage.

This is especially problematic for tipped workers. By law restaurants in 43 states can pay workers a lower hourly minimum wage down to $2.13 an hour as long as the worker’s tips get their earnings up to the state’s minimum wage. If tips are inadequate employers are supposed to make up the difference. But in a September survey of 238 tipped workers more than a third of workers reported that their tips and additional wages fail to bring them up to the state’s minimum wage. And while almost half of tipped workers reported not being fairly compensated for overtime women were 10 percent more likely to report not being paid time and a half.

Even when employers that underpaid workers pay back stolen wages they’re often only required to pay back a portion of them. Jessica Looman acting administrator of the DOL’s Wage and Hour Division said that the department is “committed to getting back wages into the pockets of those workers whose rights were violated.”

Last month California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill that could hit employers with felony charges for intentionally committing wage theft. And in recent years district and state attorneys general in California New York and elsewhere have created teams to address wage theft and other employer-committed crimes against workers. In February San Diego DA Summer Stephan announced the Workplace Justice Unit that will have a prosecutor investigator and paralegal who will respond to tips on their hotline and inspect workplaces for wage and hour violations.

“Wage theft and labor trafficking are serious problems that we are working on in partnership with the community” Stephan said. “We’re not going to allow workers to be exploited by heartless greedy employers who break the law to line their own pockets.”

Stolen wages are just one challenge. Restaurant workers have also been tasked with enforcing COVID-19 protocols sometimes putting their own safety at risk. In New York City for example a hostess at an Italian restaurant was allegedly punched on Sept. 16 after asking patrons to show proof of vaccination. More than half of workers surveyed by One Fair Wage reported hostility or harassment for sticking to pandemic safety measures.

Under these working conditions nearly 8 in 10 workers say they will only stay in the industry if they receive a livable wage with tips on top. Some restaurant owners are paying attention. Michael Shemtov owner of Butcher and the Bee serving new American cuisine in Tennessee and South Carolina told One Fair Wage that raising wages will improve the restaurant industry.

“Raising the minimum wage and eliminating the sub-minimum wage for tipped employees will help level the field for all restaurants improve the lives of our team members and strengthen local economies” Shemtov said. “Taking these actions independently can be challenging but doing it collectively will help us make our industry better and ultimately stronger.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW5zY3JpYmVybWFnLmNvbS9sZWFubmEtc2hhZGxvdy1xLWFuZC1hLXdpdGgtZGVtb24tYmlraW5pLWNlby1hbmQtc3dpbXdlYXItZGVzaWduZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leanna Shadlow: Q and A With Demon Bikini CEO and Swimwear Designer,"PHOTO: Robert D.

BENTONVILLE AR – Tucked deep in the northwest section of Arkansas Bentonville is quietly becoming one of the best places to live. Thanks to being the home and world headquarters of Fortune 500 companies such as Walmart Tyson Foods as well as the world-famous Bentonville Film Festival this quaint and charming Southern town is quickly emerging into the next Austin.

Much like their longtime rivals from Texas the University of Arkansas is only thirty-plus minutes away and with a growing hip and young Millennial demographic and corporate Walmart money coming into the area Bentonville—along with neighboring Rogers home of the first Walmart which was recently voted by Time as one of the “Best Places To Live”

Thanks to her colorful and attention-getting bikini and swimwear designs CEO and swimwear designer Leanna Shadlow is hoping to add Demon Bikini to that growing list.

A West Coast transplant Shadlow has brought some SoCal-style glitz and style to her Northwest Arkansas home thanks to her traffic-stopping beauty. A statuesque blonde bombshell at 5’8 Shadlow is 50% Barbie 50% alpha female and 100 percent badass.

It isn’t often that someone with cover model-worthy looks is so modest and refreshingly humble and inwardly shy as Shadlow is and in today’s me-me-me world of Instagram and TikTok it is a much-welcome personality trait.

A former auto body collision repair specialist Shadlow can drive and detail a sports car with the best of them and look straight out of MAXIM while doing it. A proud supporter of making women feel sexy in their own skin and not being afraid to show it Shadlow’s Demon Bikini line is all about positivity and empowering women to be beautiful.

Thanks to Demon Bikini being featured in lifestyle publications such as Maxim Mexico as well as collaborating with this magazine both Shadlow and Demon Bikini are well on their way in helping everyone realize that life is truly better in one of their handmade in the USA bikinis.

Below is my Q and A with Leanna as we talk Demon Bikini shooting in Northwest Arkansas future goals of DB and her love of working on her beloved GMC pickup truck.

Greetings from Cleveland! It was a blast connecting and working together what did you enjoy the most about your photoshoot with INSCMagazine?

Shooting with INSCMagazine was a blast! Everyone was professional the models were well taken care of and everyone was put at ease leading up to and through all of the shoots. It was a great experience.

With the explosion and growth of lifestyle and high-end resortwear what do you feel makes Demon Bikini different and unique from other brands?

Demon Bikini started out of a vision to make every woman feel comfortable in their own skin. I love getting feedback from customers when they tell me how amazing they feel in one of our bikinis. All of our bikinis are handmade in the USA. We have unique styles that stand out from everyone else.

We pride ourselves on having a real authentic experience for our customers. There is always a real person to talk to about ordering a custom bikini and which style fits what you are looking for best.

For those not familiar with you tell us a little about yourself background etc?

I have always loved to help women feel amazing in their own skin and I have always loved bikinis and having something unique that helps me stand out and not just fit in.

With everything that happened last year during Covid and the lockdowns I wanted to take the opportunity to create a company that would help women stand out and be comfortable in their own skin while being focused on high quality customer service and giving back to amazing women.

As a single mom women empowerment is a big motivation for me.

During our time together you described yourself as a gearhead with a major affinity for sports cars. What is your favorite to drive work on and detail?

It’s hard to pick just one favorite! I love to drive all kinds of exotic sports cars. I love to work on my 1953 GMC rat rod truck.

What inspired you to create Demon Bikini?

Demon Bikini was born out of a desire to follow a dream of mine and start a bikini line. I’ve always loved bikinis and loved finding unique bikinis that were different from everyone else. As a single mom I dreamt of being able to provide a better lifestyle and future for my son and I.

I wanted to create a way that other women could feel beautiful and confident wearing bikinis also. After battling demons as a single mom and over the years Demon Bikini was born amidst the pandemic.

In your own words tell us who is the target consumer of your line?

Demon Bikini’s target customer is any woman who is looking to feel beautiful and comfortable in a custom bikini that they can feel excited to show off.

What designs are you most proud of?

I love all of my designs! Some of my favorites are the signature line bikinis! I had such a blast designing these! I have a few new things in the works as well that I’m so excited about! We just launched two new collections this past summer the Shimmer and Mermaid collections. It was so fun picking the fabric and designing these custom sets!

You’re from Cali but currently live in Northwest Arkansas do you see yourself eventually expanding and setting up shop in a major market—such as L.A. or Miami?

I would love to expand into bigger cities if and when the opportunity arises! I would consider going into a bigger market. My main goal even with expansion is to keep the same high-quality bikinis that are made in the USA.

You are simply stunning and gorgeous have you considered expanding into modeling in addition to designing?

Thank you for the compliment! I would love to get into modeling on a bigger scale if the opportunity was to arise with that!

Where do you see yourself Demon Bikini in the next year five years etc?

In the next year I plan to expand our line to include some new styles! I am also working on adding board shorts men’s styles and some kid’s styles in the next few years! I want to do it all! I have loved being a part of charity events and giving back to the community and I plan to continue doing that as well!

By the time we are at 5 years in business I’d love to have a warehouse and have grown into a thriving business that is providing jobs and giving back to the community even more than I am now.

Special thanks to Leanna Shadlow all of the wonderful Demon Bikini models and ambassadors and all else involved in during our wonderful photo shoot in Bentonville Beaver Lake Devil’s Den and Crystal Lake! All photos by INSC Media & Photography. All copyrights reserved by INSC Media Group LLC.

The ones who turned up at U.S. Bank Stadium for the Rolling Stones concert on Sunday night however shrugged off all those lingering concerns with the same mantra that has followed the legendary British band for 47 of its nearly 60-year career.

It's only rock 'n' roll and boy do they still like it — maybe more than ever in fact.

The turmoil and loss that preceded the long-awaited Stones concert probably kept some fans away. It was a rare case of the band not selling out the venue. But the 45000 who did show up did so with smiles blazing and tongue-logos wagging.

""I'm a little nervous being here but no way I was going to miss the Stones"" said a masked-up PJ Kintop of Minneapolis who first saw Mick Jagger & Co. in 1972 at the Met Center.

""Tonight will be a very emotional and powerful full-circle moment"" Minneapolis rock vet Robert Wilkinson of Flamin' Oh's fame said. ""These are my boys. They epitomize what a rock 'n' roll band should be.""

As the Texan opening band Black Pumas started up the crowd at 7:30 p.m. — earning quite a rave reception by set's end — fans were still making their way through the crowded stadium concourse to stock up on beer and scoop up the $50 T-shirts. Among the shirts was a special Minneapolis edition featuring the city skyline and the Chain of Lakes reshaped like the band's iconic tongue logo.

No proof of vaccination or other COVID-related requirements were implemented at the concert which made some fans nervous but others relieved.

""It was nice knowing the shots weren't required or we wouldn't be here"" said Sherry Vennes an unvaccinated fan from Maple Lake. ""Let everyone decide for themselves.""

The Stones' 8:45 p.m. set time was preceded by a video tribute to Watts their founding drummer who died of natural causes at age 80 in August. Even before his death it had already been announced he would not be performing on the tour and Steve Jordan — a longtime sideman to Stones guitarist Keith Richards and other legends — would be taking his place.

""It's sad because Charlie felt like an old friend"" said Parrel Caplan of Minneapolis who was one of the less than 300 mostly teenage fans to catch the Stones' first Minnesota show at Excelsior's Danceland Ballroom in 1964.

""They all feel like old friends though so I still want to see the other ones.""

Kent Mortimer a veteran Twin Cities drummer explained his mixed emotions this way: ""Steve Jordan is probably the only drummer besides Charlie Watts who could be in the Stones.""

Sunday's concert was the 12th time Jagger Richards and crew have come to Minnesota on tour going back to that tepidly received low-attended 1964 debut. Yes kids even the Stones had to work to get bigger and better.

The band's most recent stop at then-TCF Bank Stadium in 2015 was actually among its all-time best-received Twin Cities show. U.S. Bank Stadium's notoriously bouncy and muddy high-ceilinged acoustics were cited by many Stones fans for their aversion to attending Sunday — though bad sound is hardly a new thing when it comes to Stones' dates in Minneapolis.

""My concern with the sound quality is a result of my ongoing trauma of seeing them inside the Metrodome"" said Mike Wiley of Minneapolis who didn't attend the concert. He was referencing the group's three tour stops at the similarly muddled Dome from 1989 to 1997.

Attending his 10th Stones show Jim Nethercut of White Bear Lake looked at 2015's concert as a peak performance — and thus he went into Sunday's gig with contentedly lowered expectations.

""I thought [2015] would be their last show here"" Nethercut said ""so I'm looking at this one as frosting on the cake.""

With the three remaining core Stones members (also including guitarist Ronnie Wood) just behind Watts in age many fans wondered if this one really could be the band's last time in Minnesota.

Jeff Gilbertson of Barnum Minn. brought his teenage daughter and son to the show at their request after he saw the band three times before without them.

""I think they recognize this as their one shot to see the Stones and they now will remember it for the rest of their lives"" said Gilbertson. ""Seeing it through their eyes [is] pretty awesome.""

The Stones took the stage to the hard-charging riff of ""Street Fighting Man"" and followed with the appropriately inviting ""Let's Spend the Night Together."" Then Jagger directly greeted the crowd.

""Hello Twin Cities! Hi there you Sotans!"" the ever-spry frontman yelled his coolness still palpable enough to forgive the fact no one ever calls us that.

Jagger also detailed a surprisingly cool itinerary from his extra days in town leading up to the show.

""I had two Jucy Lucys here: One at Matt's Bar and one at the 5-8 Club washed down with a Grain Belt Fulton and a Surly finished off at Grumpy's Bar.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEwLTI1L2JpZy1iYW5rcy1oYXZlbi10LXF1aXQtZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWwtd2l0aC00LXRyaWxsaW9uLXNpbmNlLXBhcmlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Banks Haven't Quit Fossil Fuel With $4 Trillion Since Paris,"Why did this happen?

Georgia Hazeldene 26 was looking to make her way home with a friend in the early hours of Saturday morning after enjoying some drinks at a Wollongong bar when her night took an “unsettling” turn.

'Do you want a lift?'

Just as the two women were about to order an Uber a man in a silver car pulled up beside them and leaned out the window.

“He said 'I’m your driver do you want a lift?'” Georgia told Yahoo News.

“Thinking about it now the whole sentence did not make sense.”

They swiftly brushed him off as a “sleazy man” and kept walking before making a formal booking through the ride-share app.

“We didn’t even take a second to think about how this night could have gone” Georgia admitted.

Man takes girl back to his own house

But a few hours later the terrifying reality of what could have happened was laid bare when she received a message from a distraught friend.

Georgia told Yahoo News two other women had mistakenly gotten into the car with seemingly the same man who had approached earlier that night.

“He rocked up told them he was their Uber driver they were drunk and got in” she explained.

It all seemed normal at first with the man dropping off one of the women at the given address.

But once Georgia’s friend was alone in the car with the man she quickly realised something was off.

“She was saying he was taking a long way to her house detouring around where she lived” Georgia said.

The woman suddenly noticed he didn’t have a GPS or anything to suggest he worked for Uber in his car.

He allegedly pulled up outside his own house and asked if she wanted to “go inside and f***” and “do some fun things”.

“That’s when she realised she was in trouble… She was like okay this is wrong I feel like I’m in danger.”

Georgia said her friend pleaded to be taken home and gave him all the money in her wallet.

He agreed taking her somewhere close to where she lives and she immediately bolted out of the car.

“She feels uneasy because he knows where she lives she couldn’t even sleep.

“It’s been really tough I still feel so sick it’s really unsettling.”

Georgia’s friend later revealed she mistakenly accepted a ride from the same man just hours later and found herself in a dangerous situation. Source: Getty Images

Georgia said it didn’t click that it was the same man she had come across until her friend began describing how he looked.

“My face just dropped” she said.

Both women recall the man as having dark skin and hair with a bit of stubble being of Indian or Asian appearance and driving a silver Toyota Corolla.

“I wish I had gotten a bit more detail” Georgia added.

More women 'stalked' by driver

After sharing her experience on social media Georgia was contacted by a number of other women who were also allegedly stalked by a man pretending to be an Uber driver.

“It’s disgusting after months of being locked inside we can finally go out and see our friends enjoying life being young and someone like this is out there” she said.

A number of other women have since come forward sharing similar chilling encounters with a fake Uber driver. Source: Getty Images

While her friend and some of the other women are too shaken to speak out Georgia hopes to be their advocate and voice.

“The main thing is I want young women to know they are not alone. We need to be there for each other.”

Police investigate fake Uber driver

NSW Police confirmed to Yahoo News that Wollongong officers are investigating a report of a fake Uber driver on Saturday morning.

“It has been alleged that the man approached a woman about 2.40am on Saturday in the vicinity of a licensed premises claiming that the phone app was off-line” the statement read.

“It is further alleged that the man has then performed an indecent act upon the female who entered the vehicle.”

Police are urging members of the public to ensure they check the details of the vehicle which has been booked against the phone app.

Riders urged to report dodgy drivers

In a statement to Yahoo News Uber said riders are encouraged to make a report if the driver doesn't match the photo or number plate displayed on the phone app so action can be taken.

“At Uber we continue to build cutting-edge technology and features to help improve safety and users can access these in the Safety Toolkit in the app. These advances in safety are important — but for them to be effective riders need to be in the right car. We provide driver photos and number plates in the app so riders can confirm it’s the right person picking them up before getting in"" the statement read.

Whether it’s a quick ride somewhere or a food delivery from your favorite restaurant it’s more than likely that you have used one of Uber’s services. To define it however Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network leading technology operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B as the company states. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks).

In my view while the company has certainly contributed to mobility innovation and while its brand recognition could power its growth over the long term the stock is highly un-investable based on Uber’s current cash burn rate and valuation multiple. As the stock is highly unpredictable though I am neutral on the stock.

Setting Cash on Fire

In my opinion Uber has a tremendous cash problem. The company loses billions of dollars every quarter with few to no indications of a turnaround story. In Uber’s latest quarterly report the company showed that it had managed to deliver its first substantial profit of around $1.12 billion. But don’t get your hopes up: net income benefited from unrealized gains of $1.4 billion and $471 million due to the revaluation of Uber’s equity investments in Didi and Aurora respectively.

In other words the company once again essentially lost money with adjusted EBITDA coming in at a negative $509 million.

Source: SEC filings Author

Uber is now left with around $5 billion in cash. For a different profitable business with Uber’s $90 billion market cap this would be a proper liquidity position. However for Uber this pile of cash could hardly keep the company running for long. By normalizing Uber’s artificial net income of last quarter Uber has lost more than $2.5 billion of cash over the past four quarters. Hence the company’s current position is barely adequate to sustain two more years of operations at the current burn rate. It’s clearly not sustainable.

For this reason Uber will have to continually raise additional funds either through debt or equity. The company’s long-term debt position does not look that healthy already currently standing at around $7.8 billion.

Due to Uber’s profitability worries creditors have not been very carefree with Uber. To demonstrate Effective Interest rate for Uber’s 2023 senior note stands at 7.7% while its 2026 and 2027 senior notes have Effective Interest rates of 8.1% and 7.7% respectively. One of the most recent capital increases included Uber pricing a $900 million senior notes offering of 7.5% senior unsecured notes due 2025. Uber’s balance thus becomes more indebted which in turn further delays profitability due to higher interest expenses.

The Valuation is Absurd

At the stock’s current price of around $45 Uber’s valuation is ludicrous. Analysts expect the company to report EPS of $0.27 in 2023. In other words Uber is currently trading at 172 times a very speculative potential net income that may be the case two years away from now. This is a crazy multiple for a company that has shown no real strategy towards profitability and with dilution over the next few years set to certainly deteriorate shareholder value. In my view Uber is massively overvalued for this reason.

Wall Street’s Take

Turning to Wall Street Uber Technologies has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys 2 Holds and 0 Sells assigned in the past three months. At $68.08 the average Uber Technologies price target implies 49.6% upside potential with Wall St. having quite a different opinion than mine on the stock.

Saturday PUNCH had reported that the security agents brutalised protesters and journalists after firing teargas canisters to disperse people demonstrating during the memorial car procession on Wednesday.

Clement was said to be conveying a passenger from Ajah to a destination in Ikeja when he drove into the security agents dispersing the protesters.

The 34-year-old and his passengers were said to have jumped down from the vehicle abandoned it and scampered for safety.

Upon his return Clement’s said his car was nowhere to be found adding that the security agents brutalised him while searching for his vehicle.

The tense moment of assault was captured in a video clip that trended online.

Security agents particularly the police and officers of the LSNA were seen in the video clip slapping and pepper-spraying Clement’s eye.

Nigerians including celebrities condemned the assault meted on the UBER driver and other brutalised victims.

Oyelade had said that the errant officers were summoned for orderly room trial.

In a follow-up reaction the GM while condemning the actions of the officers said they had been suspended for unruly behaviour and acts of misconduct.

Oyekan who disclosed this in a statement on Friday said the behaviour of the two officers was inappropriate and unbecoming for any member of the corps.

He added “The two officers and their supervisor have faced a disciplinary committee for assaulting a member of the public noting that their unsanctioned conduct is capable of breaching public peace contrary to the Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Corps handbook particularly sections (ii) (iii) (iv) and (x) which covers the conduct with the general public.

“The committee found the two officers guilty of the charge of misconduct and they were immediately suspended from the agency while further investigations are ongoing to determine other appropriate disciplinary action against them in order to serve as a deterrent to others.”

Why Trust Us?

Halle Berry shared the at-home facial kit she uses for soft and glowing skin.

It's the and it's already sold out at other retailers like and .

Customers say they’ve seen major transformations in their skin after just one use.

Even celebrities find time to practice a little self-care at home. (Celebrities they're just like us!) And Halle Berry is no exception. While you may be used to seeing her glammed up on the red carpet or working up a sweat while hitting the gym Berry always finds time to prioritize her skin.

Last month the actress posted a photo to Instagram while doing an at-home facial. The selfie shows the star in her bathroom mirror with her hair clipped back revealing the applied to her face. The caption read: “bare but never the minimum.”

Instagram page reposted the star’s photo and shared that Berry had “been using the Red Carpet Facial to keep her skin looking young and fresh for over a decade.”

Berry was first introduced to the red carpet facial when she began seeing celebrity aesthetician Olga Lorencin at the Kinara Spa in Los Angeles. During one of her appointments Berry mentioned wanting an on-the-go version of Lorencin's signature treatment and boom! The red carpet facial in a box was created as reported by Allure.

Other celebs are as infatuated with the product as Berry. Viola Davis expressed how much she loved the red carpet facial kit and posted a picture on Twitter calling it “the best facial kit ever!!!.”

What makes this celeb-loved kit so special? Well beyond working to give the skin an all-over radiant glow the kit contains three products: the red carpet facial peel facial neutralizer and a facial polishing mask. And it comes with an applicator brush and treatment bowl so you're sure to have everything you need.

The trio of products is formulated with a nourishing combination of exfoliants and botanical extracts. You’ll also find powerful ingredients like lactic and malic acids in the formula which are alpha hydroxy acids commonly used to shed the surface of the skin.

“Lactic acid works by gently exfoliating the outer layer of your skin said S. Tyler Hollmig M.D. director of dermatologic surgery at UT Dell Medical School and Ascension Seton in Austin in a previous interview for Prevention.com. “Sloughing off the dull dead cells makes way for a brighter smoother complexion underneath.”

Research also shows that lactic acid can help firm the skin while reducing the appearance of fine lines wrinkles and dark spots. “Normal healthy skin cells in the outer layer of the skin shed every two to three weeks. This may slow down due to aging dehydration and other environmental stressors which can appear as rough scaly and dull-appearing skin” said Dr. Hollmig.

The acid works by loosening up the bonds between dead skin cells which helps to boost cell turnover revealing a more refreshed complexion.

QVC reviewers also can’t stop raving about this kit giving it a 4.2-star rating.

“I originally purchased the travel size version of this product to ensure all the positive reviews were just that” wrote one customer. “I was extremely happy with the results and decided to splurge on the full size here at QVC. I have oily skin large pores and breakouts...BUT my skin has never looked better!

What is the most popular perfume in the world?

Depending on how you measure it (that could be sales figures reviews or how many people wear it) there are a few different answers to this question. However Chanel No.5 is widely regarded to be the most popular perfume in the world.

First created in 1921 it's one of the oldest perfumes that you can still buy today. But the popularity of the iconic fragrance exploded after 1952 when Marilyn Monroe famously declared that she wore nothing but ""five drops of Chanel No.5"" to bed - the power of celebrity influencers!

It's widely reported that a bottle of Chanel No.5 is sold every 30 seconds and in 2017 The Perfume Shop revealed that the scent has been its bestselling fragrance for 25 years - as per MailOnline.

Chanel No. 5 Eau De Parfum - £99 | John Lewis Arguably the most iconic scent in the world you can bag yourself a bottle of Chanel No. 5 for under £100 from John Lewis. A timeless powdery floral this perfume has notes of May rose and jasmine blended with citrus.

What is the difference between eau de parfum and eau de toilette?

Perfume and eau de toilette contain different concentrations of perfume oil. There tends to be 5% - 15% perfume oil in eau de toilette while eau de parfum (perfume) has a higher concentration at 15% - 18%.

The more oil a fragrance contains the more potent its aroma will be and the longer it will last on your skin. So while scents with a higher concentration are often more expensive you're often getting more for your money.

With that said most eau de toilettes still linger for several hours after applying and are a great option in you're just popping out for a short time rather than looking for a fragrance that will last all day.

But if it's longevity you're after you'll want to opt for a parfum - the creme de la creme of fragrances with a perfume oil concentration of up to 30% and a staying power of up to eight hours.

The platform that was originally intended for sharing short viral clips has grown in all different directions many of which could have never been predicted. If you’re reading this article chances are you’ve stumbled across beauty TikTok a never-ending haven of beauty tips tricks hacks and recommendations from professionals and enthusiasts alike. Among this sector of the app is what’s often referred to as “PerfumeTok” a community of fragrance lovers sharing their best finds and tried-and-true favorites.

Like a lot of viral products TikTok-famous perfumes have seen massive spikes in popularity. As someone who typically sticks to one or two signature scents I never really considered branching out when it comes to fragrances but apparently the TikTok algorithm knows me better than I know myself. After seeing so many PerfumeTok videos on my feed I eventually caved and started following some fragrance accounts only to be completely sucked in by the complex and subjective world of perfume.

One of my favorite creators @professorperfume has amassed over 236000 followers with her informative perfume content and thoughtful product reviews (she also keeps things interesting by mixing in videos about books and makeup among other things). @Rougereview on the other hand never shows their face at all and instead begins each video with aesthetically pleasing clips indicating a specific scent profile along with the text “so you want to smell like this...” before diving into the recommendations.

The beauty of PerfumeTok is that it brings fragrance lovers from all over the world to one place to bond over a space in beauty that can often be exclusive. These creators share recommendations that range from expensive ($340) to super affordable ($20) — this way everyone can partake in the fun. Ahead take a look through the assortment of perfumes that these sorts of accounts have swayed me (and countless others no doubt) to purchase and many more which are still sitting in my shopping cart — but not for long.

One robber was seen letting his pal into the Italian designer store scaring a terrified shop assistant in the process before they began clearing its shelves of luxury leather goods which retail for up to $6200.

The thieves had left the scene with luxury merchandise that cost tens of thousands of dollars exactly 21 days after a prior robbery saw 35 bags lifted on September 20.

The increase in shoplifting crimes came after State's Attorney Kim Foxx stopped prosecuting thieves who stole less than $1000.

Video footage captured the moment a female Bottega Veneta employee was pushed to the side by two hooded suspects

The suspects were captured stealing armfuls of handbags as the frightened female employee looked on

Both suspects were seen leaving the store with tens of thousands of dollars worth of purses in hand

The recent October 11 video began with a female employee walking around a section of the store on her phone as the red hooded male suspect entered the scene behind her.

The red hooded suspect then walked around the corner to what appeared to be the back door of the store.

The employee is then seen suspiciously walking around the same corner.

The male suspect then abruptly pushes the employee out of the way as another rushes into the store sporting a black hoodie.

The distraught female employee follows the black hooded suspect as the other thief begins to collect at least six purses off the display cases.

The footage cuts back to the black hooded suspect stealing the purses in another section of the store as the frightened employee looks on.

Both suspects are seen abruptly leaving the scene with an armful of purses in hand.

Police have not identified the suspects in the video but are looking further into the incident.

The Bottega Veneta store near the Magnificent Mile was previously raided by 12 men on September 20 who stole 35 handbags

The previous theft at the location occurred on September 20 as 12 men had raided the store stealing 35 handbags.

The rise in shoplifting crimes have been plaguing the Windy City over the course of the past couple of months as other luxury stores have also shared similar incidents.

Earlier this month a group of seven to eight shoplifters were seen leaving a Bloomingdale's in suburban Chicago with an armful of expensive purses.

A Louis Vuitton store was also raided by purse snatching shoplifters in Northbrook Court in the North Shore of Chicago.

Chicago is the latest city to be hit by rampant shoplifting and its Magnificent Mile the once highly-populated retail destination is now dotted with empty storefronts as businesses are being driven away by the brazen thieves.

The city's crime spiral is set to intensify as more than a third of Chicago's 13000 cops refused to report their COVID vaccine status by a deadline set for last week now putting them on track for dismissal.

Chicago's largest union has asked its members to flood the city with exemptions and is effectively daring Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fire them after continued outrage over appalling crime figures.

Shoplifter were emboldened following a December 2016 motion from State's Attorney Kim Foxx that mandated Chicago prosecutors only issue felony charges for theft of property over $1000.

Her officer said at the time that the move was meant to shift focus to the driving factors of the crimes instead of low-level offenses. In turn however thieves know they can grab armfuls of merchandise without being stopped by store security.

Chicago's most recent shoplifting spree involved a group of men who robbed three 7-Eleven convenience stores downtown in a span of 30 minutes on Monday morning.

The city has been plagued by a string of robberies and a wave of crime in the past few months as some say that the city's 'soft-on-crime' policies embolden the thieves

State's Attorney Kim Foxx mandates that Chicago prosecutors only issue felony charges for theft of property over $1000

Four armed men robbed a 7-Eleven on East Lake Street at 8.29am in which they took an undetermined amount of cash before fleeing in a black vehicle police said. Five minutes later police believe the same group wearing masks and hooded sweatshirts robbed another 7-Eleven and just before 9am they made a final stop at a third 7-Eleven and robbed it at gunpoint.

No arrests have been made as of Wednesday afternoon.

'It's a serious problem and we have to address it' Alderman Brian Hopkins told CBS Chicago explaining that the issue affects commercial real estate as well as public safety.

'The commercial brokers tell us that when they get potential interest from a tenant that's one of the first questions they ask is what's happening in Chicago to stem the tide of retail shoplifting rings that have been operating with impunity downtown? And we don't have a good answer right now for that.'

Hopkins added 'I think we have to look at prosecution. Clearly there's a feeling running through the criminal elements that there are no consequences here. We have to look to the courts and I think we have to just look to all the players in this drama to get Chicago to what it once was.'

The city's approach to prosecuting retail crime is similar to one in San Francisco where prosecutors only issue felony charges for thefts of property worth over $950. Walgreens cited the shoplifting issue as the reason it closed 17 stores and is planning to close another five throughout the city the pharmacy chain announced last week.

Stores throughout Chicago's Magnificent Mile are closing in the wake of the rampant shoplifting and since last spring the area lost a Macy's Disney Store and Japanese retailer Uniqlo

The vacancy rate for the Magnificent Mile has skyrocketed from 11 percent in 2019 to 19 percent this year according to ABC 7

Stores throughout Chicago's Magnificent Mile are doing the same as Macy's closed its 170000-square-foot flagship store in Water Tower Place last spring Japanese retailer Uniqlo closed its 60000-square-foot store in August and the Disney Store closed its 7000-square-foot location on Michigan Avenue last month.

In the past few years Gap Forever 21 and Tommy Bahama have also closed stores on the Magnificent Mile. The vacancy rate has skyrocketed from 11 percent in 2019 to 19 percent this year according to ABC 7.

'We recognize community concerns around crime and the impact it can have on one's sense of safety as well as the economic stability of a business' the State's Attorney's office wrote in a statement to CBS Chicago before doubling down on its approach to retail crime.

'We continue to prosecute retail theft cases as misdemeanors and felonies when appropriate to do so based on the facts and evidence' the statement continued.

The State's Attorney's office said that so far this year its prosecutors have reviewed and issued 38 total charges for retail theft in areas of Chicago including the Magnificent Mile and Streeterville. Of that number 18 were approved as felony charges 10 were prosecuted and six were convicted.

The city's shoplifting issue could grow worse as the Chicago Police Department has started placing officers on unpaid leave for failing to report their vaccination status by Friday's deadline.

So far about 50 officers have been placed on an unpaid status according to Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday however called the 50 officers a 'very small number' who have had their pay stopped by the city for refusing to cooperate with the mandate.

As of Tuesday 4543 officers – a little over one third of the force – have not complied and are being given one last chance to report whether they've been vaccinated or be put on no-pay status.

Meanwhile the city has started seeking recruits from suburban Illinois to fill the potential staffing shortage.

Robb Karr president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association told CBS Chicago that loss of sales tax associated with shoplifting – on top of the closing stores – further hinder Chicago's post-pandemic recovery.

'The impression around the nation is that Chicago is not a very safe place to be' he said. 'And the incidents we saw this morning over the weekend the episodes before that only feed that.'

Late last month a gang of shoplifters was filmed brazenly ransacking UIta Beauty store in the Windy City's Norridge suburb over the weekend. Footage showed a gang of three hooded thieves emptying its shelves of expensive Christian Dior and Armani makeup into black trash bags.

It was shared on social media Monday with the shocked cameraman who hasn't been named saying: 'Look at this this is insane' as he films the theft unfolding before his eyes.

It came as CWB Chicago reported Chicago's stores have been targeted by three different organized crime gangs. One of those gangs has been targeting upmarket designer stores on the city's Magnificent Mile whose businesses were hit by looting in summer 2020 during riots in the wake of George Floyd's murder.

The second has targeted at least three Ulta Beauty stores - although it's currently unclear if that is the same gang filmed at the Norridge location. And a third gang has been raiding Walgreen's drug stores to steal cigarettes.

The first shoplifting crew was stealing from high-end Chicago stores between the Magnificent Mile and Rush Street according to CWB Chicago. Twelve men were seen involved in a raid of 35 handbags at Bottega Veneta on September 27 - which go for thousands of dollars each- and left in two separate cars including a gray Honda CRV.

The same crew allegedly attempted to steal from Salvatore Ferragamo an hour before but left after they were believed to be recognized by the store's security guard. They already reportedly stole $43000 worth of the store's merchandise in August and injured the security guard during the theft.

A police officer was shot in the face on Monday afternoon but returned to his precinct in the 18th District later that evening - still wearing his hospital gown

Violent crimes are up across the board in Chicago with murders are up a whopping 56 percent since 2019 and three percent since 2020

'Michigan Avenue is the economic engine of the city of Chicago. Almost 20% of the jobs are in the mag mile district jobs in the city of Chicago' Jack Lavin the president and CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce said to ABC 7. '$180 million of sales tax revenue is generated by this district it's the largest neighborhood in the city of Chicago.'

He said that the Chamber is pushing for 'innovative' ways to attract merchants back to the Magnificent Mile adding that this may involve breaking large spaces up into smaller retail shops.

Meanwhile the most recent victim of Chicago's violent crime wave was a police officer who was shot in the face on Monday and returned to work that same evening saluted by his colleagues as he entered the precinct still wearing his hospital gown.

The unnamed officer was shot in the cheek when he confronted Jovan McPherson a felon on probation who was threatening and holding a woman at gunpoint at a busy Lincoln Park strip mall Cook County prosecutors said Tuesday.

McPherson allegedly pulled out a gun and a struggle ensued as the officer tried to take the weapon away prosecutors said. That's when McPherson fired a shot that struck the officer in the cheek prosecutors said.

Chicago's pattern of crime and shoplifting mirrors that of other cities like San Francisco in which Walgreens announced that it is shuttering another five of its stores because of rampant shoplifting by thieves who sell the items outside the drugstore chain's doors.

The national chain has closed 17 of its 70 San Francisco locations in the past two years because of the shelf raiders who have swiped everything not behind lock and key.

Thefts in the chain's 53 remaining stores are five times the average for their stores elsewhere in the country according to company officials.

San Francisco and Walgreens officials have cited 'organized retail crime' - in which the thieves sell the swiped merchandise outside the stores - as a main reason for the most recent closures.

'Organized retail crime continues to be a challenge facing retailers across San Francisco and we are not immune to that' Walgreens spokesperson Phil Caruso told the Daily Mail last Wednesday.

'Retail theft across our San Francisco stores has continued to increase in the past few months to five times our chain average.'

Another smiled and waved at the security guard who filmed the scene as he passed by

Viral videos taken throughout the summer have shown shoplifters brazenly sauntering out of stores with armfuls of stolen goods as witnesses watch in shock.

In one incident surveillance footage caught a group of thieves in masks and hoodies sprinting out of a San Francisco Neiman Marcus with armfuls of designer handbags and others casually walking out of a TJ Maxx store carrying bags worth of goods.

In another in June a prolific shoplifter who had stolen from the same Walgreens on at least four occasions was seen loading armfuls of Walgreens products into a trash bag then riding his bike through the store with the stolen goods while the security guard and bystanders looked on.

The suspect Jean Lugo-Romero 40 was arrested on June 19 and remains in jail.

Shoplifting has been a problem in the Democrat-run state since 2014 - following the passage of Proposition 47 a ballot referendum known as the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act - that downgraded the theft of property worth less than $950 in value from a felony to a misdemeanor.

Cases have jumped during the pandemic as store staff and security guards choose not to pursue the thieves. Larceny and theft remain the most common crimes committed in San Francisco increasing by about 8 percent from last year. There were 21842 cases reported through October 10 of this year compared with 20254 cases during the same time through 2020.

The Walgreens locations that will be closing include: 2550 Ocean Avenue on November 8 4645 Mission Street on November 11 745 Clement Street on November 15 300 Gough Street on November 15 and 3400 Cesar Chavez Street on November 17.

New York City stores are also rife with shoplifting incidents and earlier this month a TikTok video went viral that revealed brazen thieves stealing from a Rite Aid in front of a security guard before leaving with their stolen items. The security guard a woman named India who said she worked at a Rite Aid posted the video to TikTok and dubbed it 'a typical night at work.'

It showed a parade of people taking things off the shelves and walking out with one of the thieves even smiling and waving at her as he passed.

The comment led people to ask her why she isn't stopping the thieves if she is supposed to be a security guard to which she replied: 'Because it's illegal to touch grab or use any physical force to stop them.'

Instead she said her job is to 'observe and report.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXZlbnRpb24uY29tL2JlYXV0eS9za2luLWNhcmUvYTM4MDM1NjUxL2plbm5pZmVyLWFuaXN0b24taHlkcmF0aW5nLXJvc2V3YXRlci1mYWNlLW1pc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Aniston's Favorite $9 Hydrating Face Mist,"We may earn commission from links on this page but we only recommend products we back.

Inouye International Airport (HNL) beginning Dec. 13. Hawaiian which suspended the route in March 2020 due to travel restrictions imposed at the onset of the pandemic will welcome Australians back to the islands with its signature Hawaiian hospitality in time for the holidays.

“We are thrilled to reconnect Hawaiʻi and Australia and have been encouraged by the public’s response to Australia’s national vaccination program enabling the reopening of borders” said Andrew Stanbury regional director for Australia and New Zealand at Hawaiian Airlines.

“Hawaiʻi is a hugely popular holiday destination for Australians and we know many people have been keenly waiting to take a Hawaiian vacation. We are looking forward to safely welcoming our guests back on board to enjoy the authentic hospitality we know our guests love and have missed” he added.

HA451 will resume Dec. 13 by departing HNL on Mondays and Wednesday through Saturday at 11:50 a.m. and arrive at SYD approximately 7:45 p.m. the next day. Starting Dec. 15 HA452 will depart SYD on Tuesdays and Thursday through Sunday at 9:40 p.m. with a 10:35 a.m. scheduled arrival at HNL allowing guests to check in to their accommodations and begin exploring O‘ahu or connect to any of Hawaiian’s four Neighbor Island destinations.

Hawaiʻi Gov. David Ige last week welcomed back visitors beginning Nov. 1 now that public health efforts have resulted in among the lowest rates of COVID in the United States. Hawaiian Airlines last month also launched a new in-flight video encouraging visitors to Travel Pono (responsibly) by enjoying Hawai‘i safely and responsibly.

In addition to convenient nonstop flights to Hawai‘i Australian travelers flying on Hawaiian Airlines also regain access to the carrier’s extensive U.S. domestic network allowing them to seamlessly continue their travels to 16 U.S. mainland gateways – including new destinations in Austin Orlando and Ontario California – with the option to enjoy a stopover in the Hawaiian Islands.

Hawaiian will continue to operate the SYD-HNL route with its 278-seat spacious wide-body Airbus A330 aircraft which features 18 Premium Cabin lie-flat leather seats 68 of its popular Extra Comfort seats and 192 Main Cabin seats.

Currently only Australian citizens and returning permanent residents and their immediate family members are permitted to enter Australia without an exemption. While entry requirements for the state of Hawaiʻi remain to be announced Hawaiian hopes the state of Hawai‘i will align its requirements with U.S. government rules requiring international arrivals to show proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test taken within three days of departure effective Nov. 8.

International rules continue to evolve and travelers are encouraged to stay updated via official government channels as they prepare for their trip.

Hawaiian started SYD-HNL service in May 2004 and maintained its position as a leading destination carrier for travel to Hawaiʻi via New South Wales. The carrier’s three-times-weekly service between HNL and Brisbane Airport (BNE) which launched in November 2012 remains paused.

In a competitive job market the company is incentivizing referrals.

TAMPA Fla. — Have you started on your holiday shopping lists? Even though we aren't yet past Halloween the holiday season is months of planning in the making for mail delivery services like UPS.

""Everyone knows for us the holiday season is the busiest time of the year"" said Yanina Hernandez-Bynum the Florida District Human Resources Director for UPS. ""Although we're starting to believe there is no downtime.""

UPS is hiring an additional 100000 employees nationwide for season positions. In Tampa about 500 seasonal positions were added.

To stay competitive in a growingly difficult job market UPS is offering incentives for referrals from existing employees.

""It gives them the opportunity to earn $200 for every successful referral"" said Hernandez-Bynum. ""So every referral that they give us that is hired that works through the holiday season they can receive $200.""

Hernandez-Bynum said UPS rehires roughly one-third of the seasonal workers for permanent positions. There biggest challenge in staffing up for the holidays: time.

""Time is always a challenge because we look to do it in such a short period of time"" said Hernandez-Bynum. ""But we try to get creative with that as well.""

Seasonal positions at UPS include warehouse workers package delivery drivers personal vehicle drivers driver helpers and tractor-trailer drivers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIwNzgzMjgvYW1hem9uLW5vdy1kZWxpdmVycy1tb3JlLXVzLXBhY2thZ2VzLXRoYW4tZmVkZXjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon now delivers more US packages than FedEx,"In 2014 Amazon delivered approximately 0.2% of all US packages. Today Amazon controls one-fifth of the delivery market and is on track to overtake UPS and even the US Postal Service (USPS) according to data from the logistics firm Pitney Bowes.

Data released in Sept. shows the e-commerce giant has now unseated FedEx as the third-largest US package courier—and it’s trailing just behind UPS the only private business that still delivers more parcels than Amazon.

Amazon used to rely heavily on FedEx and UPS to deliver packages to its customers. But the company shifted its strategy after a disastrous 2013 holiday shopping season in which the delivery services failed to keep up with the torrent of gifts US shoppers ordered from Amazon leading to widespread delays. The next year Amazon accelerated the construction of its own distribution centers and began amassing fleets of semi-trucks cargo planes and delivery vans. Ever since Amazon has been steadily shifting more of its deliveries away from FedEx and UPS and toward its in-house logistics operation.

So far the e-commerce giant has focused on delivering its own packages. But the explosive growth suggests Amazon may soon enter the delivery market. Analysts believe Amazon is primed to launch a standalone delivery service in the US within months. The new unit would compete with UPS and FedEx delivering packages for outside businesses applying further pressure to make two-day or same-day delivery routine.

Amazon Logistics poised for explosive growth

Amazon Logistics the e-commerce company’s delivery division has already grown large enough to meet most of the company’s internal needs; it now handles two-thirds of Amazon package deliveries. But even so Amazon has dramatically increased its spending on logistics infrastructure. It’s buying dozens of cargo planes opening multibillion-dollar freight handling facilities and hiring 125000 new delivery drivers and warehouse workers in the US.

In the eyes of Morgan Stanley analysts that’s strong evidence Amazon’s delivery business will launch within 18 months. Indeed Amazon is already quietly handling some packages for the US Postal Service its largest competitor in the US delivery market.

If Amazon opens its delivery services to more outside businesses the company can leverage billions of dollars in in-house logistics investments—just as it did when it spun off Amazon Web Services into a wildly profitable subsidiary.

So far Amazon Logistics has failed to catch up to its US package delivery rivals in terms of revenue. But that may only be because it offers below-market rates to its primary customer its parent company Amazon. Amazon Logistics collects about $4.28 in revenue for every package it delivers compared to $12.19 for UPS and $17.95 for FedEx according to Quartz’s analysis of Pitney Bowes data.

Since its marketplace business subsidizes its delivery infrastructure it can afford to keep prices low while raking in profits. Assuming Amazon raises shipping prices for outside customers the e-commerce behemoth may itself in the market leader in yet another industry.",,,,,,,,,

The FDA’s analysis was made public ahead of a Tuesday meeting of outside scientists convened to make a recommendation on authorizing the vaccine for children in that age range. An agenda for the meeting shows sessions dedicated to the vaccine’s effectiveness and to the potential risk of myocarditis an inflammation of the heart. The FDA is not bound by the votes of its advisory committees but it generally follows their advice.

New data from Pfizer were also made public on Friday. They show that the vaccine is about 91% effective in preventing Covid-19 in 5- to 11-year-olds.

“While benefits of vaccination were highly dependent on Covid-19 incidence the overall analysis predicted that the numbers of clinically significant Covid-19-related outcomes prevented would clearly outweigh the numbers of vaccine-associated excess myocarditis cases over a range of assumptions for Covid-19 incidence” agency researchers wrote.

However the researchers noted if the rate of Covid-19 was to fall to levels seen in June 2021 there would be more vaccine-associated myocarditis cases than Covid-19 hospitalizations. But even then the FDA staff said given the more severe nature of Covid-19 hospitalization “the overall benefits of the vaccine may still outweigh the risks under this low-incidence scenario.”

Much of the committee’s discussion is likely to center on the benefits of the vaccine which dramatically reduces the chances a child will become infected with SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes Covid-19 as well as its potential risks. In older boys and young men the vaccine has been linked to myocarditis. It has occurred in somewhere around 1 in 10000 boys and men between the ages of 16 and 19 who received a second dose though estimates of the risk vary.

New data in the briefing documents show that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine not only cuts the risk of infection but also reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 in children who do become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among the 1518 children in the study who received the vaccine there were three cases of symptomatic Covid-19. Among the 750 children who received placebo there were 16 cases of the disease — meaning the vaccine was 90.7% effective. Previously only data about children’s ability to produce antibodies against Covid-19 after vaccination and not its effectiveness at preventing illness were available.

Symptoms among the vaccinated children who developed Covid were very mild. None had fevers. By contrast 10 of the 16 children who were not vaccinated who developed Covid-19 developed fevers and generally had worse symptoms. Common side effects were generally similar to those caused by the adult vaccine and included headaches and fevers. The pediatric shot is 10 micrograms or one-third the adult dosage.

Of the volunteers in the study 52% were male 79% were white 6%% were Black and 6% were Asian American.

Data were also included in an expansion group of 1591 additional children who received the vaccine and another 788 who received placebo although all have not been followed for 2.5 weeks. For these children information is available only about side effects. It appears that the FDA may be willing to make a decision on the vaccine without data from this extension study.

Because children are less likely to experience severe consequences of Covid-19 the panel will likely discuss whether the benefits of protection outweigh the small risk of myocarditis or other side effects. Covid-19 itself can cause myocarditis at a much higher rate than the vaccine.

Too few younger individuals have been treated to have a clear idea of the risk of myocarditis. Researchers still do not fully understand why it occurs. Although some patients with vaccine-induced myocarditis have needed intensive care the FDA said most had their symptoms resolve with “conservative management.”

Because myocarditis occurred only rarely in clinical trials it’s difficult to estimate exactly how often it occurs. In its briefing documents the FDA said that myocarditis and pericarditis a related inflammation of the heart’s lining were reported to the U.S. government’s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) at a rate of 71.5 cases per million in vaccinated males ages 16 to 17 and 42.6 cases per million in males ages 12 to 15. That equates to about one case per 12000 for 16- to 17-year-olds and one case per 24000 for 12-to-15-year-olds.

But the FDA also analyzed a database of claims from Optum part of the insurer UnitedHealth Group. In that database the estimated excess risk of myocarditis and pericarditis approached 200 cases per million in fully vaccinated males aged 16 to 17 and 180 cases per million in vaccinated males aged 12 to 15 years of age. That’s about one case per 5000 vaccinated boys.

The question though is not just what is the risk of myocarditis but whether the benefit of the vaccine outweighs that risk. And the benefit of vaccinating anyone depends on how many cases of Covid-19 are occurring.

The FDA modeled how many hospitalizations would be prevented by vaccinating a million boys in the 5 to 11 age range at six different points in the pandemic. Most of the time the vaccine would prevent 200 to 250 hospitalizations per one million vaccinated boys. But at one point in June 2021 when cases were plummeting nationwide the vaccine would only have prevented only 21 hospitalizations per one million boys.

At any point the number of myocarditis hospitalizations caused by the vaccine would be the same: the FDA estimated it as 98 hospitalizations per million boys vaccinated. So normally even in the highest-risk group the number of Covid-related hospitalizations prevented would be double the number of hospitalizations due to myocarditis. But when the virus is under control the number of myocarditis-related hospitalizations in boys in this age group would be slightly more than Covid-related hospitalizations because Covid-19 cases would be so low.

The FDA argues that even in this case outcomes for those hospitalized with Covid-19 would be worse than those with myocarditis and that it chose to model a high rate of myocarditis meaning the condition may be less common.

In Pfizer’s briefing documents made available ahead of the meeting the company cited data from Israel where its vaccine is the main one in use and data on myocarditis have been closely tracked.

In these data the risk of myocarditis after a second dose in 12- to 15-year-old boys was 1 in 12000 Pfizer said about half that in males aged 16 to 19. That’s based on 12 cases that occurred in 255444 adolescents. Only one of those cases was in a female vaccine recipient.

Pfizer said in its documents that assuming the 90% efficacy figure on the vaccine holds up vaccinating one million 5- to 12-year-old children would prevent 33600 cases and 170 hospitalizations over 120 days. During the same period of time there would be 21 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis.

A draft agenda for Tuesday’s meeting shows that the committee will view presentations on myocarditis and other risks and on the benefits of the vaccine. According to the briefing documents the panel will consider whether based on the totality of scientific evidence the benefits of the two-dose vaccine outweigh its risks for use in children 5-11 years of age.

If the FDA decides to authorize the vaccine its use will then be evaluated by a separate panel convened by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. If that committee also recommends its use and the CDC director agrees the vaccine will be made available.

New Delhi: There is a need to incorporate alternative financing models to address financial gaps in health sector and to ensure mandatory health coverage for all to support the Universal Health Coverage targets said a report titled 'COVID-19 Induced Healthcare Transformation in India '.With a healthcare spending of 1.5 per cent of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018-19 there is a need to increase the public health spending to 2.5-3.5 per cent to support the healthcare transformation underlined the report released on Friday.The report has listed six thematic areas that require immediate deliberation and gives actionable recommendations in view of need for greater investment in enhancing health outcomes and a strategic diversion of funds towards sustaining these outcomes.The FICCI and KPMG in India report titled 'COVID-19 Induced Healthcare Transformation in India' underlines that the Covid crisis proved to be a catalyst for increased adoption of digital healthcare systems across the world.The pandemic also paved way for India to demonstrate unprecedented resilience and dynamism in terms of system strengthening and rapid policy making as well as unified efforts by all stakeholders said the report.The report deep dives into the major disruptors and technological interventions that were triggered by the pandemic expediting the approach towards a more affordable accessible and equitable health system.Dr. Alok Roy Chair FICCI Health Services Committee  said: ""The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in our health systems and amplified already existing challenges pertaining to gaps in health infrastructure workforce and accessibility and equity in health services. But at the same time it also reinforced an urgent need to make greater investments in augmenting health preparedness and quality of care.""The report highlights the health crisis and the subsequent response management in India and how these interventions should not be one-time efforts but should have potential to create long lasting impact on the Indian health system. Lalit Mistry  Partner and Co-Head - Healthcare Sector KPMG in India said: ""The pandemic has transformed the way the government and private players are planning to bring change in the healthcare system. Success would now lie in how these new initiatives are implemented.""The report underlines a strategic way forward for a more rounded approach to ensuring pandemic preparedness and health systems strengthening.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vc2NpZW5jZS50aGV3aXJlLmluL2hlYWx0aC93aG8tcmVzb2x1dGlvbi1vbi1wZXJzb25zLXdpdGgtZGlzYWJpbGl0aWVzLW9taXRzLWNici13aHkteW91LXNob3VsZC1jYXJlL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vc2NpZW5jZS50aGV3aXJlLmluL2hlYWx0aC93aG8tcmVzb2x1dGlvbi1vbi1wZXJzb25zLXdpdGgtZGlzYWJpbGl0aWVzLW9taXRzLWNici13aHkteW91LXNob3VsZC1jYXJlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WHO Resolution on Persons With Disabilities Omits CBR – Why You Should Care,"A disability rights parade in New York. Representative image. Photo: Reuters

For the first time in many years WHO member states approved a policy pertaining to persons with disabilities that didn’t mention ‘community-based rehabilitation’ (CBR).

CBR involves three stakeholders: persons with disabilities their families and caregivers and governmental and non-governmental agencies working on public health and the rights of persons with disabilities.



A global alliance of non-governmental stakeholders working on CBR says instead of doing away with the idea the WHO should focus on streamlining CBR efforts.

New Delhi: A new decision by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to move away from a policy it initiated over four decades ago has surprised disability rights activists particularly those working in countries of the ‘Global South’.

The World Health Assembly the body with which the WHO’s member states govern it passed a resolution entitled ‘The highest attainable standard of health for persons with disabilities’ in January 2021. The moment became the first time in many years that the member states had approved a policy pertaining to persons with disabilities that didn’t mention something called ‘community-based rehabilitation’ (CBR).

This is a potentially pernicious omission.

Activists are worried that as a result the WHO will also leave out CBR from its Rehabilitation 2030 initiative – a.k.a. ‘Rehab 2030’ – which says rehabilitation should be an integral part of health systems and the health assembly’s proposed 2022 resolution on ‘Rehabilitation for All’.

Why CBR matters

For people with disabilities especially those living in places where access to healthcare is more difficult everyday life can often be challenging in different ways – from accessing basic education in the same way as everyone else to living with dignity and without stigma. To address that the WHO and public health professionals advanced the idea of CBR in the late 1970s.

CBR involves three stakeholders: persons with disabilities their families and caregivers and governmental and non-governmental agencies working on public health and the rights of persons with disabilities. On the policy level CBR implies the need to train family members caregivers and others within a community in ways that will allow persons with disabilities to live the fullest lives possible participate actively in society and access regular services.

One particular reason CBR became necessary was that there just aren’t enough trained medical professionals in many if not most parts of the world to cater to the everyday long-term rehabilitation needs of persons with disabilities. In developing countries healthcare service delivery varies widely – as we’ve seen in India across rural and urban areas and between states. In such a landscape CBR was conceived as a pathway to an inclusive cost-effective framework to ensure the most people benefited from the right policies.

Indeed the rise and inclusion of CBR also marks a broader shift in disability rights policy – from viewing persons with disabilities as passive recipients of “aid” or “charity” to more active stakeholders in their own well-being and society.

This is also why leaving CBR out of a new policy has become cause for concern – especially as there is a suggestion of a policy shift in the other direction.

Rehabilitation requirements aren’t limited to those who are born with disabilities. Long-term illness old age and other factors can also make a person need more care and help with accessing their basic entitlements. Experts have noted these aspects during and after COVID-19 infections as well as some people continue to suffer from long-term effects even many weeks or months after they beat the virus.

A 2019 study published by The Lancet attempted to estimate the number of people around the world in need of rehabilitation services – and arrived at the staggering figure of 2.41 million. “Rehabilitation needs to be brought close to communities as an integral part of primary health care to reach more people in need” the study’s authors wrote.

For these efforts to succeed traditional primary healthcare providers need to be trained to assess and deliver long-term rehabilitation measures and rehabilitation specialists need to be added to the primary healthcare workforce they added.

Making rehabilitation more inclusive

Being born with or developing a disability doesn’t affect everyone the same way. Studies have shown that vulnerable populations – women the elderly people living in poverty the economically and socially marginalised – are also likely to find themselves being excluded from healthcare and rehabilitation plans or have a tougher more exacting time accessing care.

Indeed we have reason to believe today that poverty and disability feed into each other. Unsafe living and working conditions lack of clean water and sanitation facilities and crowded housing quarters can create conditions that foster long-term illnesses and disability. At the other end having a disability can make it difficult to earn a living increase the costs of living and provoke economic discrimination ultimately increasing one’s odds of slipping into poverty.

In India out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare is high – and still rising. The country’s COVID-19 epidemic spotlighted this: many households were forced to spend all their savings and often more to get their loved ones good-quality treatment at the right time. Private hospitals in big cities as much as smaller towns and more rural areas as well continued to charge high prices through 2020 and 2021. One recent survey in Maharashtra found that even a state-government directive to keep costs down didn’t deter such gouging practices.

According to a report of the Fifteenth Finance Commission an average Indian doctor caters to 1511 people versus the WHO’s recommended 1000. Nurses are more scarce: each nurse caters to 670 Indians on average versus the ideal 300. Of course these averages also blur other healthcare inequalities – there are fewer doctors in rural areas than urban ones particularly specialists for example.

“What the WHO is saying now is that we are a health organisation [and] inclusion is not our mandate” B. Venkatesh founder-convenor of the Indian Forum for Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology and president of the CBR Global Network told The Wire. “That’s why the entire focus in the recent literature coming out of Rehab 2030 is shifting towards increasing infrastructure more primary health centres etc.”

He called ‘Rehab 2030’ a “great vision” – and said persons with disabilities would benefit from the availability of more fully-trained professionals at every health centre. “But what happens until then?”

He also pointed to the persistently dismal public spending on healthcare in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For example India spends only 0.34% of its GDP on healthcare – up just 0.03 percentage points from last year (even if the Centre recently attempted to claim that the latter figure was 137%).

“The Rehab 2030 agenda may want to make health-service delivery the same in all countries but that’s not going to happen without the political will and not for many many years” Venkatesh said.

Instead to reach the most marginalised people he suggested investing in communities. “You have to increase the knowledge and skills of people in the community to provide care wherever they are. There is no universal health coverage without CBR. There’s no other developed methodology available.”

But does it work?

CBR has been implemented in a non-uniform way in a hundred countries since the 1970s according to Venkatesh but more data is hard to find. “But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work” he continued. “It may not be perfect and maybe standardisation is required but doing away with it completely is not the answer – especially in developing countries where there is no alternative mechanism to provide rehabilitation services to poorer people.”

“A lot of the evidence” he continued “is also in different languages – Malay Chinese Swahili etc. – because CBR is practiced at the local and national levels in so many different countries. So the criticism that there’s no evidence isn’t valid.”

Perhaps this also reflects the fundamental nature of how and where CBR is implemented: “People with limited resources don’t live for evidence they live by supporting each other building community resilience mutual respect interdependence” as Venkatesh put it.

But evidence that CBR works isn’t entirely absent either. For example a May 2021 study from Kabul reported that “social support from family members and people in the surroundings and a sense of belonging are fundamental social needs of people with hearing loss”.

The CBR Global Network – an alliance of non-governmental stakeholders working on CBR in different parts of the world – has held that instead of doing away with the idea the WHO should focus on streamlining CBR efforts and gathering more data on what works or doesn’t. If not the group believes healthcare and rehabilitation access for persons with disabilities – particularly those in the LMICs – will only become more unequal.

“CBR must be included as an integral part of service delivery strategy in the resolution on rehabilitation for all expected to be tabled in the World Health Assembly in 2022” a document the group recently published says. They hope that the WHO is listening so that CBR efforts in India across and around the world can be strengthened instead of forgotten.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcml2ZXJkYWxlcHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvc28taGFzLWJvd21hbi1hYmFuZG9uZWQtcml2ZXJkYWxlLDc2MzM00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,So has Bowman abandoned Riverdale?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://riverdalepress.com/stories/so-has-bowman-abandoned-riverdale,76334 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcml2ZXJkYWxlcHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvc28taGFzLWJvd21hbi1hYmFuZG9uZWQtcml2ZXJkYWxlLDc2MzM00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaWNlZi5vcmcvc29tYWxpYS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy93b3JsZC1wb2xpby1kYXktMjAyMS1kZWxpdmVyaW5nLXByb21pc2UtcHJvdGVjdC1ldmVyeS1zb21hbGktY2hpbGQtcG9saW_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Polio Day 2021: Delivering on the promise to protect every Somali child from polio,"MOGADISHU 24 October 2021 - On World Polio Day 2021 the Federal Government of Somalia World Health Organization (WHO) United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other key partners from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) renewed their efforts to deliver on the promise to protect every Somali child from polio.

Over the years Somalia has made substantial progress in polio eradication. The country stopped the transmission of wild poliovirus in 2013 and prevented its subsequent importations. However outbreaks of other strains of poliovirus still pose a threat to unvaccinated children.

In March 2021 after 28 months Somalia’s polio programme and partners successfully stopped an outbreak of a rare strain of circulating poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3). Currently an outbreak of circulating poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) detected for the first time in Somalia in the environment in November 2017 and in a child on 11 May 2018 continues to threaten under-vaccinated children. So far 23 children have been infected with the last reported case detected in October 2021.

Somalia’s polio programme is foundational to the health care system of the country and is a critical asset for disease surveillance and primary health care. With an extensive network of over 149 national and sub-national polio health workers present in every district across the country the programme has provided immediate urgent support to other outbreaks and public health emergencies.

With a vision to strengthen Somalia’s health systems while optimizing existing resources the country is rolling out a polio transition plan capitalizing on the existing network of health workers to support other priority health care functions and streamline health service delivery. These efforts will ensure the country makes progress towards universal health coverage.

Tapping into new rigorously tested innovations to respond to and prevent polio outbreaks swiftly and robustly Somalia is at the forefront of countries to qualify for the use of a next-generation polio vaccine – known as novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2). This vaccine protects children particularly under-immunized ones from the emergence of polio strains as is genetically more stable than the monovalent oral polio vaccine (mOPV2) which is why it is being used as the “vaccine of choice” to address cVDPV2 outbreaks. Somalia is ready to use nOPV2 vaccines as soon as they are made available which would be a significant development for polio eradication efforts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWFpY2FvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8yNC9oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1jb3N0LWFuZC1wYXRpZW50LW91dGNvbWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health care cost and patient outcomes,"THIS week’s column will address several critical and intersecting health-care indices that closely correlate with patient outcomes but are poorly understood by the public. Efficient and high-quality health-care delivery requires a robust and resilient infrastructure that is expensive to create and costly to sustain. Unlike other sectors of the economy health care is perhaps one of the few areas where there is universal need but no universal access and when access is possible efficacy and quality are often lacking. When access efficacy and quality all co-exist in a health-care system the cost may be out of reach for many. Understanding how these factors interplay in health-care delivery and their impact on patient outcomes is a starting point for the appreciation of value.

A friend Robert Polet the former chairman of Gucci once gave me a long-standing Gucci mantra that he thought applied to the work we do at HIC. Gucci’s approach is that they have created something of high value that comes with the perception of high cost and so they use the slogan “Quality will be remembered long after price is forgotten.” Every human being deserves access to the best-quality health care delivered in a timely and effective manner. Efficacious quality care is the way lives are saved and major disabilities averted. But we live in an unequal society where large segments of the population do not have access to quality care and when they do the speed and efficacy of care are less than desirable. The reasons are apparent. Many facilities that are accessible to ordinary Jamaicans are seriously underfunded and often lack the resources to develop the infrastructure or procure the equipment and human capital needed to deliver high-quality effective care promptly. The affluent segments of the population have always had access to care in overseas territories most often Florida and are willing to pay significant amounts for even the most basic care there though they are often unwilling to spend even a fraction for comparable quality access and efficacy in Jamaica. This is partly because the society has been socialised over many years of lack to wrongly believe that high-quality effective timely and easily accessible care developed locally somehow magically does not attract any value.

This line of thinking creates friction in the pathway to quality care in Jamaica. In most advanced countries access to quality health care is regarded as a fundamental right of citizenship. It is likely the same logic that led to the abolition of user fees in public hospitals in Jamaica many years ago on the premise that the erasure of fees would ensure that citizens have access to care. Unfortunately because of the dire economic challenges unique to Jamaica the infrastructure in the public health-care sector is entirely inadequate to meet the demands of certain levels and complexity of care. It thus cannot deliver effective timely or quality care in many areas. Patients with cardiovascular disease for example routinely do not get timely intervention and by implication are denied effective and quality care. Several private facilities have sprung up to fill the void created by the inadequacies in the public system and should be supported and encouraged. In the United States the Government has mechanisms to compensate private hospitals and facilities that take care of cardiac emergencies (and other health-care emergencies for that matter). A law is established to protect private facilities from financial ruin resulting from providing emergency care to patients who either may be unable to pay for care or are subsequently unwilling to pay for such care once provided. No such protection exists in Jamaica and this deficit complicates access to care for many patients in emergencies.

What is the cost of providing access to emergency treatment?

Have you considered what would happen to you if you or your loved one developed crushing chest pain at 2 am on New Year’s Eve and were fearful for your life? What would you do if you got that dreaded call on Christmas Day that your mother or father is having a heart attack and you fear they will die? What will you do if your uncle or auntie collapses in church during Sunday morning service and is found to have a complete heart block? In any of these scenarios would you want to have access to a place where timely and effective intervention could take place to save lives? Have you ever considered what it costs to put such an infrastructure in place in Jamaica?

Let us try to explore the scenario. In all the cases highlighted above death or significant complication is highly likely without timely intervention in a well-equipped and well-resourced facility with around the clock availability of highly skilled personnel to respond to such life-threatening emergencies immediately. Such a facility ensures that utilities are always on and that highly qualified personnel are always available on site and are paid at a premium — whether any emergency patients come to the facility or not. Those things exist so that speed quality and efficacy will complement access in order to achieve the desired patient outcomes: prevention of death major complication or disability. The variable inputs for such high-quality and efficient care must be sourced overseas at high costs since Jamaica does not manufacture needed devices and supplies.

Additionally the facility must keep a significant pre-paid inventory to ensure timely care delivery is available in emergencies. Suppose your father or mother is having that heart attack at 2 am on Christmas Day. In that case an emergency angiogram and stent placement may need to be done. The sheath wires balloon stents and other required supplies must be readily available in the facility. Skilled interventional cardiologists trained in safe emergency stent placement and highly trained cath lab technicians and nursing staff must all be available to have this service performed in addition to administrative personnel. That staff is compensated at a higher rate for holiday and after-hour work. The same applies to your uncle or auntie who collapsed in church during Sunday morning worship and needs a pacemaker for a complete heart block. In the absence of facilities willing to provide such a resilient health-care ecosystem to translate access to quality and efficacy such patients are at the risk of untimely death or major complications.

Unfortunately unlike luxury purses health care is an intangible asset. Many patients and family members who at the time of impending doom make commitments to pay for services suddenly devalue the services once treatment is given and the danger seems to have abated. With clothing or accessories the product on their body is a constant reminder of the quality they have paid for but for some reason the life restored is often not enough of a reminder regarding quality. We have seen the contrary where some individuals feel that since they “lived to tell the tale” perhaps they would have been okay without any intervention becoming unwilling thereafter to pay following emergency treatment. This friction makes it difficult for some private facilities to provide consistent quality care which is impossible without appropriate compensation for such care.

How do we resolve cost concerns to ensure universal access and quality?

This remains a vexing question and underscores the need for continuing public education and dialogue between all stakeholders. Whether health care is a fundamental right or a privilege is a debate that has endured for decades. What however is a universally accepted doctrine is that all lives are sacred and should be preserved at all costs. Who pays that cost is the unresolved question. Current health-care financing mechanisms in Jamaica offer inadequate protection for patients and private healthcare facilities especially in emergencies. There is an urgent need for an alternative financing mechanism in order for health care to preserve the lives of citizens and encourage further investments in health-care development locally. Society must assume responsibility in ensuring that facilities that take risks to make timely effective and quality care accessible to all Jamaicans are preserved. Florida will always be welcoming to those who are happy to spend their dollars for health care in Miami. For the rest of us Jamaica may be our only option and we must make such care sustainable not just for us but for generations yet unborn.

They are some of the most scalable businesses in the world. This business model creates more revenue per employee and market cap per employee than any other group in the S&P 500.

THE THREE GOLD KING vs. S&P 500 COMPANIES (REVENUE/EMPLOYEE)

21 out of the top 50 companies from the S&P 500 that generated the most revenue per employee came from the energy sector. The oil companies saw a resurgence in 2017 because of a recovery in the oil price accelerating their revenue growth along with their increased oil production. But when you compare the top S&P 500 companies on a revenue per employee basis the top company Valero Energy generated less than 50% of the smallest of the three companies generated Royal Gold. Valero Energy generated almost 60% less than the #1 spot Wheaton Precious Metals. This is in 2017 when gold and oil produced the similar returns.

THE THREE GOLD KING vs. S&P 500 COMPANIES (MARKET CAP/EMPLOYEE)

Here is where it gets very interesting when you look at the market capitalization per employee how do the companies stack up? At the beginning of August 2018 based on the fiscal year 2017 staffing Toronto based Franco-Nevada is on a completely different league on a market capitalization value per employee at more than $400 million in market capitalization per employee. This almost 2X more than its nearest competitors (Wheaton Precious Metals and Royal Gold) and more than 11X more than EOG. Apple the world’s largest company it’s per employee value was $8.3 million in market cap value per employee in 2017 or 97% less than each employee was to Franco Nevada.

THREE GOLD KINGS vs BANKERS ON WALL STREET

For the bankers out there this will interest you. The Three Gold Kings once again in 2017 generated 25X more revenue per employee than the key wall street investment banks (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). When you compare the Three Kings to diversified bank J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Royal Gold generates almost 50X as much revenue per employee and Wheaton Precious Metals generates more than 55X more. As of August on a market capitalization basis Franco-Nevada had 175X higher value on a market capitalization per employee basis than Goldman Sachs and 277X more than Morgan Stanley.

THREE GOLD KINGS vs FAANGs

Netflix is the main FAANG winner on a revenue per employee basis ($2.1 million) this is still well below that of Wheaton Precious Metals which generated $22.2 million in revenue per employee more than 10X more. Apple was again ahead of Facebook and Google on the same metric in 2017 from 2016. Amazon is the laggard because of the number of employees it needs to hire to build out its distribution network. Google and Facebook switched on a revenue per employee position from 2016. While nowhere as extreme as the investment banks Franco-Nevada had $425 million in market cap. per employee more than 50X M that of Apple $8.3 million. This is AFTER Apple became a trillion-dollar company.

DEPRESSED GOLD IS GOOD FOR THE THREE GOLD KINGS

Depressed gold prices are ideal for the royalty and streaming model because both producers and explorers get starved for capital because investors are focused on other sectors. Now is no different with gold prices down and a marijuana boom pulling in all the capital in Canada and tech sector pulling in investor capital in the United States. This allows the royalty and streaming companies to be the bankers of last resort and get better terms than they would normally be able to get when the sector is doing well. Good luck to the banker trying to pitch a potential mine development in Africa where a royalty and streaming company can step in and take on the risk. Their deal flow tends to be inversely related to the commodity price.

SECTOR ROTATION IS COMING?

The gold sector is incredibly unloved and unwanted whereas the tech companies continue to be in favor. Over the next 2-3 years we would expect the gap to widen on the two metrics between the Three Gold Kings and the FAANG’s because of rotation out of tech and into materials. Market capitalization per employee will accelerate for the Three Gold Kings as capital flows increase to them because they tend to be in most of the gold ETFs have liquidity pay dividends have reduced exposure to any one particular mine and have a proven track record of creating shareholder wealth. On the revenue side the Three Gold Kings are growing the attributable gold ounces each year over the next few years that will further push them ahead of the FAANG’s. The Three Kings are doing this without having to add any new employees.

Okay okay but you say show me the share price:

Royal Gold and Franco-Nevada outperformed both gold and the S&P 500 by a wide margin. Wheaton Precious Metals outperformed silver but didn’t outperform the S&P 500 because of its heavier weighting to silver. In last place was the GDX ETF (gold miners ETF). It highlights the mining sector is more of a stock pickers environment. By outsourcing to the ETF shouldn’t necessarily expect outperformance. Gold has been down and the royalty and streaming model has held up well.

Why the Royalty and Streaming Model works for the Three Kings?

Wall Street and Bay Street (Canada) bankers flee the mining sector when the commodities sector is plummeting because risk and compliance assume the sector is riskier when the price is down. Which is completely illogical and irrational. This allows the Three Gold Kings to deploy capital when capital markets and traditional bank lending seizes up. Allowing them to get preferential terms because they are the banker of last resort. This is even more important when the larger miners need capital because there are fewer options to go for capital needs particularly during challenging times. The royalty and streaming companies know the miners need capital because the banks and investors have fled.

fewer ""Production"" growth tends to continue to grow year in and year out because as each new royalty and/or stream comes online it adds to the existing streams and royalty.

Optionality Optionality to the commodity price when the commodity price increases for that the royalty or stream is tied to. The change in the gold price will flow right down to the bottom line WITHOUT having to deploy more capital . Optionality to the resource. Many generalist investors completely miss this area because many times the mine can operate for many years if not decades well after the initial mine plan because the deposit continues to grow. This allows the royalty companies to continue collecting from the mine without having to deploy any more capital.

El presidente junto al titular de la Segob durante su gira en Guerrero. Foto: Gobierno de México

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO (proceso.com.mx).– Durante su vivista por Guerrero el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador aseguró que la venta de niñas ""no es la regla"" pues en la región y las comunidades ""hay muchos valores culturales morales espirituales"".

Durante el anunció el Plan de apoyo a Guerrero en Chilpancingo de los Bravos el mandatario minimizó los casos de prostitución o ventas de niñas en comunidades por usos y costumbres en Guerrero y otros estado del país.

“Ahora que fuimos a La Montaña unas periodistas por toda la campaña que se genera de quienes no conocen las comunidades ni conocen de las culturas de los pueblos la pregunta que me hacían es ‘¿qué nos dice o viene a ver lo de la venta de las niñas lo de la prostitución de niñas?’ No no vengo a ver eso porque eso no es la regla” dijo el presidente.

En ese sentido subrayó que en La Montaña en todo Guerrero y en todo México existe una gran reserva de valores.

“Que ¿acaso entonces la prostitución nada más está con los pobres? Entonces toda una campaña en ese sentido pero no es motivo para cuestionar a nadie es que es muy enajenante el manejo de la información o mejor dicho la información que se transmite para distorsionar para deformar las cosas.

La semanada pasada se reveló el caso de un hombre llamado Rutilio Julián Moreno quien abusó de una menor de 15 años de edad encarcelada por integrantes de la Policía Comunitaria de la localidad de Dos Ríos luego de que lo denunció por abuso sexual.

El juego de PC PS4 y PS5 ya ha recuperado sus costes de desarrollo y todo ello ha hecho que Ember Lab pueda desarrollar únicamente juegos.

Todo parece ir bien para Kena: Bridge of Spirits ya que el indie de PlayStation y PC ha recuperado sus costes de desarrollo “Sony está feliz” por sus ventas y ahora Ember Lab podrá crear sólo juegos.

En una entrevista con Jason Schreier de Bloomberg los creadores de Kena han comentado todo esto y algunas cosas extra ya que su primer juego oficial ha sido un éxito.

La pequeña gran aventura de Ember Lab era un estreno muy esperado en PS5 pero también la apuesta de Sony en dos hermanos y su juego que por una serie de eventos imprevistos casi no ve la luz.

A principios de 2020 Sony estaba lista para mostrar su nueva PS5 y el equipo de marketing quería pulir el tráiler de Kena junto a Mike y Josh Grier para mostrarse en verano junto a la consola.

Pero el coronavirus llegó Sony trastabilló y cambió a un evento digital que no calmó los ánimos de ambos hermanos. Difícil pero posible decía Josh: ""Estaba en un traje protegido sudando todo el rato"".

Pese a que los juegos en general se retrasaron Kena Bridge of Spirits llegó el 21 de septiembre y tuvo un trato genial por Sony todo porque ya atrajo la atención de fans y críticos desde junio de 2020.

""Creo que eso ayudó a ponernos en primera línea en juegos destacados y mostrados cuanto antes"" decía Mike; parece que el traje y todo ese sudor mereció la pena.

Los hermanos Grier nunca habían hecho un juego Ember Lab empezó como servicio de animación en 2009 y se hicieron virales en 2016 por un corto fan de Majora's Mask.

El equipo presentó unas versiones iniciales de Kena en conferencias de juego atrayendo a grandes editores pero terminaron con un trato por Sony para financiación y marketing.

""Creo que todos regresamos a nuestros yoes de niño"" decía Josh. Ambos no saben decir con exactitud las copias de Kena que han vendido pero sus costes iniciales de desarrollo están recuperados.

Además las ventas de Kena les han sorprendido hasta ahora: ""Es complicado afirmar lo que es un gran éxito"" comentaba Josh. ""Sony está feliz"".

Lo que está claro es que el éxito ha permitido a Ember Lab convertirse a una desarrolladora de juegos a tiempo completo. No saben qué juego será el próximo pero piensan ya en uno narrativo como Kena.

""No vamos a volver a los anuncios"" sentenciaba Josh. ¿Vosotros tenéis ya vuestra copia de Kena Bridge of Spirits o estáis esperando a su lanzamiento en físico el próximo noviembre?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saWJyZW1lcmNhZG8uY29tLzIwMjEtMTAtMjMvbGEtZGVub21pbmFjaW9uLWRlLW9yaWdlbi1ydWVkYS1zZS1yZWN1cGVyYS1iYXRlLXJlY29yZHMteS1zYWxkcmEtYWlyb3NhLWRlbC0yMDIxLTY4MjkzMDYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La D.O. Rueda se recupera bate récords y saldrá airosa del 2021,"La D.O. Rueda fue reconocida como tal el 12 de enero de 1980 por orden del Ministerio de Agricultura convirtiéndose en la primera denominación de origen de Castilla y León. Su zona de producción está integrada por 74 municipios: 53 al sur de la provincia de Valladolid 17 al oeste de Segovia y 4 al norte de Ávila. Su especialidad: vinos blancos de alta calidad y amplio reconocimiento internacional.

A pesar de ello las ventas se han visto muy afectadas por la crisis derivada de la pandemia de coronavirus. Lo explica para LM su director general Santiago Mora. ""En marzo de 2020 con el estado de alarma lo primero que pasa es que se cierra el canal Horeca (bares restaurantes y cafeterías) para frenar el contagio masivo"" señala. ""Se paraliza España y se paraliza el canal de comercialización más importante de los vinos de calidad"".

""Cada D.O. ha tenido su propio comportamiento"" reconoce. ""En el caso de Rueda prácticamente el 65 o 70% de todas las ventas se realizan a través del Canal Horeca"". En consecuencia se hizo una estimación de pérdidas de un 20% para 2020. Sin embargo el comportamiento de los consumidores amortiguó el golpe.

El impacto real de la pandemia

""La situación se preveía muy mal"" comenta el director general de la Denominación de Origen de Rueda. Pero se produjo ""un comportamiento muy interesante por parte del consumidor"" que provocó un inesperado incremento de las ventas.

""Aparecieron nuevos momentos de consumo en las casas nuevos momentos para brindar... Aunque fuera a través de conversaciones telefónicas de zoom o videollamadas de WhatsApp"" explica.

En definitiva nuevos momentos de celebración y también de esparcimiento. La copita de vino nos acompañaba en nuestros momentos de descanso ""para romper con el teletrabajo y dar paso a la vida en casa"". Este fenómeno ""compensó parcialmente la caída de las ventas"".

Bodegas Mocén.

También ayudó el posicionamiento de la propia D.O. la segunda de España después de Rioja con una cuota de mercado a nivel global del 115%.

Bodegas Yllera.

Algo que destaca Santiago Mora ""tiene mucho mérito"" ya que ""el consumo de vino blanco no llega al 30% de lo que se consume de vino en España"".

En el canal Horeca tienen el 16% del mercado. Pero en alimentación estaban en quinto puesto. Aquí influyó la marca. ""Fue el paraguas"" señala. ""Pasa en todas las crisis. Las buenas marcas se convierten en refugio del consumidor"". Tanto es así que ""Rueda fue la D.O. que más creció con diferencia tanto en volumen como en valor"". Y esto ""compensó el desastre del cierre de los restaurantes"".

Además afortunadamente la crisis sanitaria no ha tenido un impacto negativo en sus ventas a nivel internacional. ""Aunque es cierto que el consumo global de vino ha disminuido durante la pandemia también es verdad que Rueda ha funcionado bastante fuera"". De hecho ""durante el 2020 se produjo un récord histórico de ventas en exportación con un crecimiento respecto al año anterior de un 5%"".

En definitiva el efecto de pandemia ha sido menor de lo previsto inicialmente gracias a la combinación de estos los elementos. ""Los nuevos momentos de consumo la fuerza de la marca y el incremento de las exportaciones vinieron a compensar el desastre de 2020"". Finalmente ""la bajada ha sido solo entre comillas del 10%"".

Las bodegas han aguantado

Bodegas José Pariente.

Lo mejor de todo es que ninguna bodega ha tenido que cerrar sus puertas. ""Todas han conseguido superar el bache"" asegura ""aunque cada una se haya visto afectada de una manera"".

Bodegas Avelino Vegas.

""Algunas vendían casi exclusivamente en canal Horeca"" añade ""pero no ha habido ningún cierre"". ""Ha habido solidez financiera estratégica y empresarial para poder afrontar la pandemia"".

Un 2021 para celebrar

Con el final de las restricciones y la vuelta a una relativa normalidad ha llegado el momento de recuperar el tiempo y las celebraciones perdidas. Y eso tratándose de España va unido a un aumento del consumo en bares y restaurantes. De hecho precisamente ese es el ‘claim’ de la última campaña de la D.O. Rueda.

El suelo cascajoso caracteriza a las viñas de la D.O. Rueda.

""Teníamos la seguridad de que la gente nuestros consumidores iban a tener muchísimas ganas de celebrar todo lo que antes no habían podido"" indica Mora. Y efectivamente así ha sido.

""Se ha producido un efecto pendular. Lo hemos notado sobre todo en verano pero se sigue notando. Hay unas ganas tremendas de compensar lo que no hemos podido hacer durante todo este tiempo"". ""Estamos de celebración continua"" exclama.

""El año 2021 empezó muy mal. Enero y febrero fueron meses horribles también con bajadas importantes de ventas respecto al año anterior. Pero en marzo se vio una recuperación importante"" explica. Entonces empezaron a batir récords de ventas y ya no han parado. ""Prácticamente todos los meses"" reconoce.

Los bares sus aliados

Como dice Santiago Mora lo que no vendieron ya no lo van a vender. ""Estamos hablando de vino blanco joven (95%) y ese vino ya no se va a beber"" subraya ""ahora se está bebiendo la nueva campaña"".

Pero es evidente que la situación ha mejorado mucho y ellos pueden ""vislumbrar un horizonte un poco diferente"". En buena medida gracias al sector hostelero que tanto ""hemos echado de menos"" y que ""ha sufrido muchísimo"".

""En España somos muy de bares"" destaca ""forman parte de la cultura de este país y está en nuestro ADN"" pero es que -además- ""son los grandes aliados de la comercialización de los vinos de Rueda"".

Una nueva zancadilla: la luz

Las dificultades a la que se enfrenta el sector vinícola no acaban con los efectos de la pandemia. Aún no había llegado el fin de las restricciones cuando ya había empezado la escalada del precio de la luz. Como les hemos contado en Libre Mercado ésta ahoga al sector de la hostelería y lleva a la ruina a algunas fábricas. Pero también afecta negativamente a los productores de vino. Y no hablamos sólo de la factura que pagan a las compañías eléctricas con las que tienen contratado el servicio.

""Tiene un efecto directo en lo que pagan por la luz nuestras bodegas nuestros viticultores todos los meses. Claro está. Pero no solo viene por ahí. El incremento del coste se está produciendo también porque sube el precio de los suministros"" explica. ""Los suministradores están sufriendo sobre todo los más industriales un mayor incremento en su factura y eso lo repercuten en sus productos"".

Por tanto ""se está notando una subida de la materia prima una subida del coste de la luz y una subida de todos los suministros... Y está incidiendo de forma importante en todos los sectores y evidentemente también en nuestras bodegas y nuestros viticultores"".

Buena vendimia grandes expectativas

La vendimia nocturna garantiza el equilibrio entre azúcar y acidez de la uva.

Las expectativas son buenas. Fundamentalmente porque esperan una gran añada. ""Somos muy optimistas. Acabamos de terminar vendimia y ha sido fantástica con unas condiciones sanitarias de la uva estupendas. Las primeras impresiones de nuestros bodegueros y de nuestros enólogos son muy buenas creen que tienen una grandísima materia prima"". ""Están como como niños con zapatos nuevos"" exclama Santiago Mora.

Ahora toca esperar aunque no demasiado. ""Estamos expectantes a que se produzcan las primeras catas de certificación que no tardarán en llegar. A lo largo de este mes de noviembre probablemente ya tengamos los primeros verdejos de Rueda de la añada 2021""."

EBONY's leadership team avoided that dilemma by tapping three visionary designers to create custom looks for its 2021 Power 100 debut. On a night that was all about celebrating Black brilliance EBONY Chairwoman Eden Bridgeman Sklenar CEO Michele Ghee and Editor-in-Chief & SVP of Programming Marielle Bobo shone a light on next-gen Black designers Bara Thiam Walé Oyéjidé and Charles Harbison.

Ghee's stunning black long-sleeved floor-length sequin dress was designed by Bara Thiam. Ornate details and voluminous sleeves created a dramatic silhouette. Thiam learned to sew at an early age while growing up in Senegal. After moving to New York City in 2018 he set up shop in a showroom and began designing collections with the assistance of friends.

Designer Walé Oyéjidé Esq. of the menswear line Ikiré Jones teamed up with the Bridgeman family for not one but two looks. Oyéjidé—whose tailored menswear appeared in Black Panther and Coming 2 America—made a rare foray into the world of womenswear with Eden Bridgeman Sklenar’s standout look. Inspired by a custom blazer Oyéjidé had crafted for Nas’ October 2021 EBONY cover the visionary created a tailored gown and dramatic cape emblazoned with classical European artworks reimagined with African protagonists. Oyéjidé also designed Heartland Coca-Cola executive Justin Bridgeman’s black-and-white blazer.

For Bobo designer Charles Harbison of Harbison Studio crafted a form-fitting orange floor-length gown with a front slit and dramatic train. The ensemble was inspired by his line's recent Spring/Summer 2022 collection. This week was a big one for Harbison. In addition to debuting Bobo’s custom look the Los Angeles–based talent also dropped a limited edition sustainable collection—BR x Harbison—which was made possible through Harlem’s Fashion Row. The agency founded by Power 100 honoree Brandice Daniel connects brand partners with emerging designers of color. The bold colorful collection is size-inclusive and offers balloon sleeve tops smocked apron dresses leisure suits and more.

The answer is complicated,"Google's new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro introduced at Google's Oct. 19 Pixel event both seem poised to rival the iPhone 13 and the Galaxy S21 as the best phones of 2021. They boast impressive cameras fast processors and stylish designs. Where Google appears to differ from its Apple and Samsung rivals at least on the first few days of preorders is in whether its new phones will work with the latest 5G networks.

The short answer? It's complicated particularly if you're looking to buy a phone directly from a carrier or unlocked from Google itself or from a third party like Best Buy. Whereas you can buy a new iPhone 13 put your SIM card in and know that it will be able to use the latest networks from your carrier the same can't be said right now about the Pixel 6.

At issue appears to be interpreting a mix of several unclear web pages from the search giant. Google's main Pixel 6 and 6 Pro tech specs pages all list two different models: one that supports all flavors of 5G -- millimeter-wave and ""Sub-6"" (which is a term that encompasses mid- and low-band 5G) -- and another that supports Sub-6 networks but not millimeter-wave.

A support page meanwhile says the Pixel 6 will support all flavors of 5G in the US while the 6 Pro will be limited to just the millimeter-wave flavor.

It's a mess but here is what we know right now and what you should know if you're thinking of buying Google's latest phones.

The Pixel mess

Andrew Hoyle/CNET

With the Pixel 6 Google initially appears to be sending mixed messages. Depending on which page and fine print you look at the device may or may not have been listed to work with all versions of your carrier's 5G network.

And there does seem to be a discrepancy both in the devices and the pricing. Verizon confirmed to CNET that buying a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro directly from Verizon will get you a phone that works on all of its flavors of 5G millimeter-wave and Sub-6.

There is however a premium for the Verizon Pixel 6. When buying directly from Verizon the phone will cost you $700 or roughly $100 more than Google charges for an unlocked Pixel 6 purchased directly from the Google Store. The 6 Pro starts at around $900 from both Google and Verizon.

AT&T tells CNET something similar. When buying directly from AT&T both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro will support millimeter-wave and Sub-6 versions of 5G. AT&T's issue? Its pricing starts at $740 for the Pixel 6 and $940 for the 6 Pro both higher than what Google charges for unlocked versions. A representative for the carrier did not share a reason why its pricing is more expensive.

T-Mobile meanwhile matches Google's pricing of $599 for the Pixel 6 but its model only supports the midband and low-band versions of 5G not millimeter-wave. For the 6 Pro T-Mobile supports all flavors of 5G and the price is similar to Google's.

On Wednesday afternoon Google confirmed to CNET that the unlocked Pixel 6 available from its store will only support Sub-6 5G networks at all three US carriers. The unlocked Pixel 6 Pro however will work with both millimeter-wave and Sub-6 versions of 5G.

The different flavors of 5G

James Martin/CNET

As people have been holding onto their phones for longer it makes sense that when buying a new device today you'll want it to be capable of tapping into the latest 5G networks for the next few years.

US carriers namely Verizon and AT&T have been actively deploying millimeter-wave 5G across parts of several dozen cities (plus stadiums arenas and airports) around the country. Verizon in particular has been touting its millimeter-wave network (called ""Ultra Wideband"") in its early 5G marketing over the last few years.

T-Mobile has done some millimeter-wave 5G rollouts but has largely focused on the other Sub-6 forms of 5G.

Millimeter-wave is the fastest version of 5G. It has download speeds that can reach several gigabits per second but it suffers from severely limited coverage particularly outdoors where it can be limited to just a few select blocks in a city or sections in a stadium. It also struggles to penetrate indoors.

Low-band 5G offers the best coverage and can work fine indoors but it often has speeds equivalent to a good 4G LTE connection.

Midband 5G as its name implies offers a middle ground between the two: significantly faster speeds than 4G LTE while still covering a wider area and working indoors. T-Mobile has been the most active of the US carriers with deploying midband 5G thus far (what it calls Ultra Capacity) and has previously said it plans to cover 200 million people nationwide with this service before the end of 2021.

AT&T and Verizon have each spent billions of dollars this year buying up midband spectrum known as C-band and both plan to begin deploying these networks at the end of this year and into early 2022.

Both carriers said on Oct. 19 that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro they're selling should be compatible with their respective C-band networks. T-Mobile said on Oct. 20 that both Pixel phones would support its C-band network that's slated to start rolling out at the end of 2023.

Google said on Oct. 21 that unlocked Pixels will be able to get a software update to enable support for C-band but that it will be up to the carriers to certify the unlocked phones to allow the devices to work on their respective networks.

What should you do?

Currently carrier support for the Pixel 6 is a big problem. Nobody wants to buy a phone find out it doesn't work as expected and then have to return it and go through the process again. But right now the only way to know you're getting a Pixel that works with your carrier is to buy directly from that carrier.

For T-Mobile users the Pixel 6's lack of a higher-frequency 5G such as millimeter-wave is far from a deal-breaker for the regular Pixel 6 at least in the short term. The carrier already has a robust midband 5G network has not really deployed millimeter-wave and its C-band network isn't coming until the end of 2023.

For those with AT&T or Verizon if you're able to take advantage of a trade-in or upgrade deal then buying directly from the carrier might not be a bad option. The promotion and trade-in could offset the price difference between buying from a carrier or buying from Google.

Buying this way seems to be the safest way to ensure that the Pixel you're getting will work with the major network improvements both carriers are set to deliver over the next few years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vdHYvMjAyMS8xMC9jdXJiLXlvdXItZW50aHVzaWFzbS13aXRoLWxhcnJ5LWRhdmlkLXJldHVybnMtZm9yLXNlYXNvbi0xMS1ob3ctdG8td2F0Y2gtd2l0aC1vci13aXRob3V0LWNhYmxlLmh0bWzSAZYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFzc2xpdmUuY29tL3R2LzIwMjEvMTAvY3VyYi15b3VyLWVudGh1c2lhc20td2l0aC1sYXJyeS1kYXZpZC1yZXR1cm5zLWZvci1zZWFzb24tMTEtaG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLXdpdGgtb3Itd2l0aG91dC1jYWJsZS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ with Larry David returns for Season 11: How to watch with or without cable,"“When the world needed him most he returned” writes a YouTube commenter on the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” Season 11 trailer.

The board granted a special exception to Telecom Capital Group based in Calvert County Md. on behalf of Ronnie Posey who owns the 18.4-acre parcel off State Route 206 on Hobson Lane. The “monopole” as it’s called is being built to hold Verizon antennas and will rent space to up to three more carriers.

Neighbors along the quiet road have been lobbying against the tower and accompanying storage building since March. Many of the 20-plus landowners on the lane and nearby residents signed a petition against the project and have appeared at four public hearings—two each by the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors—as the application was revised along the way.

In the end the supervisors who have the final say on special exceptions but often follow planners’ recommendations said they understood the concerns but had to consider the greater good.

“We have to kind of weigh a few people against what’s best for the entire county” said Supervisor Jeff Stonehill. “It’s not something I really like but it’s something that the county needs on that road.”

Supervisor Jeff Bueche whose district includes the affected area said he did not take health concerns of his constituents lightly. But he pointed that according to an engineer with the telecommunications group an individual cellphone generates up to 100 times more exposure to radio waves than a cell tower.

He also said the tower impacted “a greater swath” than those in the 2-mile radius around it. While he’s heard from many people in the immediate area of Weedonville who oppose the tower others who contacted him said they favor it Bueche said.

“We need this” he said. “It’s literally a dead zone in my district with connectivity.”

Those arguments did little to appease affected residents who worried about the impact to their health and well-being property values and quiet neighborhood. Lorraine Marsh a registered nurse noted that federal agencies monitoring exposure to radio waves haven’t updated their standards in decades. They tend to depend on private industry to do their own research leaving no one to look out for the people affected she said.

Several residents were concerned about the impact construction of the tower and 60-foot by 60-foot gray equipment compound next to it would have on vehicles and buses ambulances and fire trucks that use the road. The dead-end lane is only 17.5 feet wide residents said and having it closed because of construction traffic while the facility is being built “for even short periods of time is unacceptable” said resident Cheryl Green.

Tracy Themak the company’s lawyer assured the county it works with Virginia Department of Transportation officials on road issues.

“We cannot block access to peoples’ residences” she said. “They would shut us down immediately.”

In a letter to Sen. Mark Warner Hobson Lane resident Joan Farley said having a cellphone tower nearby would reduce property values between 10 percent and 20 percent—for a combined total loss of about $1 million for all homes impacted. Like others she asked the county to move the tower a mile west to American Legion Post 89 which had expressed interest in having the facility and the revenue.

But Themak the lawyer stressed that emergency personnel said a site was needed in the location—“not just in King George in general but here.”

She said that sometimes the company looks at schools or parks as possible sites because they’re centrally located. Themak said it can be difficult to find locations in residential areas because parcels usually aren’t large enough to meet the requirement of being at least 400 feet away from nearby homes.

“This is sort of the optimal situation” where nearby residents benefit Themak said as well as those working and traveling through the area. Every day about 10000 vehicles use Route 206 according to VDOT many headed from Fredericksburg and outlying counties to the Navy base at Dahlgren."

PayPal did not respond to multiple requests by Reuters for comment on the accusations and demands for Palestinian access to its services part of a campaign launched this month by Palestinian digital rights group 7amleh.

Local entrepreneurs say they have lost opportunities after foreign clients learned they could not use PayPal to receive money transfers a service the payments giant offers to Israeli bank account holders including settlers in the West Bank.

""With PayPal not operating in Palestine it's like another checkpoint that's stopping us from moving"" website designer Rafiq Hamawi said referring to Israeli checkpoints in West Bank territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

Hamawi said he lost a website design contract after a potential client in Australia asked to pay him using PayPal. ""Not all means of cutting people off from the world are physical"" he said.

While Palestinians can use other means to receive money from abroad - Apple Pay is available locally and Palestinian banks are part of SWIFT the global system for cross-border payments - PayPal is the world's leader in e-commerce payment processing according to the 7amleh group.

""Without the international brand recognition and versatility of PayPal Palestinians are still lacking the necessary access to financial markets to improve their economic situation"" it said in a report.

""It remains unclear as to why PayPal is reluctant to offer its services to Palestinians with bank accounts in the West Bank and Gaza as this could be a clear way for PayPal to support economic development and equality in Palestine.""

'Helping Hand'

Credit card companies like Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc  as well as money transfer firms like Western Union  have operated for years in the West Bank and Gaza where the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) exercises oversight.

The PMA is part of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank while the Islamist Hamas movement rules the besieged Gaza Strip.

The PMA has said it is taking steps to thwart fraud and money laundering in online payments. These include implementing recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force a global financial crimes watchdog.

In a statement to Reuters a PMA spokesperson hinted that PayPal's services could be made available to Palestinians in the near future.

""We trust that the coming few weeks will carry new news with regard to PayPal services in Palestine as a result of our collaboration with international interested parties.""

With unemployment hovering around 17% in the West Bank and 48% in Gaza many Palestinians have turned to freelancing online or launching local digital ventures to get by.

The founders of one such company online marketplace ""sook.ps"" say they have had to rely on risky cash-on-delivery payments because local electronic payment alternatives like the Ramallah-based service PalPay were too costly.

""We prepare and dispatch the parcel and unfortunately the customer can send it right back because they haven't paid for it in the first place"" one of the founders Samah Ayyad 24 told Reuters.

""PayPal was a small company which grew because the sky was the limit. We could also grow and become the number one online market in Palestine if they gave us a helping hand.""

Our top story this past week was about heartbreak and loss but also tremendous love. Before 6-year-old Aubriella Derosier passed away after a life-long battle with mitochondrial disease her parents Taunton Police Officer Jeremy Derosier and his wife Jamie helped her fulfill some of the wishes on her bucket list including throwing a fairytale wedding.

Other leading stories included a Taunton man being charged with COVID unemployment fraud a Taunton mom fighting for the state to help her autistic son and a Berkley motocross ""business"" being shut down.

And for reasons unclear to us a timeline of President Joe Biden's path from Scranton Pennsylvania to the White House.

These were the Top 5 stories of the past week according to Gazette readers:

'We vowed to be her parents forever'

The story that resonated most with readers this week was that of 6-year-old Aubriella Derosier. And how could it not? She died earlier this month after living with mitochondrial disease all of her short life. Although her life was so short it was filled with the love of her parents the rest of her family and many friends. Her parents Taunton Police Officer Jeremy Derosier and his wife Jamie lost their son Bryce (""Almighty Brycey"") to the same illness in 2018. They've faced their heartbreak with grit and determination filling their children's days with nothing but love. Before Aubriella passed away the Derosiers were going through her bucket list with her including throwing a fairytale wedding where they all took vows cementing their love as a family.

“We vowed to be her parents forever” Jeremy Derosier said.

Taunton man charged with COVID unemployment fraud

Feds say Clark Grant a Silver Street man lied on a mortgage application claiming as his own nearly half a million dollars that actually belonged to a racial justice charity. Prosecutors also allege that Grant scammed the unemployment system throughout the pandemic getting checks of $625 a week while he continued to work full-time. Emails and calls to Grant's court-appointed lawyer Julie-Ann Olson had not been returned as of this writing.

'I'm never giving up on my kids'

Lisa Smith is fighting to get her son Nick Watt back into special education support programs after he recently turned 22 and aged out. The laws and rules around special education are full of exceptions nuances and judgment calls. But in broad strokes Smith thinks Watt should get another year of education. The Taunton Public Schools disagree.

John Cabral superintendent of TPS said the district has followed all the state recommendations and guidelines around disruptions caused by the pandemic.

State Rep. Carmine Gentile has introduced a bill that aims to buy Watt and other students in the same predicament the time their families say they lost due to COVID.

""My sole purpose is to get Nick into a program"" Smith said. ""I'm never giving up on my kids.""

Berkley motocross 'business' shut down

After neighbors brought noise complaints to the Oct. 13 Berkley Board of Selectmen meeting a town motocross ""business"" has been issued a cease and desist. Selectmen said that noise complaints are a Board of Health issue; however because Michael and Angela Ricardo were charging people ""donations"" to use their race course the select board said that makes them a ""business"" and the board voted to issue the Ricardos a cease and desist order ""for any commercial operation"" at the address.

Angela Ricardo said they have tried to work with the neighbors since 2014 and have not tried to do anything to aggravate them but they do wish to use their property for the sport that they both enjoy.

Joe Biden: From Scranton to the White House

Sometimes some of our Top Stories come out of left field.

This past week a whole lot of Gazette readers were paying attention to this timeline of President Joe Biden's life from his early days in Scranton Pennsylvania all the way to him winning the 2020 presidential election.

Is it that there's a local election coming up? Is it because of the legislative bargaining happening in Washington D.C. at the moment? Or did a very specific set of people just want to read a whole lot about President Biden this week?

Who can say? Ours is not to reason but to report and for whatever reason we can report that this 2020 story somehow made the Top 5 this week!

N/A Campaign website electyourteam2021.com Why are you seeking elective office? I want to create a culture in Royal Oak when everyone’s view and input is respected. As a city commissioner I will make decisions I believe are in the best interest of the community we love and work tirelessly to make better. I want to promote our downtown – small business owners are the core of our local economy. Most importantly I want to build trust among our citizens. We should expect an open transparent and accountable leadership team for the city of Royal Oak and my intent is to foster that climate again.

The single most pressing issue facing our (board district etc.) is _______ and this is what I intend to do about it. When elected I intend to ensure citizens of Royal Oak are heard and their concerns are addressed through continual engagement. Our current commission does not listen to their constituents and I intend to set up a process in which we have all citizens an active part of the process of governing the city of Royal Oak. What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post? I am a small business owner who has chosen to locate in Royal Oak because I believe strongly in the fabric of our community. I think the current city commission needs to do a much better job in listening to residents and upholding the will of the people. As an elected official I will do my best to put voters first. I think we need more people who are invested in our community like me running for office. If you are a challenger in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)

As I mentioned I think our current commission could do a better job at listening to and heeding the will of voters. There is a significant lack of transparency with the current commission’s actions. Further the current commission works too hard to change existing laws and ordinances (such as our city’s current master plan) when no change is actually needed. I am tired of neighborhoods and small business owners being ignored in favor of large developers and large businesses who wanted to shape our community into something it shouldn’t be. I want to put our citizens first. How do you think local officials performed in responding to the coronavirus? What if anything would you have done differently? I commend the Oakland County Health Department and County Executive David Coulter for their consistent approach to the current health crisis. Oakland County has been a state leader in our response to COVID-19. My family and I are fully vaccinated and we believe in putting the science first. Our son is too young to yet be vaccinated and we do everything we can to limit his exposure and keep him safe. We are supporters of our local school district’s efforts to protect students. Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform. I am proud to be running with a group of independent thinkers who will be responsive to voters concerns and

Uphold the City Charter and all City laws/ordinances.

Focus on fiscal responsibility and transparency.

Work for residents local businesses and neighborhoods not special interests and/or for personal gain.

Protect single-family neighborhoods and green spaces.

Follow the City Master Plan.

Foster real citizen engagement. What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job? As a small business owner and the founder of a prominent law firm in Royal Oak my experiences are varied in terms of administrative work and customer engagement. I am grown my firm from a one-person shop to a thriving organization because I invest in people and utilize their talents. I am entrepreneurial and understand the necessary factors to grow our business sector specifically our downtown but love to engage people. I am a good listener and intend to focus on voters before making decisions that might impact them as a commissioner. The best advice ever shared with me was: A colleague once shared with me a perspective of working on a farm and applied it to her work life: Everyone working on the farm wants to drive the tractor but the stalls still be to be cleaned. It’s a constant reminder to me – as a leader – that even though I am generally responsible for the big responsibilities that come with being the head of a law firm I need to get off the tractor and work in the dirt with everyone else at George Law. That piece of advice really grounds me and helps to delegate responsibility while sharing tasks. I don’t ask anyone at my company to do something I am unwilling to do myself. What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?

How close to a large tree can I put in a new driveway without killing it? Will a gravel driveway do less harm than macadam?

What to do this week Keep harvesting vegetables such as potatoes rutabagas radishes and tomatoes if you still have them. This is the best time of year for making new garden beds and many other outdoor projects. Combine dividing perennials with planting spring bulbs in the same holes as they bloom at different times. We spurn the noisy and polluting leaf blower and instead lower our mower blades to an inch and a half and mow leaves directly into our lawn so they fertilize the grass roots naturally. Where leaves are deep we collect them into 3-foot piles and leave them to decompose for 15 months into 1-foot piles of sweet-smelling weed-free compost which is the best soil amendment and mulch that I know. To speed things up we mow the leaves first and add a shovel of soil rich in organisms. We add minimal fuel to the mower so we can idle it after its last run until the gas tank is empty when it’s time for winter storage.

A. The drip zone the outer edges of a tree’s leaves has been adopted by the International Society of Arboriculture as the guide for protecting trees during construction. Temporary fencing should be installed around the drip zone to prevent heavy equipment from driving over roots and crushing them while at work. Another formula for measuring the tree protection zone or TPZ is 1-foot distance for each inch diameter of its trunk according to certified arborist Todd Caswell of Natural Tree & Lawn Care of Avon. George Barth of Hartney Greymont Tree Service of Needham and Concord suggests using an air spade — a tube that blows soil away from roots — so they can be pruned by an arborist causing much less damage than having tree roots torn off by an excavator. Barth said even gravel driveways can be deadly typically involving 10 inches of excavation and a layer of sand packed down by heavy equipment beneath the gravel.

Most tree feeder roots live in the top 16 inches of soil. “The closer the driveway comes to trunks the greater the chance of killing the trees” said John DelRosso chief arborist of the Arnold Arboretum adding that damaged trees might take a couple of years to die or blow over.

Q. By last September I had hardly any blooms on my Heavenly Blue morning-glories so in frustration I cut the plants off at the base and within a few days they were blooming like crazy! I couldn’t tell you why — maybe shock. This year I decided to go with a different variety: a Harris variety called Ipomoea Grandpa Ott. They started blooming in June!

J.C. Berkley

A. Thanks! I heard from many morning-glory fans. Cutting back reluctant bloomers of all kinds is an old trick that sometimes works. Heavenly Blue is one of the slowest blooming varieties but the best blue in color. I am afraid our season is often too short for it so do keep experimenting with faster blooming varieties.

Q. Is it too late to propagate English ivy from cuttings? Mine a groundcover has had a growth spurt and I would love to cut a lot of it and use it in potting soil in containers to get a jump start for the spring. However I think I have run out of time.

A. Maybe but do you really want to? When questing ivy finds a vertical object it climbs. Universities have spent fortunes to have them removed from their hallowed walls because they can damage architectural brickwork. In fact I’ve concluded that most non-native vines are bad news be they ivy trumpet vine porcelain berry Asian honeysuckle bittersweet black swallowwort or even fall-blooming clematis. They are the sea serpents of the plant world. Stick them here and they snake along underground to pop up in your lawn over there. Pull them out and they resurface. This is the time of year when I clip stems near the base of invasive vines and immediately stick the fresh-cut end that is still attached to the ground into a bottle of glyphosate for a second to poison the roots without harming the unintended victims of spraying.

Walmart is recalling an aromatherapy room spray that contained a dangerous bacteria which can cause a fatal health condition the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday.

The retailer is recalling 3900 bottles of the Better Homes and Gardens-branded essential oil infused aromatherapy room spray with gemstones. The spray bottles could contain Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria which can cause a condition called Melioidosis.

According to the CPSC Melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose and can be fatal. Melioidosis is a rare but serious disease in the United States with about 12 cases reported annually according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC conducted tests on the product and investigated four confirmed cases of Melioidosis including two fatal cases in the United States. Though the source of these four infections has not been confirmed by CDC the CPSC said the bottle with the same type of bacteria was found in the home of one of the individuals who died.

Tests conducted by the CDC determined that a bottle of the Better Homes and Gardens-branded aromatherapy room spray sold at Walmart contained a rare and dangerous bacteria. Consumer Product Safety Commission

The $4 aromatherapy room spray was sold at about 55 Walmart stores nationwide and online at walmart.com from February 2021 through October 2021.

The recalled sprays come in the following scents: Lavender & Chamomile Lemon and Mandarin Lavender Peppermint Lime & Eucalyptus Sandalwood and Vanilla The bottles have “Better Homes and Gardens Aromatherapy” printed on the label on the front of the 5-ounce glass bottle.

“We are deeply concerned that there may be a connection between this product and this rare bacteria. Our sympathies and concerns are with the four families that have been impacted” Walmart said in a statement emailed to CNNBusiness.

The retailer said it has taken steps to prevent any further sales of the sprays both in its stores and online.

Consumers should stop using the recalled product immediately and are advised to not open the bottle or dispose of it themselves but to return it to Walmart (WMT) in a clear zip-top double bag for a full refund.

Consumers are also advised to seek medical care if they have used the product within the last 21 days and experience fever or other symptoms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL29jdC8yMy93YWxtYXJ0LWVtcGxveWVlcy10by1yZXR1cm4tdG8tb2ZmaWNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart employees to return to offices,"Walmart Inc. plans to start bringing its U.S.-based office workers back to their respective campuses early next month the company said Friday.

The two-in-one pod machine and drip coffee maker is down to $79 from its original $99 cost.

Considering a pod machine by itself will usually cost you around $100 and you're also getting drip functionality built in here you're getting an excellent price if you need a Keurig coffee maker that can offer both the convenience of a pod machine and the volume of a carafe. This is a less feature-rich device but the full K-Duo will cost you $169 at Amazon right now - nearly $100 more than this slightly stripped back model.

The cheaper version still allows you to brew from both pods and ground coffee however there's no timer programmability here you're losing the smaller 6-ounce K-cup size and dropping 'Strong Brew' settings. That means you're still getting plenty of functionality out of the significantly cheaper model just sacrificing a few of the fancier features that more casual users won't need.

Longtime fans for the most part are not pleased with the change.

“Nothing more magical than paying thousands of dollars for a vacation only to be nickel and dimed at every corner” wrote one fan on Disney’s Twitter feed. “I’m not seeing anything ‘magical’ at all” wrote another.

In recent years Disney had been unique among major theme parks in offering its skip-the-line program to all guests at no extra charge. Under the FastPass system all guests had the ability to reserve ride times on the parks’ popular attractions later in the day with a shorter line.

Other major theme parks including Cedar Point Universal and Six Flags properties all sell pricey go-to-the-front of the line passes.

Len Testa the president of TouringPlans.com and co-author of “The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World” said he’s never seen the Disney fan base so up in arms. “The reaction to paid FastPass has been received about as poorly as anything that Disney has done” he said.

The new program which launched on Tuesday has three main components – Genie Genie+ and Lightning Lane. It works like this:

* Genie: Every guest has access to the new Genie system a free tool available on the My Disney Experience app that is designed to help visitors better maximize their time in the parks by assisting with itineraries food ordering providing estimated wait times and more.

* Genie+: For $15 per person per day a guest can upgrade to Genie+ which allows visitors to access a special shorter “Lightning Lane” at dozens of popular rides bypassing longer stand-by queues. Participating rides include Peter Pan’s Flight Test Track Slinky Dog Dash and numerous others. This option however doesn’t include the parks’ most popular rides. (For the list: disneyworld.disney.go.com/genie/lightning-lane).

* More Lightning Lane options: On top of the Genie+ system there is a separate a la carte extra-cost program for the most popular rides. Guests can pay a one-time fee -- $8 to $15 depending on the day and the ride – to access a shorter line for the eight most popular rides (two in each park). These rides are Space Mountain and Seven Dwarfs Mine Ride in the Magic Kingdom; Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure and Frozen Ever After in Epcot; Mickey & Minnie’s Runaway Railway and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Disney’s Hollywood Studios; and Avatar Flight of Passage and Expedition Everest at Animal Kingdom. Guests can buy two of these passes per day and do not need to also purchase Genie+.

The cost of Genie+ plus two a la carte Lightning Lane passes will add as much as $45 per person per day to the cost of a trip – or nearly $200 per day for a family of four. That’s on top of admission to enter the park which is at least $110 per person per day.

And Testa said the Genie+ prices are certain to increase in the coming weeks and months as Disney gauges demand.

Dennis Speigel an industry consultant predicts that Disney guests will eventually accept the new system. He noted that FastPass though free wasn’t equally available to all as numerous rides ran out of FastPass spots early in the day rewarding guests who planned ahead.

The free part of the new Genie system – which is intended to help guests create itineraries to minimize wait times – is being closely watched by others in the industry said Speigel CEO of International Theme Park Services in Cincinnati. “The more they can communicate with the guests and direct them to help the flow and balance of the park the better it is for the guest and the better it is for the park” he said. “Eventually I think it’s a win-win.”

Despite early griping from Disney’s fan base both Speigel and Testa said there’s little doubt that visitors will buy the Lightning Lane passes.

What’s less clear is whether those purchases will result in additional revenue for Disney or will replace spending elsewhere in the parks.

“People may reallocate money rather than pay more” said Testa. “Maybe they don’t have a fancy dinner one night or they cut their vacation short by a day.”

The discontinuation of FastPass is just the most recent in a series of unpopular decisions made by Disney executives designed to improve the company’s bottom line.

Earlier this year Disney announced it would discontinue Magical Express the free bus system provided to and from Orlando International Airport to Disney resorts. The service will be eliminated starting in 2022.

Other unpopular changes include the reduction of extra hours at the parks for resort guests new fees for high-tech MagicBand bracelets that serve as room keys and admission tickets increased parking fees and more.

Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Chapek seems to be taking the brunt of the criticism from fans on social media.

Testa said Chapek who took over the top job in February 2020 just before the coronavirus pandemic shut down the industry was in a no-win situation – tasked with growing revenue when previous leaders picked off all the low-hanging fruit.

“They’ve increased ticket prices to about what people can stand” he said. Hotel prices have skyrocketed as well.

“There aren’t a lot of places they can raise revenue” he said. “There’s only so much you can charge for a hot dog until people will bring their own lunch.”

And there’s nothing quite like celebrating Halloween. This year I hosted a party that was themed to the dearly departed Mickey’s Halloween party. I made all sorts of Disneyland goodies for the party but one of the top hits was my copycat recipe of Carnation Cafe’s Baked Potato Soup. I can’t wait to share this recipe with you below!

My Mickey’s Main Street Halloween Party

After so much heartbreak last year with the parks closed for so long my friends and I have taken every opportunity to enjoy some Disney magic and even make our own when we can. For my party I decorated my yard like Main Street and had plenty of festive decorations.

I asked my guests to come dressed as their favorite Disney character or to wear their traditional Disneyland outfits.

The menu included items that you can get on Main Street such as fried chicken and Mickey waffles from Plaza Inn Baked Potato soup from Carnation Cafe (the same one you’ll be making at the end of the article!) and sandwiches and chips from Jolly Holiday.

The desserts were cake pops churro toffee pumpkin fudge and Mickey sugar cookies which can all be found at Candy Palace or Jolly Holiday.

One of my former Girl Scouts who is a barista at Starbucks made Pumpkin Spice Lattes and Cinderella Lattes for my guests. There was even fresh fruit to represent the fruit stand and bottles of Dasani water (just like Disneyland!). I got cafeteria-style trays from the Dollar Tree and made utensil packets for ease of dining.

I made the Mickey ghost lanterns from paper lanterns and fabric from the 99 cent store. I had a lounge area lots of pumpkins and made the floral arrangements myself.

My oldest son was dressed as a Photopass photographer and took guests’ photos in front of the inflatable Mickey pumpkin on my front lawn before they joined the party. It was truly a magical event!

Disneyland Carnation Cafe Baked Potato Soup Copycat Recipe

I hope that seeing my Mickey’s Main Street Halloween party has inspired you. And now onto one of the favorite dishes of the evening my copycat Carnation Cafe Baked Potato Soup!

Ingredients

4 potatoes scrubbed 8 bacon slices 4 tbsp unsalted 2 garlic cloves minced ¼ cup yellow onion 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups low fat milk 1 cup half and half 2 cups chicken stock 1 tsp kosher salt plus more to taste ½ tsp garlic salt plus more to taste ½ tsp black pepper 1 cup mild cheddar cheese 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese 1 cup sour cream fresh chopped chives for garnish



Instructions





Pierce the potatoes multiple times with a fork then microwave them for 12 to 15 minutes or until tender.* Carefully halve the potatoes and let cool. Once cool enough to handle remove the skins and cut into chunks.



Meanwhile cook the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool. Reserve up to 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat from the pan discarding the rest. Once the bacon has cooled crumble it into small pieces.



In a large pot melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the reserved bacon fat garlic and onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the onion is tender. Slowly whisk the flour into the pan and stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk and half-and-half. Keep whisking until smooth.



Gradually add the chicken stock. Bring to a light simmer and whisk in the kosher salt garlic salt and pepper. Keep at a light simmer until the mixture has thickened slightly 5 to 7 minutes.



If you’d like to use cheeses and bacon as a garnish reserve 1/4 cup of each. Stir in the remaining cheeses remaining bacon and the sour cream. Remove the pot from the heat. Scoop potato chunks into the pan breaking them into small pieces or leaving them chunky depending on your preference. Serve hot topped with your favorite garnishes like cheese bacon and chives. I served mine from a crockpot to keep the soup warm.



Notes

*If desired you can bake your potatoes in the oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and bake the potatoes directly on the rack for 45 minutes or until fork tender.

But did you know that before Burton blew Disney away with his fantastic filmmaking skills the company fired him?

In 1984 Burton was actually fired by Walt Disney Studios. The company originally took on Burton after seeing his short film Stalk of the Celery Monster as noted by Screenrant. But after his 1984 short film of Frankenweenie the company told Burton that the were going to “part ways”. It seems that the conversation between Burton and Disney was not so much a firing but just a conversation that stated the two were going in different directions. Interestingly enough in 2012 we would see Frankenweenie develop into a full-length feature directed by Burton and produced by the Walt Disney Company.

Disney producer Don Hahn noted that the company did not know what to do with Burton’s eerie style. It seems that at that time the two were not a good fit as Burton’s style was “too scary” after audiences proved to dislike Burton’s film The Black Cauldron. Having Frankenweenie another film of the similar genre and style come out that same year pushed Disney to have to separate from Burton.

As stated by Yahoo! Movies:

Back in 1984 Burton made a 30 minute live action short film about a boy who harnesses the power of science to resurrect his dead dog. Disney the studio who paid for the film immediately fired the director for wasting their money on a kid’s film that was too scary.

It seems that Burton enjoys having a “revolving door” policy with Disney as he has already been “let go” by the company five times since joining them after college. Now Burton’s style has become something that Disney audiences have grown to love and anticipate. Most recently Burton directed the live-action Dumbo for the Walt Disney Company. Burton is also known for iconic films such as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands!

Countless stories have been told about the place over the years and while there are numerous fantastical stories about Disney World that are entirely true there are just as many wild stories that are entirely inaccurate or nearly so at least.

As with most myths that get propagated many of these stories are based on a kernel of truth but that kernel has been embellished to the point that many of the stories now bear little resemblance to the truth. Here are few of the more entertaining but false myths about Disney World.

Cinderella’s Castle Comes Apart

One of the reasons that central Florida was chosen as the home for Disney World is that it has pretty nice weather all year round. This means the park can be open 365 days a year assuming there isn’t a global pandemic to cause its closure. But weather in Florida isn’t perfect and there is another reason that the park sometimes has to close: hurricanes.

Florida is hurricane country and sometimes Disney World has to close to weather the storm. It's the fact that hurricanes happen which has led to a myth that Cinderella’s Castle was actually designed to be easily disassembled during a hurricane so that the castle towers aren’t blown off in the storm. But if you’ve ever seen a crane hanging around the castle it’s only there to add or remove decorations not take it apart. The castle was designed to withstand hurricanes and the way that we know that is that it has.

Walt Disney Is Buried On Disney World Property

The longest running and most bizarre myth about Walt Disney is that the man had his body cryogenically frozen. However there are some versions of this story that take things a step further and claim Walt is actually buried somewhere at Disney World. Under Cinderella’s Castle seems to be a favorite spot for this story.

It’s not true. None of it is true. Walt is not frozen. If we can please kill one of these myths dead forever and for good can we please make everybody aware that Walt Disney is dead and buried in Southern California.

Trash Cans Never Need To Be Emptied

We know that keeping Disneyland clean was something that Walt Disney found very important. It was key that cast members clean up trash off the ground quickly so that other guests wouldn’t see it. The myth here is that when Disney World was built it took things even further by making it so cast members did not need to carry trash in the park. To do this the parks included a series of vacuum tubes and that when you throw a piece of trash in a trash can it gets whisked away via pneumatic tube that sucks the trash to where it can be disposed of away from the eyes of guests.

As cool as that sounds it’s not really practical. You could never move or add trash cans without also adding more tubing underground The truth is that trash is sucked away via tubes but the trash still needs to be moved from the trans cans to one of the collection points. From there the trash is sucked away every 20 minutes or so. Only Magic Kingdom has this system the rest of the Disney World parks handle things the old-fashioned way.

Walt Had An Apartment In The Castle

Let’s face it we’ve all looked at a Disney castle and thought that it would be awesome to just be able to stay there during our vacation rather than a hotel. That was going to be the plan for Walt Disney himself. He had a small apartment above the firehouse at Disneyland but was going to dial it up a notch with Disney World and get a suite in the castle.

Unfortunately Walt Disney died in 1966 before construction on Magic Kingdom would begin. The park wouldn't open until 1971 so there was no reason to build Walt’s suite. Decades later a “Dream Suite” was built inside the castle and given away as a prize for contest winners and other such things but that suite isn’t really the same thing as Walt’s because Walt’s never happened.

An Epcot Attraction Closed Due To A Sinkhole

Whenever an attraction closes at a Disney Park it seems like it automatically becomes the most popular attraction that ever existed and nobody wants it to go. Horizons at Epcot however was maybe what you’d call a “cult classic” attraction. It likely wasn’t a favorite of the average vacationer but for Epcot diehards it was something special and its loss is still felt strongly today.

With so many people in love with it it’s maybe no shock that rumors began to claim that the reason the ride was closing was not that it had run its course in the park but that the entire pavilion was over a massive sinkhole and the ride was simply no longer safe. It’s not the craziest idea since Disney World is built over a swamp after all but it isn’t true. There was no sinkhole that needed to be fixed to build MISSION: Space.

There Are No Mosquitos At Disney World

Maybe we're slightly to blame for this myth which I saw making the rounds very recently so we'll do our part to set the record straight. Regardless of what you may have heard there are in fact mosquitos at Disney World.

Walt Disney World was build on swamp land in Florida there's no way there would not mosquitos there. It is absolutely true that Disney World has a variety of different programs in place to try and reduce the mosquito population as much as possible so there are far fewer of the bugs on property than you might expect but that doesn't mean there are none of them.

In 50 years with the millions of people who have passed into Walt Disney World it’s the perfect place for rumors to spawn and be propagated. And there certainly are some wild and curious stories about the resort that are true but these are examples of stories that are not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL29ybGFuZG9pbmZvcm1lci5jb20vYmxvZy9oaG4tY3VydGFpbi1jYWxsLWRpc25leS1nZW5pZS1kZWJ1dC1hbmQtaG9saWRheXMtb24tZGVjay15b3VyLXdlZWtseS10aGVtZS1wYXJrLXJlY2FwLW9jdG9iZXItMTgtMTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HHN Curtain Call Disney Genie Debut and Holidays on Deck: Your Weekly Theme-Park Recap (October 18 - 14),"Here’s the Orlando theme-park news you need to know for the week of October 18 – 24.

1. It’s Not Goodbye It’s See You Later

As we turn the corner into this final week of October we say goodbye to spooky season and more painfully to another year of Halloween Horror Nights. This year was a big one for several reasons not the least of which was the fact that it had been two years since Universal Studios Florida hosted a full-scale HHN. On top of that this was an anniversary year which means that the houses and festivities were full of fan-service and easter eggs – just how we like them. If you still want to sneak in a visit to Halloween Horror Nights 2021 there’s time. HHN will run from Tuesday October 26 – Sunday October 31.

2. It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas

Does anyone else notice that Thanksgiving seems to just be…looked over? It’s hard being the middle child between Halloween and Christmas but there we are. At Universal Orlando Resort the holiday season is just around the corner officially kicking off on Saturday November 13 and running through Sunday January 2. Christmas decor can already be found in Port of Entry and Seuss Landing both at Universal’s Islands of Adventure.

3. We Dream of Genie

This week Disney Genie and Genie+ debuted on the MyDisneyExperience app (have you checked your updates?). Disney Genie is a free service designed to help guests better navigate their day at Disney parks. For a charge Disney Genie+ provides access to the Lightning Lane service which replaced the Fast Pass system.

Does it seem like a lot? Here are the bare bones:

Disney Genie

Free; includes wait times and itinerary planning

Disney Genie+

$15 day per person; includes access to Lightning Lane for certain attractions (not Individual Lightning Lane)

However another potential update is that the name of streaming platform HBO Max may be about to change with the reason being that a number of execs at WarnerMedia find the name confusing according to CNBC.

Reports indicate that an exec who left WarnerMedia last year said: ‘It sounds like ‘supersized’ HBO. I think it’s still unclear how it’s different from HBO unless you’re familiar with the product. It was a typical AT&T decision.’

The confusion was perhaps at its highest when HBO Max first launched as HBO Go and HBO Now were still in existence as platforms which exclusively carried HBO content. However now the services have been replaced by HBO Max.

Although HBO Max initially contained content which was primarily HBO programming there are now many titles which only have loose links with the HBO brand. For example The Other Two the Gossip Girl reboot and Titans did not start out their lives at HBO.

With Discovery originals potentially being added from channels such as HGTV Food Network and TLC once the mega deal is complete it’s clear the platform will become less and less associated with HBO – so a rebrand could be on the horizon. Watch this space.

Scraps leftover from a recent potluck. Old bread succumbing to time’s moldy consequences.

All these items labeled as “food waste” can join the yard trimmings in Monterey County residents’ green yard waste bins on Jan. 1 officials say. For those living in the area that means yesterday’s meal could become tomorrow’s compost through that forest-green can parked in your driveway.

This change stems from an overarching law former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. enacted in 2016 that set emission reduction targets for California. Diverting organic and food waste away from landfills could reduce methane gases wafting from the rotting materials according to CalRecycle which oversees the state’s recycling and waste management programs.

While this statewide law demands that jurisdictions provide residential collection services for all forms of organic waste Monterey County is starting strictly with the items you could find on your kitchen table.

Fruits vegetables bread rice cheese flowers eggshells — you can toss any of these items in your green cart after the New Year said Ted Terrasas the sustainability manager for the city of Monterey. Any liquids raw meats and paper plastic or cardboard items are not allowed at the moment.

Once this new medley of food and yard wastes is put to the curb haulers will make their rounds as usual to take the trash to its respective endpoints: either Salinas Valley Recycles or the Monterey Regional Waste Management District depending on where you live in the county. Then it will be composted.

Salinas Valley Recycles has planned for the eventual implementation of this new law for years now said Mandy Brooks the authority’s resource recovery manager. In 2017 the facility received a $1.3 million grant from CalReycle that funded a new composting facility and a machine that removes plastic packaging from produce items rolling into the landfill.

“​​We are ready to say to our residents ‘Yes please put in your food scraps’ because we have a place to take it now and we have the process to do it” Brooks said.

The Monterey Regional Waste Management District on the other hand has been composting since the late 1980s said Zoë Shoats the district’s director of communications. Its established on-site composting paired with its existing commercial food scraps program puts the facility in a good place with the new legislation she said. The goal is to create “pure streams” of compost by educating the community on what can and cannot go in the green containers.

“We’re kind of unique in this area because we’re in the salad bowl of the world where we have agriculture all around us” she said. “And so we want to make sure that we’re providing a non-contaminated stream.”

Last year the Monterey Regional Waste Management District took in 5000 tons of food scraps through their existing commercial collection Shoats said — a number that should rise with the addition of residential food waste. Once compost materializes from both waste management facilities it can find its way to local farmers businesses and homes the representatives said.

These two joint-power authorities which serve a combined 420000 residents are working together on their education outreach in Monterey County. This will include flyers social media campaigns and new labeling for the green carts Brooks said.

“So no matter where you live in the county — if you were to move to Seaside or King City — it would be a very similar program” she said.

Individual jurisdictions are also collaborating to educate residents about the new designation for old leftovers. There will be a grace period for consumers to re-learn their trash habits before citations are issued Terrasas said.

“I think a lot of it for the first bit is just going to be getting people up-to-date with the new requirements” he said “and doing some outreach and education or even site visits if necessary before we even get to enforcement.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYWNsdWIub3JnL21vdGhlci1sb2RlL21haWR1L2NvbXBvc3RpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Composting,"Climate Methane and Composting

It’s important that we take steps today to decrease heat trapping gas emissions so that we protect future generations from the harm of climate change. Did you know that if we decrease kitchen and food waste in landfills we can decrease methane a powerful heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere?

Methane acts like a heat-trapping blanket making up about 20% of greenhouse gases. When we send kitchen and food waste to the landfill bacteria and other soil organisms “eat” it using a process called decomposition. Methane is one of the waste products of bacteria. Methane has a warming potential about 25-36 times greater than carbon dioxide. It absorbs more energy than carbon dioxide. Methane stays in the atmosphere for a shorter amount of time about 12 years compared to over one hundred years for CO2. So decreasing methane emissions gives fast and powerful results in decreasing the amount of heat getting trapped in the atmosphere.

We still need to continue to decrease CO2 emissions by using less fossil fuels and planting and retaining long lived trees to remove CO2. Composting and decreasing the amount of food and kitchen waste in landfills is useful and important because decreasing methane emission will give faster results than just decreasing CO2 emissions alone. An added benefit is adding compost to soil increases the capacity of the soil to capture and sequester carbon by supporting plant and root growth.

Action - Keep Carbon Local

Advocate at the County level. Ask the Board of Supervisors to exempt community composters from exclusive franchise agreements permit farm compost cooperatives amend zoning laws and encourage best practices.

Vermiculture (Worm Composting)

Make a DIY worm bin and compost all of your plant-based kitchen waste. You can learn how to do this by attending a Master Gardener Composting class or use the educational materials on the Master Gardeners of El Dorado County Composting webpage.

Start a local community or farm composting cooperative. Read stories about the benefits and challenges in this document from the Sustainable Economies Law Center.

El Dorado County Resources

El Dorado County has a countywide plan developed and maintained by the El Dorado Solid Waste Advisory Committee (EDSWAC). EDSWAC was established by AB939 a state law passed in 1990 with the aim to divert 75% of waste away from landfills and to recycling compost reuse etc.

The plan was reviewed in 2015 and indicated several pilot programs for composting food waste in preparation for complying with AB1826 in 2016 a state law passed requiring businesses producing a certain amount of waste to separate their organic waste for collection and composting. The minimum amount of weekly waste produced in order for a business to be required to separate their organic waste is reduced as time passes and in 2022 all businesses that produce more than 2yd3/week will fall under the program’s requirements.

Mandatory Commercial Organics Recycling

MORe Brochure

Not yet included in the current plan but required to be incorporated soon (2022) is residential organic waste collection as part of SB1383 the Short-lived climate pollutants reduction bill. When food and yard waste ends up in the landfill it generates methane emissions (a short lived but potent climate pollutant) so diverting this waste to composting or digesters is a key element of the plan to reduce methane emissions. While not yet included in the plan the Environmental Services Joint Powers’ Authority (ESJPA) has made it a priority in their meetings over the last couple of years. Additionally El Dorado Disposal and South Tahoe Refuse were running pilot programs with different compostors (CleanWorld and Full Circle Compost respectively).

Senate Bill (SB) 1383 establishes a goal of reducing the volume of organic waste disposed in California landfills by 75% by 2025. The law covers a wide range of organic products including lawn and landscaping debris wood and lumber food food-soiled paper and other paper and cardboard products. Currently two thirds of this material is landfilled. As these items break down in landfills they create methane a powerful greenhouse gas which the state of California has identified as a factor in climate change.

By recycling more paper products and turning food scraps and yard waste into compost or renewable natural gas we can dramatically reduce methane emissions. In addition SB 1383 establishes a goal of increasing edible food recovery by 20% by 2025. The regulations specify that certain food-related businesses must donate the maximum amount of edible food they would otherwise dispose to food recovery organizations. Mandated food donors fall into two tiers with the larger food providers such as wholesale food vendors and supermarkets affected first. These Tier 1 food businesses will need to have donation programs in place by January 1 2022.

El Dorado Disposal is planning for programs that will help residents and businesses meet the goals of SB 1383.

In the meantime follow these simple tips:

• Recycle all clean dry paper and cardboard products.

• Keep lawn and landscaping debris separate from trash and recyclables.

• If you operate a business or manage a multi-family property ensure that you have both recycling and yard waste collection services in place.

• Donate edible food to food pantries and other food rescue agencies to feed the hungry rather than tossing it into the trash.

The Current Plan can be found here: https://www.edcgov.us/Government/emd/solidwaste/pages/swmplan.aspx

El Dorado County currently uses several different waste management companies in different areas of the county. Each Franchisee has information available on their specific programs. The county and the franchises it hires to manage the waste collection and disposal must accommodate the requirements of these state laws and are doing so in a variety of ways.

In addition to the collection requirements mandated by the state laws El Dorado County also has outreach and education programs for Home Composting. El Dorado Disposal has a home composting and vermiculture demonstration project at its Truck Street facility. They also offer composting classes on request - Email Education and Outreach Coordinator Kristina Noble at Kristinan@wasteconnections.com for more information (flyer pg 4).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL2pvdXJuYWxub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvd2lkb3ctb2YtbWFuLWtpbGxlZC1hdC1oYW5lcy1taWxsLXJvYWQtbGFuZGZpbGwtYW54aW91c2x5LWF3YWl0cy1vZmZpY2lhbC1hbnN3ZXJzL2FydGljbGVfYTQyMDcxZmUtMzQwMy0xMWVjLTkyZDQtNmY0YmQwOTZmMDVmLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Widow of man killed at Hanes Mill Road landfill anxiously awaits official answers,"Without really thinking about what she was doing Shirley Thompson rolled a half-empty water bottle between her hands as she weighed her words.

She was surrounded by shelves full of important-looking books with impossible titles and freshly polished wood in an attorney’s conference room.

Thompson 63 was nervous but determined to speak for — and about — her husband Tommy who was killed in a terrible incident early in the summer at the Hanes Mill Road landfill.

Nearly four months have passed as she’s waited patiently on the outcome of an investigation being conducted by the state Department of Labor that could provide answers to questions that have been piling up.

Government moves at a deliberate pace and investigations into workplace deaths can take six months or longer. Thompson realizes that but it doesn’t make the waiting any easier.

“I just want to know … there was so much negligence” Thompson said.

Steady reliable man

Tommy and Shirley Thompson were married for 46 years. They met and married young then raised their small family in Stokes County.

“We were just kids” she said.

She allowed herself a slight smile when describing themselves as homebodies who mostly kept to themselves. “Work home TV and church” she said.

Tommy Thompson worked for Waste Management for 31 years mostly driving roll-off trucks that you might see collecting trash in your neighborhood and for 10 years before that for BFI another private garbage company.

Married for 46 years and employed by the same company sure makes Tommy Thompson sound like a steady dependable guy.

“He didn’t like change that’s for sure” Shirley Thompson said.

Not much has been said officially about the circumstances surrounding Tommy’s death other than a few short paragraphs in a news release indicating that a 63-year-old man had been killed just before the landfill closed on June 11.

“He worked so much and he’d come home late a lot” Shirley Thompson said. “But I didn’t worry until it got past 7. Then I got to worrying.”

That Friday her worry turned into her worst fear when Thompson’s bosses came to her door. They didn’t waste any time on small talk or formalities. Just before 5 p.m. Tommy Thompson was crushed between a bulldozer operated by a city employee and a truck.

Rodney Burcham the father of the bulldozer operator — a friend of Tommy Thompson — confirmed that his son was driving it. Burcham was speaking on behalf of his son and the family.

He even showed her a video he’d shot — at the landfill that showed how bulldozers and roll-off trucks interact when the dozers push mountains of garbage from behind unloaded trucks.

“Yes sir I did (meet with her)” Burcham said. “Tommy was a friend of mine. A real good friend. It was absolutely one of the hardest things I ever had to do.”

Part of his reason for meeting with the still grieving widow he said was to try and provide her some answers and perhaps some peace of mind. And part of it no doubt surely was to defend his son like any father would and say that the fault lay with the operating plan and not his 21-year-old son.

Burcham told Shirley Thompson that a spotter — a city employee who acts as an extra set of eyes on the interplay between large trucks — had left early as it was late on a Friday afternoon. He also said machine operators at the time couldn’t communicate via radio.

“A lot of things that happened just don’t make sense” Burcham said.

Because the investigation is still open and a lawsuit possible city officials declined to comment. “Given that this is likely to be a litigation matter the city will (refrain) from commenting” wrote City Attorney Angela Carmon in an e-mail.

Oh and there was one other thing: Burcham told Shirley Thompson that his son who no longer is employed by the city was using a cell phone wired into a handsfree Bluetooth device.

“You asked if he was on the phone” Burcham said. “Yes he was. But it went through speakers and it was not in his hand. There was nothing stating he couldn’t do that around the job.”

All eyes on OSHA

The day Shirley Thompson sat down in a conference room the first piece of the investigative puzzle arrived: the official results of the autopsy.

“Blunt-force trauma” said attorney Stuart Teeter. “What we expected.”

Even that piece of information took longer than Shirley Thompson ever imagined. It did serve as a harsh reminder that the Labor Department’s occupational and safety division’s investigation remains ongoing and nothing else can happen until it concludes.

“The district attorney can’t do anything until it does” said Josh Simmons one of Teeter’s partners. “We want justice for Shirley. We think criminal charges might be warranted.”

Until that report is filed all Shirley Thompson can do is periodically check with her representatives. Six months is considered a quick turnaround.

In the meantime she’s pleased with the support offered to her by Waste Management. She keeps in her phone a copy of a video tribute made by high-ranking company officials in an annual message about safety.

“It was life-changing for Tommy’s family” a vice president said. “It’s a sober reminder that no matter how far we’ve come in terms of safety there’s more to do.”

Shirley Thompson also takes comfort in small things such as the fact that her husband was known for looking out for younger drivers.

“There’s really nothing he wouldn’t do for anybody” she said. “He’d swap trucks with (less experienced) drivers if theirs was older than the one he was in.”

As she waits Shirley Thompson also has to consider forgiveness. The hurt is raw and that remains something for the future. Another step along a winding road toward healing if such a thing is even possible after such a sudden and tragic loss.

“Forgive? Umm-mm. Not yet. It’s too soon” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vaHVtYW5nbGVtZWRpYS5jb20vaG93LWltcHJvcGVyLXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtY29udHJpYnV0ZXMtdG8tY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtY3Jpc2lzLWluLW5pZ2VyaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Improper Waste Management Contributes To Climate Change Crisis In Nigeria,"When lightning tore across the sky and claps of thunder followed Rasheedat Ajagbe instantly instructed her son to bring out waste from the house.

As darkness began to envelop the afternoon she poured the solid waste in the gutter hoping that rain would flush them away. Minutes later the atmosphere brightened and her hopes for rain were dashed.

Rasheedat sells corn in Badore Ajah area of Lagos Southwest Nigeria. She is one of many Nigerians who have developed the habit of improper waste disposal a development that has become a pressing environmental challenge faced in urban and rural areas of the country.

Lagos Government has on several occasions shutdown markets in the state for indiscriminate dumping of refuse and blocking of drainages. Despite efforts to ensure a hygienic environment many are still reckless when it comes to proper disposal.

From parties to restaurants and even stores Nigerians get either Pp or polythene bags to package their foodstuff and other relevant items.

After use the waste products are dropped on the streets and sometimes drainages leading to environmental contamination exacerbating climate change effects.

It worsens climate change

A 2018 report named Nigeria one of the 10 most vulnerable countries to climate change in the world. According to the Federal Ministry of Environment Nigeria generates one of the highest amounts of solid waste in Africa with 32 million tonnes per year. Most of these however end up in landfills sewers beaches and rivers.

Research has it that improper waste management does not only result in litter everywhere but also in air and sea pollution.

Nigeria’s total Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG) are 492.44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) totaling 1.01 percent of global GHG emissions.

Harmful greenhouse gases are created from decomposing waste. These rise up to the atmosphere and trap heat causing extreme weather reactions in the form of storms and typhoons.

“Carbon dioxide is a waste product and keeping this around without proper care is harmful to the environment” Rachael Anyawu executive director of CleanUp Nigeria a non-government organisation combating improper waste management said.

“Carbon-based particles released into the air as a result of poor waste management will simply result in warmer air and create disastrous greenhouse effects. Even the offensive odour that comes from improper waste disposal is enough to cause health hazards.”

Another effect of improper waste disposal is flooding which has rendered hundreds of persons homeless in urban and rural areas.

HumAngle earlier reported the bitter tales of victims of floods in various communities in Nigeria following the climate change crisis.

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said in 2019 that floods had displaced approximately 1.9 million Nigerians and the country that year recorded 158 fatalities. It said no fewer than 129000 persons were affected in 2020 and at least 69 lost their lives in flood disasters.

“As people recklessly dump their waste in the gutter they block drainages and put the lives of many at risk. When drainages are blocked there will be flooding and we all know how this sad development has continued to displace people from their homes” Rachael added.

“Landfills not the solution”

Landfills are sites designated for dumping rubbish garbage or other sorts of solid waste. They are the most common means of solid waste disposal which is either buried or left to pile in heaps.

While landfills are the current solution to waste management findings revealed that the disposal method also has negative effects on the environment.

“Most communities leave the landfills unattended to which cause land pollution and uncontrolled buildup of all sorts of solid waste materials. There are more than ten toxic gases emitted from landfills of which methane gas is the most serious.”

“Methane gas is naturally produced during the process of organic matter decay. The methane expelled during the decomposition of organic matter in unmanaged landfills has the potential of trapping solar radiation 20 times more effectively than carbon dioxide” part of a study conducted by Conserve Energy Future revealed.

“The outcome is increased urban and global temperatures. Aside from the methane gas other household and agricultural chemicals that find ways to the landfills like bleach and ammonia can generate toxic gases that can greatly impact the air quality within the landfill vicinity. Dust particularly matter and other non-chemical contaminants can also be expelled into the atmosphere further contributing to air quality issues” it further said.

Also the World Health Organisation (WHO) said the global warming potential of methane is 84 times higher than CO2.

“High levels of methane can reduce the amount of oxygen breathed from the air and can result in mood changes slurred speech vision problems memory loss changes in breathing and heart rate unconsciousness and other conditions depending on its severity” WHO said.

Way Forward

In his 2012 research for Kano University of Science and Technology (KUST) Aliyu Nabego said current approaches at mitigation and adaptation to climate change in Nigeria have focused on restricting emissions of greenhouse gases but there have been no impact due to lack of awareness.

He however suggested that “recycling activities can significantly reduce the amount of solid waste that generates harmful GHGs. The real challenge is to incorporate it into the formal waste management structure and to provide safer healthier working conditions than currently experienced by scavengers on uncontrolled dumpsites.”

Segun Adagunodo co-founder Recycling Hub told HumAngle that to attain the sustainable development goals three eight and 13 of United Nations Agenda 2030 which are to promote healthy living and well-being decent employment and take action against climate change and its impact respectively recycling must be taken seriously.

“We should amend our behaviour. Rather than dumping refuse recklessly or in landfills we should recycle. Wastes like polythene bags should be reused to avoid creating unnecessary waste. By doing so we could reduce the amount of waste ending up in landfills.

“Aside from polythene bags there are many other items that can be used more than a single time or better still choose durable materials that can be used numerous times instead.”

He cited England as an example saying “sales of single-use carrier bags have dropped by 95% in main supermarkets since introduction of 5p charge in 2015. 5p is a decimal five pence coin. It is a unit of currency equalling five one-hundredths of a pound sterling.”

According to data from the country’s Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) the average person in England now buys just four bags a year from the main supermarket retailers compared with 10 last year and 140 in 2014.

“There is poverty in the land and we cannot advocate for an extra fee for carrier bags in Nigeria. What we need is education and awareness across all communities irrespective of their social and economic condition” Segundo added.

Legal sports betting was limited to Nevada prior to the US Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling that struck down the federal ban. The landmark verdict gave states the right to dictate their own laws on sports betting.

Sports betting is now seemingly everywhere television commercials during pro and college sports flooded with spots from DraftKings FanDuel Caesars Sportsbook and BetMGM.

And as sports betting continues to gain new market access — and lure in more and more sports bettors — the world’s largest cruise line is making sure the action doesn’t stop once players board their ships.

Carnival Cruise Line announced in February that it planned to incorporate sports betting in its onboard casinos once sailing resumed post-COVID-19. That officially began last week as the first bet was wagered onboard the Majestic Princess.

Keeping Amenities Current

Carnival subsidiary Princess Cruises is the first cruise line to offer passengers sports betting upon entry into international waters. Princess is operating its sports gambling odds and lines through its Ocean Sportsbook.

The Ocean Sportsbook interactive platform was developed by UK-based Miomni Gaming. Sportradar provides the book with its odds through a satellite feed that reaches the ships sailing the high seas.

Being that sports betting is everywhere it only makes sense to give those folks that may enjoy gambling but don’t really enjoy sitting in the casino a chance to win big even at sea” John Maddox owner and operator of Travel by John a cruise booking service told TravelPulse.

Most Princess ships come with a Las Vegas-style casino that offers slot machines table games bingo and now sports betting. Passengers can also gamble for real money onboard on their mobile phones with the MedallionClass app.

The majority of travel experts told TravelPulse that incorporating sports betting into the cruising experience is a no-brainer.

“Adding any additional forms of entertainment for cruise passengers to enjoy is a plus for the industry” Cruise Vacations International’s Jeremy Hall opined. “I don’t see sports betting having any negative effect on passengers as it seems the wagers are placed either in the casino or on the app. Gambling and watching sports onboard are both staples for many cruise passengers so kudos for those who found a way to blend both together.”

Cruise Casino Regulations

Carnival Cruise Line and its Princess Cruises are both members of the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). As components of the world’s largest cruise industry trade group Carnival and Princess are required to regulate their ship casinos under the same regulatory standards the Nevada Gaming Control Board imposes on its land-based casinos.

CLIA inspects each member’s casinos annually to assure that the games are fair and regulatory conditions are being followed.

However when a patron has a dispute gamblers have few resources other than the on-ship casino manager. There is no outside governing authority that allows a customer to file a complaint.

The CLIA stresses that “gambling is strictly for the enjoyment of the passengers who choose to avail themselves of this form of entertainment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXN0b2wyNDcuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLWZlYXR1cmVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JyaXN0b2xzLWdob3N0LXNpZ25zLWEtZmFkZWQtcmVtaW5kZXItb2YtdGhlLXBhc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bristol's ghost signs: a faded reminder of the past,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bristol247.com/news-and-features/features/bristols-ghost-signs-a-faded-reminder-of-the-past/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXN0b2wyNDcuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLWZlYXR1cmVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JyaXN0b2xzLWdob3N0LXNpZ25zLWEtZmFkZWQtcmVtaW5kZXItb2YtdGhlLXBhc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

""The realities of things like... wage pressures... supply chain pressures... all these things are going to continue to contribute to this wage inflation that we're seeing"" Wells Fargo CEO and President Charles Scharf told Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer at the annual Milken Institute Global Conference.

Noting that supermarkets are already forecasting higher prices Scharf added that while ""that's all very very real ... all these things will level out. Supply chains will get solved I personally just think it's going to be six-to-12 months.""

Supply chain crisis' impact on smaller and medium-sized businesses to be monitored

As companies have begun introducing price increases on household products economists continue to debate whether the inflation that the U.S. economy is experiencing is transitory or not.

One of the factors pushing inflation higher is the supply chain fiasco the country is experiencing which has been affecting various goods. With many containers stranded at sea and trucking routes clogged experts anticipate that these problems will iron themselves out.

But they disagree on exactly when those pressures will ease.

Siemens USA CEO Barbara Humpton told Serwer at the Milken conference on Monday that her supply chain professionals are expecting disruptions through 2022.

Others predict an even longer time horizon for supply chain disruptions to abate.

""We expect... strained supply chains to last until the early parts of 2023"" Peter Sand chief shipping analyst at Copenhagen-based BIMCO a shipping trade group told Yahoo Finance in a previous interview. ""We are basically seeing a global all-but-breakdown of the supply chains from end-to-end.""

Scharf said at this stage he was also concerned about the ""evenness"" of how these problems will impact businesses and whether or not small- and medium-sized businesses would get outmaneuvered by larger businesses.

""When inventory levels get lower who's going to get the shipment versus who's not? Who's able to spend? Who's able to pay for the increase in wages?"" Scharf explained. ""It's something that we've got to watch and continue to figure out how we help them.""

Around 5:20 a.m. Wednesday Nelson Alexander Sr. 73 of Falls Church pulled up to the Wells Fargo along the 2900 block of Annandale Road. He exited his light-colored Jeep Cherokee and walked to the outdoor ATM machine. A short while later a masked male suspect approached Alexander and pointed a handgun at him.

Black and white surveillance video captured a startled Alexander dropping his wallet credit cards and other miscellaneous items which became strewn across the sidewalk. Alexander and the gunman moved out of frame before the gunman shot the 73-year-old in the chest. Police say Alexander wasn't found until an hour later when a bicyclist passed by and summoned help.

“Let me just say this Nelson did nothing wrong"" Major Edward O’Carroll who commands the Major Crimes Cyber and Forensics Bureau said during a Saturday evening press conference held in front of the ATM. “In the video you saw there’s no resistance. There’s no resistance at all. So that’s why this killer is Fairfax County’s public enemy number one.”

For the last three days Alexander struggled to survive at Inova Fairfax Hospital. He was pronounced dead at 12:51 p.m. Saturday.

“He fought for his life for 72 hours after that encounter"" O’Carroll noted. ""This case has now transitioned to a full-fledged murder investigation.""

Police do not believe the gunman walked away with any cash or other property. The case marks Fairfax County's 19th murder of 2021.

“I am confident that we will identify this young man but we do need the community’s help"" O’Carroll added. ""We’re going to work for justice.”

Family members tell 7News that Alexander was born in Fairfax County during the 1940s. He sang in the men's choir at Galloway United Methodist Church in Falls Church. He loved to hunt deer and rabbits attend his nieces and nephews' sporting events tinker with cars and was an avid Dallas Cowboys fan.

“He was a good kindhearted person. He’d give you the shirt right off his back"" said Steve Brown who met Alexander decades ago in elementary school. ""I’ve said this once and I’ll say it again if the guy had just come out and asked him for some money he would have given it to him.”

Alexander was a regular customer at Smitty's Unisex Barber Shop on Douglass Avenue in Falls Church. In fact his apartment is in the same brick building right around the corner from the barbershop. That's where 7News interviewed Brown Saturday night.

“It seemed to me that when the guy walked up behind [Nelson] and [Nelson] turned and the guy had the gun and asked him for the money it seemed like he was willing to give it to him anyway"" Brown who renovated Alexander's apartment bathroom a few months ago opined. ""It’s just hard to swallow. It really is.”

Loved ones say Alexander had been married for more than 50 years and had one child an adult son who is going to turn 53 next week. Alexander worked as a residential building engineer for many years but most recently drove for an auto parts store.

“I hope they find him. I really do"" Brown added.

Fairfax County Police made the decision to release two surveillance videos showing the moments that led up to the shooting. During Saturday's press conference authorities urged the public to review those video clips to see if they recognized the suspect who was wearing a distinctive backpack and athletic shoes.

“The young man who took Nelson’s life knows what he did. [He] knows who he is. And [he] knows we’re looking for him"" Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis remarked. ""Be a human. Be a person. Be a man. Turn yourself in.”

Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the masked suspect had an accomplice that remained off-camera. They also vow to remain open-minded if and when they make an arrest in the case.



“Surrender on your terms or be arrested on ours"" O’Carroll remarked with conviction. “Maybe something happened in the encounter that’s off-camera that you want to explain to detectives. We will listen to your story. You will enjoy a presumption of innocence but turn yourself in.”

Chief Davis — who called Alexander's murder an ""atrocious act"" — echoed O’Carroll's sentiment.



“We do want to hear his story but we need him off the street. This can’t happen again. This shouldn’t have happened to Nelson... [who] stopped by the ATM machine to get a few bucks on his way to work. That’s all he did and his life was taken because of it.”

Any residence or business with surveillance cameras near the Wells Fargo is asked to review them from the overnight hours of October 19 into the early morning hours of Oct. 20. Detectives believe the suspect may have been involved in other criminal activity during that time frame.

If you have any information — or if you believe you have surveillance footage that may be helpful — call the Fairfax County Major Crimes Bureau at 703-246-7800.

Night Swim Coffee is a merger between Charlotte’s Undercurrent Coffee and Not Just Coffee which have been serving up java in the Queen City since 2018 (Undercurrent) and 2011 (Not Just Coffee). James and Miracle Yoder of Not Just Coffee and Todd and Erin Huber of Undercurrent Coffee partnered to create the business.

The couples plan to open a total of four Night Swim Coffee cafes including one inside Night Swim’s soon-to-be roastery in Charlotte’s lower South End neighborhood. It is tentatively expected to open by early December James Yoder says. Night Swim Coffee’s next location will be on the ground floor of the Bank of America Tower at the Legacy Union site in downtown Charlotte he says.

“I can’t wait to see what the turnout from the Oakhurst neighborhood is” Yoder says. “I have so many friends who live in the area and so far we’ve continued to meet incredible people. Really glad to be a part and getting to know the area better.”

Undercurrent Coffee has sites in Plaza Midwood and Optimist Hall while there are six Not Just Coffee locations: 7th Street Packard Place Atherton Mill Providence Road Dilworth and Jay Street. Night Swim will be the official roaster for all Undercurrent and Not Just Coffee locations.

Until its own roastery is operating Not Just Coffee will continue serving coffee roasted by Durham-based Counter Culture Coffee and Undercurrent Coffee will keep Onyx Coffee Lab’s beans. The Hubers started their coffee business after Todd left an investment banking job at Wells Fargo. Yoder and his wife arrived in Charlotte in 2009 after working for a nonprofit in Italy. Since then he’s fulfilled a childhood dream of opening coffee shops. Collectively the businesses will employ about 100 people by the end of the year James Yoder says.

The Night Swim cafes will have a full-service coffee menu with rotating specialty drinks Yoder says. It will also offer several food menu items with a Mediterranean influence including avocado toast and focaccia sandwiches.

A maple cardamom latte is a featured fall specialty Yoder says. “Our food will be similar to what our customers have come to expect: fresh local ingredients using local farms and providers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxseXZvaWNlLmNvbS9zYXR1cmRheS1uaWdodC1saXZlLXNubC1ncml0dHktZmx5ZXJzLW1hc2NvdC1za2V0Y2gv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGhpbGx5dm9pY2UuY29tL3NhdHVyZGF5LW5pZ2h0LWxpdmUtc25sLWdyaXR0eS1mbHllcnMtbWFzY290LXNrZXRjaC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fake Gritty makes appearance during 'Saturday Night Live' sketch,"Gritty was busy Saturday night cheering on his beloved Flyers against the Florida Panthers at the Wells Fargo Center a game which the orange and black lost 4-2.

But a fake version of the Flyers mascot was featured during a sketch on ""Saturday Night Live"" this weekend.

The sketch titled ""Mellen"" featured former ""SNL"" cast member Jason Sudeikis playing a male version of Ellen DeGeneres and hosting a mock daytime television talk show for men at home.

The fake daytime television show is described as featuring ""hardcore masculine energy""— including lots of pranks ""sneak up surprises"" awkward male dancing and men getting into fights.

Among the show's pranks include Gritty busting into random women's bathrooms according to Sudeikis' character.

The sketch cuts to a mock version of the Flyers mascot sneaking into a women's bathroom. Gritty then forcibly kicks down a stall door showing a startled Chloe Fineman trying to use the bathroom.

""What the f*ck are you doing?!"" Fineman screams at Gritty as he sprints out of the bathroom.

Fineman then catches up to and tackles Gritty and starts beating up the Flyers mascot in the hallway.

Gritty has had his fair share of appearances and jokes on the sketch comedy show over the last three years. The Flyers mascot appeared during the ""Murdur Durdur"" sketch from earlier this year.

Gritty was also made fun of several times on ""Weekend Update"" in early 2020 after the Flyers mascot was accused of punching a 13-year-old boy in the back. We'll certainly see more Gritty jokes on ""Saturday Night Live"" in the future.

This weekend's episode also featured a sketch mocking both the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776 and the plot of the 2004 film ""National Treasure."" The sketch showed the Founding Fathers debating over whether they should put a secret treasure map on the back of the historical document.

The ""Ted Lasso"" star Sudeikis was the guest host of this weekend's episode. Brandi Carlile was the musical guest.

In that article I listed nine equity REITs (eREITs) for dividend investors to consider in light of the drubbing that eREIT valuations have recently taken due to fear of rising interest rates and to capitalize on the pass-through provision for REIT income included in the new tax legislation.

ValueWalk readers can click here to instantly access an exclusive $100 discount on Sure Dividend’s premium online course Invest Like The Best which contains a case-study-based investigation of how 6 of the world’s best investors beat the market over time.

Both of these topics are covered in some detail in the previous article. This article provides a more complete investment thesis for Welltower Inc. (HCN) one of the nine eREITs highlighted in the previous article.

Welltower Inc.

Welltower is one of the larger healthcare eREITs in the US with an enterprise value of roughly $33B and more than 1330 healthcare properties/assets consisting primarily of Senior Housing Developments located in the US the United Kingdom and Canada as well as Post Acute Care Facilities located in the US. HCN has very little exposure to Medicaid and/or Medicare payment structures with roughly 93% of its revenues generated through operators relying on private pay or private insurance reimbursement for senior housing and healthcare services.

Welltower maintains a strong balance sheet with conservative use of debt and carries a BBB+ credit rating. The chart below shows four critical metrics for HCN’s balance sheet.

The bottom three metrics are particularly important as they show that HCN’s net debt including preferred stock issues is manageable with respect to EBITDA and the interest on debt and preferred dividend payments (fixed charges) is well covered by EBITDA. These are the metrics that are important to maintaining an investment grade credit rating and allows HCN to issue more debt for growth acquisitions at favorable (i.e. low) rates.

Welltower’s continuing growth strategy is focused on projected demand growth in senior housing and post acute medical care (short and long term). Senior housing (independent and assisted living) demand is projected to grow at roughly 8% per year over the next 20 years.

Source: Welltower Investor Site

Many seniors will need to move from independent living to assisted living to skilled nursing or memory care as they age. Welltower’s investment strategy encompasses the demand for that level of continuous managed care. Welltower’s existing developments and future investments are focused on high per capita income areas of the US the UK and Canada.

Outpatient and post acute care demand is also expected to grow significantly over the next 30 years as the baby boom generation ages. The chart below shows the projected growth in outpatient services in just the next 9 years.

Source: Welltower Investor Site

As we boomers age the demand for medical services and outpatient procedures will grow significantly and HCN’s growth strategy includes the post acute care facilities that will be needed to support the expected transition from inpatient to outpatient procedures. This transition from inpatient to outpatient procedures followed by post acute care has shown to be significantly more cost effective than the traditional inpatient hospital stays and it is the direction that both private insurers and the government (Medicare and Medicaid) is moving.

Welltower’s Recent Financial Performance

Had you made a $10000 investment in HCN ten years ago and reinvested all dividends today you would have roughly $23500. The chart below shows that growth in value compared to the growth of all US REITs.

Source: Morningstar

Welltower’s early performance was interrupted by the 2008/2009 recession where the value dropped to roughly $7500 after the first year. The nine year performance of an initial $10000 investment in February 2009 would have the investor holding a bit more than $33500 today.

Welltower like all REITs shares its financial performance with investors primarily through its dividend distributions. REITs must distribute 90% of their of their taxable income to shareholders to maintain their REIT status. Today HCN’s annual dividend is $3.48 per share for a yield of 6.27% as of February 9 2018. Readers should note that the recently passed tax reform legislation contained a new pass-through provision exempting 20% of income of REITs and partnerships from Federal income tax. That means that investors will only pay tax on $2.78 (80% of $3.48) of HCN’s dividend distribution.

The dividend is well covered by HCN’s cash flow. Funds from operations (FFO) for 2017 is expect to be $4.22 (range midpoint) providing a dividend to FFO payout ratio of 0.82. Anything less than 90% payout for a REIT is considered acceptable.

HCN Investment Thesis

With the general market currently experiencing a mini-correction and eREIT valuations suffering further from fear of rising interest rates why would I be considering an investment in HCN at this time? Today HCN is on sale having fallen nearly 19% while at the same reporting stellar 3Q17 financials. While the market has pushed eREIT valuations down over the last quarter and particularly the past two weeks due to fears of rising rates history tells us that eREITs generally do well during periods of slowly rising rates and some eREITs will even beat the big market indexes under these conditions. For a more complete discussion of the impact of rising rates on REIT financial performance as well as a more detail on the new pass-through provision readers should see my earlier article “Consider Equity REITs for Your Next Investment“.

The other significant driver for healthcare eREITs in general and HCN in particular is the shift in our age demographics here in the US. Today we have roughly 8M citizens over the age of 85. Due to the benefit of medical advances and increases in longevity by 2050 we will have more than 20M citizens over the age of 85. That is a 2.5 fold increase over 30 years. Another metric to consider is that we have currently 10000 baby boomers retiring every day. Readers can find a more detailed discussion of our aging demographics here. The chart below shows the estimated growth of various segments of our aging population between 2000 and 2050.

This will be very significant for companies providing services and housing specifically to accommodate the needs of our senior citizens. Welltower will have a long term growing client base for the services of their senior housing and post acute care facilities.

Final Thoughts

Welltower is a large well established and well run healthcare eREIT with a solid balance sheet and a long history of growth through economic contractions as well as expansions. Recent investor jitters over rising interest rates has pushed HCN’s stock price into bargain territory and its dividend yield up to just under 6.27%.

The partnership and REIT pass-through provision in the recently passed tax legislation will shield 20% of HCN’s dividend from Federal income taxes. Our aging demographics essentially ensures a growing client base for HCNs buildings and facilities over the next 30 years. Welltower should provide many years of healthy dividends and capital appreciation to today’s investors.

Much like the 980 our SSD today is a 1TB SSD that is DRAM-less and hits over 3GB/s read and write with a price point of just over a hundred bucks. Direct competition…oh ya. Coupled with the demographic of DRAM-less haters that just stopped reading this article with the mention of that word… DRAM-less. Get ready though…. this SSD is no slouch.

Let’s start things along by saying that the name WD Blue SN570 is not really fitting for this SSD as it has nothing whatsoever in common with its predecessor the SN550. Both are DRAM-less and this fact alone has always been a conversation in itself. Should one ever consider a DRAM-less SSD for their own use? And that is EXACTLY the point that needs to be considered…ones own use. In one respect we will guarantee this SSD will be a hit because of performance and value and that the majority of people won’t give a second thought to it being DRAM-less. That success has also been seen with the Samsung 980.

But that has always been the case. The typical user would never know the difference between a DRAM-less SSD and any other in their typical PC use pattern. In fact even experts could never tell the difference in typical user scenarios. Would we be recommending this for high end media developers? No. Absolutely not. But we guarantee that this single-sided single chip single controller SSD will be finding itself in places that previous DRAM-less SSDs (other than the 980) never have. It is just that good and we think many will find this report very refreshing as it shows an SSD from both the value and performance perspective.

The WD Blue SN570 is a single-sided M.2 2280 (80mm) form factor PCIe 3.0 SSD that contains a WD/SanDisk proprietary SSD controller and a single NAND chip. This NAND chip is a 1TB chip the only on the device and we are going to take a leap and ‘suggest’ that this SSD contains the newest BiCS 5 3D TLC 112-layer NAND flash memory available today.

Performance for our 1TB sample is listed at 3500MB/s read and 3000MB/s write with up to 460K read and 450K write IOPS. The SN570 comes in capacities of 250GB 500GB and 1TB and performance drops significantly with respect to write throughput as far as 1200MB/s write for the 250GB version in fact.

Endurance is as one might expect for as DRAM-less SSD at 150TBW (250GB) 300TBW (500GB) and 600TBW (1TB) with up to 1 million hours MTBF and a five year warranty. MSRP pricing is $49.99 (250GB) $59.99 (500GB) and $109.99 for the 1TB version we are testing today. Check Amazon now.

Lots to see here. We have a 250GB SSD where the write throughput drops from 3000MB/s to 1200MB/s. We have a 500GB version that is only $10 more that almost doubles that throughput and we have a 1TB SSD that hits at or above 3GB/s read and write throughput for just over $100.

PayPal did not respond to multiple requests by Reuters for comment on the accusations and demands for Palestinian access to its services part of a campaign launched this month by Palestinian digital rights group 7amleh.

Local entrepreneurs say they have lost opportunities after foreign clients learned they could not use PayPal to receive money transfers a service the payments giant offers to Israeli bank account holders including settlers in the West Bank.

""With PayPal not operating in Palestine it's like another checkpoint that's stopping us from moving"" website designer Rafiq Hamawi said referring to Israeli checkpoints in West Bank territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

Hamawi said he lost a website design contract after a potential client in Australia asked to pay him using PayPal. ""Not all means of cutting people off from the world are physical"" he said.

While Palestinians can use other means to receive money from abroad - Apple Pay is available locally and Palestinian banks are part of SWIFT the global system for cross-border payments - PayPal is the world's leader in e-commerce payment processing according to the 7amleh group.

""Without the international brand recognition and versatility of PayPal Palestinians are still lacking the necessary access to financial markets to improve their economic situation"" it said in a report.

""It remains unclear as to why PayPal is reluctant to offer its services to Palestinians with bank accounts in the West Bank and Gaza as this could be a clear way for PayPal to support economic development and equality in Palestine.""

'Helping Hand'

Credit card companies like Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc  as well as money transfer firms like Western Union  have operated for years in the West Bank and Gaza where the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) exercises oversight.

The PMA is part of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank while the Islamist Hamas movement rules the besieged Gaza Strip.

The PMA has said it is taking steps to thwart fraud and money laundering in online payments. These include implementing recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force a global financial crimes watchdog.

In a statement to Reuters a PMA spokesperson hinted that PayPal's services could be made available to Palestinians in the near future.

""We trust that the coming few weeks will carry new news with regard to PayPal services in Palestine as a result of our collaboration with international interested parties.""

With unemployment hovering around 17% in the West Bank and 48% in Gaza many Palestinians have turned to freelancing online or launching local digital ventures to get by.

The founders of one such company online marketplace ""sook.ps"" say they have had to rely on risky cash-on-delivery payments because local electronic payment alternatives like the Ramallah-based service PalPay were too costly.

""We prepare and dispatch the parcel and unfortunately the customer can send it right back because they haven't paid for it in the first place"" one of the founders Samah Ayyad 24 told Reuters.

""PayPal was a small company which grew because the sky was the limit. We could also grow and become the number one online market in Palestine if they gave us a helping hand.""

And though fans are heartbroken about the situation they are here for how Kanye handled it.

Life as a celebrity can be glamorous but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. With all the perks come drawbacks one of which is the constant onslaught of photographers. Naturally stars as famous as Kanye West and the Kardashians know this. It’s stressful enough for adult stars to endure people snapping photos all the time so imagine when the scenario involves children of celebs.

Recently Kanye West stepped in to protect North his daughter with Kim Kardashian West from a photographer. And though fans are heartbroken about the situation they are here for how Kanye handled it.

How does Kanye West usually handle media attention?

Kanye West is one of the most famous people in Hollywood so it makes sense to assume he is used to the attention. Still many celebrities have voiced their concerns about photographers who follow them everywhere and often invade their privacy.

So what has West said in the past about the swarms of photogs that watch his every move?

According to Inquisitr he usually shows them his not-so-nice side and has even bodyslammed a photographer once or twice.

Though West has described the paparazzi as “intrusive” and even raised his voice at them one occasion went differently.

He and then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian were enjoying a trip to Paris when photographers were incessantly snapping photos.

Instead of getting angry West noted “I like how you guys move out here. You’ve got total respect for yourselves have respect for the people that you’re photographing.”

He thanked them for not being as aggressive as the paparazzi in California and added “I understand that you have to make a living. So I appreciate [the respectfulness].”

But on another occasion West had to stop a photographer who got too close to North.

In some ways celebrities are like us especially when it comes to their children. Fans recently took to social media to discuss what happened when West protected his oldest daughter North from a photographer.

A video posted to YouTube shows West and his daughter at one of West’s Sunday services. While North plays with another girl on a grassy hill a paparazzo quickly approaches.

West immediately jumps in to stop the photographer as the man squats to snap North’s picture.

Reddit users reacted with comments like “Ew. Why would that guy even get that close?? Yuck” and “Aw this breaks my heart. It was all so innocent. North was just dancing with her friend. Leave her be.”

Commenters agreed that West did the right thing and they loved how quickly he intervened.

Are Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West’s kids photographed often?

Because of their parents’ fame Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West’s children are used to being in the spotlight. So now that they’re growing older do photographers follow them more? According to Bustle yes.

Although Kanye West didn’t like how close the paparazzo got to North at that Sunday service many photographers snap the children’s photos from a distance.

Although North seems to be used to the attention she has shut photographers down on occasion proving that having a camera pointed at her is a regular occurrence.

Kanye West isn’t the only celebrity who has shielded his kids from the paparazzi and most stars agree they would do anything to protect their children.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4uZGlnaXRhbC9uZXdzL2hvdy10aGUtd2VzdC1tYWRlLXRoZS1tb3N0LWRhbmdlcm91cy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLXB1dGluLW4yODU1NTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the West made the most dangerous version of Putin,"""This became more acute after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and is why you now see a Russia more comfortable with putting troops on international borders spreading disinformation and going after political dissidents.

Years of dysfunction compounded by the logistical challenges of restarting in-person classes amid the pandemic and a nationwide driver shortage have pushed transportation conditions in the city to a record low according to families and school bus watchdogs.

“The busing situation in this city is cataclysmic” said Amaranta Viera the mother of a first-grader with autism who was without a bus for nearly a month after classes started on Sept. 13.

Leslianne Saavedra 9 and her mother Monica Roman in the Bronx.

Some students legally entitled to school buses because of disabilities still have not been assigned a route. Others have a route but no driver matron or paraprofessional to pick them up. And some kids whose buses do show up are facing erratic pickups or hours-long rides according to experiences shared with The Daily News.

“The problems are boiling over this year with kids missing not just hours but days and weeks of school” said Sara Catalinotto the head of the advocacy group Parents to Improve School Transportation.

Top city officials have refused to acknowledge a school bus staffing shortage despite clear statements from the city’s largest school bus operators and school bus workers union saying otherwise.

DOE officials said there are roughly 550 students who still need bus routes a slight increase over the approximately 500 kids without routes at this time in 2019 and 2018 but still a small fraction of the 150000 total kids who take school buses. Officials claimed all kids who were registered by the first day of classes now have a route.

But advocates say the number and severity of complaints pouring in this year are noticeably greater than in years past.

Catalinotto said she heard from eight families just last week who still don’t have a school bus and 15 since the beginning of the year compared to zero and three such complaints in 2019 and 2018. Another parent advocate who began compiling bus grievances at the beginning of the year got 58 hits with half complaining of a no-show bus. The city’s Panel for Education Policy solicited bus complaints from parents for a recent meeting and got roughly 60 emails in three days.

“Typically by now the bus issues would die down a lot but not this year” said Lori Podvesker the policy director of the special education advocacy group INCLUDEnyc and a member of the Panel for Education Policy.

The DOE also pointed to a 63% reduction in the number of calls to the Office of Pupil Transportation hotline compared with fall 2019 from roughly 6400 calls per day in 2019 to 2400 calls per day this year.

But parents say calling the OPT’s hotline is a lesson in futility because they either can’t get through or are directed to contact their schools or bus companies — discouraging them from trying again.

Crystal Carambot and her son Lyam Carambot 8 in the Bronx on Saturday Oct. 23.

“You wait over an hour and then they hang up on you. They re-route you and tell you that [calling] the school is the only option” said Bronx mother Monica Roman who described the experience as “a disaster.”

Roman’s fourth-grade daughter Leslianne Saavedra still doesn’t have bus service turning what should be a simple eight-block trip to school into a hellish ordeal for the 9-year-old.

Leslianne suffers from achondroplasia — a form of dwarfism that can make walking up stairs and hills painful. She has received school bus service every year since kindergarten as legally mandated in her special-education plan.

This year she has been forced to walk to school with a neighbor because her mother works an early shift and can’t take her to class.

“It takes us 30 to 40 minutes because of the hill. When she’s taking the stairs she complains her knees hurt” said Crystal Carambot who takes Leslianne to school with her own child a third-grader.

On days when it’s too cold or raining Roman pays for an Uber — an expense the single mom says is becoming untenable.

From left: Crystal and Lyam Carambot and Monica Roman and her daughter Leslianne Saavedra.

The DOE offers a courtesy cab service for families with missing school buses but Roman said no one has reached out to her about the taxi service and she still doesn’t know how to access it.

“I’m trying hard to not miss school” Roman said. “She (Leslianne) keeps asking me ‘When am I going to take the bus where’s the bus?'”

One Brooklyn principal who spoke on the condition of anonymity said “OPT has zero reporting mechanism” adding that schools often feel like they’re banging their heads against a wall trying to solve transportation issues outside their control.

The Department of Education says it added staff to the OPT hotline last week and maintains that schools can lodge complaints on behalf of parents.

“We’re working closely with families bus companies and schools to ensure a safe and efficient transportation experience for all students — anything less is unacceptable” said DOE spokeswoman Jenna Lyle.

Viera said it took nearly a month for her son to get a bus because the company didn’t have a driver to staff his route.

As a result she incurred more than $1000 in Uber fares before learning about the DOE’s courtesy cab service — a system she described as error-ridden and inconsistent. And trying to lodge a complaint is “Kafkaesque” she said.

After weeks of badgering high-level DOE officials Viera said she got a driver — but her son now spends nearly two hours each way on the bus.

The Department of Education said it is “looking for efficiencies” on Viera’s son’s route. “We apologize to anyone experiencing these issues and are quickly reaching out to address their concerns and reimburse any out-of-pocket expenses as quickly as possible” added Lyle the DOE spokeswoman.

A school bus is seen with its stop sign open and flashing lights in downtown Manhattan in March 2020.

A Brooklyn mother who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described a daily guessing game of when — or if — the bus assigned to her autistic twins would show up.

“They keep on having different drivers every day” she explained. “There’s times my kids weren’t picked up because they didn’t have a driver … It’s just like a school bus nightmare.”

DOE officials say they’ve made some temporary adjustments like allowing drivers to “double up” on routes or add more students.

State and federal officials have made some moves to address the staffing woes with Gov. Hochul rolling out a program to improve recruitment and licensing for drivers and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand asking federal Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to give districts more guidance on how to use federal relief funds to hire drivers.

Michael Cordiello the president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1181 the largest union representing school bus workers said hiring is moving at a snail’s pace and estimated that they have signed up about 12 new members in the face of a staffing shortage he places at 200 or more.

DOE officials also point to the city’s ongoing takeover of Reliant the largest school bus company as a path forward.

But transportation advocates say that DOE officials need to acknowledge the scale of the current problems before they can fix them.

“We want … for them to stop gaslighting everyone that there’s no crisis” said Catalinotto.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzEwLzIzL3dhbnQtMTAwLWluLW1vbnRobHktZGl2aWRlbmQtaW5jb21lLWludmVzdC0xNTEwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want $100 in Monthly Dividend Income? Invest $15100 in These High-Yield Stocks,"These supercharged income stocks offer an average yield of 7.97%!

There's no one-size-fits-all moneymaking strategy on Wall Street. Over time we've watched growth and value investors thrive. But if there's been one near-constant it's the outperformance of dividend stocks over the long run.

Although the data is now nine years old a report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management a division of JPMorgan Chase highlights the undeniable potential of dividend stocks to make people rich over time.

In 2013 J.P. Morgan Asset Management compared the performance of public companies that initiated and grew their payouts between 1972 and 2012 to public companies that didn't offer a dividend over the same stretch. The result? Dividend-paying companies averaged an annual return of 9.5% over four decades which handily surpassed the meager 1.6% annual return for non-dividend-paying stocks over 40 years.

Since dividend stocks are usually profitable on a recurring basis have clear long-term outlooks and are time-tested they're often a smart place for investors to put their money to work in any economic environment.

The big dilemma that income investors face is deciding how to safely maximize the yield they'll receive while minimizing risk. Given that risk and yield tend to be correlated when yields hit 4% and above this is easier said than done.

The good news is that there are high-quality dividend stocks that have a track record of delivering for their shareholders. In fact some of these income stocks provide a monthly payout. If you're the impatient type who demands the regular gratification of dividend payments the following trio of high-yield stocks could be the answer. With an average yield of 7.97% an investment of $15100 divided evenly among these stocks would produce $100 in monthly dividend income.

AGNC Investment Corp: 8.73% yield

For income seekers wanting to maximize their monthly payout mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC 0.21%) appears to be the top choice.

Mortgage REITs like AGNC borrow money at short-term lending rates and use this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets such as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). The goal for mortgage REITs is to maximize their net interest margin which describes the difference between the average yield on long-term assets minus the average borrowing rate.

The great thing about mortgage REITs like AGNC is that there aren't many surprises. These are companies that ebb and flow with interest rates and their movements are often highly predictable. Generally a flattening yield curve (a situation where the yield difference between short- and long-term Treasury bonds narrows) and/or a Federal Reserve that's making big changes to its monetary policy are headwinds for companies like AGNC. Conversely a steepening yield curve with slow-walked monetary policy changes tends to be a positive for the mortgage REIT industry.

Looking back decades the early years of an economic recovery almost exclusively demonstrate a steepening yield curve and generally dovish monetary policy. In other words it's AGNC's time to shine.

Something else income investors will appreciate is the company's focus on agency MBSs. An agency asset is backed by the federal government in the event of a default. As of June 30 $85.5 billion of the company's $87.5 billion investment portfolio was comprised of agency securities. While this added protection does weigh down long-term yields it also allows the company to lever its investments to boost its profit potential.

AGNC has averaged a double-digit dividend yield in 11 of the past 12 years making it a premier income stock among monthly dividend payers.

PennantPark Floating Rate Capital: 8.57% yield

For something completely under the radar income investors seeking high-yield monthly dividends should consider buying PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (PFLT 0.35%). PennantPark is outlaying $0.095 monthly which is a payout it's held since March 2015.

PennantPark is a business development company that primarily focuses on first-lien secured debts and to a lesser degree common equity investments such as preferred stock. However instead of providing financing for well-known businesses PennantPark is predominantly a first-lien holder in smaller-capitalization private businesses that might otherwise not have the financing options available from banks that larger companies can receive.

Why focus on middle-market companies? The simple answer is yield. With fewer available financing options PennantPark is able to secure average debt yields north of 7% which is what fuels the company's supercharged dividend.

What's more virtually all of PennantPark's companies are making good on their obligations. As of June the company's investment portfolio consisted of 100 companies of which only two were on non-accrual (i.e. 90 days delinquent on their payments). This is a small percentage of its portfolio considering the company is focused on smaller-cap (i.e. less established) companies.

Arguably the best aspect of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital is as the name suggests its variable-rate loans. As of the end of June 98% of its debt portfolio consisted of variable-rate instruments. With interest rates having nowhere to go but up PennantPark's lenders are going to be paying more to the company in the years to come.

LTC Properties: 6.62% yield

A third monthly dividend stock that can deliver sustainable outsized payouts is skilled nursing and senior care REIT LTC Properties (LTC -0.09%). LTC has the ""lowest"" yield on this list at 6.6%. But to put this into perspective LTC's yield is nearly quintuple that of the broad-based S&P 500.

Without sugarcoating things LTC and its peers had a rough 2020 and start to the current year. The coronavirus pandemic brought admissions to skilled nursing facilities and senior housing to a crawl which in turn led to some level of rental delinquencies from LTC's rental base. In particular Senior Care Centers a key renter from LTC filed for bankruptcy protection and didn't make its rental payments in the second quarter.

Yet in spite of these issues LTC's dividend hasn't been cut and its overall business has quickly bounced back. Excluding Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle the company collected nearly 94% of its rent and mortgage interest income in the second quarter. With vaccination rates ticking higher especially among the elderly population and skilled nursing facility workers the prospect of returning to business as usual is somewhat in sight.

Furthermore LTC Properties' diversity has been a boost. The company holds first-lien mortgages on close to 180 properties in 27 states and more importantly has 30 lease operators. With only four of its 30 operators leasing more than nine properties as of June LTC has ensured that its business won't be turned on its head by a single operator's struggles.

Lastly the company should also benefit immensely from the aging of America. As baby boomers age demand for senior housing and skilled nursing is only bound to increase which will put the proverbial ball and rental pricing power in LTC's court.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5kZW1vY3JhY3kubmV0L2VuL2ZyZWVkb20tb2YtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24vYnAtcGFpZC1leC1taTYtc3B5LWZpcm0tdG8tc25vb3Atb24tZ3JlZW4tY2FtcGFpZ25lcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BP paid ex-MI6 spy firm to snoop on green campaigners,"The oil company also retained the services of Welund a controversial spy firm to provide regular email updates about Garrard. This continued between at least July 2019 and January of this year and included details about his social media activity.

Welund – the trading name for Papea Ltd – keeps details of its work closely guarded but it has established a reputation for teaching the oil industry how to understand “the activist threat”.

According to its website Welund works to “monitor the threats posed by international and domestic campaign groups” and its client list is reported to include many of the world’s biggest oil and gas firms.

Welund faced criticism last year when it was revealed to have signed a £12000 year-long contract providing intelligence about activists to London’s City Hall.

Reports say that one of the company’s senior officials has described the green movement as an “existential threat” to the oil and gas industry.

Today a BP spokesperson admitted: ""We have used the risk consultancy Welund to monitor and review material in the public domain such as social media posts that could help us manage these and other risks.""

None of the intelligence gathered about Garrard suggested he was engaged in physical protest or disruption. Instead the musicologist prefers to focus on research and peaceful campaigning.

The director of Big Brother Watch Silkie Carlo said the surveillance of Garrard was “extremely intrusive shocking and wholly unacceptable”.

“This is an appalling totally unjustified case of political spying” she said. “The Information Commissioner’s Office should investigate Welund and all involved in the targeting of this campaigner and ensure he has a route to redress.”

The role of BP in the surveillance of activists comes amid the oil giant’s attempt to rebrand as a more environmentally friendly business. Its CEO Bernard Looney has pledged to “help the world get to net zero” with the aim of being “recognised as a leader for transparency of reporting”.

Philip Evans oil and gas transition campaigner for Greenpeace UK said: “Reports of this kind of surveillance are disturbing and show a completely warped set of priorities.

“Universities cultural institutions – and most importantly fossil fuel companies – should immediately stop wasting time and money on greenwashing and monitoring activists and instead throw all their efforts into tackling the climate crisis.”

Welund told Garrard that it holds ""no personal data"" about him claiming that it only retains personal data on staff and clients. But emails from BP show the spy firm was sending regular updates which named specifically Garrard.

British Museum memos

Last year Garrard sent a number of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to the British Museum about its relationship with BP.

Internal emails show how these were flagged by museum staff and shared across multiple departments describing him as “an anti-BP activist”.

Transparency campaigners say that this goes against Freedom of Information guidelines which say that requests should be dealt with “applicant blind” regardless of who they are from.

Conservative MP David Davis told openDemocracy that the British Museum “must ensure requests remain applicant blind”.

“The British Museum is publicly funded and should adhere to the Freedom of Information Act principles” he said.

“If they do not follow public rules then it must be questioned whether they should get public money.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9kdC5jby5uei9ydXJhbC1saWZlL2RhaXJ5L2NlbnRyYWwtb3RhZ28tZmFybXMtc29sZC1uei1jb3Jwb3JhdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Central Otago farms sold to NZ corporate,"Six Central Otago dairy farms will be sold for $61.4 million to an NZX-listed corporate farming company.

Yesterday afternoon New Zealand Rural Land Company (NZRL) announced to the market that it had entered into an unconditional agreement with Dairy Farms Partnership (DFP) to buy its dairy asset portfolio across 3500ha.

NZRL has signed a short-term agreement to lease the properties back to the vendor until May 31 2022 to allow it to finish off the current dairy season.

From June 1 2022 the properties would be leased to WHL Capital Ltd for an initial term of 10 years with two 10-year rights of renewal.

According to the Companies Office website WHL Capital Ltd was jointly owned by Katie Williams of Timaru and Patrick Mason of Pleasant Point.

NZRL said WHL Capital owned operated or was associated with 18 farms throughout the South Island.

The six farms have averaged more than 2.4 million kilograms per year since 2017.

About 70% of the farms were covered by centre pivot irrigation with a 1100000cum dam.

The transaction would be financed using a combination of cash on hand and an extended debt facility.

In May 2021 NZRL established a $65million revolving credit facility with Rabobank and the bank had agreed to extend that to $88.5million for the transaction.

Settlement of the transaction would see NZRL temporarily exceed its internal debt policy of 30% of total assets.

NZRL said it was comfortable with that position in the near-term given the immediacy of cashflows from this acquisition NZRL’s resulting diversification of tenants and the quality large-scale assets this transaction provided.

However NZL will comply with its loan to value ratio (LVR) covenant with Rabobank of 40%.

Yesterday's announcement was NZRL's second major purchase of South Island farms this year.

In April it bought 14 South Canterbury and North Otago farms following the receivership of high-profile dairy group Van Leeuwen Group (VGL) for $114 million.

After the latest purchase has settled NZRL will own 10800ha of dairy farms in the South Island.

When contacted yesterday NZRL director Christopher Swasbrook declined to give information on who the vendor was.

The transaction was an attractive purchase in a productive area he said

NZRL has been granted a waiver by NZ RegCo from being required to obtain shareholder approval for the transaction.

Yesterday afternoon NZRL’s share price closed at $1.12 a share.

The sale is expected to settle on November 10.

ESG might be the talk of the town in the rest of the world but Asia's asset owners are still playing catch up with 46% saying they were either not considering putting an ESG policy statement in place or were still undecided according to a new report.

As a result of this low level of policy activity in the region just 11% of investor funds were being put into ESG assets or related products according to the latest Willis Towers Watson ESG Beliefs and Practices Survey 2021.

The survey collected feedback from 63 asset owners in Asia in the first half of this year of which 50% had an asset size of more than $1 billion. About half of them were based in Japan with the rest in Hong Kong Korea Singapore Taiwan and other Southeast Asian countries.

Noting that the creation of internal ESG objectives or policies was the first step towards ESG investment it found 26% of asset owners in Asia did not have a public ESG policy statement in place nor were they considering having one.

A further 20% said they were still not sure about it. An ESG statement refers to a written statement outlining ESG policies or beliefs at an institution and is often linked to existing investment policies.

BEST PRACTICE

“It is not a requirement to have [such statement] but it is a best practice. Asia could be slower to adopt. But there are also plenty of western funds that have not yet done anything on this front” noted Jayne Bok head of investments Asia with Willis Towers Watson.

In Asia risk management is a primary driver of ESG integration the report noted.

“However Asia Pacific is a large and diverse region with asset owners across the region having a range of drivers and motivations” said Helena Fung head of sustainable investment APAC at FTSE Russell.

“Asset owners that are linked to government entities can become another source of sensitivity” Fung added.

“Concerns over greenwashing the lack of transparency and data around sustainable investing combined with the lack of consistency in definitions data and methodologies have made sustainable investing somewhat challenging for most institutional investors” said Angus Hui head of credits for Asia at Schroders.

COLLECTIVE EFFORTS

This has highlighted the urgency for Asian countries to draft ESG and climate-related regulations on data disclosure and reporting requirements the report said.

According to the Willis Towers Watson survey 41% of asset owners said they were not held accountable by stakeholders for reporting on ESG issues above and beyond financial reports.

“Regulatory pressure is expected to alter such a balance [in the future]” the report said. In Hong Kong disclosures as recommended by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) will be mandatory for listed companies banks asset managers insurance companies and pension trustees by 2025.

There were also similar discussions in Korea Japan and Singapore on whether to make ESG or climate disclosures mandatory the report noted.

On a positive note however 31% of these asset owners already had ESG policies in place and had made them public with the rest either planning to (10%) or considering doing so (13%).

The report said that it was now acknowledged by the industry that bigger asset owners should take a leading role in educating and assisting smaller market players in their home countries to incorporate ESG considerations into their portfolios.

At a recent international ESG conference held in Seoul two of the biggest public asset owners in Korea the Korea Investment Corporation and the National Pension Service both pledged to enhance ESG strategies internally as well as promote ESG awareness in their home market through greater engagement with domestic institutional investors.

Similar strides were also being made in Japan with the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) - as well as large life insurance companies such as Nippon Life Insurance Sumitomo Life and Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance - being active in establishing memberships at major global initiatives such as the United Nations-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sotheby’s auction was held on Saturday at the Bellagio hotel and casino in Las Vegas where the works had been on display for years and took place two days before the 140th birthday of the Spanish artist on 25 October.

The Bellagio has always been renowned for its art and five of the paintings had hung on the walls of its fine dining restaurant which is called Picasso. The restaurant will continue to display 12 other Picasso works.

The highest price was fetched by the 1938 painting Femme au Béret Rouge-Orange which depicts Picasso’s lover and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter. It sold for $40.5m about $10m over the pre-sale estimate.

The large-scale portraits Homme et Enfant and Buste d’Homme sold for $24.4m and $9.5m respectively while smaller works on ceramic such as Le Dejeuner sur l’herbe which sold for $2.1m went for three or four times their pre-sale estimate.

The buyers’ names were not disclosed.

Saturday’s sale was part of a bid by casino and hotel group MGM Resorts to further diversify its vast collection to include more art from women people of colour and emerging nations as well as from LGBTQ artists and artists with disabilities.

American museums and art galleries have been working to broaden their collections following the widespread cultural reckoning in 2020 over racism at all levels of US society.

The works included nine paintings and two ceramic pieces spanning from 1917 to 1938 and had previously been on display at the Bellagio Gallery of fine arts for the last 20 years until MGM decided to sell them earlier this year.

Saturday’s auction which lasted just 45 minutes was the first hosted by Sotheby’s in North America outside of its New York City location. About 150 people attended.

The most expensive work was the 1938 painting “Femme au béret rouge-orange” [“Woman in a reddish-orange hat”] which is a portrait of Picasso’s muse Marie-Thérèse Walter.

The piece fetched $40.5 million dollars following a tense bidding battle much higher than the $20-30 million expected.

The painting was last sold at auction in the 1980s for $900000 before casino developer Steve Wynn acquired it in 1998. It became MGM Resort’s when the company purchased Wynn’s resort The Mirage.

Other pieces included two Cubist still-lifes Picasso painted during a period of isolation in Paris during WWII “Nature morte aux fleurs et au compotier” and “Nature morte au panier de fruits et aux fleurs” selling for $8.3 million and $16.6 million respectively.

Eleven Pablo Picasso artworks have been sold for a combined $109 million in a Las Vegas auction coinciding with the artist's 140th birthday.

The nine paintings and two ceramic pieces had been displayed inside the Picasso restaurant at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art for more than two decades until owner MGM Resorts decided earlier this year to sell them.

The Saturday event was organized by Sotheby's and marked the first time the famed auction house staged an evening marquee sale in North America outside its New York saleroom. It featured Picasso artworks from 1917 to 1969.

Auction officials said Picasso's 1938 portrait of his muse Marie-Thérèse Walter entitled ""Femme au béret rouge-orange"" (""Woman in a reddish-orange hat"") sold for $40.5 million after a bidding battle well above estimates of $20 million to $30 million.

The painting last sold at auction in the 1980s for around $900000 and was acquired by casino mogul Steve Wynn in 1998 and became MGM Resorts' property when the company purchased The Mirage resort from Wynn.

The Picasso auction also featured two Cubist-inspired still life paintings from the early 1940s during World War II with ""Nature morte au panier de fruits et aux fleurs"" selling for $16.6 million and ""Nature morte aux fleurs et au compotier"" going for $8.3 million.

""Homme et enfant"" a 1959 work that is nearly two meters tall sold for $24.4 million.

Picasso lived from 1881 until 1973 and spent much of his adult life in France.

Over the course of more than 70 years as a working artist Picasso is said to have created more than 13000 paintings."

And for good reason.

Ahead of his NHL debut last week Duhaime stepped on a puck during the customary rookie lap and went tumbling onto the ice. Though he managed to quickly pop up before any of his teammates emerged from the tunnel Duhaime eventually owned up to his mishap prompting a good amount of ribbing on the bench.

Unfortunately for Duhaime he gave his teammates more ammunition over the weekend. Fortunately for Duhaime he scored the first goal of his NHL career in the process.

Early in Saturday’s game against the Anaheim Ducks at Xcel Energy Center the 24-year-old Duhaime had his stick knocked out of his hands while battling for position in front of the net. He instinctively reached down to pick it up and as luck would have it ended up putting the puck in the back of the net.

With his skate. Without even knowing it.

“Yeah” Duhaime said with a laugh. “The stick got knocked out of my hands and then turned around and the puck was in my feet going in the net.”

How did it happen? Well as Duhaime reached down to pick up his stick center Nico Sturm fired a shot that deflected wide of the net. Or it would have if Duhaime’s skate wasn’t in the right place at the right time.

“I think I blacked out” Duhaime said. “Just looked in the net and it was there. Then everyone started coming to me.”

While it will go down as a milestone moment for Duhaime it certainly won’t go down as the prettiest goal of his career. Maybe the literal opposite.

“It’s the ugliest first goal I’ve ever seen” coach Dean Evason said.

“They are only going to get prettier from here” center Ryan Hartman added.

Not surprisingly Duhaime was a good sport about it. It helped that the Wild walked away with a 4-3 overtime win.

“They don’t ask how. They just asked how many” Duhaime said. “Obviously I would have liked to go coast to coast and score my first goal. But I’ll take that.”

More important for Duhaime he’s making an impact night in and night out playing alongside Sturm and opposite Nick Bjugstad. That explains why Evason has continued to play that line in every situation without hesitation.

“You have to do the things in order to build that trust and he has” Evason said. “That line was good. We didn’t get them as much as we should and that’s on me. It’s on us to get them involved a little more.”

Like many he's encouraged by the progress made in safety and cleanliness in the nearby Downtown Improvement District.

So much so that he and other Lowertown residents are exploring forming their own Residential Improvement District to boost after-hours security and community in their neighborhood.

""I think [the Downtown Improvement District] is a great thing"" said Thomforde former president of St. Olaf College. ""But a Lowertown residential district would give people who own housing their own voice for their own priorities.""

After years of discussion a group of downtown St. Paul property owners now pay into a special improvement district that funds a public safety communications center neighborhood ambassadors and other amenities in an area that encompasses many artistic cultural and entertainment venues as well as corporate headquarters for Ecolab Securian Financial and Travelers. Business owners in the district are expected to pay about $1.2 million toward improvements next year.

City and business officials credit the district and the street teams it pays for with putting a dent in downtown crime as well as spiffing up parks and properties. It's no panacea however. Money raised by the district goes to services that are additional to what the city provides. And after a recent mass shooting near Xcel Energy Center some downtown business owners say the city is not doing enough to ensure the safety of workers and visitors.

John Mannillo a commercial real estate developer and longtime Lowertown champion said downtown's surge in residents over the past decade — especially in Lowertown — makes it even more important to consider an improvement district focused on the unique needs of residents. Proponents are tapping about $300000 left over from the Lowertown Future Fund which was dedicated to helping foster development there.

There are approximately 4300 Lowertown property owners Mannillo said.

Proponents have completed a feasibility study in which Lowertown residents were surveyed and expressed support for an improvement district — provided they have a say in what their assessments pay for. The next step is to hire someone to shepherd the idea through the statutory and approval process Mannillo said.

State law details the formation of business improvement districts although there appears to be no prohibition of residential districts.

""We will hire someone to push this. We're talking to people now"" he said. ""We could start some of the benefits right away. Our plan is to use what we have right now to improve Lowertown.""

Joe Spencer president of the St. Paul Downtown Alliance said there is interest in a residential district for Lowertown. But he said he thinks residents should give the business-driven development district more time to ripen before potentially siphoning away support by launching an effort of their own.

""I think it makes the most sense for us to think about our downtown being one downtown"" Spencer said. ""These services are really valued by all members of the community. However we grow these kinds of things we should do it in a way that is unified and coordinated.""

City Council Member Rebecca Noecker who represents downtown said she has talked to Mannillo and others about the idea. But she said she would rather residents and downtown businesses work together to find common ground than launch separate efforts.

""We don't want to splinter the message"" she said. ""Coordination is almost always more efficient.""

She wondered if there are ways the existing downtown improvement district could be more inclusive of residents' concerns.

""The question would be what are the specific services that residents need that commercial properties don't?"" Noecker said.

But Mannillo said residents don't trust business leaders to adequately address their unique concerns.

""For years whenever there is an issue downtown it's been decided by what the commercial owners want. [Residents] don't have a political voice"" he said. ""We want to complement the [Downtown Improvement District]. We don't want to compete with them or hurt them in any way.""

Merritt Clapp-Smith a consultant and former city planner who produced the residential district feasibility study said the needs of downtown's residents are increasing as the area's population grows.

Lowertown residents want parks to be more than a place to have lunch during the workday she said. They want safe spaces where children can play pickup games where they can walk their dogs or fire up the grill.

They also want to connect with their neighbors to hold block events or coffee meetups and small evening gatherings. And they want more emphasis on security but with empathy for the unique challenges of people who are homeless or grappling with mental illness.

""A Residential Improvement District for downtown St. Paul is an exciting and important opportunity that should be given open and thoughtful consideration"" Clapp-Smith said.

At the end of the day said Lowertown resident Thomforde what residents want and what businesses want differ on one important point: ""I'm still here after 5 p.m.""
