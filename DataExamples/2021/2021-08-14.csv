Minus the usual jabs between the teams typical of a title battle this season had all been contested with a relatively healthy level of respect – until Silverstone that was.

In Northamptonshire that inevitable first major flashpoint arrived when title contenders Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen collided on the opening lap sending Verstappen out of the race.

Red Bull were served with a heavy repair bill to get the RB16B back in working order and another followed at the next round in Hungary this time triggered by the other Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas.

The Finn slammed into the back of Lando Norris at Turn 1 a crash which ended up taking Red Bull’s Sergio Perez out of the race while Verstappen’s car also suffered heavy damage in the shunt.

Hamilton earned a 10-second time penalty for the events of Silverstone while Bottas carries a five-place grid drop into the Belgian Grand Prix.

But Marko believes those punishments compared to some of the others that have been handed out show a review of the system is needed.

“Until the last two races the first half of the season was positive then everything came together in a negative way” Marko told Motorsport-Magazin.

“As a result we have to ask ourselves whether the penalty system is justified after two errors by Mercedes. Maybe there should be different standards [levels of penalties].

“Antonio Giovinazzi gets a stop-go penalty after speeding in the pit lane and Sebastian Vettel is disqualified for not having enough fuel in his tank while the 0.3 litres that was in his tank would have been enough for control [a fuel sample].

“On the other hand we have two broken engines due to [the actions of] Mercedes drivers and that means that we have to take a hard hit financially. We have three million damages and that’s an amount we can’t easily find anymore.

“Such things can be the decisive factor in the title fight.

“That is why we need to look at it differently and whether the drivers who caused it have been negligent and whether something can be arranged.

“For example that this damage does not count in the budget cap or that we can use some kind of joker.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA4L2FyZS1uOTUtbWFza3Mtd2l0aC12YWx2ZXMtc2FmZS1mb3ItY292aWQtMTktcHJvdGVjdGlvbi5odG1s0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmouY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDgvYXJlLW45NS1tYXNrcy13aXRoLXZhbHZlcy1zYWZlLWZvci1jb3ZpZC0xOS1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are N95 masks with valves safe for COVID-19 protection?,"The Delta variant has become the dominant strain of COVID now accounting for more than 93% of all cases in the U.S. mostly among the unvaccinated population.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its mask guidance last month. The agency now recommends people in areas with “high” or “substantial” COVID-19 transmission should again wear masks indoors. Nearly two-thirds of counties in the U.S. have high or substantial transmission according to CDC data including all 21 in New Jersey.

But are N95 face masks with valves safe for COVID-19 protection?

Yes the CDC says an N95 mask with a valve protects you and others from COVID-19.

“A NIOSH-approved N95 filtering face piece respirator with an exhalation valve offers the same protection to the wearer as one that does not have a valve” according to the CDC. “As source control findings from NIOSH research suggest that even without covering the valve N95 respirators with exhalation valves provide the same or better source control than surgical masks procedure masks cloth masks or fabric coverings.”

An N95 mask “is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles” according to the FDA. Fit testing also is recommended to ensure a secure fit.

N95 masks were once difficult to find since they were in high-demand at the start of the pandemic leading customers to shop for KN95 masks. But now plenty of N95 masks are now currently available.

KN95 masks are a cheaper alternative to N95 masks as long as they “meet requirements similar to those set by CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for respirators” according to the CDC.

Several reputable merchants specialize in NIOSH-certified N95 and KN95 mask sales with reasonably fast shipping notably companies like N95 Medical Supplies N95MaskCo and Well Before.

Abbott Challenges Mask Mandate,"DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) - A Texas appeals court has sided with Dallas County after Gov. Greg Abbott filed a petition to ""strike down"" Judge Clay Jenkins' mask mandate.

Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton challenged the mask mandate after Jenkins signed an executive order on Wednesday. Jenkins said the continuing surge of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations led to his decision to require masks inside schools and businesses.

Abbott said the Dallas County mandate violated his executive order that banned mask mandates. Abbott and Paxton cited the Texas Disaster Act as reason for challenging the mandate saying it ""clearly states that the Governor has the power to guide the state through emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.""

However the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Dallas decided to deny the governor's petition saying in part: ""In particular applying the plain language of the Texas Disaster Act we conclude Judge Jenkins demonstrated a probable right to relief that the Governor's power to suspend certain laws and rules under section 418.016(a) does not include the power to suspend the Act's grant of authority to mayors and county judges to declare local disasters under section 418.108.""

""Today the Court of Appeals ruled against @GovAbbott request for an emergency stay of Judge Tonya Parker's order earlier this week. We should all be together;Team Human v Virus. I'll keep following the doctor's advise and work with anyone to beat #COVID19"" Jenkins tweeted.

A district court judge in Dallas County had also issued a temporary restraining order late Tuesday evening on Abbott's executive order.

Paxton tweeted late Friday evening that he will be taking the case to the Texas Supreme Court. ""We have taken this mask mandate to the Texas Supreme Court. The rule of law will decide.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cHIub3JnL2dvdmVybm1lbnQtcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMS0wOC0xNS90ZXhhcy1zdXByZW1lLWNvdXJ0LXNpZGVzLXdpdGgtZ292ZXJub3ItYWJib3R0LW9uLWhpcy1tYXNrLW1hbmRhdGUtYmFuLWZvci1ub3fSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some Large Texas School Districts Stick With Mask Mandates Despite State Supreme Court Ruling,"The Texas Supreme Court on Sunday struck down temporary restraining orders that empowered Bexar and Dallas counties to institute mask mandates despite Gov. Greg Abbott's executive order banning them.

The elected Republican body offered Abbott his first court victory in the fight over local emergency power but local leaders remain defiant and many mask mandates across the state remain in effect.

“I’m obviously very disappointed in it. It’s not surprising because they’re all Republicans and they’ve got to run in the Republican primary"" said Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff. ""But that doesn’t mean we’re not going to keep up the battle to protect the school children of Texas.""

San Antonio Bexar County and Dallas county sued Abbott last week over his executive order banning mask mandates. Both suits won in lower courts and on appeal.

A groundswell of defiance from local governments and school districts across the state took place last week as coronavirus cases surged and hospitalizations increased. The number of ICU beds available in the state of 29 million dropped to 322 Sunday afternoon.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton brought the case to the state Supreme Court.

The win for Abbott was expected by legal experts who said the emergency statute he used to suspend laws was clear. State constitutional scholar Charles ""Rocky"" Rhodes said the court would not be deciding whether the mask mandate ban is good policy but on whether the Texas Disaster Act of 1975 gives the governor the authority to respond to a crisis across multiple counties.

""It seems to me that the argument of the cities and counties here would undercut the overarching purpose of the statute as a whole” Rhodes said.

According to an advisory announcing the temporary stay Sunday evening the ruling by the state Supreme Court does not impact upcoming hearings for both counties that could return emergency powers. San Antonio and Bexar County's hearing is scheduled for Monday.

“The City of San Antonio and Bexar County’s response to the Texas Supreme Court continues to emphasize that the Governor cannot use his emergency powers to suspend laws that provide local entities the needed flexibility to act in an emergency” said San Antonio City Attorney Andy Segovia. “His suspension authority is meant to facilitate action not prohibit it.”

Meanwhile city and county officials said Bexar County Health Authority Dr. Junda Woo’s health directive mandating the use of masks in public schools from pre-kindergarten through grade 12th remains in effect.

The state Supreme Court's order comes less than 12 hours before the first day of the school year for many Texas school districts giving districts little time to decide how to respond and communicate that response to parents.

Monday is the first day of school for several San Antonio school districts including North East Judson and Harlandale. North East and Harlandale notified parents masks would once again be optional. However both districts strongly encouraged the use of masks. Edgewood ISD said they're keeping the mask mandate in place for Monday and will decide what to do after that based on the results of the hearing. San Antonio ISD officials are asking staff and students at their schools to follow the mask mandate.

Dallas ISD Superintendent Michael Hinojosa said he’s keeping the school district's mask mandate in place pointing out that the ruling applied to counties only and not schools districts like his.

""We’re going to continue with our mask mandate to keep students safe to keep parents safe to keep families safe and most importantly our teachers who are on the front lines"" Hinojosa said.

If the court rules otherwise Hinojosa said he’ll comply. But until then the superintendent said masks will be required in Dallas ISD schools. He said if students refuse to wear a mask they'll be taught in a separate class room.

This story will be updated.

They’re fighting to fortify their trifecta control of state government despite a rapidly diversifying electorate and to establish themselves as the bastion of arch-conservatism in the United States. Victory seems imminent at least in the upcoming election cycle if not in the years thereafter. But the people of Texas — Republican independent and Democrat — have become collateral damage. Because in having dedicated themselves to battle Texas Republicans have forgotten how to govern.

This is certainly the case for the Texas legislature whose GOP majority has just led it through its most conservative session in decades. During that session GOP lawmakers failed to pass much-needed structural reforms to the state’s electrical grid after it collapsed during a catastrophic winter storm earlier this year as well as a federal Medicaid expansion program that would have given health care coverage to 1.4 million uninsured Texans amid a raging pandemic. Instead the legislature has prioritized bills that allow any adult in the state to carry a handgun without a license or permit and that ban abortions after six weeks.

It is now on track to enact one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country after an effort that has literally rendered the legislature unable to govern: Democrats fled the state to deprive the legislature of the quorum it needs to operate to protest the bill leaving Texans without a representative governing body. In response the Republican House speaker did not offer to negotiate a policy compromise but has tried to arrest the Democrats who fled.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott meanwhile has become a prominent national right-wing figure on both immigration and the pandemic.

He has waded into battles with the Biden administration over the US-Mexico border setting off on a misleading quest to construct a wall on his own (the taxpayer funds he’ll use for the effort are enough for only a few miles of wall at most) and falsely claiming that migrants are behind Covid-19 surges. And as the delta variant is infecting almost 12000 Texans a day in reported tests he has also refused to reinstate mask mandates at the state level banned local governments from doing so and sued those that defy him.

It’s all a bid to keep the GOP base happy in the lead-up to next year’s midterm elections as Republicans in the state are more concerned about potential primary challenges from the right than any serious offensive from Democrats. But with their focus on raising their political profiles and defeating potential rivals they have forgotten to actually govern amid several statewide crises in recent months: the winter storm that left tens of thousands without power and in the cold the arrival of increasing numbers of migrants at the border and the recent resurgence of Covid-19 cases due to the delta variant.

According to Brendan Steinhauser a GOP strategist based in Austin who ran Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s 2014 reelection campaign Republicans are just doing their job by responding to what Texas Republican voters want: “The voters are driving Republican policies” Steinhauser said.

But at some point elected officials have a responsibility to protect the health and safety of their constituents and the basic human rights of anyone who passes through their state even if it’s not what their base wants. Few Texas Republicans have embraced that sense of duty; state Rep. Lyle Larson a Republican from San Antonio has been a lone dissenting voice calling on his colleagues to “do the right thing with no expectation of getting re-elected” on issues like Covid-19 Medicaid expansion and election law.

“We’ve come to a point where Republican elected officials in Texas treat their jobs like they’re Fox News contributors as opposed to people with responsibilities to their constituents” said Zack Malitz co-founder of the progressive Real Justice PAC and a former adviser on Democrat Beto O’Rourke’s 2018 Texas Senate campaign.

Malitz’s view reflects the general frustration of Democrats. But there is a limited amount they — or anyone concerned about Texas government — can do. The reality of how districts are drawn as well as Texas Republicans’ push to restrict voting means many of those GOP lawmakers with little interest in lawmaking are likely to hang on to their seats next year. And that means the problems Texans have faced due to their government’s neglect are likely to continue.

The Texas legislature is scoring political points at the expense of addressing the most pressing issues

For a while after the 2018 elections Texas Republicans were focused on bread and butter issues like property taxes and school finance that wouldn’t offend many independents and Democrats. Democrats made some major inroads that year not just retaking the US House but also picking up 12 seats in the Texas House and two in the Texas Senate. That shook Republicans’ confidence a bit and left them looking to play it safe.

But after Democrats’ predictions that they would turn Texas blue in 2020 failed to come to fruition Republicans felt that they were given a mandate marking the return of culture war-type issues that most energize their base in the Texas legislature.

“In Texas Republicans still win statewide and have done so in the last couple of election cycles even though we had some narrower races in 2018” Steinhauser said. “If you’re a Republican running statewide you still have to speak to the Republican Party first not only to get the nomination but to turn them out and win in November.”

That pressure has manifested in what Steinhauser described as the most conservative session of the state legislature in his memory. The governor has already signed legislation that removed permit requirements to carry a handgun and also established an effective ban on abortion that is currently facing legal challenges.

But there is also a special session of the state legislature underway where lawmakers are supposed to work on legislation that would prevent schools from teaching critical race theory or mandating masks or Covid-19 vaccines and to provide funding for border security among other Republican causes.

All the while the failure of the Texas power grid during the winter storm — a statewide crisis that impacted Texans regardless of political party — has been glossed over. Though the governor signed laws to prepare the electrical grid to withstand future extreme weather events the legislature hasn’t passed any bills delivering direct relief for consumers who were slammed with huge electricity bills as a result of the blackouts or making the kind of forward-looking structural changes to Texas’s electricity market that many experts have called for.

Nor did the legislature in either their regular or special sessions find time to address many other pressing concerns in Texas like Medicaid expansion and police reforms that were proposed in the aftermath of former Houston resident George Floyd’s death.

“These cultural war issues get people to hunker down in the trenches that they’re used to being in around elections and refocus voters’ attention on how much they hate the other side” Malitz said. “These issues are being deliberately used as a distraction from really widely felt stuff in Texas right now: Covid economic recovery the blackouts baseline bad governance.”

Republicans are also trying to strip Texans of the only tool they have to demand good governance with a bill that would make the state’s already very restrictive voting laws even more so. It passed the state Senate on Thursday despite a more than 15-hour filibuster from an Austin Democrat but still needs to pass the House and be signed by the governor.

As my colleague Ian Millhiser notes the bill would strengthen constraints on absentee voting; ban drive-through polling sites; introduce new limitations and paperwork requirements on people who help disabled voters and non-English speakers cast a ballot; make it harder to remove partisan poll watchers who harass voters or otherwise disrupt an election; and impose harsh new penalties on people who commit even minor violations of Texas election law.

Steinhauser said that Texas Republicans are more unified behind that agenda than they have been in a long time.

“If you’re a Republican running statewide you still have to speak to the Republican Party first”

“Part of that is probably the party being out of power nationally and having a common political enemy if you will — to have the White House and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to point to” he said. “Also having Trump be a little less front and center in the party has allowed them to focus their critiques on national Democrats.”

But for Texas Democrats there isn’t room for compromise on the Republican agenda. House Democrats had fled the state en masse last month in an effort to prevent votes on the voting bill in particular. But after Republican Speaker Dade Phelan signed civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats on Tuesday night with a green light from the Texas Supreme Court nearly enough of them have returned to form a quorum a two-thirds majority of the chamber required to conduct business giving the Republican majority a chance to move forward with their agenda.

Though Republicans have decried Democrats’ actions as breaking relationships in a chamber that has historically sought to give the minority party a seat at the table Republicans had already drawn battle lines with a legislative agenda designed to exploit partisan divisions.

Gov. Abbott has tried to pass off his failures on the Covid-19 resurgence on migrants

Beyond the problems with the legislature Texas is in the middle of another statewide crisis: a third wave of Covid-19 this time brought on by the highly contagious delta variant. It has left hospitals with dwindling numbers of ICU beds and delaying non-emergency medical procedures while the governor calls in out-of-state medical staff to come to the rescue.

Nevertheless Abbott hasn’t budged in refusing to use his gubernatorial powers to try to get rising case — and death — numbers under control. He could for instance implement statewide mask or vaccine mandates but will not saying that curbing the epidemic now comes down to “personal responsibility.”

He has instead actively worked against the interests of public health issuing an executive order that prohibits any government entity from issuing its own mask mandates effectively hamstringing local governments that are bearing the brunt of Covid-19 surge in keeping Texans safe. Several counties have gone ahead and implemented mask mandates anyway but Abbott is going to court in an effort to reverse them.

Though he has praised the vaccine and has gotten the jab himself Abbott is focused on protecting the rights of the unvaccinated.

“They have the individual right and responsibility to decide for themselves and their children whether they will wear masks open their businesses and engage in leisure activities” Abbott told the Dallas Morning News. “Vaccines which remain in abundant supply are the most effective defense against the virus and they will always remain voluntary — never forced — in the State of Texas.”

Steinhauser said that Abbott is trying to balance the desire of millions of Texans not to return to the shutdowns of last year with the real immediate need to get millions more Texans vaccinated. Democrats however see it as an abdication of the governor’s responsibility to protect public health.

“This is beyond inaction — this is the governor tying the hands of health experts who are trying to keep Texans healthy as cases and hospitalizations increase” Texas state Rep. Donna Howard a former critical care nurse said in a statement.

What’s more Abbott has sought to blame the recent delta surge on migrants arriving on the southern border — playing into a false nativist and damaging right-wing narrative that might be particularly attractive to Republican voters in the state who have long identified immigration and border security as top priorities in public opinion polling.

At a national level a recent Axios poll found that nearly 37 percent of unvaccinated Americans blame “foreign travelers in the US” for the rise in Covid-19 cases. Abbott has played no small part in creating that perception.

They’re “allowing free pass into the United States of people with a high probability of Covid and then spreading that Covid in our communities” he said in an interview last month on Fox News.

But available data hasn’t shown migrants on the border to be any more likely to test positive for Covid-19. In March the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Congress that less than 6 percent of migrants at the border had tested positive for Covid-19 a lower percentage than the Texas positivity rate at that time.

Scapegoating migrants serves two purposes for Abbott: It obscures his role in failing to prevent the current Covid-19 surge and provides him with an excuse to pursue the kind of restrictive immigration policies that former President Donald Trump both popularized and made a priority.

He recently issued an executive order allowing public safety officers to stop and reroute vehicles suspected of transporting migrants with Covid-19 though the measure has been blocked in federal court for now.

He has told Texas child care regulators to revoke the licenses of facilities that house migrant children and state troopers to jail migrants for state crimes such as trespassing on private property when they cross the border.

And he is trying to finish the wall along the Texas border putting forth a $250 million “down payment” drawn from state disaster relief funds — money that could have gone to the aid of those still recovering from last winter’s storms or those struggling under the burden of the pandemic — and crowdfunding almost another $500000 as of June 23. That’s still a drop in the bucket of what he might need to finish the project which the federal government estimated could cost as much as $46 million per mile in some sectors of the border.

But it doesn’t really matter if Abbott finishes the wall or whether his executive order is ever allowed to go into effect. The policies have generated news cycles that boost his profile nationally which will be important if he pursues a 2024 presidential bid as rumored.

“It’s a fantastic talking point for his primary electorate both next year and in 2024” Malitz said. “It’s government by theater. The things that they are doing with government in Texas are by and large for the purpose of introducing a message into the right wing media machine with obviously catastrophic humanitarian results.”

Abbott and his fellow Texas Republicans have been very successful at controlling messaging and have had many wins in energizing state conservatives. Their party is poised to retain control of Texas.

Greg Abbott as he stares down local officials who are disobeying his ban on mask mandates.

Ruling Sunday evening the all-Republican Supreme Court blocked temporary restraining orders issued by two trial court judges last week that had allowed Dallas County and San Antonio to impose mask mandates in defiance of Abbott's executive order.

On Monday lawyers for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton responded by asking the state's highest civil court to void similar restraining orders issued Sunday by a judge in Travis County.

The rapidly shifting legal terrain left schools cities and counties scrambling to clarify mask policies as the highly contagious delta variant has produced a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections overrunning intensive care units in adult and children's hospitals across Texas.

Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Andy Brown who last week required face coverings to be worn inside public schools and government buildings to deal with surging COVID-19 infections insisted the orders remained in effect because Sunday's court action did not involve their rules.

""While we await a final decision we believe local rules are the rules"" Adler said on Twitter. ""Regardless of what eventually happens in the courts if you’re a parent please keep fighting to have everyone in schools masked. We stand with you.""

The Austin school district announced late Sunday that masks still will be required in all schools and facilities ""regardless of the latest Texas Supreme Court ruling"" because it applied to areas outside of Austin and Travis County. Austin schools start Tuesday.

Abbott's July 29 executive order prohibited cities counties school districts and health officials from requiring that face masks be worn indoors.

Facing a mounting health crisis however officials in the state's larger more Democratic counties began requiring masks in public places particularly in schools where children under 12 lack access to the COVID-19 vaccine.

The most recent trial court restraining orders came Sunday night when state District Judge Jan Soifer of Austin issued four temporary restraining orders that allowed mask mandates in any Texas school district — including ""any public school located within Travis County"" — as well as Harris County schools and a group of eight school districts seven of them in South Texas and one in the Dallas area.

Soifer had said she would issue the orders during a hearing Friday.

By the time the judge released her orders Sunday the Supreme Court had already stepped in to void restraining orders in Dallas County and San Antonio.

Lawyers for Paxton asked the Supreme Court on Monday to void three similar restraining orders issued by Soifer omitting the order that applied to Travis County schools.

Paxton's lawyers said they were preparing to file separate challenges to the Soifer orders but urged the court to act without waiting arguing that a delay was not ""an inefficient use of the Court’s scarce time and resources.""

The Supreme Court however declined to lump the Travis County orders in with its prior ruling requiring Paxton to file a separate challenge.

'Mask mandates are illegal'

Abbott and Paxton are challenging local mask mandates as illegal under the governor's emergency powers during a declared disaster. Those challenges remain before the Supreme Court and are expected to be decided later.

""Let this ruling serve as a reminder to all (school districts) and local officials that the governor’s order stands"" Paxton said on Twitter. ""Local mask mandates are illegal.""

Abbott who has said Texans — not government — must be responsible for their own health also took to Twitter to announce the ruling adding: ""The ban doesn't prohibit using masks. Anyone who wants to wear a mask can do so including in schools.""

Some of those local mask mandates were based on a statewide temporary restraining order issued by state District Judge Tonya Parker in Dallas County that prohibited Abbott from enforcing his ban on required masks.

The Supreme Court action Sunday however blocked Parker's restraining order — and it was unclear how school districts will react particularly those where school doors were to open on short notice early Monday morning.

Next step in the legal process

Sunday's Supreme Court action did not stop the next step in the legal process — trial court hearings Monday in San Antonio — in which the judge agreed to grant the requested injunction — and Aug. 24 in Dallas on whether to issue temporary injunctions that would allow mask mandates. The now-blocked restraining orders were intended to allow masking requirements to continue until the injunction matters are settled.

Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins who last week required that masks be worn inside schools and businesses said the legal fight is far from over.

""We won’t stop working with parents doctors schools business and others to protect you and intend to win that hearing"" on Aug. 24 he said on Twitter. ""Unless I receive a ruling requiring otherwise I will amend my order to remove the possibility of fines on noncompliant businesses but otherwise leave the order in effect.""

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said Sunday's Supreme Court action did not affect his county and he plans to move forward toward an injunction hearing set for Aug. 25.

Soifer a Democratic state district judge set separate injunction hearings affecting Travis County schools for Aug. 23 and affecting all Texas school districts for Aug. 25.

Meantime Jose Menéndez D-San Antonio said he was launching a legal defense fund to pay fines for schools that defy Abbott's executive order by requiring masks. Bexar County Commissioner Justin Rodriguez committed $10000 to help his county's school districts pay ""any frivolous fines.""

State law allows for fines of up to $1000 against jurisdictions or officials that disobey a governor's order during a declared disaster.

'Being consumed by the flames'

A number of organizations advocacy groups and school districts filed briefs over the weekend urging the Supreme Court to uphold mask mandates.

Disability Rights Texas said school officials should be allowed to follow federal health guidelines by requiring masks saying it would help protect students with disabilities who face a higher risk of hospitalization severe illness or death should they contract COVID-19.

""The executive order at issue here is not mere inattention to a fire; it is an attempt to prevent any fire brigade from fighting the fire as it deems best while the citizens risk being consumed by the flames"" Disability Rights Texas told the court.

The Texas Association of School Boards said public school districts are responsible for the health and safety of more than 5 million students who are required to attend school.

""A blanket prohibition against requiring masks in public school districts is an intrusion on local authority and an impediment to school districts’ ability to take local responsibility for the safety of a largely unvaccinated school population"" the organization told the court.

""School districts across the state are simply asking for the flexibility to set guidelines for student and staff health measures when their communities are demanding it and when school leaders determine it would be best for their students and educators"" the association added.

The Dallas County Medical Society representing 8400 doctors and students said public masking is effective at reducing the spread of the coronavirus particularly when all parties are masked.

""Our emergency rooms are rapidly becoming overloaded because of the increased number of patients requiring emergency care. Patients who require hospitalization are waiting hours even days to be admitted to a hospital room"" the society told the court.

The workload also is taking a toll on the physical and mental health of doctors and medical professionals the society said adding ""The current rate of effort being expended is unsustainable."""

NEW YORK — The FDNY launched its new FireCAD system this month replacing a 45-year-old computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system called STARFIRE.

StateScoop reported that the launch occurred at 3:43 a.m. on Aug. 2 a Monday when call volume is generally low.

The $22 million system developed by Accenture is the result of a four-year project to build a modern platform that according to officials is more reliable and has expanded features.

FDNY Deputy Commissioner JonPaul Augier said reliability was the top concern in the early planning stages of the CAD system. FireCAD was built to have just 52 minutes of downtime per year making it even more reliable than STARFIRE which was designed to have 9 hours of downtime per year according to FDNY.

Augier shared some of FireCAD’s key features:

An intuitive interface that reduces the need for extensive training and makes it easier to deploy resources to fires medical emergencies or chemical biological or radioactive hazards;

Simplified processes to give dispatchers the most relevant data quickly;

A robust development environment with ways to test and stage new security patches or features before pushing them live onto the platform; and

An administrative interface that allows dispatch supervisors to quickly and independently make changes.

“We’ve dubbed it a CAD system that was for dispatchers by dispatchers” Augier told StateScoop. “We didn’t just sit them down prior to the procurement and gather the requirements and hand off a stack of requirements to a [business analyst] group and just say ‘yeah go explain this to a technologist.’ Dispatchers and their training unit were involved for the entire build for the last few years.”

The new CAD system was designed to be compatible with next-generation 911 but that feature is not yet live.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzM4MDIvcGV0ZXItYnVybnMtbmV3LWhlYWQtb2YtYWNjZW50dXJlcy1maW5hbmNpYWwtc2VydmljZXMtZGl2aXNpb27SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdWx0YW5jeS5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9hbXAvMzgwMi9wZXRlci1idXJucy1uZXctaGVhZC1vZi1hY2NlbnR1cmVzLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1kaXZpc2lvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Burns new head of Accenture’s financial services division,"Profile Accenture

According to research by Accenture  94% of Fortune 1000 companies witnessed supply chain disruptions from Covid-19 75% of companies had a negative or strongly negative impact on business and 55% plan to downgrade their growth outlooks. Not only do these disruptions impact the economy businesses and workers they also have direct implications for financial markets. Prolonged supply chain disruptions can severely impact market sentiment by instigating fear about persistent inflation and apprehension about supply chain resilience and sustainability. What is likely to be immortalised in history then is this: Covid-19 exposed a structural vulnerability in modern global supply chains that threatened to dismantle the very architecture that has sustained them over the previous half-century.This architecture relies on what is known as Just-in-Time manufacturing pioneered by Japanese automaker Toyota in a post-war attempt to compete with the batch manufacturing model that characterized American car companies’ success. Most industries across the world have since embraced lean manufacturing as the standard and not without reason. Eliminating excess inventory has allowed companies to maximise production efficiency greatly reduce warehousing and other costs incentivize product innovation and diversification adapt to ever-evolving demand and enhance shareholder gain through buybacks.However experts have been sounding alarms for decades about a critical fragility in the system – the inevitability of supply chain disruptions. Where they have transpired the impact has largely been local and temporary. Until now. The Just-in-Time model hinges on a harmonious dance between production shipping and stable average demand but when the music stops a cascading domino-effect of supply chain chaos takes its place. This is what happened when Covid-19 grinded manufacturing to a halt in key export markets and lockdown-induced impacts doubled shipping times and caused acute labour shortages – add to the mix a skyrocketing of demand for consumer products as economies began to recover.Ironically the car industry is shouldering the fiercest impacts of global shortages  estimated to lose $60 billion in sales this year as shutdowns plague many of the world’s largest auto factories forced by an acute scarcity of a critical manufacturing component: computer chips. The only company that’s escaped the wrath of lean inventories? Toyota itself.That’s because in the aftermath of the devastating 2011 earthquake in Japan Toyota realised that the supply chains of each of the 1800 parts and 30000 components that make up a car had unique vulnerabilities and while some were quick to recover others – like computer chips – took months to catch up. It tweaked its own model to incorporate long-term strategic planning for building resilience into vulnerable supply chains and its policy to stockpile two to six months’ worth of semiconductors has allowed it to remain largely unscathed in a crisis where its competitors are now flailing.What companies have chosen to ignore and what experts have consistently warned about is that the root cause of such shortages is a ruthless pursuit of short-term profit over longer-term sustainability and natural disasters or pandemics are merely triggers that set off the bomb. Somewhere along the way companies have normalised sacrificing resilience at the altar of efficiency but Toyota has demonstrated that it does not have to be such a drastic trade-off. It has demonstrated that the most efficient manifestation of its own model exists at the intersection of lean manufacturing and a diversified resilient supply chain that is able to overcome disruptions till markets recover.The shockwaves have rippled globally and India is no exception. Before the pandemic hit an aggressive US-China trade war and other concerns were facilitating a global supply chain shift away from China and towards other Asian countries. Vietnam emerged as the top contender but favourable investor sentiment and shored-up domestic manufacturing placed India in the running as well with nearly one-third of respondents in a global survey of 700 firms naming India as a leading sourcing destination across multiple sectors. This is now in jeopardy. Covid-19 threatens to undo large swathes of progress that India has made over the last few decades across sectors including its manufacturing capabilities and MSMEs . A prolonged disruption weakened economy and waning trust in India’s capabilities can well arrest any progress it has made in capitalising on supply chain shifts from China where the impact has not been so drastic and which continues to be the world’s most trusted sourcing partner.There are several domestic concerns too. India’s logistics and supply chain costs add up to a whopping $400 billion or 14% of GDP  far less competitive than the global average – and consequently with far more potential for damage in the face of supply chain disruptions. In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic in 2020 financial markets remained extremely volatile and bearish leading to crashes and massive wealth erosion. While markets have been fairly resilient through the second wave uncertainty surrounding recovery and inflation fears stemming from prolonged disruptions could lead them into further bouts of volatility. One pre-pandemic study on supply chain disruptions found that on average Indian companies lose 2.88% of shareholder wealth over an 11-day period covering a disruptive event significantly higher than US companies.All in all – while a lot is contingent on how further Covid-19 outbreaks are tamed – it would bode well for India’s private sector to learn from the first two waves to build resilient supply chains. If it is to emerge as a key manufacturing and sourcing hub it has to cultivate relationships of trust with international companies as well as domestic markets and demonstrate that it is capable of withstanding even prolonged crisis-induced disruptions – or recovering quickly from them – like the one Covid-19 is currently fuelling.The buck doesn’t stop here – the virus may only be a precursor for what’s to come. In a world increasingly threatened by hostile trade wars retreating globalisation and aggressive protectionism and unprecedented disruptions from climate change building supply chain resilience is arguably the most potent survival strategy for any industry business or country.(The writer is a policy consultant and advisor to India’s former minister for IT and Shipping),,,,,,

Where Photoshop concentrates on in-depth image masking layering and retouching for single images Lightroom can organize and search your entire photo collection. It has its own photo editing tools and while these don't have the all-out power of Photoshop's they are more than enough for most photographers – and Lightroom's adjustments are 'non-destructive' which means you can go back and change them at any time in the future.

Like Photoshop Lightroom is no longer sold as a standalone program for a one-off price and is only available as part of a Creative Cloud subscription plan. The good (well great!) news is that you can get both Photoshop and Lightroom under a single monthly payment.

In fact there are two versions of Lightroom both included in the Adobe Photography Plan (below). Lightroom Classic CC is the more powerful version and designed for regular desktop or laptop photo editing with images stored on the user's own computer. Lightroom CC is a simpler cloud-based version where your photos are stored on Adobe's servers and hence are available on any device anywhere (there are Android and iOS Lightroom mobile apps). The only downside to Lightroom CC is that Adobe's storage fees are extra and can escalate as your image library grows.

• See also: Why I dumped Lightroom CC and went back to Lightroom Classic

The ‘CC’ in the name indicates that both Lightroom versions are part of Adobe’s Creative Cloud system which charges a monthly fee for using the software.

So does that mean you have to pay before you try Lightroom? No! Adobe offers a 7-day free trial for its subscription plans which should give you time to try out Photoshop properly. At the end of the trial period you can simply stop using Photoshop and cancel your subscription or do nothing and have your subscription start automatically.

So here’s how to download Lightroom and try it free for 7 days.

Download Lightroom free trial now

Just choose the Adobe subscription plan you'd like to try and download the software. Both versions of Lightroom are fully functional and not limited in any way. Simply cancel your subscription before the end of the 7 day trial if you don't want to proceed – otherwise the subscription will be activated automatically.

Download Lightroom free trial

Click this link to start your free Creative Cloud trial. You’ll be offered a choice of subscription plans for your 7-day trial including the Adobe Photography Plan Photoshop only or Adobe’s all apps plan. You will have to enter your card or PayPal details but you won’t be charged until the end of the 7-day trial period. If you decide not to go ahead at the end of the trial you’ll need to cancel your subscription online or via Adobe’s customer support.

Download Lightroom: Choose a plan

When you sign up for a free trial you'll need to choose a subscription plan to try out. Here are the choices (just to recap you won't actually be charged until the trial period ends):

Photography Plan: $9.99/£9.98 per month

This is by far the best choice for photographers. It includes not just but Lightroom CC and Lightroom Classic CC but Photoshop CC so you’re getting two high-powered professional programs for the price of one subscription.

Lightroom: $9.99/£9.98 per month

This plan comes only with Lightroom CC (the cloud version) but to make up for that you get 1TB of cloud storage space included in your subscription and you can add more later if you need it (at extra cost alas). This is a good plan for those who don't need to make complex multi-layer images and want the convenience of cloud storage.

Creative Cloud All Apps: $52.99/£49.94 per month

With this subscription you get access to all of Adobe’s professional apps. For regular photographers this is overkill but for anyone who also works with video web and print design and illustration this could be the plan to go for.

3. How to buy Lightroom

At the end of the 7-day trial period your Adobe subscription will start automatically and there’s nothing else you need to do. If you decide not to subscribe you will need to cancel your subscription online or via Adobe customer services.

Lightroom CC is designed around cloud rather than desktop storage and there are Lightroom mobile apps for both Android and iOS devices. (Image credit: Future/Rod Lawton)

Adobe discounts for students

You can get the Creative Cloud All Apps plan at a substantially discounted price of $19.99/16.24 per month (including a first year discount changing to $29.99/£25.28 after that) but you do have to be aged 13 or over and able to provide documentary evidence of your student status.

See the full range of Creative Cloud plans

We recommend the Photography Plan for photographers because it offers spectacular value for money and includes not just both versions of Lightroom but Photoshop too. There's also a substantial educational discount for students on the All Apps plan with a further reduction for the first year.

Photoshop Elements shares the same name as the Photoshop family but it's a separate program outside the Creative Cloud system and aimed at editing novices. (Image credit: Adobe)

What about Photoshop Elements and its Organizer?

Photoshop Elements 2021 is a separate product to Photoshop and not part of the Creative Cloud system. You can buy Photoshop Elements with a one-off payment from Adobe or resellers. Photoshop Elements is designed for beginners and ‘memory keepers’ however and does not offer the same professional tools and features as Photoshop CC. Elements does have its own Organizer app but this is separate to Lightroom and specific to Photoshop Elements.

Are there any Lightroom alternatives?

There certainly are! See our guide to the best photo editing software to get an idea of what’s out there and how different software publishers approach photo-editing. Lightroom is designed as an all-in-one photo organizing searching and editing tool but there are plenty of rival programs that do the same thing – and more (see our guide to best photo organizing software).

“We talk about it all the time breaking records and stuff like that” Sweat said per Ethan Cadeaux of NBC Sports Washington. “I personally want to go get the combined sack record that the guys got back before. We talk about it all the time.”

The record is 39 sacks set by Minnesota teammates Keith Millard and Chris Doleman.

Young’s preseason debut had many fans believing the duo can break the record. Young raced around the New England left tackle to sack Cam Newton and force a fumble. The play was ruled an incomplete pass but it doesn’t matter.

Here's Cam Newton's 2nd incompletion of the game. Isaiah Wynn got MANHANDLED by Chase Young. pic.twitter.com/4Y83RjhOnE — Henry McKenna (@McKennAnalysis) August 12 2021

Bucky Brooks of NFL.com recently ranked the NFL’s top pass-rushing duos and surprisingly the combination of Sweat and Young wasn’t No. 1.

Brooks offered high praise to the pair:

The WFT duo ranks as the most athletic edge tandem in the league. Sweat and Young are built like superheroes and their pass-rush skills showcase their superpowers (speed athleticism power and burst). Defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio is not afraid to unleash them on an assortment of stunts and games that enable them to utilize their superior first-step quickness and movement skills against lumbering offensive tackles. Considering the young pass rushers are still figuring out how to access all the tools on their tool belt the rest of the league should be wary of the disruptive tandem in D.C.

Brooks ranked Sweat and Young No. 3. The Rams’ duo of Aaron Donald and Leonard Floyd was No. 1 followed by Tampa Bay’s threesome of Devin White Jason Pierre-Paul and Shaq Barrett. I thought he was talking about duos?

Brooks is a respected analyst and his rankings make sense. But when you talk about edge rushers there is no better pair in the NFL than Young and Sweat.

While breaking the combined sack record in 2021 may be a lofty goal I wouldn’t rule it out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oaXN0b3JpY2FsLWhpZGRlbi13YWxsLXByb3RlY3Rpbmctc3QtMjIwNDAwMDY2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historical hidden wall protecting St. Anthony Falls draws new scrutiny over its unknown condition,"A giant hidden concrete wall buried deep below the Mississippi River has been holding the storied St. Anthony Falls in place for more than 140 years. It safeguards Minneapolis' water supply and helps ensure the river doesn't undermine bridges or other infrastructure.

But the wall's condition is largely a mystery. Now some river experts and politicians are calling for a closer examination fearing that a failure of the aging structure could prove catastrophic.

""There's a dramatic threat to the Twin Cities — water supply upstream infrastructure downstream navigation billions in central riverfront development"" said John Anfinson a leading Mississippi River historian who has been calling attention to the issue. ""How serious is it? We don't know.""

The problem is the wall is largely inaccessible lodged in sandstone beneath the riverbed. And it is unclear who is responsible for it; none of the entities most closely associated with the falls believes they are the owner.

Roughly the height of a three-story building the wall helps prevent the collapse of a thick limestone riverbed slab by stopping flowing water from eroding soft sandstone underneath it. It was constructed after one of the biggest disasters in Minneapolis history when a tunneling project went awry and nearly destroyed the falls in 1869.

There is no firm evidence that the wall often called the cutoff wall is in danger. But the vast majority of it can't be seen except for an area where it intersects with old tunnels.

Anfinson has been trying to alert public officials about the issue before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers — which built the wall — exits the area after the lock and dam closed to navigation in 2015.

The issue has piqued the interest of officials ranging from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar both of whom want the Army Corps to conduct a closer examination.

""If history's taught us anything it's that we need to be proactive when it comes to critical pieces of infrastructure like the cutoff wall"" Frey said.

The Congressional Research Service is investigating the legal process that would need to occur for the corps to analyze the wall's condition.

Anfinson has written extensively about the history of the riverfront. He says he felt obligated to speak out as someone well-versed in the wall's history. And he's thought about the questions now being asked after the Florida condominium collapse in June.

""Who knew what and when? And what did they do about it?"" Anfinson said. ""This wall may last another 144 years. But how do we know if we haven't done a good study of it?""

Anfinson once worked for the corps though he is not an engineer. He later joined the National Park Service where he became superintendent of the national park spanning most of the Mississippi River in the Twin Cities. He retired in January.

Nan Bischoff a corps project manager said people are raising a lot of concerns over something that is not actively threatening. Bischoff said the wall is effectively insulated by all the material and infrastructure that surrounds it.

""It's not going anywhere"" Bischoff said. ""There's no place for it to go.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9raW0ta2FyZGFzaGlhbi1zaGFyZXMtYmVkdGltZS1zbmFwcy0xNTAwMDA1MzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kim Kardashian Shares Bedtime Snaps of Sons Saint 5½ and Psalm 2: 'My Boys Are So Cute',"Kim Kardashian/Instagram; Inset: Getty Kim Kardashian and sons

""Little visitors in the gym today"" she captioned the sweet shots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YmluLmNvbS9maXgtbGFnLWluLXZhbG9yYW50LWdhbWUtZm9yLXBjL9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YmluLmNvbS9maXgtbGFnLWluLXZhbG9yYW50LWdhbWUtZm9yLXBjL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Increase FPS in Valorant? (2024),"Facing Freezing or Lag in Valorant Game for Windows PC? Here are the Best Solution to Increase FPS in Valorant Game for PC.

You can increase FPS in games using an AMD graphics control panel. AMD team has been working on improving the software over the years and they are trying to make the overall gaming experience better. There is no doubt that the control panel has gotten a facelift in 2020 which has complicated things a little. You have to spend a few minutes figuring out the options settings and configuration. I will be showing you how to reduce lag in AMD machines.

What are Our Testing Specifications?

Many so-called experts miss out on providing gaming rig information which leads to several questions.

Processor: Ryzen 5 1600

GPU: Radeon RX 570 (4 GB)

RAM: 16 GB (DDR4 3000 MHz)

Storage: 240 GB M.2 SSD

Monitor: 1080p IPS Display

Motherboard: B450 (MSI B450M PRO-VDH V2) (UPDATED BIOS)

Our gaming rig is an entry-level machine which makes it a suitable benchmark for the task. You will notice an FPS increase even when you are playing the game on integrated graphics.

Tone Down Valorant Settings

Several newbies don’t play around with the video settings in Valorant which leads to a lack of room for improvement. Allow me to show you how you can increase FPS instantly by toning down the video settings.

Step 1: Open the Valorant game.

Step 2: Click on the gear icon located at the top-right side.

Step 3: Choose “Settings” to continue.

Step 4: Choose “Video” from the top menu.

Step 5: Click on “Graphics Quality” from the sub-menu.

Step 6: Maintain low settings in the graphics quality.

Big-time players in the competitive scene have lowered the graphics settings for maximum frame rate.

Make sure to turn on “multi-threaded rendering” that will use multiple threads in the machine to render graphics. You can tone down the UI menu quality if it is loading slower during the buy period. Do not enable experimental features because they will slow down the weaker GPU due to poor optimization.

No Power Limit

Valorant is not hardware hungry game when compared to the modern games available on the web market. But it pushes the GPU or CPU to render the graphics which requires raw power from the PSU.

Many laptops have set “Balanced” mode in the power settings which limits the GPU and CPU power consumption. You have to let the hardware consume raw power when needed without restrictions.

Step 1: Press the Start button and open “Control Panel.”

Step 2: Click on “Hardware and Sound” to continue.

Step 3: Choose “Power Options” to continue.

Step 4: Select the “High Performance ” option.

Now you are allowing Windows to let programs utilize the demanded power wattage which will improve the FPS and overall performance.

Note: You can create a profile in the power options and create a “High Performance ” profile.

Many battery-powered Windows machines will notice faster battery drain during idle state so make sure to choose “Balanced” after you are done with the game.

Advanced Display Settings

I always play around with the settings from time to time and that’s what you should do to find out what’s best for your hardware. I found out that two changes in the display settings improved visual quality and smoothed the visual transition during heavy movement.

Step 1: Open the Valorant game.

Step 2: Click on the gear icon located at the top-right side.

Step 3: Choose “Settings” to continue.

Step 4: Choose “Video” from the top menu.

Step 5: Make changes to the shown settings.

Display Mode: Fullscreen

Resolution: Whatever your monitor supports

Monitor: Default

Aspect Ratio Method: Fill

All Limit FPS: Off

Make sure to keep the rest of the options to default.

Do not increase FPS in the menu and background because that won’t do any good for your hardware resources.

Turn off Background Running Programs

Windows machines have several programs running in the background during your gameplay. You should let the game consume the majority of the hardware resources rather than feeding it to the background programs.

I would consider this a performance boost If you could free 100 MB RAM by limiting the background running programs.

Step 1: Press CTRL + ALT + DEL keys together.

Step 2: Choose “Task Manager” to open it.

Step 3: Click on “Startup” located at the top.

Step 4: Click to select the program and disable it.

You should let Windows Defender Antivirus system HD Audio Console Graphics Card control panel and other essential programs run in the background. Disable unnecessary programs to run in the background so your game can consume the resources instead.

How to improve FPS using AMD Control Panel?

AMD developers have been pushing software optimization for a long time and they have made the dedicated GPUs utilize the software efficiently. Allow me to show you how you can improve the visual quality without compromising FPS drop.

Step 1: Open the AMD graphics control panel.

Step 2: Click on “Performance” from the top menu.

Step 3: Choose “Tuning” to continue.

Step 4: Keep the overclocking capabilities on automation.

Tuning Control: Automatic

Auto Tuning: Default

Step 5: Click on “Advisors” from the sub-menu and then choose the “eSports” preset.

Your game’s visual quality will improve and visual tearing will reduce drastically. You may not notice FPS gain from these settings but you will witness better visual quality with minimal FPS impact.

Overclock AMD GPU

Overclocking may fry your GPU or crash the machine but I recommend choosing AMD’s overclocking presets. The worst-case scenario would be a PC crash and you can always revert the recent changes following the same tutorial.

Step 1: Open the AMD graphics control panel.

Step 2: Click on “Performance” from the top menu.

Step 3: Choose “Tuning” to continue.

Step 4: Click on the “Overclock GPU” option.

Step 5: A warning will be issued on the screen and click on “Proceed.”

Step 6: AMD will overclock a certain part of the GPU and click on “OK” to finalize the setting.

Note: AMD overclocked the boost clocks in my case.

Step 7: Compare the stats and note down the FPS.

AMD’s overclocking presets do push the GPU for extra frame rates but the stability will depend on your PC cooling system. Nonetheless you can go through the same tutorial to revert the recent changes back to normal.

How to Improve FPS using Nvidia Control Panel?

I always applaud Nvidia for working on hardware and software optimization where AMD failed to achieve the same standards. You can tweak your Nvidia GPU settings for maximum performance out of the card. Allow me to introduce you to three settings that will boost frame rate with the minimal rise in temperature.

Step 1: Open the Nvidia control panel.

Step 2: Click on “Manage 3D settings” to continue.

Step 3: Choose “Global settings” to view more options.

Step 4: Change three settings.

Low Latency Mode: Ultra

Power Management Mode: Adaptive

Texture Filtering Quality: High performance

That’s all you have to do for the extra frame rates and you will notice a rise in GPU temperature. The poorly designed graphics card will experience overheating issues but it shouldn’t be a problem for standard cards manufactured by MSI Gigabyte Zotac etc.

Uninstall Unused Programs

Uninstalling unnecessary programs from the machine is proven to improve performance. You should remove programs that you haven’t opened in a long time because it will make room for Windows to breathe in. Undoubtedly uninstalling programs doesn’t increase FPS but it will free up RAM and storage space that your game can utilize.

Step 1: Press on the Start key and open “Control Panel.”

Step 2: Choose “Uninstall a program” to continue.

Step 3: Choose a program and uninstall it.

Do not install any program or games that you don’t need anymore or have not opened in a while. You should give maintain free space and lower the number of programs to let Windows utilize extra resources.

Bottom Line

You can increase FPS in Valorant by applying simple solutions. You should maintain a clean machine that is not infected by threats and not filled with junk. Always keep an eye on the new driver’s update because they do slow down the aging GPU’s and it has happened in the past as well. Let us know how much FPS you have increased in the comment section below.

A new study of 20 major Airbnb markets conducted by LendingTree showed that in 19 the number of short-term rental listings dropped precipitously between May 2020 and March 2021.

Among the 20 markets examined only Broward County Fla. saw an increase in the number of listings (they rose 2 percent). In every other market they fell by at least 10 percent. Jersey City N.J. saw the steepest decline with Airbnb listings falling 61 percent. This week’s chart which displays data from Inside Airbnb as analyzed by LendingTree reveals just how drastic the reductions were among these 20 markets.

Even before the pandemic there had been pressure on lawmakers to crack down on short-term rentals. Complaints from neighbors about disruptive Airbnb guests had become commonplace and some unscrupulous landlords were turning entire buildings into illegal Airbnb hotels. New legislation lengthened minimum stay requirements in some municipalities including Jersey City and New York.

Airbnb hosts are also free to set their own minimum stay requirements and the pandemic suddenly gave them more reasons to do so including lowering the possibility of infection and reducing post-checkout cleanups. In Jersey City the average required minimum stay jumped 195 percent from May 2020 to March 2021 up to 20.8 days. But New York City had the biggest percentage increase during that time up 237 percent to 20.6 days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5haXJibmIuY29tL3N0YXktd2l0aC10aGVzZS1haXJibmItc3VwZXJob3N0cy1mb3ItYW4tdWx0aW1hdGUtc2lhcmdhby1leHBlcmllbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stay with these Airbnb Superhosts for an ultimate Siargao experience,"Whether you’re staying for the weekend or for a month Airbnb’s Siargao Superhosts will ply you with tips and tricks on how to live like a local

The short-term rental provider has reported revenue of $1.34 billion (£966 million/€1.14 billion) for the three months to end-June fully a billion dollars up on the corresponding year-earlier period.

While costs also rose sharply to $1.39 billion (£1 billion/€1.18 billion) the San Francisco-based company's net loss of $68.2 million (£49.2 million/€57.8 million) compared very favourably with the loss of $575.6 million (£415 million/€488.1 million) experienced a year earlier.

""The travel rebound is upon us"" the group proclaimed in an extensive shareholder letter.

It added: ""Guests from countries with high vaccination rates including the U.S. and parts of Europe are driving the travel recovery…

""While the COVID-19 pandemic creates ongoing uncertainty for our future results we expect [third quarter 2021] revenue to be our strongest quarterly revenue on record.""

It seems unlikely that Tokyo 2020 will have benefited Airbnb in the manner originally expected.

When the company signed on as an IOC sponsor in 2019 - in the exclusive category of ""Unique Accommodation Products and Unique Experiences Services"" - co-founder Joe Gebbia revealed that Airbnb hosts in Japan had earned more than $70 million (£50.5 million/€59.4 million) during the Rugby World Cup adding: ""And we have even bigger expectations for the Olympic Games"".

Airbnb noted in the new shareholder letter however that its business in the Asia Pacific region ""remained depressed"" compared with the equivalent three months of 2019 before the pandemic struck.

Sensitivities surrounding Beijing 2022 along with COVID-19's lingering impact mean that this edition of the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games will also need to be carefully handled.

However future Games hosts Paris Milan and Los Angeles have traditionally been among the group's biggest markets for private accommodation rentals worldwide.

Airbnb's present deal with the IOC runs through until 2028."

Much of this money is used to hire new employees and lease office space preferably in central Tel Aviv to house their growing work forces.

One outstanding example of this is the Israeli fintech company Rapyd which raised $300 million at the start of the month at a company valuation of $8.75 billion after raising $300 million in January. Rapyd is currently headquartered in the Azrieli Sarona tower but in April it announced together with Azrieli Group Ltd. (TASE: AZRG) that it has signed an agreement to lease 27500 square meters in the Azrieli Center - 13500 square meters in the triangular tower and 14000 square meters in the 91-floor spiral tower currently under construction and due for completion in 2026. 15 floors in total for an estimated payment of NIS 100 million for eight floors in the triangular tower over five years and NIS 150 million for seven floors in the spiral tower over five years.

Commercial real estate broker Daniel Shamia partner and owner of Next Place which specializes in finding office space for Israeli tech companies said ""The most in demand space by Israeli startup companies is the area around the Hashalom railway station by the Azrieli Center. The most in-demand tower is the Azrieli Sarona tower where Amazon and Facebook have their offices. What happens there is that the moment a company leaves there is a vacuum sucked up by the rest of the companies occupying the building. They have first rights. The price is NIS 160 per square meter.""

""The second most popular are the Ha'arba'ah Towers which are in-demand because of the location and the balconies - which they love in high-tech. The outstanding tenants in these buildings are Melio which is in the penthouse Armis and Rafael.""

Shamia explains that the growing demand for office space in Tel Aviv is in order to attract the most talented employees. ""When my customers complain that the price is too high I ask them how much three good programmers cost them. When they tell me that each one costs NIS 50000 per month I explain to them that these three employees will influence 100 that will get a crazy salary signing-on agreements share options. The money is flooding in there. So why is it a big deal to lease an office for NIS 150000 a month? It's small change.""

""You can find things much cheaper seven kilometers from Tel Aviv""

Veteran real estate player Jackie Mokmal says that the real estate reality has changed recently. ""We see the founding of dozens of startups with the ability to raise surprising amounts of money. These companies are still not yet profitable so they are going to locations that they can leave easily. This has strengthened the co-working trend. Our partners today are thirtysomethings who want Tel Aviv and Central Tel Aviv. They don't compromise over locations and they want commercial entertainment and community services to be close by. They want to enjoy life. They don't want to go to a place where the rent is cheaper - it doesn't interest them.

""If you look at the map of Gush Dan (Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area) you'll see that seven kilometers from Tel Aviv in Bnei Brak or in Holon you can lease offices 60% more cheaply. Not many want to go there.""

""In order to integrate teams they have to sit near each other""

""In Israel people look to be together and that's especially relevant in a situation of major growth said Orca Security founder Geron. The company which was founded in 2019 and is developing a cloud security solution has offices in Israel Los Angeles London Vienna and elsewhere but most of the development is conducted in Israel.

Over the past six months the company's work force has grown from 50 to 150. Orca Security currently has 700 square meter offices in Tel Aviv's Hamasger Street and it will soon move to a 2000 square meter office nearby paying NIS 130 per square meter. Geron explains the growth in demand for office space in Israel as being due to large growth which requires direct face-to-face communication. ""In the US people don't want to go back to the office. From their point of view the age of 90 minute commutes in each direction is over. In Israel people look to be together and it's especially relevant in a situation of rapid growth.

""In order to integrate a team they have to sit near each other and they need someone to ask questions and someone to speak to. I think that because of the nature of the work in Israel which is mainly development people are looking to work in an office but not fully. Most employees today ask to work in a hybrid style.""

""The office is an instrument for strengthening enterprise culture""

Guardicore is developing a solution to protect the servers of the world's large corporations against attacks. VP human resources Ilan Stern said that the company is growing rapidly and today has 280 employees including 160 in Israel. Estimates are that by the end of the year Guardicore will have 350 employees. The company recently moved from its 1500 square meter office in the Levinstein Tower on Menachem Begin Road to a 3000 square meter office in Beit Rubinstein 400 meters to the north.

Stern recalled ""When we began to look there was coronavirus hovering in the background. We were hesitating whether to keep the same amount of space or move to a hybrid working culture in other words with some coming and some not and not everybody having their own space but we decided that we don't want that model because it is important for the company to continue to convey our enterprise culture. From our point of view the office is an instrument for strengthening the enterprise culture. So we took a much larger space than we actually need today.""

""This is space that will be enough for us for years to come. A large amount of the space we have allocated for public areas that will connect employees together. We have a large canteen that will let large groups eat lunch and there is a bar for the afternoon and evening and a recreational area with a billiards table and sofas and there is an assembly area to bring everybody together for the latest updates. Out of the 3000 square meters 700 square meters is devoted to these public spaces.""

Stern believes that Covid has changed work culture. ""I'm not sure we'll ever be able to turn the clock back. We are a company that worked five days a week in the office and it was rare that somebody chose to work from home. That won't come back. We allow a hybrid work model today according to which all employees can work two days a week from home. Our aim is to build in this specific office with its large public spaces something that will make people want to come to the office and be together. Not because somebody makes them but because they enjoy being together.""

Stern explains that the choice to remain in central Tel Aviv was natural. ""A large part of our work force is of people who live in Tel Aviv. There are many people who get to the office on electric scooters and bikes and ultimately the decision was to make it easier for them to get here. There is something here that is connected to the company's culture. When we understood that the previous offices were too small we began looking in the area. We checked out Yigal Alon Street but we found that it was clear to us that we wanted a sea view as in the previous offices. At some stage that began to define our search. We want a spacious office with three adjoining floors and room to grow and a view of the sea.""

""Prepared to pay more for flexibility

Seebo is developing technology to predict and prevent production and quality problems in manufacturing plants. The number of employees at the startup has doubled to 70. Seebo has a 300 square meter office in Tel Aviv's Montefiore quarter and is moving to a 1000 square meter office.

Seebo CEO Lior Akiva said ""Most of our employees come by bike scooter or walk. But there are also employees who come from outside of the city. Our preferred location is Tel Aviv. Like everyone we are seeking the right balance in hybrid working.""

Working from home saves the jams and is a better work-life balance and more time with the family and that's wonderful. But work from the office is also important because it allows better cooperation between team members encourages creativity informal conversations as well as fun social connections. When thinking about work spaces the acute need in a startup like ours is flexibility.""

Akiva added that Covid has indirectly caused a change in the design of work areas. ""Before Covid people came to the office five days a week and sometimes worked on their own and sometimes as part of a team. We've noticed that people who work from home concentrate on their team work on the days that they come into the office In this situation we need more meeting rooms compared with what was before Covid. If we once thought about a certain number of personal work stations and meeting rooms so now we understand we have to reduce personal work stations and have more meeting rooms.""

Akiva stressed that there are three factors making it difficult for companies to forecast the size of the work areas that they need. ""We are a fast growing company and it is difficult to know how many people will be here in two or three years' time. The second thing is that it is not clear where hybrid working is going to - most people come to the office two or three times a week. The third factor is the virus itself - nobody knows what will be.""

""The mixture of a fast growing company hybrid work patterns and Covid which comes and goes creates a major difficulty for us in seeing how many square meters we will need in the near future. And so we are ready to pay more for flexibility. In other words if we suddenly need to double the company's workforce we will be able to cope with that.""

By Space Coast Daily // August 14 2021

list includes top 32 QB's in the nation heading into 2021 season

ORLANDO FLORIDA – The Manning Award sponsored by the Allstate Sugar Bowl announced its preseason Watch List on Thursday.

The list includes 32 of the top quarterbacks in the nation heading into the 2021 season and UCF’s Dillon Gabriel was among the honorees.

The winner will again be selected by a voting panel which includes national media and each of the Mannings after the bowls.

The Manning Award was created by the Allstate Sugar Bowl in honor of the college football accomplishments of Archie Peyton and Eli Manning. It is the only quarterback award that includes the candidates’ bowl performances in its balloting.

Finalists will be selected prior to the postseason and the winner will be announced following the College Football Playoff National Championship.

Gabriel is one of six Manning Award finalists from a year ago on this year’s Watch List joining Matt Corral (Ole Miss) Sam Howell (North Carolina) Grayson McCall (Coastal Carolina) Brock Purdy (Iowa State) and Desmond Ridder (Cincinnati).

In its first 17 years the Manning Award has recognized the top names in college football. It has honored quarterbacks from 13 different schools and from four different conferences.

One of the more unique aspects of the Manning Award is the fact that it takes account of the quarterbacks’ bowl performances in addition to the regular season.

Fourteen of the 17 Manning Award winners won bowl games during the season they won the honor. Twelve Manning Award honorees led their teams to the CFP Semifinals or a BCS Championship game. Eight won national championships.

All the Manning Award winners follow in the footsteps of the Mannings themselves.

In college Archie Peyton and Eli Manning combined for over 25000 passing yards and 201 touchdowns while playing in 10 bowl games and earning four bowl MVP awards. Archie was the No. 2 pick in the NFL Draft while both Peyton and Eli were selected No. 1 overall.

In addition to the Manning Award’s yearly honor each week during the regular season eight quarterbacks are recognized as Manning Quarterbacks of the Week.

Seventy-three players from 66 different schools were honored during the 2020 season and 424 different quarterbacks from 129 schools have been recognized since 2011.

John Cena has seemingly given recognition to one of his greatest rivals former WWE Champion CM Punk.

On Saturday Cena posted a picture of Punk blowing a kiss at Vince McMahon after his victory in the main event of Money in the Bank 2011 at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago.

Cena's post came just a day after he indirectly referenced Punk during his promo segment with WWE Universal Champion on SmackDown.

Cena told Reigns: ""Roman you're gonna put on a hell of a show but I'm just gonna hang in there for 1 2 3. And then I'm gonna take your title jump the barricade and run out of Allegiant Stadium as fast as I can. I may even blow you a kiss goodbye.""

As noted Punk also shared a cryptic post on his Instagram Stories almost immediately after the Cena-Reigns segment.

Although Cena typically posts random pictures on his Instagram the Punk post is rather interesting since Punk is rumored to make his AEW debut on next Friday's episode of Rampage.

The bill is a companion to a measure introduced this week by a bipartisan trio of senators which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use alternate app stores and payment systems.

Representative Ken Buck the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee antitrust panel introduced the measure along with Representative Hank Johnson a Democrat.

“For far too long companies like Google and Apple have had a stranglehold on app developers who are forced to take whatever terms these monopolists set in order to reach their customers” Buck said in an email statement.

U.S. consumers spent nearly $33 billion last year in mobile app stores and downloaded 13.4 billion apps Buck’s office said in a statement.

Apple has previously defended its app store as “an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation one that now supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states.”

The stakes are high for Apple whose App Store anchors its $53.8 billion services business as the smartphone market has matured.

Google has said that Android phones often have two or more app stores preloaded.

The legal fight between the two Detroit automakers turns on whether ""cruise"" is a generic term for technology that allows the car to take over some share of driving tasks from a human motorist.

The clash underscores the intensity of competition among established automakers to be seen as leaders in automated driving technology competitive with Silicon Valley rivals Tesla Inc Alphabet Inc 's Waymo unit and others.

GM filed a federal suit against Ford on July 24 accusing Ford of violating GM trademarks by using the name ""Blue Cruise"" for a system that enables hands-free driving.

GM had previously trademarked ""Super Cruise"" for its hands-free partially automated driving technology. It also has trademarked ""Cruise"" the name of its robo-taxi unit in San Francisco.

Ford reiterated on Friday its position that GM's suit is frivolous. The effort to nullify GM's trademarks for the use of the word ""cruise"" takes the fight to a new level.

""To defend itself Ford has no choice but to ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to rescind both of GM's ""Cruise"" and ""Super Cruise"" trademark registrations that should have never been registered in the first place"" Ford said. ""Any number of companies use the word 'cruise' in connection with driver assist technology.""

Among the examples Ford cited: ""Predictive Cruise"" marketed by Mack Trucks; ""Smart Cruise Control"" marketed by Hyundai Motor Co and Autocruise used by auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG.

GM said Friday that Super Cruise ""has had a well established commercial presence since 2017"" and added in a statement that the company ""remains committed to vigorously defending our brands and protecting the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market and that won't change.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vY29uc3RydWN0aW9ucmV2aWV3b25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VzYS9nb29nbGUtdG93ZXItaW4tYXVzdGluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ongoing construction of Google Tower in Austin topped out at 590 feet,"The signature tower known as the Google Tower in Austin has recently topped out at 590 feet and construction work on the building continues as it gradually nears its maximum height of 594 feet.

The 35-story high Google Tower is unique to Austin’s skyline with its iconic boat-like design which is even more prominent as it stands next to Lady Bird Lake. Vertical construction of the building is now complete and all the required floors have been put in place with most of the building already covered with glass.

Located at Block 185 601 W. Second Street in Downtown Austin this high-rise Google Tower in Austin is being built to serve as the the largest and tallest office tower in the area and the development covers up to 800000 square feet of office space 1411 parking spaces on the lower floors along with some underground floors. In addition it also features outdoor roof areas terraces and creek-side retail.

The bill is a companion to a measure introduced this week by a bipartisan trio of senators which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use alternate app stores and payment systems.

Representative Ken Buck the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee antitrust panel introduced the measure along with Representative Hank Johnson a Democrat.

“For far too long companies like Google and Apple have had a stranglehold on app developers who are forced to take whatever terms these monopolists set in order to reach their customers” Buck said in an email statement.

U.S. consumers spent nearly $33 billion last year in mobile app stores and downloaded 13.4 billion apps Buck’s office said in a statement.

Apple has previously defended its app store as “an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation one that now supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states.”

The stakes are high for Apple whose App Store anchors its $53.8 billion services business as the smartphone market has matured.

Google has said that Android phones often have two or more app stores preloaded.

The legal fight between the two Detroit automakers turns on whether ""cruise"" is a generic term for technology that allows the car to take over some share of driving tasks from a human motorist.

The clash underscores the intensity of competition among established automakers to be seen as leaders in automated driving technology competitive with Silicon Valley rivals Tesla Inc Alphabet Inc 's Waymo unit and others.

GM filed a federal suit against Ford on July 24 accusing Ford of violating GM trademarks by using the name ""Blue Cruise"" for a system that enables hands-free driving.

GM had previously trademarked ""Super Cruise"" for its hands-free partially automated driving technology. It also has trademarked ""Cruise"" the name of its robo-taxi unit in San Francisco.

Ford reiterated on Friday its position that GM's suit is frivolous. The effort to nullify GM's trademarks for the use of the word ""cruise"" takes the fight to a new level.

""To defend itself Ford has no choice but to ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to rescind both of GM's ""Cruise"" and ""Super Cruise"" trademark registrations that should have never been registered in the first place"" Ford said. ""Any number of companies use the word 'cruise' in connection with driver assist technology.""

Among the examples Ford cited: ""Predictive Cruise"" marketed by Mack Trucks; ""Smart Cruise Control"" marketed by Hyundai Motor Co and Autocruise used by auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG.

GM said Friday that Super Cruise ""has had a well established commercial presence since 2017"" and added in a statement that the company ""remains committed to vigorously defending our brands and protecting the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market and that won't change.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vY29uc3RydWN0aW9ucmV2aWV3b25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VzYS9nb29nbGUtdG93ZXItaW4tYXVzdGluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ongoing construction of Google Tower in Austin topped out at 590 feet,"The signature tower known as the Google Tower in Austin has recently topped out at 590 feet and construction work on the building continues as it gradually nears its maximum height of 594 feet.

Block Club on Friday afternoon first reported on the furor from the Chicago Park District allowing Amazon to bolt an Amazon Hub delivery locker into a sidewalk in Brands Park 3259 N. Elston Ave. this week.

Within a day the locker was gone and Amazon pledged to review other Chicago locations. There are plans in the works to install dozens of the blue lockers around the city. Some lockers have been in place for months irking fans of those parks.

A similar delivery locker installed in the tiny Forest Glen Playlot 5073 W. Berwyn Ave. was also removed this weekend after Ald. Samantha Nugent (39th) and others objected to it.

“We value the community’s feedback and are taking action to respond to these concerns” Av Zammit an Amazon spokesperson told Block Club. “We are working with the Chicago Park District to remove this Amazon Hub Locker from its current location as soon as possible. We are also reviewing our other Locker installations in partnership with Chicago Park District to ensure they are all located in appropriate areas that serve both customers and the community.”

Amazon installed the large Amazon delivery locker in Brands Park Thursday quickly drawing scorn and bewilderment from park users and Ald. Rosanna Rodriguez (33rd). It was bolted to the sidewalk in a bend in the park creating a chokepoint because of a nearby fence.

In Facebook comments locals said the new Amazon “hub” is not only unsightly but is also a glaringly obvious safety concern because it prevents people with strollers and people in wheelchairs from easily passing through the public park.

“This looks so absurd I can’t even believe it’s real” one neighbor commented on Facebook.

Another wrote: “who the heck green lighted this massive boondoggle? please report to your alderman if you live in this ward. disgust!”

Rodriguez said a Park District supervisor told her the lockers in the park were installed there by mistake. Chicago Park District spokeswoman Irene Tostado wouldn’t confirm saying only “The locker was installed in the correct park.”

Rodriguez on Friday asked the Park District supervisor to move the lockers to a more appropriate location.

Rodriguez said her office fielded numerous complaints from constituents since it was installed in the park. She said she was stunned when a neighbor sent her photos of the lockers which were stationed on the sidewalk near the playground.

“It just looks crazy” the alderwoman said. “I don’t even understand how someone could’ve thought that was an OK place to put it.”

Many have broader concerns about Amazon’s presence in public parks. About 100 people have signed an online petition calling on city officials to “keep our parks community spaces free from predatory businesses like Amazon.” The company has long been criticized for its poor treatment of its workers and grueling workplace conditions.

“To go to a place that is a public good a place of recreation and then see the branding of one of the most anti-worker companies in the world … it’s so disturbing” Rodriguez said.

A total of 68 Amazon lockers are being installed at Chicago parks across the city according to a list provided by the Park District. Some have already been installed and others are being installed later this month. The full list is below.

Rodriguez said the lockers are a symptom of a larger budgetary issue the city is facing.

“When you have public institutions that are not well-funded and can’t function with the budget they’re provided by the government they need to look for other sources of revenue. This is how we get a company like Amazon to have a presence in our public parks. It’s disheartening” the alderwoman said.

Tostado didn’t immediately answer a question about how much revenue the partnership will bring the city.

“It is beyond inappropriate for Amazon’s business paraphernalia to block public access in park” said Juanita Irizarry executive director of Friends of the Parks. “But even if it were placed somewhere out of the way this is not an appropriate use of public property. Chicago’s parks should not be for sale.”

Here’s where the lockers are being installed around Chicago:

He often traveled on Thornton Road to work for residents living on Buck Lake Road. Interstate 10 was still under construction.

The young man born in 1939 in Spring Creek North Carolina a town populated by less than 900 was full of ambition and grit. Moore always admired the east Tallahassee property miles away from his garnet and gold-clad campus.

The blank slate represented possibilities.

Back story:

""I’d look across that property as a student and say 'If I could ever own something like that that would be OK' "" said Moore his raspy voice laced with longing.

His fondness for Thornton Road and the people who lived by his beloved Antique Car Museum never ceased not even when it came down to selling the large swath of land needed to hook the biggest commercial fish in Tallahassee's history — Amazon.

The world's largest e-commerce company found its way to Moore not because of glossy and polished presentations intended to convince companies into setting up shop in the capital city. Deeply rooted relationships deserve the credit he says.

It all began with a call from Beth (Kirkland) Cicchetti who heads the Gadsden County Development Council.

Amazon made the first move

The economic development community is tight knit and Cicchetti said she’s made connections with more than 500 peers in the industry.

In this case maintaining those relationships paid off. About a year ago Cicchetti said she was contacted by someone she knew professionally who now works at Amazon.

That person who she declined to identify requested suggestions on properties to meet the company’s needs.

At about the same time Amazon was developing a last-mile facility in Jackson County's Marianna secret plans began taking shape for a first-mile fulfillment center in or near the capital city.

More:'They came to us': Amazon makes plans to build new 'last-mile' facility in Jackson County

Cicchetti knew the area well as the previous executive director of the defunct Economic Development Council of Tallahassee/Leon County for 10 years.

She knew of land owned by Moore in Gadsden County near I-10 and Highway 90 similar but smaller than the Mahan Drive project site. Cicchetti also worked with Moore in an effort to attract Four Star Freightliner in Midway.

She worked previously on a strategic sites identification program a pilot program introduced by Duke Energy in 2015. It identified industrial properties near interstates that are shovel ready with utility hook-ups — just some of Amazon’s must-haves for a fulfillment site.

Working mostly in rural areas Cicchetti sought direction from an industrial real estate broker and began working on a short list of contenders.

Moore's 170 acres at 6720 Mahan Drive the north side between Interstate 10 and Thornton Road looked promising.

According to permitting materials much of the site is undeveloped or developed as single-family residential with three existing single-family structures a private roadway and stormwater improvements.

Cicchetti was aware of the front end work Moore paid out of pocket to create a ""ready set go"" property. Much of the time-consuming prep work wasn't a factor which was another big plus for Amazon.

“They want to come to a piece of property that they consider site ready"" she said. ""It’s ready to submit the site plans and begin the construction. There’s not this long drawn out period of due diligence on the environmental aspects of the property.

Once you do that you put yourself in a much better position to meet the demands of the market.”

Moore did just that.

She met Moore in person at his Antique Car Museum on Mahan Drive. Within a few months Amazon representatives were in Tallahassee to see the property firsthand.

“Once DeVoe decided this was something he wanted to pursue he had all the relationships there in the jurisdiction in Leon to proceed” Cicchetti said.

No more mystery for a 'competitive project'

The deal with Amazon wouldn't have happened if not for the call to Cicchetti that eventually led to Moore.

Local economic officials also say the incentives package was vital in locking down the interest of Amazon.

Before Amazon was named – when the project was still under a cloak of confidentiality as Project Mango – the promise that the company would become the largest job producer by the private sector in Tallahassee's history was widely celebrated. Business and community leaders touted it as a game changer while the project drew criticism and concern from nearby residents worried about an increase in noise and traffic.

The Intergovernmental Agency made up of city and county commissioners quickly approved a $2.56 million incentives package for Amazon's massive project.

Only Tallahassee City Commissioner Jack Porter voted against the package at a Blueprint meeting of city and county commissioners. She maintained the project felt ""super rushed"" and that officials failed to seek enough public input.

Some residents have also criticized awarding incentives to a company like Amazon that is valued at $1.7 trillion.

How Amazon unfolded:

Cristina Paredes Director of the Tallahassee-Leon Office of Economic Vitality said Amazon was never a fait accompli for the capital city.

""Amazon was a competitive project as they evaluated different properties across their network area"" she told the Democrat. ""Our community offered short-term limited property tax reimbursement through our local Target Business Program in return for 1000 new jobs a payroll of $167.6 million and more than $200 million in capital investment.""

""It is a truly transformative job creation project for Tallahassee"" she said adding that retailer will continue to pay taxes and incentives are only realized when the company meets its job creation milestones.

An economic forecast by the FSU Center for Economic Forecasting and Analysis shows the project will ultimately create 3600 new jobs $167.6 million in wages and generate approximately $451 million in local economic impact for Tallahassee-Leon County.

The company's identity was a poorly kept secret until this week's official announcement. Last week the Democrat reported that Sam Blatt an economic development policy manager at Amazon was in conversations with Leon County development officials as early as April.

In a video message played Thursday at the Chamber of Conference's annual conference in Amelia Island Blatt told leaders how the company had been working with city and county officials for six months.

“Tallahassee has been wonderful"" he said. ""They have the right site the right workforce and ultimately have the right team in place to bring this to fruition.”

Local officials say the facility will be a high-tech marvel and have 15 miles of conveyor belts. The company plans to break ground next month and open in time for Christmas season 2022.

DeVoe Moore: 'I want quality'

Over the years Moore had many opportunities to sell.

There were pushes to bring a truck stop or an outdoor mall to the Mahan Drive property due to its proximity to I-10. Bass Pro Shops initially considered building there but decided to open its Tallahassee store in the Fallschase Shopping Center about 4 miles west from where the fulfillment center will be.

Moore a wealthy self-made business man turned them all down. To sell the right company and project had to come along.

“That’s just my nature” Moore said. “I don’t want just anything on the property. I want quality.”

While he's known to many Tallahassee Democrat readers for his columns advocating for conservative positions the Florida State alum also is a generous donor to his alma mater where his namesake DeVoe L. Moore Center is located and serves as a public policy research institute.

Leon County Administrator Vince Long one of the few public officials who knew about Amazon's interest early on said the land is a point of pride for Moore.

“I think it’s safe to say he’s not someone who had to sell the property” Long said. “There were no fire sales on the property as far as DeVoe was concerned.

He was in a unique position as a landowner ... and had the ability to wait for the right deal to come along not only for him but for the community.”

DeVoe didn't hire teams of consultants to represent him which might be expected for a land deal of this scale.

“That’s the kind of guy he is” Long said. “DeVoe is very old school and he handles these projects of this magnitude which are really sophisticated with himself and a small group of people that he trusts.”

Long met with Moore dozens of times on the project. Moore was adamant about protecting his neighbors and their quality of life.

""He’d say ""I won’t do this deal Vince. I’ll walk away from this deal if they put trucks on Thornton Road'"" Long recalls. “He was steadfast about that.”

Moore made a promise to his neighbors he intended to keep. He assured them that whatever he did with the property he would work to mitigate negative impacts.

Long said he gives Moore the lion’s share of the credit on the Amazon deal adding “he really deserves it.”

He said local government helps facilitate interactions with potential buyers to help navigate permitting and land-use details. But Moore engaged with Amazon and ultimately came to terms.

“Without that” Long said “we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”

One of my favorite weekend activities is strolling through the mall or cozying up at home with a glass of wine in one hand and my laptop in the other. But while I love to shop I find myself left with lots of individual pieces in my closet and sometimes don’t quite know how to outfit them in a fresh and new way. I also seem to have a full closet that I stand in front of in the morning and wonder why I have nothing to wear (anyone else?).

Nowadays there are plenty of online styling services that can help you with that so I turned to trusty Amazon. That’s right—there’s an Amazon personal shopper service. Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe is similar to Stitch Fix and Trunk Club in that a stylist learns about your body shape and preferences and puts together outfits they think you’ll love. The major difference? The cost is much lower at $5. (Yes less than your daily Starbucks order). I tested it and this is how it went:

The Style Survey

Think of your style survey as your first impression without being able to talk to someone. The survey has you choose between different style archetypes you like best such as edgy boho classic and retro (there are 10 categories in all). You also enter in your body shape where you live and what you’re looking for. To fully get your goals across there’s also an open text field so that you can directly communicate your requests with your stylist.

My Stylist’s Picks

From there I received Amazon fashion picks from a personal stylist. I let my stylist know that I was looking for casual work-from-home pieces with a few going out tops for weekend get-togethers. She wrote me a cute little note telling me about her favorite pieces in the 16-item collection and explained how to wear them.

What I loved about her picks was that they were arranged in groups of three or four items to make complete outfits so you can see exactly how to wear each piece. I noted that I like to stay on top of trends and my collection consisted of feminine puff sleeve tops high-waist jeans (just as I requested) and some easy summer dresses in different silhouettes.

If you struggle to style new pieces this is the perfect solution as it eliminates guessing how to incorporate it into your wardrobe and allows you to copy or take inspiration from the stylist’s suggestions.

The Next Steps

Of those 16 pieces you’re able to choose eight items from the collection to be sent to you to try on at home. You’re not charged for anything unless you decide to keep it but they do require you to use a credit card at checkout. My outfits arrived a few days later and I loved being able to try everything on in the comfort of my own home. I ended up keeping a pair of high-waisted Levi’s a one-shoulder top by one of Amazon’s in-house brands and a pair of sandals by Splendid. I packaged up the pieces I was sending back in the return envelope they provided and dropped off the package at my local UPS store.

The Verdict

Out of all the online styling services I’ve tried Amazon’s is my favorite by far. I love the low out-of-pocket cost having access to the name brands Amazon carries and having lots of pieces to choose from. I also really like being able to select what to ship and what not to ship versus just having pieces show up at my front door that I don’t really like.

Even if you decide not to buy anything it’s always refreshing to see what someone else picks out for you and how they put outfits together. It definitely inspired me to try new things in my styling like pairing my white jeans with a white top for a monochromatic ensemble this summer. If you’re looking for some style inspiration or just need a wardrobe refresh I couldn’t recommend Personal Shopper by Amazon Wardrobe more.

The Winners

Amazon is the giant in the room for easy instant access to hundreds of thousands of different products.

While the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is technically free to own one of the caveats is that you have to be an Amazon Prime subscriber to qualify. In 2018 Amazon increased the price of a Prime membership from $99 a year to $119.

It's hard (and actually foolhardy) to assess the value of the Prime membership based solely on the return you might get using the online retailer's credit card — because membership includes so many other tangible benefits — but for argument's sake I'm going to try.

First let's look at what the Prime Rewards card pays:

5% cash back at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market.

2% back at restaurants gas stations and drugstores.

1% back on all other purchases.

There's no cap on the cash-back value you can earn and you can redeem your rewards to pay for all or part of your Amazon purchases. In addition to cash back you can also redeem for gift cards or travel. Currently new cardmembers receive a $100 Amazon.com gift card instantly upon approval. With Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods Market and the millions of items ready to be delivered to your home let's see if this card is still worth the cost.

How should you use the card?

Compared to many other travel credit cards the Amazon Prime Rewards card offers fewer earnings on both bonus and non-bonus category spending.

For example the Chase Sapphire Reserve gets you 3 points per dollar spent on travel and dining at restaurants while the Costco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi (see rates and fees) earns 4% cash back on eligible gas and EV charging purchases for the first $7000 per year and 1% thereafter.

You even can beat the 5% cash back at Whole Foods by using the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express which offers 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $6000 per calendar year in purchases then 1%). Cash Back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as as statement credit. Terms apply.

However if grocery and household spending is a significant chunk of your budget virtually no card can top the Prime Rewards bonus on spending at Amazon.com.

So let's look at how much you'd have to spend annually with Amazon to justify the subscription price.

Earning your membership fee back

(Photo by Dania Maxwell/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

Let's figure out your break-even cost for signing up for Prime and using the Prime Rewards card.

The $100 gift card you receive for signing up goes a long way toward paying off the first-year cost of the Prime membership. You'd have to spend about $380 at Amazon during your first year to earn enough cash back to pay off the remainder of your Prime subscription cost. Here's the breakdown:

$119 (Prime membership) minus $100 (sign-up bonus gift card) divided by $0.05 (5% back with card) = $380

During subsequent years you'd have to spend about $2400 on Amazon merchandise to earn enough cash back to pay for your Prime subscription. Here's the breakdown:

$119 divided by $0.05 = $2380

A 2017 Consumer Intelligence Research Partners analysis found that the typical Amazon Prime member spends about $1300 a year with the retailer. That's not enough spending to justify getting a Prime membership for the sole purpose of getting the credit card.

I spend even less than average it turns out. I spent $615.62 on Amazon last year buying both merchandise and digital content. Had I used the Prime Rewards card I would have earned $30.78 in cash back or Amazon credit well short of the $119 Prime membership fee.

Another Amazon card option

I might be better off with the Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card. You can get this card without subscribing to Prime. The Amazon Rewards card pays:

3% back at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market.

2% back at restaurants gas stations and drugstores.

1% back on all other purchases.

I could get a slightly better return but I'd have to use the Chase Freedom Unlimited which earns 1.5% cash back on most purchases (plus 3% on dining and drugstores and 5% on Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel) and transfer those points to my Chase Sapphire Reserve account where each point is worth 2 cents on average when you redeem them with travel partners according to TPG's latest valuations.

Bottom line

This exercise to determine whether it's worth paying the Prime membership fee to get the Prime Rewards card is extremely subjective. Some of us may find incredible value from 5% back on Whole Foods deliveries.

I'm an Amazon Prime member — and I don't even buy that much from Amazon. But for people who enjoy perks like free two-day shipping and Prime streaming services those benefits alone could justify the cost of a membership. Essentially membership is already a sunk cost and with no annual fee adding the Prime Rewards card is just icing on the cake.

I find value in the membership because of the Prime Video and Amazon Music streaming services. Those alone are worth the $119 a year to me. Throwing in a rewards credit card on top of that doesn't hurt either.

According to a Facebook post from Ald. Rossana Rodríguez the Amazon delivery hub in Brands Park in Chicago's Avondale neighborhood is ""clearly obstructing a public walkway"" and will be removed soon.

""Neighbors our office was recently made aware of a newly installed Amazon delivery hub in Brands Park that is clearly obstructing a public walkway. We contacted the park who informed us that the hub was improperly installed and will be moved asap. We are also looking into the contractual relationship between Amazon and the Chicago Parks District because we do not believe this to be a proper use of public property. Thank you to our 33rd Ward neighbors who alerted us of this matter"" Rodríguez wrote in the post.

The Chicago Park District said in a statement that the Amazon locker at Brands Park will be relocated.

The park district noted that as part of a new partnership Amazon Hub will be installing delivery lockers at parks throughout the city for convenience to the community.

""Locations will be dispersed throughout the city in neighborhood parks to provide this convenient amenity for residents in the area"" a spokesperson for the park district said. ""These installations are being placed as an added offering to our park patrons and community members."""

The carrier will operate its flights to and from New York out of Terminal 5 alongside its Oneworld partner British Airways. All other American routes will originate from Terminal 3.

The decision to divide and conquer across two terminals is a curious one. It would seem to make more logistical sense at least for passengers to have an airline operate all of its flights from the same terminal.

American moved all of its Heathrow flights to T5 in July 2020 as the pandemic forced the shuttering of T3 due to lack of airport traffic. A benefit of the move is it made it easier for American passengers to make connections with BA.

But now those travellers who may not be aware that American is working out of two different terminals could find themselves a bit lost.

Another factor to consider with this split is how it affects travellers on the ground. The lounge situation in Terminal 3 isn't ideal at the moment. The Cathay Pacific First Class Lounge and the Qantas Lounge are both closed as is the Admirals Club. The only Oneworld lounge currently open in Terminal 3 is the British Airways Lounge and it's limited to business-class flyers.

The world's airlines are taking off again after the COVID-19 crisis almost completely stalled their business (via FlightGlobal). Returning passengers may want a glass of Chablis or a double bloody mary to calm the usual flight jitters and ease their nerves about traveling again especially since the CDC warns that air travel is risky because social distancing can't always be maintained. But fliers might get a tall glass of disappointment instead. Several airlines are restricting alcohol on flights or banning it altogether (via CNN).

The airlines aren't trying to make their passengers any grumpier than they already might be. Carriers around the globe such as Delta American Airlines and KLM have come to this decision out of a concern for travelers' health. The restrictions are intended to limit up-close interactions between fliers and flight attendants and airlines really want their customers to keep their face masks on to best protect themselves and others. (Someone should alert the airlines to these really cool face masks on Etsy with holes just big enough to fit a drinking straw through.)

At the time of my accident I was an Aircraft Technical Representative for a US based airline in the Technical Operations department stationed in Central America. A few weeks each month I would fly down to El Salvador with a few other crewmembers; together we would oversee heavy maintenance work done on Airbus A320s by Aeroman an aircraft Maintenance Repair Organization (MRO).



On May 30th 2008 I was finishing up my latest stint at Aeroman in San Salvador and I was looking forward to taking a few days off. I was headed to neighbouring Honduras to visit my son who was four years old and was living with his mom.



I love El Salvador but I was eager to get away and spend time with my son William who I hadn’t seen in a couple months. That Friday morning I called TACA and switched from an afternoon to a morning flight TACA 390.



Not a good choice. In fact it was the first of many decisions I would make that changed the fate of that day.



When I arrived at the airport in San Salvador and checked-in for my flight to Tegucigalpa the capital and biggest city in Honduras I was given a choice to sit in the middle of the plane or move to the back. I chose row 26.



That was a good choice.

Like an Ashtray



Toncontin International Airport TGU is unlike any airport you’ve seen before there’s no city that comes close. It’s one of the world’s most dangerous airports. The site has been described as “like an ashtray” use your imagination. It’s basically a runway set in a basin surrounded on all sides by steep hills it’s so small and such a tight squeeze that every approach is a challenging one for pilots. I’ve flown in there many times over the years but I’m still not used it.

(Click to see a ""normal"" landing at TGU on YouTube)

The flight that morning was uneventful 131 miles in an A320 over the rainforest and mountains of Central America. The flight is normally 40 minutes but it took a little longer that morning because the pilot had to make a go-around. Tropical Storm Alma had just swept through the country and the weather over Tegus as it’s nicknamed was not the best.



We made a second go-around.



It’s common for pilots to do a second go-around there; finally after circling for a bit we descended. As our plane swooped in I noticed that the landing was so smooth that it felt unreal. I knew something was wrong.



In the middle of the landing people began clapping. Everybody was cheering! But I looked out the window to my left and I noticed that we had passed a set of markers that indicate that we were approaching the end of the runway. In that split second when I felt something was wrong; I pulled my seat belt tighter threw up my arms and braced for impact. I knew we were going to hit something.



Within milliseconds it happened.

Cracked Open Like an Egg



It was a lucky thing I moved to row26 and wasn’t in the middle of the plane where I was originally seated. As the jet slammed to a stop it cracked open like an egg. Light came shining through into the cabin around row 10. The plane had buckled right across the middle as it came to rest on a hillside just beyond the end of the short runway.



The official investigation unfortunately claimed pilot error but from my perspective three factors doomed our flight: the runway was slick after Tropical Storm Alma there was heavy fog and we probably hit the ground too far down the runway to ever stop safely.



One-hundred-forty people hit seatbacks and tray tables like dominos. Then the pandemonium began. People were screaming shouting “fire!” and pushing their way to escape.

Later we learned that the captain had died upon impact. In total 5 people died. 3 in the aircraft and 2 were in a taxi on the ground that got crushed by the impact of the aircraft.



Back in the cabin flight attendants were doing an excellent job helping people get out despite the chaos. They carried out their emergency procedures very well. I was lucky to be in the back and one of the first people to head down the emergency slide. From outside the plane I could see fuel leaking and thought about the possibility of an even bigger fire.



There were so many people coming out of the plane needing help. I didn’t think twice about grabbing some elderly passengers and pulling them up the small hill that we’d come to come to rest below. From there we watched the last few passengers stream out of the wreckage as crowds gathered to witness the mess.

Ambulances arrived quickly and police were on the scene a few minutes later with a triage unit being set up in the meantime. Every person who got out alive had minor injuries except those in the middle. They were pretty hurt. I was in a lot of pain but fortunately it was only some bruises. I knew most people were a lot worse off than I was and I wanted to make sure they were taken care of first.



I wanted to call my family right away but I couldn’t remember any phone numbers. They wouldn’t have been much use anyway since I left my phone and everything but my passport and credit cards on the plane.



As I stood there among all the chaos I was in disarray. I was confused and didn’t know what to do I was still in shock. Out of the blue a woman who works for the airport came over to me. Out of everyone standing around she somehow grabbed me. She brought me over to her office where I was able to use a phone and call my colleagues in San Salvador. They gave me all the local numbers I needed to sort myself out to call my family and friends.

At that point I was looking pretty dishevelled and didn’t know what to do. The woman from the airport was kind of enough to bring me to my hotel. When I got there I had messages waiting from my company and the US Embassy. I didn’t think anyone would know I had been in the crash but I guess news travels quickly!



It was clear my pain was getting worse so I got a ride to the hospital where most of the foreigners on flight 390 had been taken (people were split up in between three or four hospitals). I stayed there a few hours before doctors verified that there was nothing major wrong with me.



In the hospital I couldn’t help but look around and fixate on those people worse off than me. Some had bandages around their heads or patches on their eyes. Some were in wheelchairs with broken legs or feet.



Truth be told it felt awful to be the one who was OK. Classic survivor’s guilt. But I also felt really lucky it just wasn’t my time yet.



I stayed in Tegus for four days; happy to be alive replaying that day in my head. When it was time to leave Taca bussed me and others four hours north not a bus ride I want to repeat to flights in San Pedro Sula. Imagine twisty Central American roads to your left for mile after mile the road falls off suddenly into deep ravines. From San Pedro Sula I hopped a flight home to Miami.



TGU remained closed to large jets for a long time. Big planes were forced to divert 40 miles north to an air base with long runways until the investigation was finished. There is a lot of debate going on in Honduras about whether the airport should close forever. Flight 390 was just the latest in a string of deadly accidents there at the time.



The crash of Taca 390 was quite an experience. Working in the aviation field it seems ironic to have been in a crash in a plane I know so well and on an airline I’ve worked with for such a long time in San Salvador.



In a word it was surreal.

They also canceled the remaining North American tour which was set to wrap in August.

As the live industry is slowly but surely coming back with the re-opening of major venues and artists resuming their tours Aventura — helmed by Romeo Santos Henry Santos Lenny Santos and Max Santos — did not hold back from hitting the road again dubbing their Inmortal Tour their last-ever tour together.

The group officially launched their five-date U.S. trek at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on Saturday night (Aug. 14) where not only there’s a global pandemic but also the delta variant-driven infection and in true Florida fashion the arrival of tropical storm Grace.

Even though the odds were against them the bachata group took the stage at 9:55 p.m. opening the set with five back-to-back classics: “El Desprecio” “La Niña Cambio” “Por Un Segundo” “La Boda” and “Infieles.”

“Good evening” lead singer Romeo Santos told the crowd in Spanish. “We decided to kick off the tour in Miami for many reasons and you know what? F— the storm!”

Matching in all-black outfits the group continued to croon fans with hit tracks such as “Dile Al Amor” “Enseñame a Olvidar” and “El Malo” which follows Romeo’s philosophy that even though one can date 50 people only the “bad guy” conquers their heart.

The Hard Rock Stadium was packed Saturday night — 50000 attendees to be exact. Amid the COVID-19 and delta variant spikes the show was sold out. The venue staffers all had their masks on as they greeted fans but no COVID-19 measurements were in place for concert-goers some of whom opted to wear their masks as they walked around the stadium or sat at their seats.

In fact the group did not make any mention of the pandemic but instead sent an important message of “more love and less violence” when performing “Mi Corazoncito.”

Towards the middle of the concert and under the on-and-off showers of the tropical storm Aventura had a change of clothes and performed ballad versions of their songs “La Tormenta” “Our Song” “Deja Vu” and “Llorar” on of a “rooftop” setting. They also proceeded to receive fan petitions and sang a couple of impromptu songs before closing off their slow-tempo set with “Lagrimas.”

“When we started our careers we weren’t fans of covering other artists’ music” Romeo told the crowd. “ But with lots of respect and may God have him in his glory we wanted to pay tribute to the ‘Prince of Songs’ José José.”

Next they dropped their reggaeton-infused “Noche de Sexo” and took it way back to some of their first jams released in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as “La Novelita” “Hermanita” and “Amor de Madre.”

“This tour is very special” Romeo said as the band prepared for the grand finale. “We are celebrating more than two decades of trajectory. First because of God and second because of you. Thank you!”

Aventura then performed “Obsesion” the breakthrough song that put their modernized bachata sound on the global map and bid farewell with fireworks an explosion of confetti and large balloons.

Or so fans thought.

“Oh we have a lot of songs to continue. We can do an encore and an encore and an encore” Romeo said when the group returned on stage to perform their comeback track and the first single in nearly 10 years “Inmortal.”

Aventura closed the show with their first-ever performance of “Volví” their new single alongside Bad Bunny.

“Benito never fails and neither does Aventura!” Romeo said as Bad Bunny came on stage and surprised the audience wearing a blue and white checkered-print outfit.

Aventura and Bad Bunny hyped up the crowd with their edgy urban-bachata collaboration as Bad Bunny flaunted his fast-paced bachata moves for the epic closing a little bit before midnight. “Volví” debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Latin Streaming and Latin Digital chats. It’s also No. 2 on Hot Latin Songs.

The Inmortal tour grossed $25.8 million and sold 189000 tickets according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore. That’s 15 shows between Feb. 5 and March 10 2020. Up next Aventura will visit fans in Texas Illinois California and New Jersey."

I’ll call him Gallagher. He could do anything he wanted. He experimented dabbling in neuroscience law philosophy and other fields. But he was so critical so picky that he never settled on a career. Nothing was good enough for him. He never found love for the same reason. He also disparaged his friends’ choices so much so that he alienated us. He ended up bitter and alone. At least that’s my guess. I haven’t spoken to Gallagher in decades.

There is such a thing as being too picky especially when it comes to things like work love and nourishment (even the pickiest eater has to eat something). That’s the lesson I gleaned from Gallagher. But when it comes to answers to big mysteries most of us aren’t picky enough. We settle on answers for bad reasons for example because our parents priests or professors believe it. We think we need to believe something but actually we don’t. We can and should decide that no answers are good enough. We should be agnostics.

Some people confuse agnosticism (not knowing) with apathy (not caring). Take Francis Collins a geneticist who directs the National Institutes of Health. He is a devout Christian who believes that Jesus performed miracles died for our sins and rose from the dead. In his 2006 bestseller The Language of God Collins calls agnosticism a “cop-out.” When I interviewed him I told him I am an agnostic and objected to “cop-out.”

Collins apologized. “That was a put-down that should not apply to earnest agnostics who have considered the evidence and still don’t find an answer” he said. “I was reacting to the agnosticism I see in the scientific community which has not been arrived at by a careful examination of the evidence.” I have examined the evidence for Christianity and I find it unconvincing. I’m not convinced by any scientific creation stories either such as those that depict our cosmos as a bubble in an oceanic “multiverse.”

People I admire fault me for being too skeptical. One is the late religious philosopher Huston Smith who called me “convictionally impaired.” Another is megapundit Robert Wright an old friend with whom I’ve often argued about evolutionary psychology and Buddhism. Wright once asked me in exasperation “Don’t you believe anything?” Actually I believe lots of things for example that war is bad and should be abolished.

But when it comes to theories about ultimate reality I’m with Voltaire. “Doubt is not a pleasant condition” Voltaire said “but certainty is an absurd one.” Doubt protects us from dogmatism which can easily morph into fanaticism and what William James calls a “premature closing of our accounts with reality.” Below I defend agnosticism as a stance toward the existence of God interpretations of quantum mechanics and theories of consciousness. When considering alleged answers to these three riddles we should be as picky as my old friend Gallagher.

THE PROBLEM OF EVIL

Why do we exist? The answer according to the major monotheistic religions including the Catholic faith in which I was raised is that an all-powerful supernatural entity created us. This deity loves us as a human father loves his children and wants us to behave in a certain way. If we’re good He’ll reward us. If we’re bad He’ll punish us. (I use the pronoun “He” because most scriptures describe God as male.)

My main objection to this explanation of reality is the problem of evil. A casual glance at human history and at the world today reveals enormous suffering and injustice. If God loves us and is omnipotent why is life so horrific for so many people? A standard response to this question is that God gave us free will; we can choose to be bad as well as good.

The late great physicist Steven Weinberg an atheist who died in July slaps down the free will argument in his book Dreams of a Final Theory. Noting that Nazis killed many of his relatives in the Holocaust Weinberg asks: Did millions of Jews have to die so the Nazis could exercise their free will? That doesn’t seem fair. And what about kids who get cancer? Are we supposed to think that cancer cells have free will?

On the other hand life isn’t always hellish. We experience love friendship adventure and heartbreaking beauty. Could all this really come from random collisions of particles? Even Weinberg concedes that life sometimes seems “more beautiful than strictly necessary.” If the problem of evil prevents me from believing in a loving God then the problem of beauty keeps me from being an atheist like Weinberg. Hence agnosticism.

THE PROBLEM OF INFORMATION

Quantum mechanics is science’s most precise powerful theory of reality. It has predicted countless experiments spawned countless applications. The trouble is physicists and philosophers disagree over what it means that is what it says about how the world works. Many physicists—most probably—adhere to the Copenhagen interpretation advanced by Danish physicist Niels Bohr. But that is a kind of anti-interpretation which says physicists should not try to make sense of quantum mechanics; they should “shut up and calculate” as physicist David Mermin once put it.

Philosopher Tim Maudlin deplores this situation. In his 2019 book Philosophy of Physics: Quantum Theory he points out that several interpretations of quantum mechanics describe in detail how the world works. These include the GRW model proposed by Ghirardi Rimini and Weber; the pilot-wave theory of David Bohm; and the many-worlds hypothesis of Hugh Everett. But here’s the irony: Maudlin is so scrupulous in pointing out the flaws of these interpretations that he reinforces my skepticism. They all seem hopelessly kludgy and preposterous.

Maudlin does not examine interpretations that recast quantum mechanics as a theory about information. For positive perspectives on information-based interpretations check out Beyond Weird by journalist Philip Ball and The Ascent of Information by astrobiologist Caleb Scharf. But to my mind information-based takes on quantum mechanics are even less plausible than the interpretations that Maudlin scrutinizes. The concept of information makes no sense without conscious beings to send receive and act upon the information.

Introducing consciousness into physics undermines its claim to objectivity. Moreover as far as we know consciousness arises only in certain organisms that have existed for a brief period here on Earth. So how can quantum mechanics if it’s a theory of information rather than matter and energy apply to the entire cosmos since the big bang? Information-based theories of physics seem like a throwback to geocentrism which assumed the universe revolves around us. Given the problems with all interpretations of quantum mechanics agnosticism again strikes me as a sensible stance.

MIND-BODY PROBLEMS

The debate over consciousness is even more fractious than the debate over quantum mechanics. How does matter make a mind? A few decades ago a consensus seemed to be emerging. Philosopher Daniel Dennett in his cockily titled Consciousness Explained asserted that consciousness clearly emerges from neural processes such as electrochemical pulses in the brain. Francis Crick and Christof Koch proposed that consciousness is generated by networks of neurons oscillating in synchrony.

Gradually this consensus collapsed as empirical evidence for neural theories of consciousness failed to materialize. As I point out in my recent book Mind-Body Problems there are now a dizzying variety of theories of consciousness. Christof Koch has thrown his weight behind integrated information theory which holds that consciousness might be a property of all matter not just brains. This theory suffers from the same problems as information-based theories of quantum mechanics. Theorists such as Roger Penrose who won last year’s Nobel Prize in Physics have conjectured that quantum effects underpin consciousness but this theory is even more lacking in evidence than integrated information theory.

Researchers cannot even agree on what form a theory of consciousness should take. Should it be a philosophical treatise? A purely mathematical model? A gigantic algorithm perhaps based on Bayesian computation? Should it borrow concepts from Buddhism such as anatta the doctrine of no self? All of the above? None of the above? Consensus seems farther away than ever. And that’s a good thing. We should be open-minded about our minds.

So what’s the difference if any between me and Gallagher my former friend? I like to think it’s a matter of style. Gallagher scorned the choices of others. He resembled one of those mean-spirited atheists who revile the faithful for their beliefs. I try not to be dogmatic in my disbelief and to be sympathetic toward those who like Francis Collins have found answers that work for them. Also I get a kick out of inventive theories of everything such as John Wheeler’s “it from bit” and Freeman Dyson’s principle of maximum diversity even if I can’t embrace them.

I’m definitely a skeptic. I doubt we’ll ever know whether God exists what quantum mechanics means how matter makes mind. These three puzzles I suspect are different aspects of a single impenetrable mystery at the heart of things. But one of the pleasures of agnosticism—perhaps the greatest pleasure—is that I can keep looking for answers and hoping that a revelation awaits just over the horizon.

Again,"This op-ed is part of a series published by The Dallas Morning News Opinion section to explore ideas and policies for strengthening electric reliability. Find the full series here: Keeping the Lights On.

After the energy crisis in February Texas policymakers are looking for scapegoats that fit a political narrative. But we have a collective inability to admit that natural gas let us down again which sets us up for another energy crisis.

Texas is the No. 3 natural gas producer in the world after Russia and the U.S. It has enriched us and helped us clean up the power sector by displacing coal. Gas has been good to us and is central to our identity as a state. But as a result we are psychologically unable to admit that gas let us down during the winter storm in February just as it did a decade ago in the Groundhog Day cold snap of 2011 and the freeze of 1989.

Texas will blame anyone and anything other than natural gas no matter how absurd. In a grid dominated by fossil fuels the power outages must be wind’s fault. In a state where politics have been controlled by conservatives for decades it’s liberals’ fault.

In a state with its own independent grid it must be the fault of out-of-state politicians who have no say in our decisions. In a state suffering the consequences of its own energy decisions over the last few decades it must be the fault of some future program like the Green New Deal which is an amorphous policy concept that doesn’t exist yet.

In a state where a significant portion of the natural gas supply froze up cutting off gas supplies to power plants (even those that had firm gas supply contracts) it must be the electricity regulators’ fault even though they have no oversight of the natural gas system.

Advocates from the natural gas industry are saying we need to build even more gas-fired power plants to prevent this problem from happening in the future. But Texas’ problem wasn’t that we had too few gas power plants; the key problem during the outages was that too few of the power plants turned on or stayed on.

Many gas power plants failed from the cold and many of those that could operate could not get the gas they needed to keep going because Texas natural gas production dropped significantly. According to a report by the University of Texas at Austin Permian Basin gas production dropped as much as 80% or more because of the cold weather.

But our pathological adoration for natural gas prevents Texans from seeing these shortfalls and that can come back to bite us.

Why is the gas supply so flimsy in Texas? There are several reasons.

Gas suppliers did not sufficiently winterize so there were extensive freeze-offs especially in the Permian Basin. It costs tens of thousands of dollars to winterize wells or other equipment and some gas companies concluded that investment wasn’t worth the effort despite the risk to human lives and the economy.

Instead of intending to serve as reliable suppliers of critical fuel for the power sector many gas providers signed up for interruptible power (which provides cheaper electricity in exchange for a consumer’s willingness to have their power turned off during a grid emergency). Some signed up for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’ emergency response services program which pays industrial customers handsomely to turn off their equipment when power supply is tight.

This means some gas companies were financially rewarded for their lack of reliability exacerbating problems in the power sector. Worse yet hundreds of gas producers failed to register their equipment as critical infrastructure which meant their power could be cut off by utilities during forced outages just like regular consumers. Even worse some gas companies signed up both as critical infrastructure and as interruptible infrastructure which is like trying to have your cake and eat it too.

The evidence is now clear: The gas system started to fail on Feb. 10 five days before the power outages on Feb. 15. It wasn’t the power outages that caused the gas system to fail rather it was gas outages that helped cause the power system to fail.

When wind solar nuclear coal or natural gas power plants underperformed in February they left billions of dollars on the table.

When gas producers and pipelines underperformed some of them still made big profits.

Recent reporting by Bloomberg showed that gas suppliers and pipeline companies made at least an $11 billion windfall over the five-day storm despite massive reduction in supply which reveals an important moral hazard: Gas suppliers can reap financial rewards despite not being reliable.

Natural gas producer Continental Resources in public filings trumpeted a rise in first quarter profit and revenue yet the company’s natural gas production declined compared with the prior year and the company attributed it to the February storm.

It’s essentially a massive transfer of wealth from hard-working consumers — all of us Texans — that in part enriches natural gas producers and leaves us saddled with bills that will take a decade or more to pay off.

Some gas producers then turn around and make hefty political donations to statewide elected regulators and policymakers an encouragement to keep the hands-off approach after politicians turned a blind eye to bad behavior.

And if that means energy reliability doesn’t improve the risk remains that outages will happen again.

By the way the local gas utilities like Atmos did the best they could with the hand they were dealt. They did yeoman’s work to deliver gas to residential customers to keep them from freezing to death but they were caught in a vise by gas supplies as market prices increased by orders of magnitude in a matter of hours. Imagine if grocery stores hiked prices from $3 to $1000 for a container or milk a pack of batteries or a gallon of gasoline. Charging higher amounts for critical resources during an emergency is considered price-gouging and is illegal for most goods. But not natural gas.

Instead of leaping to the defense of gas and making renewables the villain let’s be more honest about the situation. Renewables have their own well-known challenges of course. But after years of gas advocates beating their chests about the reliability of gas it’s time for them to be more honest with us and themselves about the gas system’s underlying fragility.

Before readers accuse me of being some sort of anti-gas activist they should know I have published many pieces arguing that the oil and gas industry is critical to a low-carbon future. I also sit on the board of GTI (formerly known as Gas Technology Institute an industry consortium for the gas industry) and conduct research in collaboration with gas companies.

I am able to think two things simultaneously: 1) Natural gas could and should play a prominent role in our future low-carbon energy system and 2) the gas industry should act responsibly.

Our biggest risk right now is that we’re going to seek the wrong scapegoats and blame the wrong problem and therefore fail to make the right decisions or implement the proper solutions. That will leave us vulnerable to an even bigger electricity failure in the future.

Under rules to be announced on Monday and put in place in October average benefits will rise more than 25 percent from prepandemic levels. All 42 million people in the program will receive additional aid. The move does not require congressional approval and unlike the large pandemic-era expansions which are starting to expire the changes are intended to last.

For at least a decade critics of the benefits have said they were too low to provide an adequate diet. More than three-quarters of households exhaust their benefits in the first half of the monthly cycle and researchers have linked subsequent food shortages to problems as diverse as increased hospital admissions more school suspensions and lower SAT scores.

Under the new rules average monthly benefits $121 per person before the pandemic will rise by $36. Although the increase may seem modest to middle-class families proponents say it will reduce hunger improve nutrition and lead to better health.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDgvMTUvYmlkZW4tY2xpbWF0ZS1mb3NzaWwtZnVlbHMtNTA0NDY00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden's pro-car pro-gasoline moves leave green allies fuming,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/15/biden-climate-fossil-fuels-504464 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDgvMTUvYmlkZW4tY2xpbWF0ZS1mb3NzaWwtZnVlbHMtNTA0NDY00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2phY29iaW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvb2tsYWhvbWEtZ3JlZW4tY29ybi1yZWJlbGxpb24td2FzaGluZ3Rvbi13d2ktdGVuYW50LWZhcm1lci1wb3ZlcnR5LXNvY2lhbGlzdC1wYXJ0eS1yZW50ZXJzLXVuaW9uLXdvcmtpbmctY2xhc3MtdW5pb24td2N10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When Oklahoma Was the Heartland of American Socialism,"In the winter of 1915 the socialist journalist and publisher John Kenneth Turner traveled through southern Oklahoma to report on the conditions of poor tenant farmers. “On this little journey” he wrote in a dispatch to the socialist weekly Appeal to Reason “I did not find anybody enjoying the benefits of modern civilization in any degree.” A man of wealth would not stable his horse in such houses as these people live in; the food that they eat would be spurned by a well-fed dog. Many of them at this moment are in the actual throes of acute starvation. Many have already been stripped of their poor possessions and turned out in the cold with no shelter nowhere to turn and not a penny in their pockets. And many more will have met the same fate by the time this article reaches the reader. Conditions for Oklahoma tenant farmers further deteriorated over the coming years as World War I precipitated a collapse in cotton prices. When impoverished tenants learned they would be conscripted to fight in that same war they reached a breaking point. In the summer of 1917 hundreds of Oklahoma tenant farmers gathered on the property of John “Old Man” Spears in what had not long ago been Indian Territory. Armed with rifles and squirrel guns they assembled beneath the red flag of socialism. They planned to smash the machinery of conscription at home fighting off inevitable police and vigilantes who would stand in their way. Then they intended to march east recruiting other poor war resisters along the way to the nation’s capital where they would force a reversal of Woodrow Wilson’s draft orders. As far as the rebels were concerned World War I was “a rich man’s war a poor man’s fight.” In Oklahoma Turner had seen barefoot little children forgoing education to work in their indebted parents’ cotton fields. He’d seen an old woman from a tenant family begging a store proprietor to pay her in cash for some chickens “her wasted body shaking with dry sobs” when she was refused. Why should men die far from home on the command of politicians who would neglect them so? The rebels didn’t make it far. Their insurgency known as the Green Corn Rebellion was quickly defeated and the aftermath was brutal. Hundreds were arrested and imprisoned and left-wing radicals of all stripes were persecuted and hounded out of public life. These events led to the discrediting of the Socialist Party of Oklahoma which at the time boasted more members than any state-level socialist party in the nation. As far as the rebels were concerned World War I was ‘a rich man’s war a poor man’s fight.’ But the story of the Green Corn Rebellion isn’t just a tragic tale of foolhardy agitators who doomed their comrades through ill-conceived action. Placed in social and economic context it’s the story of a regional socialist movement so uniquely adapted to its specific environment that it had become synonymous with the cultural life of the region’s laboring class suffusing everything it did. The rebellion was crushed before it even really began in earnest. Even so it remains astonishing that hundreds of poor Oklahoma farmers came together beneath the red flag ready to take on the US government and forcibly end the draft. Ultimately the Green Corn Rebellion is a testament to the success of a regional socialist movement that up to that point was the strongest the United States had ever seen.

Humanity at Its Lowest Before Turner another socialist writer and organizer Oscar Ameringer had arrived in the state in 1907. He observed that tenants’ “standard of living was so far below that of the sweatshop workers of the New York east side that comparison could not be thought of.” They were “as wretched a set of abject slaves as ever walked the face of the earth anywhere or any time.” In southeastern Oklahoma one found “humanity at its lowest possible level of degradation.” According to historian Nigel Anthony Sellars in his introduction to William Cunningham’s novel The Green Corn Rebellion tenant farming began in Oklahoma’s Indian Territory in the late nineteenth century as “mixed-heritage and intermarried citizens of the Five Nations (there Cherokees Chickasaws Choctaws Creek and Seminoles) converted tribal land to large-scale agricultural production.” The tenants primarily came from Texas and Arkansas. They were mostly poor and white though some were black and Native American. All were compelled by landlords to grow cash crops mainly cotton. The first tenants hoped to make enough money to buy farmland of their own. That may have been a pipe dream from the beginning given the intensity of their exploitation but in any case two events happened in 1907 that killed all hope of upward social mobility according to Sellars and historian Jim Bissett in his book Agrarian Socialism in America: Marx Jefferson and Jesus in the Oklahoma Countryside 1904–1920. First the Panic of 1907 sent cotton prices plummeting. Landlords usually received roughly one-quarter of the yield produced by tenant farmers but since this in-kind rent was of reduced value landowners scrambled to make up for lost revenue with rampant real estate speculation. Thus land prices went through the roof at the precise moment that tenants’ income provided by cotton sales declined. The situation left tenants without the means to purchase basic necessities to say nothing of property. To make matters worse the recognition of Oklahoma statehood in 1907 spurred a land grab in Indian Territory. Much of the land which was previously owned in common by tribal governments and had been off-limits to potential white buyers was granted to individual Native American families. Those families could be convinced or if not defrauded or intimidated to sell their land to outside interests. Capitalists many hailing from the East went on a buying spree. Thus a few wealthy owners swiftly consolidated land in the former Indian Territory in southeastern Oklahoma. In this economic climate not only did existing tenants have no means of improving their station but non-tenant small farmers in the region were being converted into tenants at a quick clip. As agricultural capital established itself firmly in the region a cartel of merchants and lenders began squeezing small farmers from all sides plunging them into debt and divesting them of their farms. In the southeast the county tenancy rates were as high as 75 to 80 percent by 1910. Tenants and non-tenants alike endured ruthless manipulation by the agricultural cartel. Poor soil and boll weevil infestations hurt their yield from the outset. Come harvest time farmers would bring their crops to what they called the electric light towns. There they would be greeted by a handful of crop buyers who would lowball them which they could get away with since there were so few buyers compared to the number of increasingly desperate sellers. This oligopsony resulted in artificially low prices across the board. With their pitiful earnings farmers would then go to a merchant selling farm goods — merchants who often employed the same buyers who’d just stiffed them. The merchants would charge outrageously high prices for necessary seed or equipment taking the farmers for all they were worth. In order to keep their farms going for another year farmers would have to take out loans from banks which recognizing their desperation charged usurious rates. “The result is that not one is able to make ends meet year in and year out and not one in one hundred has made ends meet this year” wrote Turner in 1915. “With hardly any exception they are in debt and are never able to get out of debt. In my trip . . . I did not meet nor even hear of but ONE working farmer who was not in debt.” This was the context for the Green Corn Rebellion. But destitution and immiseration are not enough to push people into open rebellion — there must be another element in the mix. And in southeastern Oklahoma that element was socialism.

The Right Man in Front the Farmer In the final decade of the nineteenth century tenant farming was not the only upward trend in Oklahoma. Populism too was on the rise. The short-lived People’s Party gained widespread support by demanding measures that would check the power of agricultural capital and protect poor farmers from predation. In 1890 Oklahoma territory’s first house of representatives was 15 percent Populist. The Oklahoma Populist candidate for Congress outperformed the Democratic Party’s candidate in 1894. In 1896 the Democratic Party successfully neutralized the Populist electoral insurgency by nominating William Jennings Bryan who spoke eloquently to populist concerns as its presidential candidate causing a schism in the party. Coupled with violent repression the schism proved disastrous. But many Oklahomans’ perspectives had been forever altered by their political experiences with Populism and they remained in search of a new political current that gave expression to their frustrations. The Socialist Party of Oklahoma was founded in 1901 but wouldn’t ascend to prominence for several more years. The first real beneficiary of the remaining post-Populist energy was the Indiahoma Farmers’ Union founded in 1904. “Now let’s wake up” said one of the organization’s officials “and get the right man in front that is the farmer not the man that owns hundreds of acres of land and never works a foot of it himself. His interest is not our interest for he is keeping the poor man oppressed to death.” The Indiahoma Farmers’ Union reached a peak of nearly seventy-five thousand members in 1906. By the end of 1907 only three thousand remained. The organization had collapsed after it failed to respond effectively to the Panic of 1907 — and as yet again overtures from the Democratic Party were welcomed by some and rejected by others. Committed socialists were wary of organizing tenant farmers as it cut against Marxist orthodoxy which placed a special emphasis on the industrial working class and generally understood small farmers to be a reactionary social force. But for many the encounter was radicalizing rather than demoralizing. Through their experience in the Farmers’ Union Oklahoma farmers “achieved a rare sophistication in their understanding of how agrarian capitalism worked” writes Bissett “and deepened their sense of entitlement to the promise of democracy.” The energy of the collapsed Farmers’ Union spilled over into the Socialist Party of Oklahoma (SPO) which was linked to a national party apparatus whose star was rising due in no small part to the decline of Populism and the oratory skill of movement leaders like Eugene Debs and Kate Richards O’Hare. Some in the SPO were frustrated by what they viewed as the weak progressivism of the new recruits. One officer said that the “alleged Socialists” entering the party were “nothing but populistic reformers who are possessed of the ‘good man’ hallucination the belief that honest and moral men can relieve the working class and at the same time maintain the system that is exploiting them.” Committed socialists were also wary of organizing tenant farmers as it cut against Marxist orthodoxy which placed a special emphasis on the industrial working class and generally understood small farmers to be a reactionary social force. But by 1908 some Oklahoma socialists had begun to argue it was politically negligent to ignore the combination of Oklahoma tenant farmers’ deep immiseration and passionate populist leanings. Swayed by this perspective the SPO wrote “land planks” into its platform addressed to the needs of tenant farmers and indebted smallholders and then proceeded to set up an organization the Oklahoma Renters’ Union to organize them. By 1910 observes historian Jim Green in his book Grass-Roots Socialism: Radical Movements in the Southwest 1895–1943 the SPO’s “farm program” had become a contentious issue for socialists nationally who reasoned that farmers were insufficiently proletarian to organize into a revolutionary bloc and that the land planks were more agrarian-populist than socialist. But in Oklahoma it was taken for granted that poor farmers were both exploited and militant and should be expressly organized against Marxist convention. An appealing program and institutional infrastructure alone wouldn’t accomplish that organization however and so the SPO also sought to develop a corresponding culture that would appeal to tenant farmers. Thus a highly syncretic form of regional socialism emerged combining evangelical customs and Christian scripture with socialist organizing and messaging. Over the next several years the Socialist Party hosted well-attended “encampments” all across the countryside. The meetings intentionally resembled tent revivals. These encampments which took place each summer gave socialist organizers “an unusual collective forum through which they could appeal to a generally captive audience of largely isolated farmers and workers” writes Green. Their programming consisted of rousing speeches from well-known radicals like Eugene Debs and Mother Jones sermons from socialist preachers open meetings where farmers could air their grievances and festivities at which campers often sang Christian hymns adapted with socialist lyrics. Ameringer recalled: After the night meetings discussions around the glowing campfire continued on into the small hours. For these people radicalism was not an intellectual plaything. Pressure was upon them. Many of their homesteads were already under mortgage. Some had already been lost by foreclosure. They were looking for delivery from the eastern monster whose lair they saw in Wall Street. They took to their socialism like a new religion. And they fought and sacrificed for the spreading of the new faith like the martyrs of other faiths. The SPO’s tripartite strategy of targeted platform demands devoted organizing infrastructure and cultural programming paid off as the next several years saw massive growth and electoral success. In 1914 the party had twelve thousand dues-paying members — more than the state of New York at the time — and a robust press ecosystem with dozens of weekly newspapers. Also in 1914 the party elected 175 candidates to office statewide including six to the state legislature. And southeast Oklahoma with the highest concentration of tenant farmers was the party’s stronghold. But while the SPO was making electoral advances it lacked a sufficient majority to practically reverse the fortunes of poor farmers. The Renters’ Union could do little about the decline in cotton prices caused by World War I market closures. Additionally a campaign of repression against the SPO spearheaded by capitalists and their allies in the Democratic Party intensified in 1916. Landlords and creditors received lists of registered socialists from Democratic Party registrars and began blacklisting them driving them to destitution or forcing them to migrate elsewhere. In 1917 news of the nation’s entry into World War I and rumors of a coming draft began to spread throughout the countryside. The Socialist Party was vocally opposed to World War I draft measures and continued to reiterate its intention to build enough power to improve conditions for tenant farmers. But the party’s opposition to conscription was not enough to secure the loyalty and discipline of distressed farmers who were terrified of the draft and had little to lose. Instead of planning their next move through the Socialist Party of Oklahoma a cohort of desperate and militant tenant farmers in the state’s southeast took matters into their own hands.

The Green Corn Rebellion Alongside the ascendant Socialist Party of Oklahoma arose another organization the Working Class Union. The WCU was formed in 1914 and before long the Kansas-based Appeal to Reason observed that it was “growing with the marvellous rapidity that characterised the formation of the revolutionary clubs that battered down the Bastille in Paris and overthrew the feudal lords of France.” Unlike the SPO the WCU operated in secret and engaged in direct-action tactics vowing to abolish rent and prevent foreclosures “by any means necessary.” The group was influenced by and had much in common with the Wobblies though its members were denied entry into the International Workers of the World on account of the contention that farmers were not wage workers. Wobblies were in theory committed to nonviolent direct action. In this regard the WCU was another species altogether. The WCU’s leadership was unafraid not only to destroy property but also to threaten hurt or even kill landlords creditors agricultural merchants scabs and collaborators. Already by 1915 the group had shown a fondness for dynamite. Many SPO leaders were privately supportive of the WCU’s militancy but the party declined to make a formal endorsement for fear of inviting state repression. Still SPO members began to join the WCU in “night riding” missions to threaten predatory landowners creditors and merchants. As the SPO’s Renters’ Union floundered the clandestine WCU absorbed many of its members growing to twenty thousand by 1917 with a stronghold in southeastern Oklahoma. On the brink of starvation tenant farmers began to rob banks. This had happened before in Oklahoma bank robberies coming in waves as tenants’ desperation peaked but the difference now was that the activity was politicized by the WCU as an expression of political radicalism. Despite disagreeing on tactics established socialists in the region mostly withheld criticism with the Appeal reasoning that the banks were “in the robbery business too.” Through their exposure to the organized socialist movement poor farmers in southeast Oklahoma had adopted a posture of wholesale opposition to US involvement in World War I which they usually articulated in class terms. Their sentiment mirrored that of Eugene Debs who wrote in the Appeal in 1915 “I will refuse to obey any order to fight for the ruling class but I will not wait for a command to fight for the working class.” This rural class of laboring farmers made more conscious by the SPO and more combative by the WCU was now poised for rebellion. When the draft order came down from President Wilson it came due. The hundreds-strong group that assembled at “Old Man” Spears’s property in August of 1917 was connected to and influenced by the WCU but was self-organized and bound together by deeper older affiliations. Many belonged to a secret radical group called the Jones Family immigrants from Missouri whose ancestors had violently resisted the Confederate draft. “In 1917” notes Green “they were simply carrying on a long tradition of self-defense.” “Some members of the Family were Socialists” Green writes “others were Democrats angry at Wilson’s breach of faith. And others were illiterate nonpartisan tenants who simply thought the draft violated their rights. They were determined to resist being taken away from their families and sent far away to fight a bloody war they neither knew nor cared anything about.” On August 2 word of simmering unrest reached the Seminole County sheriff who set out to investigate. Along the way he and his deputies were ambushed by five black members of the Jones Family and beat a hasty retreat. That night a WCU member called a secret meeting and by morning WCU members SPO members and Jones Family rebels — there being a great deal of overlap between the three — had convened at Spears’s farm. The Oklahoma ‘red scare’ took what was arguably the strongest socialist movement in the country at that time and broke it beyond all hope of repair. Together they devised a plan. They would not fight in Wilson’s war. They would use every tool at their disposal to sabotage the local infrastructure and machinery necessary to conscript them into service and then they would march on Washington DC recruiting other war resisters along the way to force the end of the draft. They planned to live on ripe corn in the fields as they marched east giving the uprising its name. They were explicitly socialist in their aims cursing warmongers and capitalists in the same breath and talking of full-on revolution. The socialist writer William Cunningham fictionalized this meeting in his novel The Green Corn Rebellion describing the coming insurrection: A line of men marching through the fields cutting fences and turning cattle loose burning bridges and cutting telephone lines. Taking over towns and dragging bankers out of their chairs and printing the truth in newspapers and telling the poor to come in and be issued what they needed from the local stores and marching on and meeting the enemy fighting at crossroads and bridges and in the timber. That was the vision and they wasted no time realizing it. Night raiders traversed Seminole County burning railroad bridges and cutting telephone and telegraph wires. Without these they reasoned officials would not be able to coordinate their conscription. They also sent parties to recruit rebels from the neighboring counties putting up posters which read: Now is the time to rebel against this war with Germany boys. Get together boys and don’t go. Rich mans war. Poor mans fight. If you dont go J.P. Morgan Co. is lost. Speculation is the only cause of the war. Rebel now. The next day recruits came from neighboring counties including a group of Native Americans led by socialist and WCU organizer John Harjo a relative of the Creek fighter Crazy Snake who had led the last anti-settler rebellion in Indian Territory only eight years prior. More black sharecroppers members of the WCU were also among the activated rebels. At Spears’s farm they stood shoulder to shoulder with poor whites prepared to violently confront the US government. But unbeknownst to them a mob of seventy townspeople had assembled to stop them in their tracks. When the posse arrived at Spears’s farm it overpowered the rebels easily. The scene was anticlimactic; nobody was even killed in the fighting. One rebel explained why their army collapsed so quickly: The papers said we were cowards but we weren’t. Some of the men in the posse were neighbors of ours and we couldn’t shoot ’em down in cold blood. That’s the way we felt ’bout the Germans too. . . . We didn’t have no quarrel with them at all. Over the coming week law enforcement and volunteers rounded up every suspected participant in the Green Corn Rebellion arresting 450 people. Thus the great march east ended before it began. The subsequent repression was severe with far-reaching and devastating consequences for socialists in Oklahoma."

Rem Koolhaas is a Pritzker Architecture Prize winner the founder of OMA Design Group and is seen by many as one of the most significant architects and urbanists of his generation. Koolhaas’ most notable pupils include the great Zaha Hadid. After discussing various options AMEX and Koolhaas quickly chose the architect’s Boompjes project for the Rem Koolhaas x Centurion Art Card. The project was created as a high-profile commission to redevelop a district in Rotterdam Netherlands which was decimated by bombings during the second world war. The silk-screen drawings for the project embodied a “vision for better living” and paid homage to OMA which was founded in Rotterdam in 1980 besides the unbuilt Boompjes plot. The unfinished project has now found closure on the new Centurion card. “This was a groundbreaking project for myself and for OMA and it was exciting to dive back into it and capture its dynamics in the new design for the Centurion Card” Koolhaas commented.

Kehinde Wiley is an American portrait painter based out of New York City who was chosen to paint the official portrait of former U.S president Barack Obama. The Kehinde Wiley x Centurion Art Card incorporates botanical motifs from the artist’s painting of Princess Victoire of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha which is part of his famous An Economy of Grace series dedicated to celebrating African-American women. The portraits feature custom-made couture gowns designed by Riccardo Tisci who was with Givenchy at the time. “An important part of my work is the decorative organic background of the person being portrayed. The design on the Centurion Card stems from my interest in botanical elements and is a reference to my signature style” explains Wiley.

The final option includes unisex Prada Centurion wrist wear. The leather piece is made of scratch-resistant black saffiàno leather and includes a hidden payment chip.

Her experience wasn’t uncommon. People working at the tourism guide Lonely Planet the travel site The Points Guy and the health and medical information site Healthline were similarly blindsided in recent years when Red Ventures bought up special interest publications in a multibillion-dollar shopping spree.

At the end of 1980 OMA was asked by the city of Rotterdam to conduct a study of high rise building in the city and to illustrate the investigations with a planning proposal for a site in the centre. In consultation with the Town Planning Department a site was selected on the Maasboulevard along near the Maasbridges.



We see the angle between the river and the lower side of the grid as a 'hinge' between the city and the river. Here the river is closest to the centre. The shifting of the centre through the injection of gigantic buildings in the second reconstruction makes this point most suitable to take over the role of the 'window' in the disclosing of the riverfront.



The site is peculiar. On one hand it is embedded in a network of traffic lanes like the new suspension bridge across the Maas whose approach makes its way into the city through two inexplicable twists. On the other hand there lies a unique opportunity to connect the river with the city. The city is visible but hardly accessible; any structure will be noted in passing at bewilderingly different speeds and angles.



The design in its context

The building and the bridge are designed as an undetachable whole. Built as a composition of towers inserted in a slab the project carries on the experiments in slaboid mutations and new building types that were done after the war in the bombed areas. It forms a transparent screen along the riverfront.



On the riverside the screen acts as a row of stone towers against a glass horizon introducing a skyline in the Rotterdam skyline and on the city side it acts as a stone slab with glass towers and slits that portray pieces of the river.



Due to their different angles the glass surfaces on the city side reflect the light in different directions and mostly they only reflect air and water not buildings.



The building is designed toward the kinetic experience caused by the passing of the site with different speeds across the bridges and the boulevard: The towers all have a different angle to the slab: some fall backwards others are contained others twist away and the steel tower has altogether escaped.



The average height of the building in 72 meters. For a tower this is not so high for a slab it is (according to Dutch standards). The composition of these elements in this project claims a fair height to be effective in the skyline of the Rotterdam harbour where the juxtaposition of extremely high constructions with lower city districts is a frequently appearing image.



Two Structures for Rotterdam 1980-81

The centre of Rotterdam was bombed in 1940: overnight it was turned into a 3 kilometer wide crater. Few buildings survived – one of them (the so-called White House) a 54 meter tower built in 1898 that was for twenty years Europe’s tallest building.



Immediately Rotterdam architects started to plan the eventual ‘reconstruction’ project which began during the war which is still incomplete. During the 1950s the new Rotterdam became a paradigm: a CIAM city of slabs that were tied together by a Team X-like ‘connective tissue’ by Bakema the Lijnbaan.



In the 1960s and 1970s that emblematic architecture was discredited: on the periphery of the centre on the other side of the railway track a second revisionist reconstruction was started – an assembly of buildings by Piet Blom (a small forest of his tree houses) Bakema and others.



The new reconstruction was the absolute opposite of the 1950s effort: where they were sober ordered and logical; the new city was chaotic and obsessively humanist. The two cities are separated by a ‘fault’ formed by a railway line and a highway that both cross the river at this point. The separation is further reinforced by a new suspension bridge across the Maas whose approach makes its way into the city through two inexplicable twists.



Now that the city nears completion the riverfront – more precisely the so-called Maasboulevard a curved dike that protects the rest of the city – remains under-exploited and is one of the last frontiers for further development.



The two structures for Rotterdam are located exactly at this point; they form a ‘cornerstone’ of the old ‘modern’ centre and face across the fault the multitude of anti-modernist revisions.



This project had a triple purpose: to activate the riverfront; to propose a ‘solution’ for the bridgehead of the old bridge that will become redundant after the inauguration of the new one; and to suggest an apartment building for a site against the old bridge.



The site is peculiar: one side is quayside the other is formed by a riverside highway one the side of a bridge. It is visible but hardly accessible; any structure on it will be noted in passing at bewilderingly different speeds and angles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8wOC8xNC9leGNsdXNpdmUtYXJ0d29yay1yZXZlYWxlZC1mb3ItYW1leC1jZW50dXJpb24tbG91bmdlLWF0LWhlYXRocm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: artwork revealed for Amex Centurion lounge at Heathrow – Business Traveller,"Business Traveller can reveal that American Express has commissioned renowned artwork service Elegant Clutter to curate a collection of pieces at its long-awaited Centurion lounge at Heathrow T3.

We had published images of the artwork here taken from a page on the Elegant Clutter website which has since been removed. We have been contacted with a request to remove them for now as the exact makeup of the collection is still being determined and have respected this request.

The page confirmed that “American Express worked with Elegant Clutter to commission and curate a collection of artwork for their guests pleasure” adding that “Our Art Story consultants researched and briefed suitable art partners to collaborate with to create the perfect ambience for the space”.

The firm also confirmed that the collection will include works by “renowned celebrity photographer Norman Parkinson mixed media art from Stephen Marshall and architectural pencil drawings from Minty Sainsbury”.

Guests will be able to scan QR codes on plaques next to each work directing them to a website with biographies of the artists.

In addition Elegant Clutter has created its own artwork for the lounge “celebrating the many facets of London old and new”. These include “A hand-embroidered interpretation of the London Underground” and an Elton John likeness “designed to capture the traveller’s attention”.

American Express first announced plans for a Centurion lounge at Heathrow T3 in 2018. The facility had originally been slated to open in 2019 but it has been delayed by the onset of Covid-19 and the temporary closure of Terminal 3 in April last year.

Heathrow Terminal 3 has now reopened to passengers with Delta and Virgin Atlantic among the first carriers to return to the terminal.

No1 Lounges also reopened its T3 facility at the end of July but as yet there has been no confirmed date for the unveiling of the Centurion lounge.

Elegant Clutter also created the artwork for the new Fellows House Cambridge Curio Collection by Hilton which will be reviewed in the September/October 2021 edition of Business Traveller.

How exactly did the militant group do it? Understanding how the Taliban accomplished its lightning-fast encirclement of the capital as well as the next phase of the conflict requires understanding the group’s strategy in terms of “operational art.” The Taliban of 2021 is not the same as the Taliban of the 1990s. This Taliban is now adept at integrating military and non-military instruments of power in pursuit of its political objectives.

The Afghan government didn’t lose the fight because most US military forces withdrew from the country. Instead the government’s troops were outmaneuvered by a more adaptive military organization. The Taliban delineated specific objectives and lines of effort to hollow out the Afghan security forces and conduct a strategic encirclement of Kabul designed to force the government to capitulate.

The concept of operational art forms the blueprint for military campaigns translating political objectives and strategy into tactical actions on the battlefield. A group need not study Clausewitz and Western military history or attend a modern military staff college to develop such an art. As the Taliban has demonstrated it need only rely on an overarching theory of victory to guide its actions.

Over time the Taliban has evolved into a military group capable of advancing along multiple lines of effort. The shadowy insurgent network deft at executing rural ambushes and planting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) has been replaced by a complex organization managing as many as 80000 fighters who are even more skilled at using social media than AK-47s. Their operational art combines information operations including appeals from tribal elders alongside text messages and Twitter with decentralized orders that allow local commanders who know the terrain and politics in their areas to identify opportunities for taking the initiative. When Taliban forces achieve military success they reinforce those advances with mobile reserve exploitation forces—hordes of commandos on motorcycles—allowing the group to maintain tempo on the battlefield.

The Taliban’s overarching objective has not changed for years: seize control of Afghanistan and re-establish an Islamic Emirate. During the current military campaign the group was pragmatic about this objective. Success could come in the form of pure military victory or a more complex negotiated settlement that left the group in the seat of power and the administration in Kabul expats or prisoners. This pragmatism reflects the Taliban’s understanding that the group cannot govern Afghanistan the same way it did in the 1990s. The Taliban will be harsh and roll back human rights but it will seek to keep the country connected to the world and the aid dollars flowing. The group likely wants to avoid repeating the governance failures of the 1990s by calling for many government officials to remain in technical positions and ensure that basic services and the economy continue functioning. Taliban fighters have seized key economic terrain such as border-crossing points granting themselves enough funds to govern a country of almost forty million people.

To achieve their objective the Taliban’s military campaign relied on four lines of effort:

1. Isolating the Afghan military

The collapse of the Afghan security forces was a result of operational-level isolation. In US Army doctrine isolation involves sealing off an enemy both physically and psychologically from its base of support—denying them freedom of movement and preventing reinforcement. The Taliban took a deliberate approach to isolating its foe at the operational level for more than eighteen months by taking advantage of fundamental weaknesses in the posture of Afghan security forces.

Initially the Afghan government focused on holding terrain through checkpoints and small outposts scattered across the country. From a political standpoint this posture allowed Ghani who struggled to win broad-based political support to appeal to different political groups and say he was denying the Taliban terrain.

But the military reality was the opposite: The approach dispersed units across the country and rendered them unable to mutually reinforce one another. The Taliban exploited this vulnerability disrupting ground lines of communication in an effort to further isolate the checkpoints and set the conditions for the defeat of Afghan forces. As the checkpoints became dependent on getting new supplies by air resupply missions strained an already overstretched Afghan Air Force. As a result maintenance issues grounded more aircraft than anti-aircraft fire did.

The net result was a series of outposts where Afghan forces were often without food water or ammunition breeding discontent disillusionment and a broken air force to boot.

2. Targeting cohesion through threats and texts

With Afghan security forces—which likely outnumbered the Taliban by three to one—isolated the Taliban increased activities along a second line of effort: the use of tailored propaganda and information operations to undermine morale and cohesion. Morale and the will to fight are critical intangibles in war—as practitioners ranging from Sun Tzu to Napoleon have observed. The Taliban further sealed off physically isolated Afghan security forces through a sophisticated psychological-warfare campaign.

The insurgents flooded social media with images that offered surrounded Afghan security forces a Hobson’s choice: Surrender and live—or die and wonder if the Taliban will kill your family next. More than 70 percent of the Afghan population has access to cell phones and the Taliban has adapted accordingly—using modern Russian-style information warfare that deploys fake accounts and bots to spread its messages and undermine the Afghan government.

The group combined the new with the old as well using appeals from tribal elders alongside text messages to compel Afghan security forces to surrender. As outposts crumbled the Taliban sustained its momentum on the battlefield using captured military equipment not only to resupply its forces but also to exploit images of the surrender for additional propaganda.

Put yourself in the shoes of an Afghan soldier: You are in a combat outpost running out of food and ammunition fighting for an unpopular government and forced to pay bribes due to endemic corruption. As you look at your cell phone all you see are images of fellow soldiers surrendering. Even if you opt to fight your morale and will to fight have been undermined.

3. Practicing a new form of terror: kill and compel

The Taliban used terror to further undermine confidence in the government and degrade Kabul’s ability to fight. Whereas the insurgents once relied on high-value attacks using vehicle-borne IEDs to terrorize the population and strike at the government in the lead-up to this latest campaign they shifted their tactics to a war in the shadows that proved more effective in undermining the legitimacy of the Afghan government.

Over the last two years the Taliban has employed a covert assassination campaign to target civil-society leaders and key military personnel such as pilots. The intermediate military objective was twofold. First it amplified the Taliban’s strategic messaging that Ghani’s regime could not secure Afghanistan. Everyone knew the Taliban was behind most of the assassinations but the fact that it didn’t take credit for them made the killings seem more insidious. Second the best way to destroy an air force is on the ground. Lacking sophisticated air-defense weapons the Taliban opted to undermine the Afghan Air Force by killing pilots in their homes—a crude but effective variant of the practice of high-value individual targeting. These attacks were designed to compel other Afghan pilots to abandon their posts.

4. Negotiating to buy time and constrain military power

The Taliban integrated diplomacy with its military campaign in a way that both Afghan security forces and the United States struggled to replicate. War is a continuation of politics. Any battlefield activity in which the operational logic isn’t connected to clearly defined political objectives will prove self-defeating.

The Taliban took advantage of the peace deal negotiated largely bilaterally between its representatives and the United States under former President Donald Trump. In excluding the Afghan government the agreement undermined the Ghani administration politically and made it difficult to maintain unity of effort between partners in the counterinsurgency campaign. The Taliban used the cover of the peace deal to move into position across the country surrounding key districts and provincial centers while also using the negotiation process to limit US military power. Each round of diplomatic talks constrained America’s ability to attack Taliban targets.

If there was a critical turning point in the conflict it was the peace deal signed under Trump: Without it the Taliban would have struggled to isolate the Afghan military and set the conditions for its rapid advance on Kabul. Likewise the deal signaled to regional actors that they needed to hedge their bets and start making provisions for the end of the Ghani regime in Afghanistan.

The next phase

All wars must end. But how they end matters and can determine the character of future conflicts and their ability to spread beyond borders.

The complete collapse of the Afghan security forces increases the likelihood that regional actors will engage the Taliban shifting from proxy support to open political relations with the group. These interactions will be transactional exchanges as states like Iran and Pakistan secure their borders and security interests while countries such as Russia China and Afghanistan’s Central Asian neighbors advance their economic interests and try to limit refugee flows and what could prove to be a complex humanitarian emergency.

In the transition period regional states and great powers will determine whether or not to fund rival centers of power in Afghanistan to balance the Taliban—an unlikely prospect in the short-term given the success of the Taliban campaign. More immediately regional actors will increasingly view Afghanistan through a counterterrorism lens and shift their attention to groups such as ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) a mutual enemy of states in the region and the Taliban.

In this environment US policy will need to focus on averting a humanitarian catastrophe and developing viable options for pursuing American counterterrorism goals. The war in Afghanistan is displacing hundreds of thousands of people in the middle of a pandemic and a severe drought affecting the region. Humanitarian concerns and terrorism are not mutually exclusive. Groups such as ISIS-K will prey on the post-conflict security crisis to radicalize a new generation of followers who feel abandoned by Western institutions. Other actors such as Russia and Belarus will take advantage of refugee flows to further polarize politics in Europe. The United States and its partners will need to shift from supporting a fallen regime to preventing the Taliban’s military victory from fueling unrest in new forms.

Nations like individuals tell stories in order to understand what they are where they come from and what they want to be. National narratives like personal ones are prone to sentimentality grievance pride shame self-blindness. There is never just one—they compete and constantly change. The most durable narratives are not the ones that stand up best to fact-checking. They’re the ones that address our deepest needs and desires. Americans know by now that democracy depends on a baseline of shared reality—when facts become fungible we’re lost. But just as no one can live a happy and productive life in nonstop self-criticism nations require more than facts—they need stories that convey a moral identity. The long gaze in the mirror has to end in self-respect or it will swallow us up.

Tracing the evolution of these narratives can tell you something about a nation’s possibilities for change. Through much of the 20th century the two political parties had clear identities and told distinct stories. The Republicans spoke for those who wanted to get ahead and the Democrats spoke for those who wanted a fair shake. Republicans emphasized individual enterprise and Democrats emphasized social solidarity eventually including Black people and abandoning the party’s commitment to Jim Crow. But unlike today the two parties were arguing over the same recognizable country. This arrangement held until the late ’60s—still within living memory.

The two parties reflected a society that was less free than today less tolerant and far less diverse with fewer choices but with more economic equality more shared prosperity and more political cooperation. Liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats played important roles in their respective parties. Americans then were more uniform than we are in what they ate (tuna noodle casserole) and what they watched (Bullitt). Even their bodies looked more alike. They were more restrained than we are more repressed—though restraint and repression were coming undone by 1968.

Since then the two parties have just about traded places. By the turn of the millennium the Democrats were becoming the home of affluent professionals while the Republicans were starting to sound like populist insurgents. We have to understand this exchange in order to grasp how we got to where we are.

George Packer: Can civics save America?

The 1970s ended postwar bipartisan middle-class America and with it the two relatively stable narratives of getting ahead and the fair shake. In their place four rival narratives have emerged four accounts of America’s moral identity. They have roots in history but they are shaped by new ways of thinking and living. They reflect schisms on both sides of the divide that has made us two countries extending and deepening the lines of fracture. Over the past four decades the four narratives have taken turns exercising influence. They overlap morph into one another attract and repel one another. None can be understood apart from the others because all four emerge from the same whole.

Call the first narrative “Free America.” In the past half century it’s been the most politically powerful of the four. Free America draws on libertarian ideas which it installs in the high-powered engine of consumer capitalism. The freedom it champions is very different from Alexis de Tocqueville’s art of self-government. It’s personal freedom without other people—the negative liberty of “Don’t tread on me.”

The conservative movement began to dominate the Republican Party in the 1970s and then much of the country after 1980 with the presidency of Ronald Reagan. As the historian George H. Nash observed it uneasily wove together several strands of thought. One was traditionalist a reaction against the utopian plans and moral chaos of modern secular civilization. The traditionalists were sin-fearing Protestants orthodox Catholics southern agrarians would-be aristocrats alienated individualists—dissidents in postwar America. They were appalled by the complacent vulgarity of the semi-educated masses. Their hero was Edmund Burke the avatar of conservative restraint and their enemy was John Dewey the philosopher of American democracy. The traditionalists’ elitism put them at odds with the main currents of American life—the one passage of American history that most appealed to them was the quasi-feudal Old South—but their writings inspired the next generation of conservatives including William F. Buckley Jr. who introduced the first issue of National Review in 1955 with the famous command to “Stand athwart history yelling Stop. ”

Adjacent to the traditionalists were the anti-Communists. Many of them were former Marxists such as Whittaker Chambers and James Burnham who carried their apocalyptic baggage with them when they moved from left to right. Politics for them was nothing less than the titanic struggle between good and evil God and man. The main target of their energy was the ameliorative creed of Eleanor Roosevelt and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. good old liberalism which they believed to be a paler communism—“the ideology of Western suicide” Burnham called it. The anti-Communists like the traditionalists were skeptics of democracy—its softness would doom it to destruction when World War III broke out. If these hectoring pessimists were the sum of modern conservatism the movement would have died of joylessness by 1960.

The libertarians were different. They slipped more easily into the American stream. In their insistence on freedom they could claim to be descendants of Locke Jefferson and the classical liberal tradition. Some of them interpreted the Constitution as a libertarian document for individual and states’ rights under a limited federal government not as a framework for the strengthened nation that the authors of The Federalist Papers thought they were creating. Oddly the most influential libertarians were Europeans especially the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek whose polemic against collectivism The Road to Serfdom was a publishing sensation in America in 1944 during the most dramatic mobilization of economic resources by state power in history.

What distinguished libertarians from conventional pro-business Republicans was their pure and uncompromising idea. What was it? Hayek: “Planning leads to dictatorship.” The purpose of government is to secure individual rights and little else. One sip of social welfare and free government dies. A 1937 Supreme Court decision upholding parts of the New Deal was the beginning of America’s decline and fall. Libertarians were in rebellion against the mid-century mixed-economy consensus. In spirit they were more radical than conservative. No compromise with Social Security administrators and central bankers! Death to Keynesian fiscal policy!

Lucy Jones

Despite or because of the purity of their idea libertarians made common cause with segregationists and racism informed their political movement from the beginning. Their first hero Senator Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964 as an insurgent against his own party’s establishment while opposing the civil-rights bill on states’-rights grounds.

The first two strands of the conservative movement—elitist traditionalism and anti-communism—remained part of its DNA for half a century. Eventually the American people made their preference for taking pleasures where they wanted clear and the first faded while the end of the Cold War rendered the second obsolete. But libertarianism stretches all the way to the present. James Burnham is mostly forgotten but I’ve met Ayn Rand fanatics everywhere—among Silicon Valley venture capitalists at the office of the Tampa Bay Tea Party on a road-paving crew. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan (who read Atlas Shrugged in high school) brought Rand’s pitiless philosophy of egoism to policy making on Capitol Hill. Libertarianism speaks to the American myth of the self-made man and the lonely pioneer on the plains. (Glorification of men is a recurring feature.) Like Marxism it is a complete explanatory system. It appeals to supersmart engineers and others who never really grow up.

How did Free America become the dogma of the Republican Party and set the terms of American politics for years? Like any great political change this one depended on ideas an authentic connection with people’s lives and timing. Just as there would have been no Roosevelt revolution without the Great Depression there would have been no Reagan revolution without the 1970s. After years of high inflation with high unemployment gas shortages chaos in liberal cities and epic government corruption and incompetence by 1980 a large audience of Americans was ready to listen when Milton and Rose Friedman in a book and 10-part public-television series called Free to Choose blamed the country’s decline on business regulations and other government interventions in the market.

But it took the alchemy of that year’s Republican nominee to transform the cold formula of tax cuts and deregulation into the warm vision of America as “the shining city on a hill”—land of the Pilgrims beacon to a desperate world. In Reagan’s rhetoric leveraged buyouts somehow rhymed with the spirit of New England town meetings. Reagan made Free America sound like the promised land a place where all were welcome to pursue happiness. The descendants of Jefferson’s yeoman farmers with their desire for independence became sturdy car-company executives and investment bankers yearning to breathe free of big government.

In 1980 the first year I cast a vote I feared and hated Reagan. Listening to his words 40 years later I can hear their eloquence and understand their appeal as long as I tune out many other things. Chief among them is Reagan’s half-spoken message to white Americans: Government helps only those people. Legal segregation was barely dead when Free America using the libertarian language of individualism and property rights pushed the country into its long decline in public investment. The advantages for business were easy to see. As for ordinary people the Republican Party reckoned that some white Americans would rather go without than share the full benefits of prosperity with their newly equal Black compatriots.

The majority of Americans who elected Reagan president weren’t told that Free America would break unions and starve social programs or that it would change antitrust policy to bring a new age of monopoly making Walmart Citigroup Google and Amazon the J.P. Morgan and Standard Oil of a second Gilded Age. They had never heard of Charles and David Koch—heirs to a family oil business libertarian billionaires who would pour money into the lobbies and propaganda machines and political campaigns of Free America on behalf of corporate power and fossil fuels. Freedom sealed a deal between elected officials and business executives: campaign contributions in exchange for tax cuts and corporate welfare. The numerous scandals of the 1980s exposed the crony capitalism that lay at the heart of Free America.

The shining city on a hill was supposed to replace remote big government with a community of energetic and compassionate citizens all engaged in a project of national renewal. But nothing held the city together. It was hollow at the center a collection of individuals all wanting more. It saw Americans as entrepreneurs employees investors taxpayers and consumers—everything but citizens.

In the Declaration of Independence freedom comes right after equality. For Reagan and the narrative of Free America it meant freedom from government and bureaucrats. It meant the freedom to run a business without regulation to pay workers whatever wage the market would bear to break a union to pass all your wealth on to your children to buy out an ailing company with debt and strip it for assets to own seven houses—or to go homeless. But a freedom that gets rid of all obstructions is impoverished and it degrades people.

Real freedom is closer to the opposite of breaking loose. It means growing up and acquiring the ability to participate fully in political and economic life. The obstructions that block this ability are the ones that need to be removed. Some are external: institutions and social conditions. Others are embedded in your character and get in the way of governing yourself thinking for yourself and even knowing what is true. These obstructions crush the individuality that freedom lovers cherish making them conformist submissive a group of people all shouting the same thing—easy marks for a demagogue.

Rather than finding new policies to rebuild declining communities Republicans mobilized anger and despair while offering up scapegoats.

Reagan cared more about the functions of self-government than his most ideological supporters. He knew how to persuade and when to compromise. But once he was gone and the Soviet Union not long after him Free America lost the narrative thread. Without Reagan’s smile and the Cold War’s clarity its vision grew darker and more extreme. Its spirit became flesh in the person of Newt Gingrich the most influential politician of the past half century. There was nothing conservative about Gingrich. He came to Congress not to work within the institution or even to change it but to tear it down in order to seize power. With the Gingrich revolution the term government shutdown entered the lexicon and politics became a forever war. (Gingrich himself liked to quote Mao’s definition of politics as “war without blood.”) His tactics turned the goal of limited and efficient government into the destruction of government. Without a positive vision his party used power to hold on to power and fatten corporate allies. Corruption—financial political intellectual moral—set in like dry rot in a decaying log.

The aggressive new populism of talk radio and cable news did not have the “conservative orderly heart” that Norman Mailer had once found in the mainstream Republicans of the 1960s. It mocked self-government—both the political and the personal kind. It was rife with destructive impulses. It fed on rage and celebrity culture. The quality of Free America’s leaders steadily deteriorated—falling from Reagan to Gingrich to Ted Cruz from William F. Buckley to Ann Coulter to Sean Hannity—with no bottom.

While the sunny narrative of Free America shone on its policies eroded the way of life of many of its adherents. The disappearance of secure employment and small businesses destroyed communities. The civic associations that Tocqueville identified as the antidote to individualism died with the jobs. When towns lost their Main Street drugstores and restaurants to Walgreens and Wendy’s in the mall out on the highway they also lost their Rotary Club and newspaper—the local institutions of self-government. This hollowing-out exposed them to an epidemic of aloneness physical and psychological. Isolation bred distrust in the old sources of authority—school church union bank media.

Government which did so little for ordinary Americans was still the enemy along with “governing elites.” But for the sinking working class freedom lost whatever economic meaning it had once had. It was a matter of personal dignity identity. Members of this class began to see trespassers everywhere and embraced the slogan of a defiant and armed loneliness: Get the fuck off my property. Take this mask and shove it. It was the threatening image of a coiled rattlesnake: “Don’t tread on me.” It achieved its ultimate expression on January 6 in all those yellow Gadsden flags waving around the Capitol—a mob of freedom-loving Americans taking back their constitutional rights by shitting on the floors of Congress and hunting down elected representatives to kidnap and kill. That was their freedom in its pure and reduced form.

A character in Jonathan Franzen’s 2010 novel Freedom puts it this way: “If you don’t have money you cling to your freedoms all the more angrily. Even if smoking kills you even if you can’t afford to feed your kids even if your kids are getting shot down by maniacs with assault rifles. You may be poor but the one thing nobody can take away from you is the freedom to fuck up your life.” The character is almost paraphrasing Barack Obama’s notorious statement at a San Francisco fundraiser about the way working-class white Americans “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.” The thought wasn’t mistaken but the condescension was self-incriminating. It showed why Democrats couldn’t fathom that people might “vote against their interests.” Guns and religion were the authentic interests of millions of Americans. Trade and immigration had left some of them worse off. And if the Democratic Party wasn’t on their side—if government failed to improve their lives—why not vote for the party that at least took them seriously?

Free America always had an insurgent mindset breaking institutions down not building them up. Irresponsibility was coded into its leadership. Rather than finding new policies to rebuild declining communities Republicans mobilized anger and despair while offering up scapegoats. The party thought it could control these dark energies on its quest for more power but instead they would consume it.

The new knowledge economy created a new class of Americans: men and women with college degrees skilled with symbols and numbers—salaried professionals in information technology computer engineering scientific research design management consulting the upper civil service financial analysis law journalism the arts higher education. They go to college with one another intermarry gravitate to desirable neighborhoods in large metropolitan areas and do all they can to pass on their advantages to their children. They are not 1 percenters—those are mainly executives and investors—but they dominate the top 10 percent of American incomes with outsize economic and cultural influence.

They’re at ease in the world that modernity created. They were early adopters of things that make the surface of contemporary life agreeable: HBO Lipitor MileagePlus Platinum the MacBook Pro grass-fed organic beef cold-brewed coffee Amazon Prime. They welcome novelty and relish diversity. They believe that the transnational flow of human beings information goods and capital ultimately benefits most people around the world. You have a hard time telling what part of the country they come from because their local identities are submerged in the homogenizing culture of top universities and elite professions. They believe in credentials and expertise—not just as tools for success but as qualifications for class entry. They’re not nationalistic—quite the opposite—but they have a national narrative. Call it “Smart America.”

From the November 1996 issue: Nicholas Lemann on America’s cartoon elite

The cosmopolitan outlook of Smart America overlaps in some areas with the libertarian views of Free America. Each embraces capitalism and the principle of meritocracy: the belief that your talent and effort should determine your reward. But to the meritocrats of Smart America some government interventions are necessary for everyone to have an equal chance to move up. The long history of racial injustice demands remedies such as affirmative action diversity hiring and maybe even reparations. The poor need a social safety net and a living wage; poor children deserve higher spending on education and health care. Workers dislocated by trade agreements automation and other blows of the global economy should be retrained for new kinds of jobs.

Still there’s a limit to how much government the meritocrats will accept. Social liberalism comes easier to them than redistribution especially as they accumulate wealth and look to their 401(k)s for long-term security. As for unions they hardly exist in Smart America. They’re instruments of class solidarity not individual advancement and the individual is the unit of worth in Smart America as in Free America.

The word meritocracy has been around since the late 1950s when a British sociologist named Michael Young published The Rise of the Meritocracy. He meant this new word as a warning: Modern societies would learn how to measure intelligence in children so exactly that they would be stratified in schools and jobs according to their natural ability. In Young’s satirical fantasy this new form of inequality would be so rigid and oppressive that it would end in violent rebellion.

But the word lost its original dystopian meaning. In the decades after World War II the G.I. Bill the expansion of standardized tests the civil-rights movement and the opening of top universities to students of color women and children of the middle and working classes all combined to offer a path upward that probably came as close to truly equal opportunity as America has ever seen.

After the 1970s meritocracy began to look more and more like Young’s dark satire. A system intended to give each new generation an equal chance to rise created a new hereditary class structure. Educated professionals pass on their money connections ambitions and work ethic to their children while less educated families fall further behind with less and less chance of seeing their children move up. By kindergarten the children of professionals are already a full two years ahead of their lower-class counterparts and the achievement gap is almost unbridgeable. After seven decades of meritocracy a lower-class child is nearly as unlikely to be admitted to one of the top three Ivy League universities as they would have been in 1954.

This hierarchy slowly hardened over the decades without drawing much notice. It’s based on education and merit and education and merit are good things so who would question it? The deeper injustice is disguised by plenty of exceptions children who rose from modest backgrounds to the heights of society. Bill Clinton (who talked about “people who work hard and play by the rules”) Hillary Clinton (who liked the phrase God-given talents) and Barack Obama (“We need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect”) were all products of the meritocracy. Of course individuals should be rewarded according to their ability. What’s the alternative? Either collectivization or aristocracy. Either everyone gets the same grades and salaries regardless of achievement which is unjust and horribly mediocre or else everyone has to live out the life into which they’re born which is unjust and horribly regressive. Meritocracy seems like the one system that answers what Tocqueville called the American “passion for equality.” If the opportunities are truly equal the results will be fair.

But it’s this idea of fairness that accounts for meritocracy’s cruelty. If you don’t make the cut you have no one and nothing to blame but yourself. Those who make it can feel morally pleased with themselves—their talents discipline good choices—and even a grim kind of satisfaction when they come across someone who hasn’t made it. Not “There but for the grace of God go I” not even “Life is unfair” but “You should have been more like me.”

The winners in Smart America have lost the capacity and the need for a national identity which is why they can’t grasp its importance for others.

Politically Smart America came to be associated with the Democratic Party. This was not inevitable. If the party had refused to accept the closing of factories in the 1970s and ’80s as a natural disaster if it had become the voice of the millions of workers displaced by deindustrialization and struggling in the growing service economy it might have remained the multiethnic working-class party that it had been since the 1930s. It’s true that the white South abandoned the Democratic Party after the civil-rights revolution but race alone doesn’t explain the epochal half-century shift of working-class white voters. West Virginia almost all white was a predominantly Democratic state until 2000. If you look at county-by-county national electoral maps 2000 was the year when rural areas turned decisively red. Something more than just the Democrats’ principled embrace of the civil-rights movement and other struggles for equality caused the shift.

In the early 1970s the party became the home of educated professionals nonwhite voters and the shrinking unionized working class. The more the party identified with the winners of the new economy the easier it became for the Republican Party to pull away white workers by appealing to cultural values. Bill and Hillary Clinton spoke about equipping workers to rise into the professional class through education and training. Their assumption was that all Americans could do what they did and be like them.

The narrative of Free America shaped the parameters of acceptable thinking for Smart America. Free trade deregulation economic concentration and balanced budgets became the policy of the Democratic Party. It was cosmopolitan embracing multiculturalism at home and welcoming a globalized world. Its donor class on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley bankrolled Democratic campaigns and was rewarded with influence in Washington. None of this appealed to the party’s old base.

The turn of the millennium was the high-water mark of Smart America. President Clinton’s speeches became euphoric—“We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history” he said in his final State of the Union message. The new economy had replaced “outmoded ideologies” with dazzling technologies. The business cycle of booms and busts had practically been abolished along with class conflict. In April 2000 Clinton hosted a celebration called the White House Conference on the New Economy. Earnest purpose mingled with self-congratulation; virtue and success high-fived—the distinctive atmosphere of Smart America. At one point Clinton informed the participants that Congress was about to pass a bill to establish permanent trade relations with China which would make both countries more prosperous and China more free. “I believe the computer and the internet give us a chance to move more people out of poverty more quickly than at any time in all of human history” he exulted.

You can almost date the election of Donald Trump to that moment.

The winners in Smart America have withdrawn from national life. They spend inordinate amounts of time working (even in bed) researching their children’s schools and planning their activities shopping for the right kind of food learning to make sushi or play the mandolin staying in shape and following the news. None of this brings them in contact with fellow citizens outside their way of life. School once the most universal and influential of our democratic institutions now walls them off. The working class is terra incognita.

The pursuit of success is not new. The Smart American is a descendant of the self-made man of the early 19th century who raised work ethic to the highest personal virtue and of the urban Progressive of the early 20th who revered expertise. But there’s a difference: The path now is narrower it leads to institutions with higher walls and the gate is harder to open.

Under the watchful eye of their parents the children of Smart America devote exhausting amounts of energy to extracurricular activities and carefully constructed personal essays that can navigate between boasting and humility. The goal of all this effort is a higher education that offers questionable learning dubious fulfillment likely indebtedness but certain status. Graduation from an exclusive school marks the entry into a successful life. A rite endowed with so much importance and involving so little of real value resembles the brittle decadence of an aristocracy that’s reached the stage when people begin to lose faith that it reflects the natural order of things. In our case a system intended to expand equality has become an enforcer of inequality. Americans are now meritocrats by birth. We know this but because it violates our fundamental beliefs we go to a lot of trouble not to know it.

A common refrain in places like southeastern Ohio and southern Virginia and central Pennsylvania is that the middle class no longer exists. I once heard a woman in her 60s a retired municipal employee in Tampa Florida who had made and then lost money in real estate describe herself as a member of “the formerly middle class.” She meant that she no longer lived with any security. Her term could apply to a nonunion electrician making $52000 a year and to a home health aide making $12 an hour. The first still belongs financially to the middle class while the second is working-class—in fact working-poor. What they share is a high-school degree and a precarious prospect. Neither of them can look with confidence on their future less still on their children’s. The dream of leaving their children better educated and better off has lost its conviction and therefore its inspiration. They can’t possibly attain the shiny well-ordered lives they see in the houses of the elite professionals for whom they work. The espresso maker on the quartz countertop the expensive art hanging on the living-room walls the shelves of books lining the children’s bedrooms are glimpses of a foreign culture. What professionals actually do to earn the large incomes that pay for their nice things is a mystery. All those hours spent sitting at a computer screen—do they contribute something to society to the family of an electrician or a home health aide (whose contributions are obvious)?

So these two classes rising professionals and sinking workers which a couple of generations ago were close in income and not so far apart in mores no longer believe they belong to the same country. But they can’t escape each other and their coexistence breeds condescension resentment and shame.

As a national narrative Smart America has a tenuous sense of the nation. Smart America doesn’t hate America which has been so good to the meritocrats. Smart Americans believe in institutions and they support American leadership of military alliances and international organizations.

But Smart Americans are uneasy with patriotism. It’s an unpleasant relic of a more primitive time like cigarette smoke or dog racing. It stirs emotions that can have ugly consequences. The winners in Smart America—connected by airplane internet and investments to the rest of the globe—have lost the capacity and the need for a national identity which is why they can’t grasp its importance for others. Their passionate loyalty the one that gives them a particular identity goes to their family. The rest is diversity and efficiency heirloom tomatoes and self-driving cars. They don’t see the point of patriotism.

Patriotism can be turned to good or ill purposes but in most people it never dies. It’s a persistent attachment like loyalty to your family a source of meaning and togetherness strongest when it’s hardly conscious. National loyalty is an attachment to what makes your country yours distinct from the rest even when you can’t stand it even when it breaks your heart. This feeling can’t be wished out of existence. And because people still live their lives in an actual place and the nation is the largest place with which they can identify—world citizenship is too abstract to be meaningful—patriotic feeling has to be tapped if you want to achieve anything big. If your goal is to slow climate change or reverse inequality or stop racism or rebuild democracy you will need the national solidarity that comes from patriotism.

That’s one problem with the narrative of Smart America. The other problem is that abandoning patriotism to other narratives guarantees that the worst of them will claim it.

In the fall of 2008 Sarah Palin then the Republican nominee for vice president spoke at a fundraiser in Greensboro North Carolina. Candidates reserve the truth for their donors using the direct language they avoid with the press and the public (Obama: “cling to guns or religion”; Romney: the “47 percent”; Clinton: “basket of deplorables”) and Palin felt free to speak openly. “We believe that the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit” she said “and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America being here with all of you hardworking very patriotic very pro-America areas of this great nation. Those who are running our factories and teaching our kids and growing our food and are fighting our wars for us.”

What made Palin alien to people in Smart America prompted thousands to stand in line for hours at her rallies in “Real America”: her vernacular (“You betcha” “Drill baby drill”); her charismatic Christianity; the four colleges she attended en route to a degree; her five children’s names (Track Bristol Willow Piper Trig); her baby with Down syndrome; her pregnant unwed teenage daughter; her husband’s commercial fishing business; her hunting poses. She was working-class to her boots. Plenty of politicians come from the working class; Palin never left it.

She went after Barack Obama with particular venom. Her animus was fueled by his suspect origins radical associates and redistributionist views but the worst offense was his galling mix of class and race. Obama was a Black professional who had gone to the best schools who knew so much more than Palin and who was too cerebral to get in the mud pit with her.

Palin crumbled during the campaign. Her miserable performance under basic questioning disqualified her in the eyes of Americans with open minds on the subject. Her Republican handlers tried to hide her and later disowned her. In 2008 the country was still too rational for a candidate like Palin. After losing she quit being governor of Alaska which no longer interested her and started a new career as a reality-TV personality Tea Party star and autographed-merchandise saleswoman. Palin kept looking for a second act that never arrived. She suffered the pathetic fate of being a celebrity ahead of her time. Because with her candidacy something new came into our national life that was also traditional. She was a western populist who embodied white identity politics—John the Baptist to the coming of Trump.

Real America is a very old place. The idea that the authentic heart of democracy beats hardest in common people who work with their hands goes back to the 18th century. It was embryonic in the founding creed of equality. “State a moral case to a ploughman and a professor” Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1787. “The former will decide it as well and often better than the latter because he has not been led astray by artificial rules.” Moral equality was the basis for political equality. As the new republic became a more egalitarian society in the first decades of the 19th century the democratic creed turned openly populist. Andrew Jackson came to power and governed as champion of “the humble members of society—the farmers mechanics and laborers” the Real Americans of that age. The Democratic Party dominated elections by pinning the charge of aristocratic elitism on the Federalists and then the Whigs who learned that they had to campaign on log cabins and hard cider to compete.

The triumph of popular democracy brought an anti-intellectual bias to American politics that never entirely disappeared. Self-government didn’t require any special learning just the native wisdom of the people. “Even in its earliest days” Richard Hofstadter wrote “the egalitarian impulse in America was linked with a distrust for what in its germinal form may be called political specialization and in its later forms expertise.” Hostility to aristocracy widened into a general suspicion of educated sophisticates. The more learned citizens were actually less fit to lead; the best politicians came from the ordinary people and stayed true to them. Making money didn’t violate the spirit of equality but an air of superior knowledge did especially when it cloaked special privileges.

The overwhelmingly white crowds that lined up to hear Palin speak were nothing new. Real America has always been a country of white people. Jackson himself was a slaver and an Indian-killer and his “farmers mechanics and laborers” were the all-white forebears of William Jennings Bryan’s “producing masses” Huey Long’s “little man” George Wallace’s “rednecks” Patrick Buchanan’s “pitchfork brigade” and Palin’s “hardworking patriots.” The political positions of these groups changed but their Real American identity—their belief in themselves as the bedrock of self-government—stayed firm. From time to time the common people’s politics has been interracial—the Populist Party at its founding in the early 1890s the industrial-labor movement of the 1930s—but that never lasted. The unity soon disintegrated under the pressure of white supremacy. Real America has always needed to feel that both a shiftless underclass and a parasitic elite depend on its labor. In this way it renders the Black working class invisible.

From its beginnings Real America has also been religious and in a particular way: evangelical and fundamentalist hostile to modern ideas and intellectual authority. The truth will enter every simple heart and it doesn’t come in shades of gray. “If we have to give up either religion or education we should give up education” said Bryan in whom populist democracy and fundamentalist Christianity were joined until they broke him apart at the Scopes “monkey trial” in 1925.

Finally Real America has a strong nationalist character. Its attitude toward the rest of the world is isolationist hostile to humanitarianism and international engagement but ready to respond aggressively to any incursion against national interests. The purity and strength of Americanism are always threatened by contamination from outside and betrayal from within. The narrative of Real America is white Christian nationalism.

Real America isn’t a shining city on a hill with its gates open to freedom-loving people everywhere. Nor is it a cosmopolitan club to which the right talents and credentials will get you admitted no matter who you are or where you’re from. It’s a provincial village where everyone knows everyone’s business no one has much more money than anyone else and only a few misfits ever move away. The villagers can fix their own boilers and they go out of their way to help a neighbor in a jam. A new face on the street will draw immediate attention and suspicion.

By the time Palin talked about “the real America” it was in precipitous decline. The region where she spoke the North Carolina Piedmont had lost its three economic mainstays—tobacco textiles and furniture making—in a single decade. Local people blamed NAFTA multinational corporations and big government. Idle tobacco farmers who had owned and worked their own fields drank vodka out of plastic cups at the Moose Lodge where Fox News aired nonstop; they were missing teeth from using crystal meth. Palin’s glowing remarks were a generation out of date.

This collapse happened in the shadow of historic failures. In the first decade of the new century the bipartisan ruling class discredited itself—first overseas then at home. The invasion of Iraq squandered the national unity and international sympathy that had followed the attacks of September 11. The decision itself was a strategic folly enabled by lies and self-deception; the botched execution compounded the disaster for years afterward. The price was never paid by the war’s leaders. As an Army officer in Iraq wrote in 2007 “A private who loses a rifle suffers far greater consequences than a general who loses a war.” The cost for Americans fell on the bodies and minds of young men and women from small towns and inner cities. Meeting anyone in uniform in Iraq who came from a family of educated professionals was uncommon and vanishingly rare in the enlisted ranks. After troops began to leave Iraq the pattern continued in Afghanistan. The inequality of sacrifice in the global War on Terror was almost too normal to bear comment. But this grand elite failure seeded cynicism in the downscale young.

The financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed had a similar effect on the home front. The guilty parties were elites—bankers traders regulators and policy makers. Alan Greenspan the Federal Reserve chairman and an Ayn Rand fan admitted that the crisis undermined his faith in the narrative of Free America. But those who suffered were lower down the class structure: middle-class Americans whose wealth was sunk in a house that lost half its value and a retirement fund that melted away working-class Americans thrown into poverty by a pink slip. The banks received bailouts and the bankers kept their jobs.

The conclusion was obvious: The system was rigged for insiders. The economic recovery took years; the recovery of trust never came.

Ever since the age of Reagan the Republican Party has been a coalition of business interests and less affluent white people many of them evangelical Christians. The persistence of the coalition required an immense amount of self-deception on both sides. As late as 2012 the Republican National Convention was still a celebration of Free America and unfettered capitalism. Mitt Romney told donors at the infamous fundraiser that the country was divided into makers and takers and those 47 percent of Americans who took would never vote for him. In fact the takers included plenty of Republicans but the disorganization of life in the decaying countryside was barely noticed by politicians and journalists. Christians who didn’t attend church; workers without a regular schedule let alone a union; renters who didn’t trust their neighbors; adults who got their information from chain emails and fringe websites; voters who believed both parties to be corrupt—what was the news story? Real America the bedrock of popular democracy had no way to participate in self-government. It turned out to be disposable. Its rage and despair needed a target and a voice.

When Trump ran for president the party of Free America collapsed into its own hollowness. The mass of Republicans were not free-traders who wanted corporate taxes zeroed out. They wanted government to do things that benefited them—not the undeserving classes below and above them. Party elites were too remote from Trump’s supporters and lulled by their own stale rhetoric to grasp what was happening. Media elites were just as stupefied. They were entertained and appalled by Trump whom they dismissed as a racist a sexist a xenophobe an authoritarian and a vulgar orange-haired celebrity. He was all of these. But he had a reptilian genius for intuiting the emotions of Real America—a foreign country to elites on the right and left. They were helpless to understand Trump and therefore to stop him.

Trump’s populism brought Jersey Shore to national politics. The goal of his speeches was not to whip up mass hysteria but to get rid of shame. He leveled everyone down together.

Trump violated conservative orthodoxy on numerous issues including taxes and entitlements. “I want to save the middle class” he said. “The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.” But Trump’s main heresies were on trade immigration and war. He was the first American politician to succeed by running against globalization—a bipartisan policy that had served the interests of “globalists” for years while sacrificing Real Americans. He was also the first to succeed by talking about how shitty everything in America had become. “These are the forgotten men and women of our country and they are forgotten” he said at the 2016 Republican National Convention. “But they’re not going to be forgotten long.” The nationalist mantle was lying around and Trump grabbed it. “I am your voice.”

Early in the campaign I spent time with a group of white and Black steelworkers in a town near Canton Ohio. They had been locked out by the company over a contract dispute and were picketing outside the mill. They faced months without a paycheck possibly the loss of their jobs and they talked about the end of the middle class. The only candidates who interested them were Trump and Bernie Sanders.

A steelworker named Jack Baum told me that he supported Trump. He liked Trump’s “patriotic” positions on trade and immigration but he also found Trump’s insults refreshing even exhilarating. The ugliness was a kind of revenge Baum said: “It’s a mirror of the way they see us.” He didn’t specify who they and us were but maybe he didn’t have to. Maybe he believed—he was too polite to say it—that people like me looked down on people like him. If educated professionals considered steelworkers like Baum to be ignorant crass and bigoted then Trump was going to shove it in our smug faces. The lower his language and behavior sank and the more the media vilified him the more he was celebrated by his people. He was their leader who could do no wrong.

Trump’s language was effective because it was attuned to American pop culture. It required no expert knowledge and had no code of hidden meanings. It gave rise almost spontaneously to memorable phrases: “Make America great again.” “Drain the swamp.” “Build the wall.” “Lock her up.” “Send her back.” It’s the way people talk when the inhibitors are off and it’s available to anyone willing to join the mob. Trump didn’t try to shape his people ideologically with new words and concepts. He used the low language of talk radio reality TV social media and sports bars and to his listeners this language seemed far more honest and grounded in common sense than the mincing obscurities of “politically correct” experts. His populism brought Jersey Shore to national politics. The goal of his speeches was not to whip up mass hysteria but to get rid of shame. He leveled everyone down together.

Throughout his adult life Trump has been hostile to Black people contemptuous of women vicious about immigrants from poor countries and cruel toward the weak. He’s an equal-opportunity bigot. In his campaigns and in the White House he aligned himself publicly with hard-core racists in a way that set him apart from every other president in memory and the racists loved him for it. After the 2016 election a great deal of journalism and social science was devoted to finding out whether Trump’s voters were mainly motivated by economic anxiety or racial resentment. There was evidence for both answers.

Progressives shocked by the readiness of half the country to support this hateful man seized on racism as the single cause and set out to disprove every alternative. But this answer was far too satisfying. Racism is such an irreducible evil that it gave progressives commanding moral heights and relieved them of the burden to understand the grievances of their compatriots down in the lowlands let alone do something about them. It put Trump voters beyond the pale. But racism alone couldn’t explain why white men were much more likely to vote for Trump than white women or why the same was true of Black and Latino men and women. Or why the most reliable predictor for who was a Trump voter wasn’t race but the combination of race and education. Among white people 38 percent of college graduates voted for Trump compared with 64 percent without college degrees. This margin—the great gap between Smart America and Real America—was the decisive one. It made 2016 different from previous elections and the trend only intensified in 2020.

The issues Trump had campaigned on waxed and waned during his presidency. What remained was the dark energy he unleashed binding him like a tribal leader to his people. Nothing was left of the optimistic pieties of Free America. Trump’s people still talked about freedom but they meant blood and soil. Their nationalism was like the ethno-nationalisms on the rise in Europe and around the world. Trump abused every American institution—the FBI the CIA the armed forces the courts the press the Constitution itself—and his people cheered. Nothing excited them like owning the libs. Nothing convinced them like Trump’s 30000 lies.

More than anything Trump was a demagogue—a thoroughly American type familiar to us from novels like All the King’s Men and movies like Citizen Kane. “Trump is a creature native to our own style of government and therefore much more difficult to protect ourselves against” the Yale political theorist Bryan Garsten wrote. “He is a demagogue a popular leader who feeds on the hatred of elites that grows naturally in democratic soil.” A demagogue can become a tyrant but the people put him there—the people who want to be fed fantasies and lies the people who set themselves apart from and above their compatriots. So the question isn’t who Trump was but who we are.

In 2014 American character changed.

A large and influential generation came of age in the shadow of accumulating failures by the ruling class—especially by business and foreign-policy elites. This new generation had little faith in ideas that previous ones were raised on: All men are created equal. Work hard and you can be anything. Knowledge is power. Democracy and capitalism are the best systems—the only systems. America is a nation of immigrants. America is the leader of the free world.

My generation told our children’s generation a story of slow but steady progress. America had slavery (as well as genocide internment and other crimes) to answer for original sin if there ever was such a thing—but it had answered and with the civil-rights movement the biggest barriers to equality were removed. If anyone doubted that the country was becoming a more perfect union the election of a Black president who loved to use that phrase proved it. “Rosa sat so Martin could walk so Barack could run so we could all fly”—that was the story in a sentence and it was so convincing to a lot of people in my generation myself included that we were slow to notice how little it meant to a lot of people under 35. Or we heard but didn’t understand and dismissed them. We told them they had no idea what the crime rate was like in 1994. Smart Americans pointed to affirmative action and children’s health insurance. Free Americans touted enterprise zones and school vouchers.

Of course the kids didn’t buy it. In their eyes “progress” looked like a thin upper layer of Black celebrities and professionals who carried the weight of society’s expectations along with its prejudices and below them lousy schools overflowing prisons dying neighborhoods. The parents didn’t really buy it either but we had learned to ignore injustice on this scale as adults ignore so much just to get through. If anyone could smell out the bad faith of parents it was their children stressed-out laborers in the multigenerational family business of success bearing the psychological burdens of the meritocracy. Many of them entered the workforce loaded with debt just as the Great Recession closed off opportunities and the reality of planetary destruction bore down on them. No wonder their digital lives seemed more real to them than the world of their parents. No wonder they had less sex than previous generations. No wonder the bland promises of middle-aged liberals left them furious.

Then came one video after another of police killing or hurting unarmed Black people. Then came the election of an openly racist president. These were conditions for a generational revolt.

Call this narrative “Just America.” It’s another rebellion from below. As Real America breaks down the ossified libertarianism of Free America Just America assails the complacent meritocracy of Smart America. It does the hard essential thing that the other three narratives avoid that white Americans have avoided throughout history. It forces us to see the straight line that runs from slavery and segregation to the second-class life so many Black Americans live today—the betrayal of equality that has always been the country’s great moral shame the heart of its social problems.

But Just America has a dissonant sound for in its narrative justice and America never rhyme. A more accurate name would be Unjust America in a spirit of attack rather than aspiration. For Just Americans the country is less a project of self-government to be improved than a site of continuous wrong to be battled. In some versions of the narrative the country has no positive value at all—it can never be made better.

In the same way that libertarian ideas had been lying around for Americans to pick up in the stagflated 1970s young people coming of age in the disillusioned 2000s were handed powerful ideas about social justice to explain their world. The ideas came from different intellectual traditions: the Frankfurt School in 1920s Germany French postmodernist thinkers of the 1960s and ’70s radical feminism Black studies. They converged and recombined in American university classrooms where two generations of students were taught to think as critical theorists.

Critical theory upends the universal values of the Enlightenment: objectivity rationality science equality freedom of the individual. These liberal values are an ideology by which one dominant group subjugates another. All relations are power relations everything is political and claims of reason and truth are social constructs that maintain those in power. Unlike orthodox Marxism critical theory is concerned with language and identity more than with material conditions. In place of objective reality critical theorists place subjectivity at the center of analysis to show how supposedly universal terms exclude oppressed groups and help the powerful rule over them. Critical theorists argue that the Enlightenment including the American founding carried the seeds of modern racism and imperialism.

The term identity politics was born in 1977 when a group of Black lesbian feminists called the Combahee River Collective released a statement defining their work as self-liberation from the racism and sexism of “white male rule”: “The major systems of oppression are interlocking. The synthesis of these oppressions creates the conditions of our lives … This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics. We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity.” The statement helped set in motion a way of thinking that places the struggle for justice within the self. This thinking appeals not to reason or universal values but to the authority of identity the “lived experience” of the oppressed. The self is not a rational being that can persuade and be persuaded by other selves because reason is another form of power.

Lucy Jones

The historical demand of the oppressed is inclusion as equal citizens in all the institutions of American life. With identity politics the demand became different—not just to enlarge the institutions but to change them profoundly. When Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington called on America to “rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal’ ” he was demanding equal rights within the framework of the Enlightenment. (In later years his view of the American creed grew more complicated.) But in identity politics equality refers to groups not individuals and demands action to redress disparate outcomes among groups—in other words equity which often amounts to new forms of discrimination. In practice identity politics inverts the old hierarchy of power into a new one: bottom rail on top. The fixed lens of power makes true equality based on common humanity impossible.

And what is oppression? Not unjust laws—the most important ones were overturned by the civil-rights movement and its successors—or even unjust living conditions. The focus on subjectivity moves oppression from the world to the self and its pain—psychological trauma harm from speech and texts the sense of alienation that members of minority groups feel in their constant exposure to a dominant culture. A whole system of oppression can exist within a single word.

By the turn of the millennium these ideas were nearly ubiquitous in humanities and social-science departments. Embracing them had become an important credential for admittance into sectors of the professorate. The ideas gave scholars an irresistible power intellectual and moral to criticize institutions in which they were comfortably embedded. In turn these scholars formed the worldview of young Americans educated by elite universities to thrive in the meritocracy students trained from early childhood to do what it takes to succeed professionally and socially. “It is a curious thing but the ideas of one generation become the instincts of the next” D. H. Lawrence wrote. The ideas of critical theorists became the instincts of Millennials. It wasn’t necessary to have read Foucault or studied under Judith Butler to become adept with terms like centered marginalized privilege and harm; to believe that words can be a form of violence; to close down a general argument with a personal truth (“You wouldn’t understand” or just “I’m offended”); to keep your mouth shut when identity disqualified you from speaking. Millions of young Americans were steeped in the assumptions of critical theory and identity politics without knowing the concepts. Everyone sensed their power. Not everyone resisted the temptation to abuse it.

Just America emerged as a national narrative in 2014. That summer in Ferguson Missouri the police killing of a Black 18-year-old whose body was left to lie in the street for hours came in the context of numerous incidents more and more of them caught on video of Black people assaulted and killed by white police officers who faced no obvious threat. And those videos widely distributed on social media and viewed millions of times symbolized the wider injustices that still confronted Black Americans in prisons and neighborhoods and schools and workplaces—in the sixth year of the first Black presidency. The optimistic story of incremental progress and expanding opportunity in a multiracial society collapsed seemingly overnight. The incident in Ferguson ignited a protest movement in cities and campuses around the country.

What is the narrative of Just America? It sees American society not as mixed and fluid but as a fixed hierarchy like a caste system. An outpouring of prizewinning books essays journalism films poetry pop music and scholarly work looks to the history of slavery and segregation in order to understand the present—as if to say with Faulkner “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” The most famous of this work The New York Times Magazine’s 1619 Project declared its ambition to retell the entire story of America as the story of slavery and its consequences tracing contemporary phenomena to their historical antecedents in racism sometimes in disregard of contradictory facts. Any talk of progress is false consciousness—even “hurtful.” Whatever the actions of this or that individual whatever new laws and practices come along the hierarchical position of “whiteness” over “Blackness” is eternal.

Here is the revolutionary power of the narrative: What had been considered broadly speaking American history (or literature philosophy classics even math) is explicitly defined as white and therefore supremacist. What was innocent by default suddenly finds itself on trial every idea is cross-examined and nothing else can get done until the case is heard.

Just America isn’t concerned only with race. The most radical version of the narrative lashes together the oppression of all groups in an encompassing hell of white supremacy patriarchy homophobia transphobia plutocracy environmental destruction and drones—America as a unitary malignant force beyond any other evil on Earth. The end of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me published in 2015 and hugely influential in establishing the narrative of Just America interprets global warming as the planet’s cosmic revenge on white people for their greed and cruelty.

Read: Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “Letter to My Son”

There are too many things that Just America can’t talk about for the narrative to get at the hardest problems. It can’t talk about the complex causes of poverty. Structural racism—ongoing disadvantages that Black people suffer as a result of policies and institutions over the centuries—is real. But so is individual agency and in the Just America narrative it doesn’t exist. The narrative can’t talk about the main source of violence in Black neighborhoods which is young Black men not police. The push to “defund the police” during the protests over George Floyd’s murder was resisted by many local Black citizens who wanted better not less policing. Just America can’t deal with the stubborn divide between Black and white students in academic assessments. The mild phrase achievement gap has been banished not only because it implies that Black parents and children have some responsibility but also because according to anti-racist ideology any disparity is by definition racist. Get rid of assessments and you’ll end the racism along with the gap.

I’m exaggerating the suddenness of this new narrative but not by much. Things changed astonishingly quickly after 2014 when Just America escaped campuses and pervaded the wider culture. First the “softer” professions gave way. Book publishers released a torrent of titles on race and identity which year after year won the most prestigious prizes. Newspapers and magazines known for aspiring to reportorial objectivity shifted toward an activist model of journalism adopting new values and assumptions along with a brand-new language: systemic racism white supremacy white privilege anti-Blackness marginalized communities decolonization toxic masculinity. Similar changes came to arts organizations philanthropies scientific institutions technology monopolies and finally corporate America and the Democratic Party. The incontestable principle of inclusion drove the changes which smuggled in more threatening features that have come to characterize identity politics and social justice: monolithic group thought hostility to open debate and a taste for moral coercion.

Just America has dramatically changed the way Americans think talk and act but not the conditions in which they live. It reflects the fracturing distrust that defines our culture: Something is deeply wrong; our society is unjust; our institutions are corrupt. If the narrative helps to create a more humane criminal-justice system and bring Black Americans into the conditions of full equality it will live up to its promise. But the grand systemic analysis usually ends in small symbolic politics. In some ways Just America resembles Real America and has entered the same dubious conflict from the other side. The disillusionment with liberal capitalism that gave rise to identity politics has also produced a new authoritarianism among many young white men. Just and Real America share a skepticism from opposing points of view about the universal ideas of the founding documents and the promise of America as a multi-everything democracy.

But another way to understand Just America is in terms of class. Why does so much of its work take place in human-resources departments reading lists and awards ceremonies? In the summer of 2020 the protesters in the American streets were disproportionately Millennials with advanced degrees making more than $100000 a year. Just America is a narrative of the young and well educated which is why it continually misreads or ignores the Black and Latino working classes. The fate of this generation of young professionals has been cursed by economic stagnation and technological upheaval. The jobs their parents took for granted have become much harder to get which makes the meritocratic rat race even more crushing. Law medicine academia media—the most desirable professions—have all contracted. The result is a large population of overeducated underemployed young people living in metropolitan areas.

The historian Peter Turchin coined the phrase elite overproduction to describe this phenomenon. He found that a constant source of instability and violence in previous eras of history such as the late Roman empire and the French Wars of Religion was the frustration of social elites for whom there were not enough jobs. Turchin expects this country to undergo a similar breakdown in the coming decade. Just America attracts surplus elites and channels most of their anger at the narrative to which they’re closest—Smart America. The social-justice movement is a repudiation of meritocracy a rebellion against the system handed down from parents to children. Students at elite universities no longer believe they deserve their coveted slots. Activists in New York want to abolish the tests that determine entry into the city’s most competitive high schools (where Asian American children now predominate). In some niche areas such as literary magazines and graduate schools of education the idea of merit as separate from identity no longer exists.

But most Just Americans still belong to the meritocracy and have no desire to give up its advantages. They can’t escape its status anxieties—they’ve only transferred them to the new narrative. They want to be the first to adopt its expert terminology. In the summer of 2020 people suddenly began saying “BIPOC” as if they’d been doing it all their lives. (Black Indigenous and people of color was a way to uncouple groups that had been aggregated under people of color and give them their rightful place in the moral order with people from Bogotá and Karachi and Seoul bringing up the rear.) The whole atmosphere of Just America at its most constricted—the fear of failing to say the right thing the urge to level withering fire on minor faults—is a variation on the fierce competitive spirit of Smart America. Only the terms of accreditation have changed. And because achievement is a fragile basis for moral identity when meritocrats are accused of racism they have no solid faith in their own worth to stand on.

The rules in Just America are different and they have been quickly learned by older liberals following a long series of defenestrations at The New York Times Poetry magazine Georgetown University the Guggenheim Museum and other leading institutions. The parameters of acceptable expression are a lot narrower than they used to be. A written thought can be a form of violence. The loudest public voices in a controversy will prevail. Offending them can cost your career. Justice is power. These new rules are not based on liberal values; they are post-liberal.

Just America’s origins in theory its intolerant dogma and its coercive tactics remind me of 1930s left-wing ideology. Liberalism as white supremacy recalls the Communist Party’s attack on social democracy as “social fascism.” Just American aesthetics are the new socialist realism.

The dead end of Just America is a tragedy. This country has had great movements for justice in the past and badly needs one now. But in order to work it has to throw its arms out wide. It has to tell a story in which most of us can see ourselves and start on a path that most of us want to follow.

All four of the narratives I’ve described emerged from America’s failure to sustain and enlarge the middle-class democracy of the postwar years. They all respond to real problems. Each offers a value that the others need and lacks ones that the others have. Free America celebrates the energy of the unencumbered individual. Smart America respects intelligence and welcomes change. Real America commits itself to a place and has a sense of limits. Just America demands a confrontation with what the others want to avoid. They rise from a single society and even in one as polarized as ours they continually shape absorb and morph into one another. But their tendency is also to divide us pitting tribe against tribe. These divisions impoverish each narrative into a cramped and ever more extreme version of itself.

All four narratives are also driven by a competition for status that generates fierce anxiety and resentment. They all anoint winners and losers. In Free America the winners are the makers and the losers are the takers who want to drag the rest down in perpetual dependency on a smothering government. In Smart America the winners are the credentialed meritocrats and the losers are the poorly educated who want to resist inevitable progress. In Real America the winners are the hardworking folk of the white Christian heartland and the losers are treacherous elites and contaminating others who want to destroy the country. In Just America the winners are the marginalized groups and the losers are the dominant groups that want to go on dominating.

I don’t much want to live in the republic of any of them.

It’s common these days to hear people talk about sick America dying America the end of America. The same kinds of things were said in 1861 in 1893 in 1933 and in 1968. The sickness the death is always a moral condition. Maybe this comes from our Puritan heritage. If we are dying it can’t be from natural causes. It must be a prolonged act of suicide which is a form of murder.

I don’t think we are dying. We have no choice but to live together—we’re quarantined as fellow citizens. Knowing who we are lets us see what kinds of change are possible. Countries are not social-science experiments. They have organic qualities some positive some destructive that can’t be wished away. Our passion for equality the individualism it produces the hustle for money the love of novelty the attachment to democracy the distrust of authority and intellect—these won’t disappear. A way forward that tries to evade or crush them on the road to some free smart real or just utopia will never arrive and instead will run into a strong reaction. But a way forward that tries to make us Equal Americans all with the same rights and opportunities—the only basis for shared citizenship and self-government—is a road that connects our past and our future.

Meanwhile we remain trapped in two countries. Each one is split by two narratives—Smart and Just on one side Free and Real on the other. Neither separation nor conquest is a tenable future. The tensions within each country will persist even as the cold civil war between them rages on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlc2N1ZS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9ob3ctY2FuLWktaGVscC1hZmdoYW5pc3RhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How can I help Afghanistan?,"The crisis in Afghanistan is putting the lives of thousands of people at risk including those who supported the United States. Learn what you can do to help Afghans.

The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate rapidly as the country becomes more unstable. Already around 550000 people—80% of them women and children—have been displaced by conflict this year. Many Afghans say they fear for their lives.

More than 18 million people in Afghanistan require humanitarian aid—a number that has doubled since 2020 and fifty percent of Afghans in need are women and girls. But aid funding has fallen far short. The world must not turn its back on Afghanistan.

Here are five things you can do right now to help Afghanistan and Afghans in danger:

Urge President Biden to act now to protect at-risk Afghans

While all eyes have been on the airport in Kabul the reality is most Afghans in need of aid and protection remain in Afghanistan. Humanitarian needs in the country were already among the highest in the world before the crisis. Now the situation is rapidly worsening by nearly every measure.

The Biden Administration must scale up humanitarian assistance to organizations on the front-line of the crisis. The administration must also urge safe passage for those evacuating the country and provide aid and support to neighboring countries who are hosting Afghans. Email the White House today.

Take action now.

Show Afghans your support

The IRC stands in solidarity with the people of Afghanistan and our more than 1700 staff there most of them Afghans. One way you can show them your support is by sharing this post.

The IRC’s 25 offices across the United States support newly arrived refugees by providing immediate aid such as food housing and medical attention as well as long-term case management to help integrate them into American communities. Recently we worked alongside partners to welcome Afghans who had helped the U.S. as they were relocated to a government facility in Virginia. As more arrive we will continue to help Afghans get on their feet and thrive in their new lives.

Volunteers are a critical part of this work and there are a number of ways to get involved. As just a few examples the IRC’s Phoenix office is looking for volunteers to set up apartments for newly-arrived refugees. And in both Denver and Missoula offices are looking for people to mentor families by assisting with appointments taking them to local attractions cooking together or otherwise helping them acclimate to the U.S.

Instead the vague implausible threat by a group of construction workers in Florida to blow up U.S. buildings including Chicago’s Sears Tower was mostly the making of the FBI whose undercover operatives sought out the men promised them money and coached them over months to implicate themselves in a conspiracy to commit violent acts they never actually intended or had the means to carry out.

The “Liberty City Seven” case — known by its connection to the poor violence-ridden Miami neighborhood where the men involved lived — was the most high-profile FBI investigation of a supposed terrorist cell after the attacks in New York City and Washington D.C. It came as the bureau which had failed to act on intelligence it had received before 9/11 faced enormous pressure to predict and stop the next attack setting off its transformation in the words of former Deputy Director John Pistole “from reactive crime-solving agency to preventative national security agency.”

The ordeal of the seven Black men most of them Haitian American who were manipulated by two paid FBI informants into pledging allegiance to Al Qaeda is recounted in a new Frontline documentary “In the Shadow of 9/11” by British director Dan Reed.

“It was kind of really absurd almost unbelievable” said Reed who has previously directed documentaries about terror attacks in Moscow and Mumbai. “I didn’t really understand how the Liberty City guys could have got themselves in this predicament.”

The story of the seven men five of whom were sentenced to a cumulative 43 years in federal prison in connection to the case is a largely forgotten tale about the lengths to which government agencies were empowered to go in the panicked aftermath of 9/11 and about the absurdities the U.S. criminal justice apparatus sold to the public in the name of national security. The case is indicative of how quickly the so-called war on terror morphed into a battle to shape a narrative: that there was a real threat — and that the U.S. government was winning.

The case set the stage for hundreds of FBI sting operations in the following years as the bureau continued to frame individuals who were often poor credulous and had dubious ability to independently plan any attacks. In doing so the agency leaned on a sprawling surveillance apparatus set up after 9/11 and used constitutionally protected speech as a basis for monitoring people even as bureau officials regularly denied doing so. FBI agents relied heavily on well-paid informants operating with little accountability. And they expanded the stings to an ever-growing list of supposed threats: not only foreign-inspired ideologies but also domestic ones like that posed by what the FBI called “black identity extremism.”

As The Intercept has detailed in the “Trial and Terror” database most of the nearly 1000 people the U.S. has prosecuted for terrorism since 9/11 never came close to committing an act of violence. Like the Liberty City Seven most had no connection to terrorist groups and many were set up in FBI stings.

Those cases were not only unnecessary colossal wastes of investigative and prosecutorial resources that destroyed people’s lives but they also distorted the American public’s understanding of security threats after 9/11.

“What terrorists want to do is spread terror they want to make people afraid that there will be more terror attacks” said Reed. “And when the government goes in and essentially makes terrorists that way then that’s achieving the terrorists’ aims. It’s making the American public more afraid.”

Fabricated Fear

The story of the Liberty City Seven pieced together in the documentary through interviews as well as hours of surveillance footage and audio recorded by the informants is so tragic and farcical it is hard to fathom that it was a real FBI operation.

The supposed terror cell’s ringleader Narseal Batiste was a construction business owner and eccentric spiritual guru with a small following of men faithful to the Moorish Science Temple of America a mix of Christianity Judaism and Islam whose primary belief is the improvement of African Americans’ condition. His associates were mostly poor young men hustling on the streets of Miami. With Batiste self-styled as their “divine leader” they mostly offered martial arts training and spiritual teachings to neighborhood kids.

The FBI learned of the group when a Yemeni convenience store clerk who had once worked as an informant for the New York Police Department claimed to the bureau that the group had asked him to make a connection with Al Qaeda. The tip seemed improbable even to the FBI but the agency hired the clerk as an informant and concocted a scheme to introduce the group to yet another informant who claimed to be connected to Osama bin Laden. Batiste who was struggling to pay off business-related debts seized on what he thought was an opportunity to scam the two men out of money which they kept promising while leading Batiste to make progressively more compromising statements of support for Al Qaeda. He played along.

In one of the exchanges that sealed his fate Batiste agreed to provide one of the informants with a list of items he supposedly needed to carry out an attack in Chicago — including for some reason knee-high boots. “I had to make up something up right then and there” says Batiste whom FBI surveillance video shows struggling to differentiate a pistol from a machine gun before his unrelenting handler. “I didn’t know any names of guns. I had never owned a gun.”

Pressed by the informants Batiste repeated a bizarrely written oath of allegiance to Al Qaeda and crucially convinced his six associates to do so as well. Led on further he made bombastic statements about a made-up plot to blow up buildings and shoot survivors at one point boasting that it would be “greater than 9/11.” After yet more pressure he agreed to drive around Miami in a vehicle and with a camera the FBI had provided to snap photos of federal buildings.

Throughout the ordeal Batiste believed that he was conning the FBI informants who themselves were manufacturing a threat they knew was not real. The end goal for both parties was to cash in.

Not even the FBI agents working with the informants to set up the sting believed that the threat was real yet the Justice Department cited Batiste’s “overt acts” to bring terrorism-related charges.

The Justice Department touted the case as a major victory in its newly launched war on terror even as officials were aware that the seven “weren’t really the terrorists that we were seeking out” said Michael Mullaney a former chief of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section in the documentary.

It became apparent that the case was staged by the government as soon as the seven were arrested in June 2006. Justice Department officials tried to rationalize their decision to prosecute the men by insisting that they were guilty of the acts they were convicted of: swearing allegiance to a terrorist organization and taking photos of federal buildings. They justified stings as a tool to predict who might plot an attack rather than traps set out for individuals who likely would have never thought to do so had the FBI not written the script for them.

“The problem with terrorism cases is you have to stop the act and so you really in a way have to predict who is going to do what” said Mullaney. “And so stings are very important.”

The documentary telling the story of a scam seems to conclude that the victims are not just the seven men and their families but also the American people whose government fabricated fear to justify its powers.

No Lead Goes Uncovered

In the film Mike German a former FBI special agent who did undercover work for terrorism investigations before 9/11 says that had he told his superiors that he wanted to initiate an operation targeting individuals who did not belong to a terrorist group did not have any weapons and did not have a plot — and that the FBI itself would provide all those things in the course of the operation — “they would have sent me for counseling.”

The 9/11 attacks changed that ushering in a “no lead goes uncovered” policy at the bureau that forced agents to pursue any tip that came in no matter how far-fetched or improbable and regardless of the civil rights implications. That those tips often came from informants with clear financial agendas did not stop the bureau.

In the Liberty City case the FBI went much further than checking out an unlikely tip. Even as the agents quickly realized that Batiste and the others posed no credible threat they kept pushing forward investing countless hours and resources into the sting. After the first trial ended with a hung jury prosecutors tried it two more times before getting any convictions in 2009.

Rather than abandoning stings as pointless and harmful the FBI doubled down on them.

The operation became a cautionary tale within the bureau which used it as a case study to train informants on how not to cross a line and to master the art of manipulation while steering clear of the legal threshold for entrapment. Rather than abandoning stings as pointless and harmful however the FBI doubled down on them in some cases even providing weapons to the individuals they set up.

Trevor Aaronson a contributor to The Intercept and the author of a book about FBI stings says in the documentary that the bureau’s takeaway from the case seemed to be that “if they can convict these guys in Miami they convict just about anybody.”

In the following years the FBI did just that prosecuting hundreds of people including at least 350 who were set up in sting operations mostly through paid informants.

The bureau manipulated a group of Black men in Newburgh New York to plant what they thought to be functioning bombs by two synagogues. In Ferguson Missouri after the police killing of Michael Brown led to widespread protests federal agents framed two young protesters and coached them into a plan to blow up St. Louis’s iconic Gateway Arch before retroactively referring to their conviction to describe a new category of domestic extremism and expand surveillance of Black activists. At Standing Rock the agency relied on an FBI informant who became romantically involved with an Indigenous activist and whose gun was used in what ended up becoming the most severe prosecution in connection to protests against the Dakota Access pipeline.

“I was hoping they would learn that this case” — Liberty City — “was an overreach they had gone too far and perhaps undermined public trust in the counterterrorism tactics that they were using” German says in the documentary referring to the FBI. “But they seem to have taken the opposite lesson.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldGFsb2N1cy5lcy9lbi9uZXdzL29tYS1kZXNpZ25zLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1hbWV4LWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWJvb21wamVzLW9yaWdpbmFsLWRyYXdpbmdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OMA designs the exclusive Amex credit card with Boompjes original drawings | The Strength of Architecture | From 1998,"Boompjes Project description by OMA



At the end of 1980 OMA was asked by the city of Rotterdam to conduct a study of high rise building in the city and to illustrate the investigations with a planning proposal for a site in the centre. In consultation with the Town Planning Department a site was selected on the Maasboulevard along near the Maasbridges.



We see the angle between the river and the lower side of the grid as a 'hinge' between the city and the river. Here the river is closest to the centre. The shifting of the centre through the injection of gigantic buildings in the second reconstruction makes this point most suitable to take over the role of the 'window' in the disclosing of the riverfront.



The site is peculiar. On one hand it is embedded in a network of traffic lanes like the new suspension bridge across the Maas whose approach makes its way into the city through two inexplicable twists. On the other hand there lies a unique opportunity to connect the river with the city. The city is visible but hardly accessible; any structure will be noted in passing at bewilderingly different speeds and angles.



The design in its context

The building and the bridge are designed as an undetachable whole. Built as a composition of towers inserted in a slab the project carries on the experiments in slaboid mutations and new building types that were done after the war in the bombed areas. It forms a transparent screen along the riverfront.



On the riverside the screen acts as a row of stone towers against a glass horizon introducing a skyline in the Rotterdam skyline and on the city side it acts as a stone slab with glass towers and slits that portray pieces of the river.



Due to their different angles the glass surfaces on the city side reflect the light in different directions and mostly they only reflect air and water not buildings.



The building is designed toward the kinetic experience caused by the passing of the site with different speeds across the bridges and the boulevard: The towers all have a different angle to the slab: some fall backwards others are contained others twist away and the steel tower has altogether escaped.



The average height of the building in 72 meters. For a tower this is not so high for a slab it is (according to Dutch standards). The composition of these elements in this project claims a fair height to be effective in the skyline of the Rotterdam harbour where the juxtaposition of extremely high constructions with lower city districts is a frequently appearing image.



Two Structures for Rotterdam 1980-81

The centre of Rotterdam was bombed in 1940: overnight it was turned into a 3 kilometer wide crater. Few buildings survived – one of them (the so-called White House) a 54 meter tower built in 1898 that was for twenty years Europe’s tallest building.



Immediately Rotterdam architects started to plan the eventual ‘reconstruction’ project which began during the war which is still incomplete. During the 1950s the new Rotterdam became a paradigm: a CIAM city of slabs that were tied together by a Team X-like ‘connective tissue’ by Bakema the Lijnbaan.



In the 1960s and 1970s that emblematic architecture was discredited: on the periphery of the centre on the other side of the railway track a second revisionist reconstruction was started – an assembly of buildings by Piet Blom (a small forest of his tree houses) Bakema and others.



The new reconstruction was the absolute opposite of the 1950s effort: where they were sober ordered and logical; the new city was chaotic and obsessively humanist. The two cities are separated by a ‘fault’ formed by a railway line and a highway that both cross the river at this point. The separation is further reinforced by a new suspension bridge across the Maas whose approach makes its way into the city through two inexplicable twists.



Now that the city nears completion the riverfront – more precisely the so-called Maasboulevard a curved dike that protects the rest of the city – remains under-exploited and is one of the last frontiers for further development.



The two structures for Rotterdam are located exactly at this point; they form a ‘cornerstone’ of the old ‘modern’ centre and face across the fault the multitude of anti-modernist revisions.



This project had a triple purpose: to activate the riverfront; to propose a ‘solution’ for the bridgehead of the old bridge that will become redundant after the inauguration of the new one; and to suggest an apartment building for a site against the old bridge.



The site is peculiar: one side is quayside the other is formed by a riverside highway one the side of a bridge. It is visible but hardly accessible; any structure on it will be noted in passing at bewilderingly different speeds and angles.",,,,,,

Already water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead the two major reservoirs that store the Colorado River’s water are down to 34% of their capacity and may soon drop too low to spin the hydroelectric turbines in their dams. Some smaller reservoirs began emergency releases in summer 2021 to prop up water levels in these lakes.

The situation is serious but there’s plenty we can do to improve it. We know that the West will continue to get hotter and drier due to climate change. By proactively working together and planning for this future we can share the Colorado River’s water equitably among all those who need it including nature. We can use water more efficiently in our homes and businesses improve agricultural irrigation infrastructure adopt innovative water sharing approaches and plant crops that use less water. With proper planning the river will have enough water for fish and animals as well as people.

“Water issues are complex and require partnership and collaboration” says Hawes. “The Nature Conservancy has worked in the Colorado River Basin for 20 years and appreciates the critical importance of partnerships in charting a sustainable and resilient future. However the river system has changed more quickly than we have adapted. We must accelerate our efforts and think more broadly and creatively than ever before to chart a sustainable course. We must work together testing ideas sharing knowledge and investing in both short-term and long-term solutions in order to have the greatest impact in a short amount of time. This approach is our best path forward to minimize more future shortages on the river.”

With our contacts in the region and our history of bringing diverse stakeholders together TNC is ideally situated to broker agreements that keep the Colorado River healthy. In Colorado we developed the Yampa River Fund a compact in which downstream users pay to protect the health of their water supply near its source. In Arizona we developed a groundwater recharge system and helped farmers switch to water-efficient crops. We helped Mexicali Mexico invest in wastewater treatment solutions to leave more water available for nature. We are supporting policies at local regional and national levels that safeguard water supplies in the arid West.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlZm9ydW0ub3JnL2FnZW5kYS8yMDIxLzA4L2EtbmV3LW1hcC10cmFja3MtMzAteWVhcnMtb2YtZXh0cmVtZS1zbm93bWVsdC1pbi10aGUtdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A new map tracks 30 years of extreme snowmelt in the US,"A new map shows 30 years of extreme snowmelt events in the United States.

Extreme snowmelt can be destructive and deadly causing floods landslides and dam failures.

A new map of extreme snowmelt events over the last 30 years clarifies the processes that drive rapid melting.

The work is important for understanding the world under the influence of climate change.

Snowmelt—the surface runoff from melting snow—is an essential water resource for communities and ecosystems. But extreme snow melt which occurs when snow melts too rapidly over a short amount of time can be destructive and deadly causing floods landslides and dam failures.

“When we talk about snowmelt people want to know the basic numbers just like the weather but no one has ever provided anything like that before. It’s like if nobody told you the maximum and minimum temperature or record temperature in your city” says study coauthor Xubin Zeng director of the University of Arizona Climate Dynamics and Hydrometeorology Center and a professor of atmospheric sciences.

“We are the first to create a map that characterizes snowmelt across the US. Now people can talk about the record snowmelt events over each small area of 2.5 miles by 2.5 miles.”

The map shows the greatest amount of snow loss over a two day period across the United States within a 30-year window. Image: Josh Welty via The University of Arizona

Zeng and lead study author Josh Welty who received his doctoral degree under Zeng’s advising created a map that catalogs the top-10 extreme snowmelt events in terms of frequency magnitude temperature and precipitation over every 2.5-mile square of the US between 1988 and 2017. They also used machine learning to understand how large-scale weather patterns affect extreme snow melt.

They found that in the western half of the country winds transport water vapor from the Pacific Ocean eastward. However in the eastern half of the country weather patterns transport moisture primarily south to north from the Gulf of Mexico all the way to the Great Lakes and New England.

Their maps also reveal that in most cases unusually warm temperatures cause extreme snowmelt. This conclusion is fairly intuitive but a surprising finding revealed that in certain regions particularly in the Pacific Northwest and the northeastern US extreme snowmelt events are driven by rain—which is relatively warm—falling on snow. In these cases extreme snowmelt events become immediately dangerous.

The paper outlines one such example in detail: The Oroville Dam in Butte County California holds the second-largest reservoir in the state. In 2017 a series of storms dropped huge amounts of warm rain on the snowcapped Sierra Nevada Mountains resulting in rapid snowmelt that filled the dam past its brim. Spillways which provide controlled water runoff failed and over 180000 people were evacuated.

Such events might happen more often in the future according to Zeng and Welty’s findings. The researchers found only a slight increase in the frequency of such events over the 30-year period and they didn’t see a trend in terms of the magnitude of extreme snowmelt events.

However 30 years isn’t long enough to establish a trend says Zeng. That means future research will be especially important.

“This paper serves as foundation and a reference point to see if and how things will be changing in different regions over the next 10 to 15 years” Welty says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbnRyYWxpbGxpbm9pc3Byb3VkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbG9jYWwtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWhvc3RzLXdhdGVyLWZpZ2h0cy_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZW50cmFsaWxsaW5vaXNwcm91ZC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2xvY2FsLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1ob3N0cy13YXRlci1maWdodHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local fire department hosts water fights,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/news/local-news/local-fire-department-hosts-water-fights/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbnRyYWxpbGxpbm9pc3Byb3VkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbG9jYWwtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWhvc3RzLXdhdGVyLWZpZ2h0cy_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZW50cmFsaWxsaW5vaXNwcm91ZC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2xvY2FsLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1ob3N0cy13YXRlci1maWdodHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

In January 2010 I decided to use a different film camera every week aiming to get through 52 in the year. Well things got a little out of hand and the project – which you can follow on my Flickr page – ended up lasting a decade. I never missed a week which means I've now used 522 different cameras.

Many of my cameras are fairly common or cheap including the likes of Olympus Trips and Box Brownies. But I've picked up a lot of oddities along the way too and the ones below are a selection of the more unusual ones in my collection. Hailing from all over the world these cameras are a cross-section of the huge variety you could find in the earlier days of film (and still can if you're prepared to hunt around).

As well as an interest in old cameras I have a degree in Fine Art and like to think that the creative element of the project is as important as its technical aspects. Of course it's now several years since consumer digital cameras have out-performed film cameras in terms of technical quality.

But this has freed film cameras to be used for the sheer joy of tinkering with analogue devices and in creative ways where a perfect image is no longer an important criterion for success. So here in no particular order are the 12 most gloriously strange cameras I own.

The 12 strangest cameras I own:

The 16-lens wonder: Kalimar Actionshot (1995)

Bought on eBay for £80 (around $111 / AU$151) in 2009

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

Cast your mind back five years and you might remember a bizarre digital camera with 16 lenses called the Lytro L16. Well the Kalimar Action Shot is a similar concept from an entirely different era. It's one of those rare cameras that I previously hadn't heard of but as soon as I became aware of its existence I knew I had to have one.

Hitting the market just before video cameras started to get affordable this gadget was marketed at golfers to help them analyze their swing. It has 16 lenses arranged to cover two full frames on a 35mm film. The shutters are fired in rapid sequence and the resulting prints show the progress of the golfer's arm and club.

The appeal to me was not so much the rapid sequences but the fact that the camera also has a setting allowing the shutters to be fired one at a time as close or as far apart as you want. This opens up possibilities of creating a mini narrative series or making in-camera 'joiner' photos like the one above of Marc Quinn's giant baby.

The original selfie machine: Minolta 7 Disc (1983)

Bought for a few pounds in a car boot sale in the 1990s

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

The selfie camera has been standard on smartphones for years now but this camera was way ahead of its time when it landed in 1983. It uses the now-obsolete disc film format and is in most respects just like the hundreds of little disc cameras that were around at the time.

What sets the Minolta 7 Disc apart from the rest though is its built-in telescopic wand (as Minolta called it) which we'd now call a selfie stick. This allows the camera to be held at arm's length while you pose yourself with the aid of a convex mirror which is part of the camera.

The camera's shutter release is in the handle and a motor-drive advances the film to the next frame if you want to take more than one snap. The main disadvantage with disc cameras is that the film was last made in 1999 and the dwindling supply is ever more expired. Couple that with the fact that the battery is not replaceable and this becomes more a collector's curiosity than a usable camera although I did take a few selfies with it during lockdown.

Double trouble: View-Master Stereo (1962)

Bought for £60 (around $83 / AU$113) on eBay in 2010

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

Remember the View-Master? Like a 1950s precursor to Google Cardboard these binocular-like devices created the illusion of 3D depth thanks to their little discs containing stereo pairs of photos. What fewer people realize is that there were also a number of cameras made for enthusiastic amateurs to take their own View-Master stereo photos and I have one of these.

First introduced at the New York World's Fair in 1939 there was a wealth of content made for View-Masters everything from wildlife to comedy cartoons and risqué pin-ups. But the camera I have is the Mark II version made in 1962. As ever I was as taken by the camera's quirks and possibilities as much as by its functionality.

The film takes a diagonal path across the camera and this allows an amazing 75 stereo pairs or 150 'chips' as the manufacturer described them to be made out of a 36 exposure film. I sometimes like to extend my compositions beyond the frame of the negative and the staggered angled images edged by the film's sprocket holes and bar-codes can work well given a suitable subject.

The airport nightmare: Zenit Fotosniper (1982)

Bought for £40 (around $55 / AU$76) on eBay in 2010

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

This piece of Soviet-era kit comes in a distinctly military-looking metal case weighing in at over 5kg. As the name suggests this Zenit is made for snipers but the intended target is sportspeople or wildlife rather than enemy combatants.

The camera is a modified Zenit B with a 300mm lens. At first glance it's an alarming sight and it was a challenge to use it without frightening passers-by or getting arrested on suspicion of carrying a shoulder-mounted rocket-propelled grenade launcher.

I generally like to blend in and avoid drawing attention to myself so I took it to a historical re-enactment where guns and lenses of all sizes were toted and no-one batted an eyelid. I found myself a discreet spot and as I carefully assembled my photographic weapon I couldn't help thinking of the climactic scene from the film “The Day of The Jackal” in which Edward Fox puts together his sniping rifle ready to take a pop at the French president.

The American beauty: Mercury II (1945)

Bought for £30 (around $42 / AU$57) on eBay in 2011

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

Made in New York and dating from 1945 the Mercury is a peculiar-looking beast. With its domed top and wealth of dials and curved scales at first glance it could mistaken for an old-fashioned parking meter rather than a camera. But that semi-circle on the top was innovative for its time – it contains the focal plane shutter which takes the form of a rotating disc with a variable width slit in it.

The Mercury II's body is made from cast aluminum so feels solid and robust without being isn't too heavy. With its myriad dials and scales it's certainly not for the easily daunted or numerically challenged – I counted no less than 167 numbers spread out among them. Among other things there is comprehensive information about depth of field and an exposure calculator to work out the settings for most conceivable light conditions.

If you were to make full use of all this information anything but the most static of subjects would have long gone by the time you were ready to shoot. Still it's a half-frame camera so with 72 exposures on a roll I was quite happy to use it to make panoramic sequences encompassing several frames.

Bond's binoculars: Tasco 7900 Bino/Cam (1977)

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

Bought for £15 (around $21 / AU$28) from eBay 2018

Launched by Tasco in 1977 the Bino/Cam adverts had the catchy tagline “until now you didn't have a choice you could either look through the camera or look through the binoculars now you can do both.” It was a claim taken seriously by James Bond in 'For Your Eyes Only' (1981) when he used them to spy on one of his adversaries.

There have been other binocular cameras in the 110 format but they've tended to be novelty items with poor-quality optics. This one has decent optics both in the binoculars and the camera. The telephoto's focal length is 112mm which is equivalent to around 225mm on 35mm film. Unlike most 110 cameras it offers a range of apertures and two shutter speeds.

Sadly my example doesn't focus properly – I suspect a previous owner attempted to service it and didn't reassemble it properly. This particular piece of kit is long gone but the Bino/Cam concept lives on albeit in monocular form with the recent Canon Powershot Zoom which seems to be aimed at the same market (even if Bond hasn't yet been tempted to pick one up).

The Cold War relic: Krasnogorsk FT2 (1958)

Bought for £100 (around $139 / AU$189) on eBay in 2011

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

This brick-like metal box with sharp corners could cause serious injury in hand-to-hand combat so perhaps it's no surprise that its designer was one Fedor Tokarev (the FT in the camera's name) better known as Stalin's favorite weapon designer.

Better known for designing automatic rifles his camera would also have been used in military settings taking large group photos of conscripts the sort of thing that those of us of a certain age associate with old-school photographs. The long thin negative needed for such shots is achieved by swinging the lens from right to left taking a sweeping shot of the scene in front of it.

The FT2's negatives are three times the width of a standard 35mm frame so you only get 12 shots per roll. My group photo taken on Crosby beach is rather sparsely populated with only two people – and one of those is made of cast iron. The FT2 is awkward to use but one of its descendants the Horizon 202 which has a more usable aspect ratio is a favorite of mine and often accompanies me on holiday.

The Art Deco gem: Purma Special (1937)

Bought in a car boot sale for a couple of pounds in the 1990s

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

The Purma Special has three shutter speeds but you'll look in vain for a lever or dial to select them. So how exactly do you change its shutter speed? If you weren't told you'd probably never guess that it's actually determined by which way up you hold the camera.

Because the camera has a square format negative it doesn't actually matter how the camera is oriented from a composition standpoint. But a clever gravity-driven device is weighted so that it falls at a different shutter speed depending on how you hold it. This unique design aside the Purma Special is a stylish streamlined Bakelite camera with a distinctly Art Deco look to it.

They were made in large numbers and are easy to come by but the early plastic gets brittle with age and many have chips or worse to contend with. When not in use the spring-loaded lens retracts into the body and is held there by a screw-on lens cap. The lens caps are often missing so be sure to check if you find one for sale. Seeing as the camera relies on gravity to operate I thought a sculpture of Sir Isaac Newton would make a fitting subject in the photo above.

Quirky and quickfire: Yashica Rapide (1961)

Bought for £50 (around $69 / AU$94) on eBay in 2012

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

The Yashica Rapide doesn't look like your average camera at all – in fact it could easily be mistaken for a cine camera. About the size of a large smartphone if somewhat thicker the Rapide's name refers to the rapid wind-on and shutter-cocking mechanism which is achieved by tugging sharply on a leather tab. With practice you can take an exposure every second or so should the need arise.

I quite like to make David Hockney-style 'joiner' photographs where several pictures are taken with the camera pointing in different directions with this camera. The resulting prints assemble into a collage with the overlaps and incongruities providing added visual interest.

The Rapide lived up to its name in the photo above allowing me to get fourteen shots done in under a minute having just emerged from the tube at London's Piccadilly Circus. Of course it took considerably longer than a minute to put them all together in Photoshop Elements and reminded me that just because you start off with an analogue camera doesn't mean you can entirely escape the digital drudgery.

The Japanese Warrior: Kyocera Samurai (1987)

Bought for £10 (around $14 / AU$19) on eBay in 2012

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

The Kyocera Samurai might look like a video camera from the 1990s but looks can be deceptive. It even handles like an old camcorder being gripped snugly with your right hand so you can access the main controls with your fingertips but the Samurai is actually a 35mm SLR that makes half-frame negatives.

It's fully automatic but the specs are pretty comprehensive with a 25mm-75mm auto-focus zoom lens and shutter speeds that go from 1/500th sec right down to three seconds all controlled by a TTL (Through The Lens) metering system. Those half-frame negatives mean it can shoot up to 72 exposures on a 36-exposure cassette.

It certainly sounds like an SLR with a satisfying mirror slap each time an exposure is made. In burst mode which is three frames per second it can sound very indiscreet positively paparazzi. Still with 72 shots to play with it's an ideal camera to make little series of images such as these seven beach huts in Hove near Brighton in the UK.

The pocket full-framer: Durst Duca (1947)

Bought for £15 (around $21 / AU$28) from eBay in 2011

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplan)

The Italian company Durst were probably best known for their enlargers and other darkroom equipment but they did make a handful of cameras too. The palm-sized Duca was launched in 1947 and was in production for around five years.

It uses standard 35mm film but this is loaded into the 'Rapid' spool-free cartridges. These have the advantage of being smaller than a standard cassette but this is at the expense of only being able to handle short lengths of film – in this case 12 exposures. The upright design of the Duca makes it look more like an 8mm cine camera than a stills camera and when it's in its tight fitting leather case I think most people would assume that's what it was.

A lever on the side of the camera advances the film and cocks the shutter and also incorporates a frame counter. The shutter release is on the front below the lens and ergonomically this layout would allow for taking photos in quick succession – something that's unlikely to be taken advantage of given the limited number of exposures in the cartridge.

The sea monster: Nemrod Siluro (1960)

Bought for £40 (around $55 / AU$76) on eBay in 2012

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen) (Image credit: Tony Kemplen)

This underwater camera was made by Nemrod Metzeler of Barcelona a manufacturer of diving and spear-fishing equipment which also dipped its toe into the photographic market with this its one-and-only camera. Despite the rudimentary nature of the photographic part of the Siluro this was a niche product and commanded a premium price in the early 1960s when it was made.

For a plastic camera it's remarkably heavy and this is because it contains lead weights to give it neutral buoyancy. It also houses a battery and a large capacitor to power the single-use flashbulbs needed to provide sufficient light in deep water.

Inside the underwater casing is the simplest possible box camera with a single shutter speed and no adjustments for focusing or aperture. The Siluro claimed to be usable down to 40m – and behind the large knurled metal knob on the front there's a valve to let you pressurize the interior with a bicycle pump prior to diving. I was having none of that and confined myself to a selfie in my bathroom mirror – that's about as close to water that this camera's going to get.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been ordered to pay $300 million over the use of the company’s wireless technology in iPhones and other products.

What Happened: A Texas judge upheld a jury's decision that Apple owes royalties to PanOptis Patent Management and its Optis Cellular and Unwired Planet units for patents held by the company on the LTE cellular standard. Optis says Apple products that utilized 4G networks were using its patented technology.

The order comes at the conclusion of a retrial of the case involving the patent dispute. In the first trial a jury awarded Optis $506.2 million according to report from Bloomberg.

In April U.S. District Court Judge Rodney Gilstrap upheld the jury’s liability finding but ordered a new trial on damages. The re-trial focused on the amount Apple was to pay Optis in royalties.

Apple issued a statement indicating the company plans to appeal the ruling. “Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate” the statement said. “We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire.”

What’s Next: Optis has been attempting to collect about $7 billion from Apple. In a related case a judge in the U.K. is considering instituting a global royalty rate. Apple has indicated it may pull out of the British market if it is forced to pay an amount that is “commercially unacceptable.”

Optis claims that all fair offers have been refused by Apple and has accused the tech giant of being an “unwilling licensee” a central issue in the London trial.

And our very own Greg Holger is part of the team. Holger spends his days maintaining compliance with lobbying campaign finance gift conflict of interest and ethics laws in the United states and Canada. His path to work at one of the most successful technology companies in the world began in little Cincinnati Ohio.

Even though he is now working for one of the largest tech companies the small-town feel of UC is what gave him the leg-up. The close connection to the community as well as the strong reputation and vast alumni network provided him with the opportunities he needed to get to where he is today. Holger came to the UC College of Law with an interest in the intersection of the public and private sectors.

“The Center for Professional Development helped me make several important connections during my three years to great people in Cincinnati serving in public office or having done so in the past” he says. “Learning from them and about their work helped lay the foundation for my first role after law school as a law clerk in the United States Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions in the office of then Chairman Senator Harkin.”

When looking back on his experience ever since he wholeheartedly recommends UC to those interested in pursuing a legal career."

Tastes change. It's a mantra applied to most consumer-facing industries. But what if your industry is actual taste — flavor — and your consumers are looking for new kinds of products but do not conversely want the taste of the product to change at all? This is a challenge that sometimes faces chemists like Mike Zampino at International Flavors and Fragrances  with a near-$40 billion market capitalization one of the world's largest public companies dedicated to figuring out how things taste and smell before selling that expertise and products to clients across the food and beverage industry. Last year increased demand for flavoring helped propel the overall North America market past a $9 billion value according to market research firm IMARC group. The equivalent global figure is several times that multiple with other major players including DuPont  Givaudan and Archer Daniels Midland .

Alternative dairy's growing flavor profile

Baked goods confectionary energy drinks smoothies ice-cream and desserts all require flavoring and have propelled the U.S. flavor market. But over the past decade another significant growth driver has been the demand for dairy alternatives evidenced by the recent Oatly IPO valuation of $10 billion lab-grown dairy breakthroughs in areas like ice cream from firms like Perfect Day and even Impossible Foods' possible foray into this space. Market research firm Mordor Intelligence forecasts the dairy alternative market is growing roughly 10% year on year and will be worth $8.2 billion annually by 2024. The accelerated expansion of dairy alternatives has sometimes made life complicated for Zampino's scientific colleagues as they work to meet client requirements under the guidance of expert flavorists like Zampino known to some in the industry as ""golden tongues."" For instance when a grocery business wants to introduce a new vanilla-flavored almond milk ice cream but asks that it taste like traditional dairy milk vanilla ice cream ""There are quite a few challenges in that"" Zampino said ""and not all of them are doable.""

Vanilla is one of the best-loved and most recognizable flavors in the United States used in thousands of everyday products such as chocolate cookies and ice cream. But on a molecular level it is also complex with more than 400 constituent parts and because it is subject to stringent regulations it is produced with great care. ""It's the only flavor in the U.S. that has a very specific standard of identity in the Code of Federal Regulations"" said Zampino delineating the raw ingredients and proportions that must be followed to create legally-sanctioned vanilla extract. Retailers like Whole Foods maintain long lists of ingredients that cannot be used in their in-store products and at times these lists can limit the palette available for flavorists to use. That is because certain consumers particularly in a younger demographic have in recent years been looking to purchase brands that exemplify their values such as sustainability and healthier ingredients. In a recent report it shared with CNBC Mordor Intelligence cited ""increasing health concerns among American consumers regarding artificial/synthetic flavors"" as a reason for natural flavors like vanilla to take a greater share in the U.S. market. This means that the team at IFF will first seek to understand a client's parameters for a product whether for instance it needs to be kosher or animal-free. They will then take delivery via courier at their plant in South Brunswick New Jersey of the product's ""base"" — in the case of an ice cream this is essentially an unflavored shake. An application laboratory will host the main sample while down the hallway in a flavor creation lab a flavorist will work to get the right composition of a crafted flavor with a series of smaller sub-samples. Once the flavorist feels ready they will share frozen samples with several groups; experts who know how to apply or bind that flavor to a physical product consumers who can provide their unvarnished reactions and executives who may be involved in marketing or commercializing the end product.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

« L’Émirat islamique ordonne à toutes ses forces d’attendre aux portes de Kaboul de ne pas essayer d’entrer dans la ville » a affirmé sur twitter Zabihullah Mujahid un porte-parole des talibans. « Il y a des combattants talibans armés dans notre quartier mais il n’y a pas de combats » a toutefois déclaré à l’AFP un habitant d’une banlieue située à l’est de la capitale.

Né en Chine le grès a un passé de près de 2.000 ans. Il a été réinventé en Europe depuis le Moyen Âge au prix de perfectionnements techniques successifs comme les fours couchés à axe de tirage oblique par rapport à la vieille tradition de terre cuite vernissée remontant au néolithique. Cuire l’argile qui s’y prête à haute température à 1.300 ° C la vitrifie partiellement dans la masse et confère aux pièces des avantages notoires même sans émail : résistance aux charges et aux chocs imperméabilité. Ancrées dans les meilleurs sites d’argile à grès d’un croissant allant de Mézilles (Yonne) à Henrichemont (Cher) peuplées d’artisans attachés à l’unité de temps et de lieu autant qu’à la production assurant le débouché ou l’intérêt la Puisaye et La Borne ont su perpétuer leur histoire en se renouvelant. De l’utilitaire vers l’artistique la céramique a modelé paysage et personnalités.

La révolution Carriès

« La terre de Puisaye est exceptionnelle » sait bien Jacques Lacheny qui a tourné et cuit pendant six décennies à Saint-Amand-en-Puisaye à partir de 1951 et que Marcel Poulet auteur d’ouvrages de référence a classé « inventeur de formes » « enfant du renouveau du grès de l’après-guerre ». Le maire qu’il fut vota l’achat par la commune du château Renaissance (abritant depuis le musée du grès). L’artiste lui continua à travailler la porcelaine en parallèle du grès et développa notamment l’idée de « population » de pièces de tailles et teintes différentes prenant leur valeur au milieu des autres. « Ça accentue l’intérêt des formes » explique-t-il.



L’on y verra confrontée à des lois physico-chimiques et techniques une prise de risque dans l’une des voies de création permises par les pâtes molles venant des généralement grises argiles de Myennes et de l’Albien – plus rarement blanches comme le kaolin – avec leur pourcentage naturel de fondant (potasse soude) et le soupçon d’oxyde de fer qui les colore. Jean Carriès (1855-1894) et ses suiveurs Lee de Vallombreuse Jeanneney de Barck Lion les Pointu l'abbé Pacton ont aussi voulu emmener le matériau à ses limites partant de gestes ancestraux.

Carriès a démontré que la poterie de Puisaye pouvait avoir un côté artistique. On peut dire qu’il a permis de maintenir la poterie de Puisaye sur le déclin sur la fin XIXe. Jacques Lacheny (céramiste à Saint-Amand-en-Puisaye)

« Carriès cabossait les formes inclinait les cols détaille le céramiste amandinois. Les tourneurs étaient scandalisés. C’était un révolutionnaire. Il voulait des émaux mats être libre de ses cuissons. En 6 ans c’est extraordinaire ce qu’il a fait à Montriveau c’est le basculement de la poterie en Puisaye. Il a démontré qu’elle pouvait avoir un côté artistique. On peut dire qu’il a permis de maintenir la poterie de Puisaye sur le déclin sur la fin XIXe. »

Un monde clos resté quand même ouvert

Depuis au moins le XVe siècle ici le japonisme on ne connaissait pas. On fabriquait des tuiles des briques et une poterie d’usage pour stocker et transporter liquides laitages viandes. Et un peu de décoratif ostentatoire demandé par les nobles et ayant fait la renommée des bleus longtemps dits de Saint-Vérain (émaillage à l’oxyde de cobalt).

Pour attester que l’activité était plus ancienne en Puisaye l’on n’a trace écrite que du dû d’une revenue (un bois taillis) de Salé lou potier à la comtesse Jeanne de Toucy en 1316.

Pots et pichets bouteilles bonbonnes toules à huile saloirs plats terrines vases et autres « égoutasses » par millions ont séché au soleil en tout cas.

Le bois le gisement et le laitier sur place

La présence du bois pour le feu du laitier (résidu des fonderies de minerai de fer gallo-romaines et médiévales) à broyer pour l’émaillage brillant le plus courant et bien sûr le gisement a amené la sédentarisation.



L'activité faisait vivre toute une région : tireurs de terre forestiers rouliers tourneurs anseuses émailleurs cuiseurs mariniers-commerçants.

Plus corporatistes qu’au nord (Treigny Moûtiers) les potiers du sud de la Puisaye (région de Saint-Amand) ont été plus à même de s’organiser pour réduire la surproduction ou peser sur les rusés mariniers. Ceux-ci ont assuré l’écoulement jusqu’à Nantes et dans le monde notamment depuis le port de Neuvy-sur-Loire ou « Neuvy-les-pots ». Jusqu’à ce que le Tacot circule de Saint-Amand à Cosne de 1900 à 1939.

Chacun essaie de tirer son épingle du jeu. Marcel Poulet (historien)

L’âge d’or fut le XVIIIe. Cinq dynasties les Mousset Normand Faule (ou Faulon ou Folon) Laurent Cagnat et dix grandes familles n’ont cessé de noyauter la population potière. Un impératif de transmission des ateliers justifiait l’endogamie.

Ce monde clos reste quand même ouvert aux évolutions technologiques par exemple. À l’ouest Myennes et Bonny se développent au XXe Myennes accueille même la poterie industrielle des Corneau. Sur l’autre rive « La Borne n’est pas restée utilitaire plus longtemps que nous. Il y a toujours eu un amour-haine entre Saint-Amand et La Borne » raconte Jacques Lacheny.

L’avait formé au tournage Camille Vannier un Bornois venu faire carrière dans la Nièvre (dont le four couché qui malheureusement s'effondre est celui du site du Cnifop). Il y a eu peu voire pas de tels mouvements vers le Cher où Ivanoff spécialiste des rouges les Mohy et Lerat rayonnaient pourtant.

La fin des communautés

Le four à gaz s’impose il faut se réorienter en partie sur la poterie de jardin. Les grandes manufactures Normand et Mallet notamment ferment. La faute surtout à des importations massives absolument déloyales au regard des lois sociales françaises. « Il n’existe plus de communauté potière. […] Chacun essaie de tirer son épingle du jeu » d’après Marcel Poulet. Mais l’école Cnifop lancée en 1976 permet de sauver et partager le savoir-faire.



Restent des traces de carrières des souvenirs de cuissons d’un volume de 70 m³ terminées par deux jours de grand feu où les « bourrées » (fagots à deux liens) emmènent les flammes jusqu’au têtin. Ainsi qu'un bâti de caractère comme au Faubourg amandinois si caractéristique avec ses petites maisons basses où les ouvriers dormaient autour des ateliers et fours. Le Faubourg car le risque d'incendie lié aux cuissons était éloigné des centres urbains.

Les potiers toujours là sont « tous tournés vers la création de pièces surtout décoratives ». Eux non plus sans pouvoir s’extraire de la genèse la boule de glaise à maîtriser pour la modeler. La terre nourricière.

L’ocre. La Puisaye est aussi une terre d’ocre. À la carrière des Beaux-Arts à Saint-Amand côté Bitry la société Solargil à la suite de Jacques Quieffin continue à en extraire ainsi que du sable ocré (ferrugineux) pour le bâtiment.

Des dizaines de combattants ont pris le palais présidentiel selon des images télévisées.

« Les talibans ont gagné » a dit M. Ghani sur Facebook assurant avoir quitté son pays pour lui éviter un « bain de sang » car « d’innombrables patriotes auraient été tués » et la capitale « aurait été détruite » s’il était resté.

Les talibans sont aux portes du pouvoir 20 ans après en avoir été chassé par une coalition menée par les États-Unis en raison de son refus de livrer le chef d’Al-Qaïda Oussama Ben Laden dans la foulée des attentats du 11 septembre 2001.

La débâcle est totale pour les forces de sécurité afghanes pourtant financées pendant 20 ans à coups de centaines de milliards de dollars par les États-Unis mais qui se sont effondrées et pour le gouvernement.

Peu avant l’annonce des talibans l’ancien vice-président Abdullah Abdullah avait le premier fait savoir que le président Ashraf Ghani avait « quitté » son pays après sept années au pouvoir sans préciser où il se rendait. Son départ avait été une des principales exigences des talibans pendant les mois de négociations avec le gouvernement mais M. Ghani s’était accroché au pouvoir.

Un porte-parole des insurgés Suhail Shaheen a déclaré à la BBC qu’ils escomptaient un transfert pacifique du pouvoir « dans les prochains jours ».

Au fil de la journée la panique s’est emparée de Kaboul. Les magasins ont fermé des embouteillages monstres sont apparus des policiers ont été vus troquant leur uniforme pour des vêtements civils. Beaucoup d’Afghans surtout dans la capitale et les femmes en particulier craignent le retour au pouvoir des talibans. Lorsqu’ils dirigeaient le pays entre 1996 et 2001 ces derniers avaient imposé leur version de la loi islamique. Les femmes avaient interdiction de sortir sans un chaperon masculin et de travailler et les filles d’aller à l’école. Les femmes accusées d’adultère étaient fouettées et lapidées.

Les voleurs avaient les mains coupées les meurtriers étaient exécutés en public et les homosexuels tués. Les talibans ont maintes fois promis que s’ils revenaient au pouvoir ils respecteraient les droits humains en accord avec les « valeurs islamiques ». Mais dans les zones nouvellement conquises ils ont déjà été accusés de nombreuses atrocités : meurtres de civils décapitations enlèvements d’adolescentes pour les marier de force.

A volatile weather pattern will fuel more rounds of damaging storms and tornadoes endangering lives and property in the southern United States through the end of the week.

Copied

From flooding in Illinois to destructive tornadoes in Tennessee severe storms left behind a path of destruction on May 8.

The risk of severe thunderstorms some capable of triggering tornadoes will reach across much of the southern United States as well as part of the mid-Atlantic region through Thursday AccuWeather meteorologists warn.

While the intensity of the thunderstorms may not be as ferocious as many that erupted in the Midwest and Great Plains earlier in the week there is still the likelihood that some of the strongest storms will be capable of producing a few tornadoes. Approximately 60 million people live within the anticipated zone of severe weather through Thursday night.

The tally of filtered severe weather incidents as reported by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) from Monday through early Thursday afternoon had reached 1078 of which there were 95 reports of tornadoes. There were at least 454 incidents of severe weather on Wednesday alone making it the biggest day for severe weather of the entire outbreak.

All it takes is one brief tornado to strike a populated area which leads to great risks to lives and property. And like most prior days this week there is the potential for multiple tornadoes to occur. With each passing day the storms have pushed into progressively more densely populated areas and that trend will continue prior to the end of the week.

A reported tornado wreaked havoc in a mobile home community in Portage Michigan on May 7.

""The main threats from the thunderstorms in the East will be high winds and hail"" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty said.

A wedge of cool air will protect areas from Boston to New York City Philadelphia Baltimore and Pittsburgh areas from severe weather into Thursday night. Washington D.C. will be on the edge of the cool air influence. The cool air will occupy the lower part of the atmosphere so any thunderstorms and high winds will be forced to occur several thousand feet up and not at ground level.

The major metro areas and the airport hubs most likely to be affected by severe weather include Richmond Virginia; Montgomery Alabama; Jackson Mississippi; Shreveport Louisiana; and Dallas. As storms develop over or approach these areas and many regional secondary hubs ground stops can lead to lengthy airline delays and possible flight cancellations.

""It has been nearly a month since much of Virginia had severe storms"" Douty said ""April 15 was the last day with widespread wind and hail in the state and the mid-Atlantic region in general.""

Thursday will be an active day with severe weather from Virginia to Florida and Texas.

One cluster of thunderstorms leftover from storms that rocked the Tennessee Valley on Wednesday night will push from southern Georgia to northeastern Florida into Thursday evening. These storms will pack strong wind gusts frequent lightning torrential downpours and some hail. A few of the strongest storms in this cluster could produce a tornado.

Forecasters are particularly concerned about a cluster of thunderstorms that will race eastward across the South on Thursday night. These storms will likely have large hail damaging wind gusts and localized flash flooding. However a few of the strongest storms can produce tornadoes from north-central Texas to western Louisiana into Thursday evening.

As the storms erupt downpours alone can lead to substantial travel delays. Motorists should be alert for changing weather conditions including rapidly rising water on some area streets highways and underpasses.

Severe storms to focus on southeastern corner of US on Friday

The likelihood of severe weather will continue to progress southeastward on Friday. To close out the workweek for millions of Americans the severe weather will focus on an area from southern Alabama central Georgia and the coastal areas of the Carolinas to northern and central Florida.

If the overnight cluster of storms continues to move along the severe weather threat may end by midday in much of this zone except for perhaps central Florida.The main threats will be from storms packing high winds and hail. Some of the strongest storms may also trigger tornadoes or waterspouts.

People spending time on area beaches and the central Florida theme parks should be alert to rapidly changing weather conditions during the afternoon and evening.

Farther to the north a potent storm system will race southeastward from Canada and into the Great Lakes region on Friday and then swing into the Northeast this weekend.

""This system is likely to produce some locally gusty thunderstorms with small hail but widespread damaging winds and hail are not likely"" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson said.

The system will drop quickly across the Midwest from Friday to Saturday then slow down as it pivots across the Northeast on Saturday and Sunday where it is most likely to spoil many outdoor plans for Mother's Day weekend.

The small disturbance will mark a change in the weather pattern with massive multiday severe weather outbreaks taking an extended break over much of the Central states.

However trouble in the form of torrential downpours and drenching thunderstorms will set up along much of the Gulf Coast states especially in Texas and Louisiana from later in the weekend to the middle of next week.

The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtYmFza2V0YmFsbC9uZXdzL2pvaG4tY2FsaXBhcmktaGl0cy1ncm91bmQtcnVubmluZy1pbi1hcmthbnNhcy1hZnRlci11Z2x5LWZpbmFsLWNoYXB0ZXItYXQta2VudHVja3ktdGhhdC1zdWNrcy_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwvbmV3cy9qb2huLWNhbGlwYXJpLWhpdHMtZ3JvdW5kLXJ1bm5pbmctaW4tYXJrYW5zYXMtYWZ0ZXItdWdseS1maW5hbC1jaGFwdGVyLWF0LWtlbnR1Y2t5LXRoYXQtc3Vja3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Calipari hits ground running in Arkansas after ugly final chapter at Kentucky that 'sucks',"FAYETTEVILLE Ark. — The new guy in town regrets the optics. A sterile corner office overlooking Arkansas' Bud Walton Arena is for now a muted tribute to what is about to take place.

""They've got this a little bit like a dentist's office so I apologize"" John Calipari says stepping out from behind an empty desk.

Things will soon be cluttered complicated and all-consuming for the Hogs' new basketball coach — just not today. Coach Cal has his first new job in 15 years. He must meet people reveal the personality that comes up on you like a three-quarter court press. Not all of those people are the much-scrutinized recruits who are populating that empty roster Calipari referred to in his introductory press conference.

Some of them are holy.

""We sleep pig and wake pig"" said Father Jason Sharbaugh who has already spotted Cal on campus at mass. ""It's all the more sweet having Coach in.""

Some of them are tolerated. For now the hall-of-fame coach is sharing a temporary condo with his son Brad near the center of the campus entertainment district Dickson Street.

""They said to me 'It may get a little loud. It's down by the strip' Calipari explained. ""I was there Monday Tuesday Wednesday. No problem. Friday? One place has live music the other has karaoke the other has a DJ.

""The whole room is like shaking from [the noise]. I'm sleeping with ear plugs.""

Some — well one — is a billionaire.

""One of the things Coach Cal does is he out-cares any coach in America"" said John Tyson chairman of Tyson Foods close friend and driving force behind Calipari taking the job. ""If you do it the right way the derivative of that is you might win the national championship.""

That's really what this is all about isn't it? Not just the possibility of a natty the actual documented proof of concept. Calipari has won one among his 855 career victories. His bona fides also include six Final Fours 12 Elite Eights and 15 Sweet 16s.

None of them lately of course but at age 65 Arkansas has become the next podium from which Cal can preach. Yes Calipari has reached retirement age but looks 55 and has more left in the tank than an Escalade. Never one to leave flair on the bench the coach's departure from Kentucky was as shocking as his arrival here was spectacular.

It was both the suddenness — and the destination — that astounded. Arkansas? Hogs everywhere love their hoops.

""I grew up on that action"" said Sharbaugh pastor of University of Arkansas Newman Center Parish. ""I just love the game. Next to Jesus it's the hottest thing in the universe.""

But it's also fair to point out Arkansas' place in the sporting universe. The Razorbacks last won 11 football games in 2011. A few months later coach Bobby Petrino crashed his motorcycle with a woman on board from the staff who was not his wife. Scandal ensued.

Nolan Richardson won Arkansas' last and only basketball championship in 1994. Eric Musselman contributed two Elite Eights in five seasons before leaving last month for … USC.

""You could see that coach Musselman had a desire — if maybe the right job opened up on the West Coast — to go home"" Tyson said.

It's additionally fair then to assert this is the biggest hire in the school's athletic history. Arkansas coaches have come from Kentucky (John Pelphrey played for the Wildcats) and gone to Kentucky (Eddie Sutton) but there has been nothing like this.

The likes of Frank Broyles Sutton and Richardson pretty much made their bones here. Lou Holtz won a conference title but bolted to Minnesota before finding the crest of his career at Notre Dame.

Legends all of them but Calipari comes prepackaged — oozing championship pedigree. He's got the blueprint stored in the synapses somewhere underneath that perfectly quaffed 'do. Just step aside and let him show you. It's expected actually.

""I made the analogy this like you have a worldwide company and it's in New York … and you're being encouraged by another area"" Calipari told CBS Sports. ""So you move the headquarters.""

From CBS Sports' Matt Norlander to Jay Bilas virtually all the game's tastemakers hailed Calipari's move as a multi-level win — for Cal for Arkansas for Kentucky — for college basketball.

All of them got a reset. Of course Cal's move can't be recounted without a reminder that a sizable amount of Big Blue Nation wanted him gone. To that well Calipari can't wait to respond.

""I think some people were happy"" the coach said of his departure from Kentucky. ""[Some were saying] 'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games.' [Actually 410] We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'""

The sarcasm might as well be dripping from the ceiling. Calipari then launched into slice-of-life memories from going back to Lexington Kentucky for a day before his exit. Folks were yelling ""We love you."" A couple pulled their car over to wish him well. At Panera ""one of the ladies came from the back in tears to hug me"" Cal said.

And now he is theirs again only here.

""I'm a poor miserable sinner"" Calipari said. ""Please That's who I am. I hope I have a good heart for kids and their families. I'm not a magician and I don't have a magic wand.""

If not he's got rights to the best set of card tricks ever seen.

Regardless Arkansas has proved it is all in. There is already talk of a monster NIL war chest. As of Tuesday the once-depleted Arkansas roster now includes seven scholarship players. Two Kentucky players have transferred to Arkansas — Adou Thiero and Zvonimor Ivišić. FAU transfer Johnell Davis one of the best talents in the portal led the Owls to the 2023 Final Four. Tennessee transfer Jonas Aidoo averaged 11 and 7 for the Vols. 247Sports currently has Calipari's first Arkansas class No. 6 nationally third in the SEC.

Think of what is at stake not only Arkansas' basketball future but Kentucky's basketball brand. What if the Hogs edge past the Wildcats on the national scene at some point with Calipari?

The transition has been swift and impressive. It was made clear by Cal there will be competition at Arkansas for a tight rotation. The Division I maximum is 13 scholarships per team. Who actually plays is another thing.

""I enjoyed coaching last year. I had a ball but that was hard"" Calipari said. ""Then Reed Sheppard decides to become [SEC] Freshman of the Year. I asked him after the season 'How much did you expect to play?' He said 'Ah I thought I'd be carrying water.' Did you expect to leave here after the season? He said 'Coach I expected to be here all four years.' ""

That's a roundabout way of Cal saying he still has it. Sheppard left for the NBA after a year and is projected as a top-10 NBA Draft pick.

""My thought was 'We're going to get this' and we had a good group coming in … "" Calipari continued. ""It wasn't like we were 15-15. But there's an expectation where it's only winning championships and winning that 'ship.

Arkansas fans couldnt wait to meet new basketball coach John Calipari. Getty Images

The Calipari rollout came on a recent rainy Wednesday night at Bud Walton. Calipari looked out of place at his introductory press conference. Watching him wear red Arkansas gear was like watching Derek Jeter in a Padres uniform instead of pinstripes. Some things just need getting used to. This was life-changing in a basketball sense. Ted Owens the 94-year-old former Kansas coach who gave Calipari his first job signaled that by making the trip over from Tulsa Oklahoma.

The only thing missing was Cal's first public calling of the hogs. That's coming too and will be a major event in these parts.

""It gave [fans] a chance to really thump their chests and say 'Hey we got a blue blood's head coach to come to our university and coach our men's basketball team'"" Arkansas AD Hunter Yurachek said.

An athletic department whose budget was 10th among 14 SEC teams last year has a modern superstar on the bench. A state of only 3 million people is hungry to rally around a gregarious legend from Moon Township Pennsylvania who was once fired by the New Jersey Nets.

""I'm not going to try to get spiritual"" Calipari said. Then of course he did.

""Something nudges you and you don't know what it is"" the coach continued. ""But I've been there [at Kentucky] 15 years. Maybe it's 'You've done what I needed you to do there for the kids for the state. Now I need you to do something down there [at Arkansas].' ""

The earth-bound driving force behind the hire certainly doesn't want to be considered the driving force behind the hire. Tyson 70 is certainly the basketball patriarch of this endeavor. Yes he is the money man of many things in Arkansas. This one happens to be personal.

This is Tyson's second run at Calipari. While Calipari was at Memphis in 2007 Tyson and Broyles reached out. Calipari couldn't make himself leave his players — especially Derrick Rose — back then. Memphis then played for a national championship in 2008.

""I think we were close [to getting him] but that's when Cal said 'I'm committed to my kids' Tyson said. ""Back then kids couldn't move. Nowadays kids can move.""

Which kind of explains the game the climate and the reason for the move.

Neither Calipari nor Tyson can remember the circumstances of their first meeting two decades ago. They bonded over talk of leadership. Tyson oversees a global food company headquartered in Springdale Arkansas that is second nationally in the processing of chicken beef and pork. He reminisces lovingly about his late father Don who admired Harry Truman so much his office is built in an oval shape for two reasons.

That imitates both Truman's Oval Office and the shape of eggs laid by chickens that are so important to the company.

Calipari specializes in shaping 18-year-olds into champions for the one of the biggest brands in college basketball. His players have signed NBA contracts worth more than $4 billion.

That should be relatable to any CEO — or recruit. When Kentucky came to town Calipari would go out of his way to have Tyson at his courtside seat. Never mind Tyson being a huge Arkansas benefactor.

""He's my friend first"" he said of Calipari.

They call each other youthful nicknames of endearment — Johnny. That's why when Tyson said it's fair to say things had gotten stale between the two parties at Kentucky it means something.

""I talk to my folks around here. There are cycles"" Tyson said. 'Don't tell me you're going to retire at 65. There are business cycles. When we get to the end of the cycle do you want to sign up for another cycle?' ""

You don't have to be dunked on to get the connection. Cal has signed up for another cycle at Arkansas. And stale has different definitions. Calipari once consulted former Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall who lasted 13 years in the Big Blue maelstrom.

""I stayed three years too many"" Calipari quoted Hall as telling him.

Cal stayed at Kentucky two years beyond that. At the end of last season Tyson estimated there were three options for his friend – stay with the Wildcats chase a championship elsewhere or go do TV.

""But he's a competitor"" Tyson said.

""Last year revived me. I had so much fun with those kids and they celebrated each other"" Calipari said. ""The way it ended … I'll just say sucks.""

The first-round loss to Oakland marked the third straight year UK finished short of the Sweet 16. The last time that happened was 2006-2008 under Tubby Smith and Billy Gillespie.

The Arkansas' hiring process took less than three days. On April 4 Yurachek was in Phoenix for the Final Four. About 1 pm PT Musselman informed the AD he was taking the USC job.

Tyson first called his coaching friend to ask if he'd speak to Yurachek about vetting candidates. Yurachek called Calipari that night.

At some point Yurachek cut to the chase and asked Calipari if he was interested.

""In my judgment as a businessman either you go big [or not]"" Tyson said. ""When we were talking big I threw out three names. I said 'Do you call Bill Self? Do you call Danny Hurley or do you call Coach Cal?

'Or do you [hire] Chris Beard Jerome Tang. In the business world you call that a lateral move. You go get somebody who knows how to do the business. You're probably going to have to pay them a little more.""

It wasn't until Yurachek and Calipari talked that they found out they were in the same city for unrelated reasons. Cal was in Phoenix for an NABC meeting. (He is the current president of the coaches' organization.) Yurachek was also there for a meeting as a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee.

Calipari said any face-to-face meeting would have to happen quickly.

Tyson then told Yurachek he'd better have a plan. That is aligning the support and resources of the university to make such a hire. In other words John Calipari doesn't have to interview for the job. He just has to want it.

""Swing big … who would you hire?"" Tyson emphasized. ""Coach Cal of course.""

The two sides connected. Calipari vetted Yurachek with Houston coach Kelvin Sampson who had worked under Yurachek the former Cougars' AD.

Cal didn't want the news to leak that he had been talking to Arkansas stealing the spotlight from the Final Four. Then of course it leaked.

""I'm not mad about it"" Calipari said ""but it wasn't me and then it was like an avalanche.""

Speculation and anticipation ran wild. By that Saturday night an oral agreement was close. Only a tight circle knew – Yurachek Calipari Cal's lawyer Tom Mars and an Arkansas board member. That in itself was unique. Yurachek had once been named in a lawsuit filed by Mars who was representing former football coach Bret Bielema against the Arkansas Razorback Foundation.

""Hunter was a real pro. He was hands-on. I guess he forgave me for all the horrible things I said about him in the Bielema lawsuit"" Mars joked.

Attorney Matt McCoy who oversees athletic department legal affairs was looped in.

""We just kept at it and got the contract finished Monday night"" said a source involved in the talks. ""A land-speed record.""

It helped that Cal didn't have an agent a rarity for someone of his stature. An agent would have taken approximately $1.225 million of the $35 million Calipari is earning over those five years in fees. An agent would have possibly extended the negotiations by weeks.

Arkansas was indeed all in. The basketball world — no American sports — gasped. Dickson Street had a new inhabitant.

In the middle of the interview in that sterile office a familiar face ducked in the doorway.

""You good?"" he said.

It was not some assistant doing a preplanned drop by to make sure the interview didn't run too long. This was Brad Calipari that 27-year-old coaches' son and roommate who has moved over from the staff at Vanderbilt.

John Calipari indeed was good. For now.

""His mom is telling him to check on me every 30 minutes to see if I'm still alive"" the coach said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vU3BvcnRzL3dpcmVTdG9yeS9oYWxsLWZhbWUtZGVmZW5zaXZlLWJhY2stamltbXktam9obnNvbi1kZWFkLWFnZS0xMTAwODMwMjTSAWVodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9TcG9ydHMvd2lyZVN0b3J5L2hhbGwtZmFtZS1kZWZlbnNpdmUtYmFjay1qaW1teS1qb2huc29uLWRlYWQtYWdlLTExMDA4MzAyNA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson dead at age 86,"Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson a three-time All-Pro and member of the All-Decade Team of the 1970s has died

Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson a three-time All-Pro and member of the All-Decade Team of the 1970s has died. He was 86.

Johnson's family told the Pro Football Hall of Fame that he died on Wednesday night at home in the San Francisco area after a lengthy illness.

Johnson inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1994 played his entire 16-year pro career with San Francisco. He appeared in 213 games more than any other 49ers player at the time of his retirement.

“Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented” Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said. “The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a ‘lockdown’ cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams’ quarterbacks even look his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.”

The 49ers drafted Johnson sixth overall in 1961 out of UCLA — the Chargers of the upstart AFL took him in the fourth round of that league’s draft — and he became a starter almost immediately as a cornerback. He had five interceptions as a rookie.

But he was so versatile that the Niners used Johnson on offense in 1962 when he made 34 receptions for 627 yards and scored four touchdowns.

Preventing opponents from compiling such stats was his forte however and by 1964 Johnson was a fixture on the corner. He remained there until retiring after the 1976 season totaling 47 interceptions returning two for scores and earning a reputation as a stingy cover man with a nose for the ball.

“Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team said in a statement. “He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor.”

In 1971 in the midst of a three-year run as an All-Pro Johnson won the George Halas Award for courageous play.

“You have to be worked on cornered in and cornered out to become as good as you can be” Johnson said when he entered the Hall of Fame. “So actually I feel standing here today that I never reached that level I never reached as good a player as I could be. But thanks to God and inner talent I was able to present a picture to those individuals who were voting for the Hall of Fame and my longevity and the level of game that I played from my rookie season to my last. That on this wondrous year of 1994 I’ve been given the opportunity the glorious opportunity to become a member of the most wonderful society: The Hall of Fame.”

It reached the point when Johnson was at his peak that opponents rarely threw his way. He was Deion Sanders long before “Prime Time” hit the NFL.

“Jim doesn’t receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible” San Francisco quarterback John Brodie once said. “Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they’ll tell you they call few pass patterns in Jimmy’s area. The only reason Johnson doesn’t lead the league in interceptions is he doesn’t get the chance.”

Former 49ers coach Dick Nolan once said Johnson was a better cornerback than two of his other players (Hall of Famer) Mel Renfro and (two-time All-Pro) Cornell Green with the Cowboys.

The brother of Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson Jimmy Johnson played two ways at UCLA. He was a wingback on offense and a defensive back while also competing in track as a hurdler and broad jumper.

His brother was Johnson’s presenter for enshrinement in the Canton Ohio hall.

“Rafer Johnson is in fact my hero and that is an amazing thing in itself” Jimmy Johnson said that day. “Most young men growing up usually have a hero in another town another city another country and they will write to this individual receive an autographed photo and then tack that photo up on the wall and worship that photo play for that photo and get inspiration from that photo. No such problem for me.

“I had a brother living with me on a day-to-day basis that I was able to talk to ask the pertinent questions get the pertinent feedback and get corrected in my direction if needed. I must say I must give brother Rafer credit for everything that I have accomplished in the field of athletics. And I just wish that we could split this trophy this bust of myself right down the middle because he surely deserves half of it.”

The greatest breakdown during the storm which forced controlled electrical blackouts in Kansas and Missouri industry groups have said was natural gas which was in short supply and rose to 200 times its normal price during the worst stretch of the storm.

So far two of Kansas’ largest natural gas companies have filed to collect a combined $539.5 million from ratepayers over as long as 10 years. Some Evergy customers in Kansas will pay for $152.3 million in power costs from Winter Storm Uri over two years.

But as regulators review those companies’ plans and prepare to pass on the costs to Kansas ratepayers some groups representing large-scale customers say that — even six months later — the state has more work to do investigating the cause of huge natural gas price spikes during the storm.

“We don’t know who got the bag of cash but somebody got it” said C. Edward Watson II an attorney representing several large-scale customers including the Catholic Diocese of Wichita.

Watson on behalf of his clients joined a motion filed with the Kansas Corporation Commission by the Natural Gas Transportation Customer Coalition to subpoena a national gas price index to look for signs of market manipulation or dysfunction. NGTCC represented by attorney Jim Zakoura also wants the Kansas Gas Service to disclose the names of suppliers that charged such high prices during the storm. In the filing Zakoura wrote KGS has not challenged the extraordinarily high February gas prices.

“Essentially KGS has abandoned its advocacy on behalf of its Kansas ratepayers — the very ratepayers who will be obligated to pay $451 million for seven days of natural gas if ordered by the commission” the filing says.

KGS has yet to file a response to the motion but said in a statement it cooperated with investigations into the natural gas price spike and disputed some invoices from its suppliers. It did not answer whether it agreed with the call for subpoena of S&P Global Platts Gas Daily.

At the same time the attorney general’s office is investigating whether any price gouging took place during the storm.

The Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board the state’s dedicated consumer advocate said it’s important the parties cooperate with that investigation.

In a statement Black Hills Energy’s spokesman James Williams also pointed to the attorney general’s investigation.

“Identifying who profited from the winter storm is the responsibility of governmental bodies but the cost of gas is a pass-through expense for Black Hills Energy” Williams said. “We’re committed to helping find a solution for our customers that lessens the impact of this historic event.”

In Missouri Spire has yet to file a plan to recover the costs it incurred to keep heat on for Kansas City-area and Western Missouri residents during the storm. In an email a spokesman said the utility would file with the Public Service Commission this fall.

Spire is currently in a battle over a pipeline it installed in the St. Louis area which it says was instrumental in avoiding the need to cut off gas service to residents in eastern Missouri.

‘$1 billion and it’s all gone’

All told the Kansas Gas Service incurred an additional $390 million in extraordinary gas costs in February plus carrying costs. It has filed a plan to recover those over five seven or 10 years increasing customers’ bills by anywhere from about $5 to $11 per month.

Black Hills customers could see their bills go up by $12.23 per month to recoup $87.9 million in costs over five years.

Atmos Energy has yet to file a plan but according to its quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission it incurred an estimated $76.7 million in excess natural gas costs.

Along with Evergy’s filings loans taken out by municipalities that supply their residents power and cooperatives across the state the total cost of the storm is $953.9 million according to a filing by NGTCC. That doesn’t account for costs incurred by large-scale customers that purchase their natural gas directly such as hospitals school districts and large businesses.

Zakoura noted Kansas ratepayers weren’t getting any new wind or solar farms new or safer pipelines or other upgrades in exchange for their high bills. He called it the “most costly event in the last 50 years.”

“This is $1 billion and it’s all gone” he said.

David Nickel executive director of the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board called the event substantial but said the utilities were doing their due diligence to lessen the impact on customers. He said he understood Zakoura’s point that no new infrastructure came from the huge sum but he said it depends on “how you determine value.”

“The whole concept of being able to live through this event without having massive curtailments without having blackouts that roll through the states like we did in Texas … I think there’s value to that” he said.

To recover those costs from residents the gas utilities have to incur them prudently. If they don’t the KCC can deny the unreasonable costs. Nickel said he doesn’t see any evidence the utilities took on unreasonable costs but that CURB and KCC staff will investigate.

Williams said Black Hills’ purchases followed regulators’ instructions to “do all things possible and necessary to ensure continued natural gas service.”

And while some municipalities or large consumer customers are challenging their bills Zakoura said utilities supplying gas to residential customers aren’t doing enough to challenge the exorbitant gas prices they paid before passing the surcharges on to their customers.

Between Feb. 1 and Feb. 18 average gas prices on the Southern Star Pipeline which serves Kansas rose from $2.55 to $622.79 according to the S&P Global Platts Gas Daily which relies on gas companies to report their purchases. Zakoura said on the days the prices were highest only a handful of trades were reported to make up that average.

Zakoura filed a motion in the Kansas Gas Service’s proceedings before the KCC to subpoena the index saying there was “overwhelming circumstantial evidence of a dysfunctional market that was characterized by unconscionable price increases” during the cold snap.

The filing claimed KGS had made no effort to challenge the high prices it was charged for gas.

“This docket is not a docket that is solely focused on the issue of ‘the length of time’ that Kansas ratepayers will have in order to pay KGS $451 million” the filing said. “It is equally if not more focused on whether KGS ratepayers should pay KGS $451 million and whether Kansas residents businesses and governments should pay $1 billion for seven days supply of natural gas.”

In its statement KGS said it had made purchases tied to the S&P price which isn’t known until the market closes at the end of the day. That amounted to about 30% of the gas purchased during the storm.

The utility hasn’t “lodged an independent investigation of the prices” said spokeswoman Dawn Tripp who added that KGS disputed invoices from some of its suppliers.

KGS has yet to file a response with the KCC but has resisted Zakoura’s filings seeking to have the company disclose its suppliers saying those are confidential business dealings.

Tripp said the company submitted documents to the KCC CURB attorney general’s office NGTCC and others under a protective order. It noted the KCC staff and CURB had not objected to the protective order.

Tripp said KGS purchases gas through a competitive bid process it considered confidential.

“Natural gas suppliers may be reluctant to sell gas to Kansas Gas Service if the only option is under a public contract” Tripp said. “With fewer suppliers available to purchase gas from it would likely result in higher gas prices paid by Kansas Gas Service’s sales customers.”

Black Hills too said it does not publicly disclose contract prices.

KCC staff filed a response Thursday to Zakoura’s motion supporting KGS’ position that the documents should be confidential. In its filing it noted the KCC and CURB are designated to protect residential consumers not NGTCC.

“While staff fully understands and appreciates the extraordinary nature of the winter weather event” the filing said “staff finds it difficult to agree that the extraordinary nature of the event requires an extraordinary deviation from traditional commission practice related to confidentiality.”

A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the period of time over which Black Hills customers will see their bills increase.

The Chiefs’ preseason victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday allowed every non-starting player in uniform to showcase their skills and prove to coach Andy Reid and general manager Brett Veach that they deserve a spot on the initial roster.

As is typically the case in exhibition games some players excelled against the 49ers in the spotlight while others struggled in ways that are concerning. With just three preseason games this year the Chiefs are hoping to begin the regular season with a roster in which the depth is just as impressive as the collection of stars.

As part of our camp series along with our updated roster projections here’s an updated assessment of the players who stood out Saturday to improve their chances of staying on the roster and those who faltered in an already tight position battle.

Rising

Cornerbacks Deandre Baker and Mike Hughes

In certain preseason games you can learn more about a defense that is facing a talented rookie quarterback who will start at some point soon and 49ers phenom Trey Lance provided a perfect opportunity for Reid and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo to evaluate the Chiefs’ cornerback depth.

Sure Lance and the 49ers executed one snap perfectly completing an 80-yard touchdown bomb to receiver Trent Sherfield. The Chiefs though should feel good about Baker and Hughes who had strong snaps and were effective in coverage for most of the time Lance was on the field.

Saturday’s game marked the first time Baker had played in a game since he sustained a broken left femur in the Chiefs’ regular-season finale last year. Baker a former first-round pick entering his third year recorded two pass breakups against Lance. In the second quarter he was perfect in his zone coverage on one snap which allowed him to nearly collect an interception on a high pass from Lance. According to Pro Football Focus the 49ers targeted Baker six times Saturday and failed to complete a pass.

Meanwhile Hughes whom the Chiefs acquired this offseason in a trade from the Minnesota Vikings was physical throughout Saturday’s game recording two tackles and forcing a fumble.

Another positive sign for Hughes was that he was the Chiefs’ first kickoff and punt returner. One question many coaches have when evaluating a new player on the roster is this: How does the player respond after a mistake? After surrendering the touchdown to Sherfield Hughes caught the ensuing kickoff and returned the ball a team-high 40 yards ending the return by trucking safety Jared Mayden for about 7 yards. It was quite the determined response from Hughes who is carving a role on the team.

Tight end Jody Fortson and wide receiver Byron Pringle

In his third year with the Chiefs Fortson had played in just four preseason games before Saturday’s game. The coronavirus pandemic canceled all exhibition games last season which proved to be the biggest factor as to why Fortson didn’t make the Chiefs’ 53-man roster.

Listed at 6-foot-6 and 230 pounds Fortson has been one of the most productive players in training camp and he continued his stellar play against the 49ers. The Chiefs targeted Fortson five times the second most in the game and he finished with three receptions for 32 yards including a one-handed catch on the Chiefs’ game-winning touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.

Perhaps the most underrated part of Fortson’s performance is that he was solid on special teams and didn’t make a mistake when blocking for his teammates.

“No. 88 you can see him out there flying around” tight end Travis Kelce said of Fortson during the game on the Chiefs’ local TV broadcast. “It takes a bold guy to wear No. 88 (former Chiefs great and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez’s number) out here in Kansas City and he’s got all the athleticism to do his thing man.”

As for Pringle he used his increased speed and greater knowledge of the playbook to create more separation Saturday between him and Demarcus Robinson for the battle to win the third receiver spot on the depth chart. Pringle caught both of his targets for 10 receiving yards and he embarrassed 49ers cornerback B.W. Webb on a quick out route for a 5-yard touchdown reception.

Defensive end Tim Ward

A second-year player listed at 6-foot-6 and 255 pounds Ward has had his share of bright spots during camp. He won repetitions with his speed against left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. (who was working on certain techniques) in the one-on-one drills between defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Ward then flashed his surprising speed throughout Saturday’s game as he came off the edge with intensity to sack both Lance and quarterback Josh Rosen.

With the Chiefs having several quality defensive ends — including Chris Jones Frank Clark Taco Charlton Mike Danna and Alex Okafor — Ward will have to continue to play well in the preseason to earn a roster spot. But Saturday couldn’t have gone better for him. He is chasing a veteran such as Okafor who missed the game because of a strained hamstring on the depth chart.

Offensive linemen Andrew Wylie and Nick Allegretti

Yes one of the biggest takeaways from Saturday’s game is that the Chiefs’ new offensive linemen — Brown left guard Joe Thuney rookie center Creed Humphrey rookie right guard Trey Smith and right tackle Lucas Niang — performed well against the 49ers’ backup defensive line. But Super Bowl LV proved that the Chiefs will need to have quality backups this season to stabilize the potent offense.

Wylie a fourth-year player and Allegretti a third-year player were the best backup linemen Saturday. They didn’t commit a penalty they were solid in run blocking and they provided steady pass blocking for backup quarterbacks Chad Henne and Anthony Gordon. The versatility shown by Wylie and Allegretti should also help keep their place on the roster. Wylie played the first half as the right tackle and moved to right guard in the third quarter. Allegretti split snaps at left guard and center.

Falling

Tight end Noah Gray

In camp Gray a rookie has been stellar as a pass-catching option and willing blocker. But some rookies are a bit surprised by the increased speed of the game at the NFL level even in the preseason and that appeared to be the case for Gray on Saturday.

Gray didn’t make an egregious error but he didn’t record a reception while being targeted twice. In the second quarter Henne threw a fastball just behind Gray who was running a route toward the sideline. Gray who was known for his reliable receiving skills in college at Duke was able to get his hands on the ball but couldn’t secure the catch which led to an interception by rookie cornerback Deommodore Lenoir.

The Chiefs shouldn’t be too concerned about Gray’s performance. With two preseason games left Reid and offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy should try to increase Gray’s targets.

Receivers Gehrig Dieter and Cornell Powell

The issue for Dieter a fifth-year player and Powell a rookie is that they appear to be near the bottom of the depth chart and neither player made a highlight-worthy play that would lead to them getting more snaps in the Chiefs’ next exhibition game Friday against the Arizona Cardinals.

Dieter didn’t record a reception and committed a false-start penalty late in the second quarter to stall the Chiefs’ drive near midfield. Powell finished with two receptions for 20 yards and wasn’t impressive on special teams.

With just three training camp practices left Dieter and Powell will need to have strong performances to leap over teammates such as Marcus Kemp Daurice Fountain and Darrius Shepherd.

New story. The Chiefs' 1st preseason game was mostly uneventful. The offensive line looked just fine. Daurice Fountain & Jerick McKinnon were impressive. The interior defensive line should be a strength. Here are my takeaways from Santa Clara. https://t.co/U1h4cpVvot — Nate Taylor (@ByNateTaylor) August 15 2021

Running back Darwin Thompson

In our last assessment Thompson a third-year veteran was in the fallers category because he started training camp by missing the first week with his teammates while on the reserve/COVID-19 list. Thompson struggled at times last season and entered camp as the fourth back on the depth chart which put him on the roster bubble. Thompson needed a quality performance against the 49ers. Instead he finished with five touches for just 16 all-purpose yards.

And Thompson frustrated the coaching staff by committing an unnecessary roughness penalty in the second quarter when he used his helmet to headbutt linebacker Jonas Griffith.

Safety Devon Key

Key an undrafted rookie has received praise from the Chiefs in camp for his ability to quickly learn Spagnuolo’s system and be in the right place to earn repetitions with the projected starters. Key entered Saturday’s game with a chance of earning one of the final roster spots. But he was beaten in coverage against Sherfield who ran a double-move route on his 80-yard touchdown reception.

On the other hand safety Armani Watts a fourth-year veteran recorded an interception and a pass breakup in the second half. Those plays from Watts tightened his battle with Key for a roster spot. Key will likely have to respond with an excellent performance in each of the next two preseason games to hold off Watts.

RESEDA LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Family and friends gathered Saturday night to honor the memory of a woman who was found beaten to death inside her Reseda home.

Grieving loved ones of Michelle Avan 48 say she brightened the lives of everyone around her.

""I don't wish this on anybody but I just wish it wasn't my mom. She was too beautiful she was too kind she was too charismatic. She was just too strong of a woman"" said her son Trevon.

Avan a prominent banking executive was found dead inside her home earlier this month. She had recently taken a job with Bank of America supporting women and underrepresented groups.

A 48-year-old woman was found murdered at her Reseda home and police are seeking help from the public in tracking down a suspect.

Anthony Duwayne Turner a co-worker who was formerly in a relationship with her was arrested as a suspect shortly after her death.

The 52-year-old was charged and arraigned Monday but those who knew Avan say the charges are not enough.

""She always always told us no matter what we were going through to be strong. But this is one time where we cannot be that strong"" said one woman at Saturday's vigil.

Avan's relatives and friends say they want justice.

This summer the Art Institute of Chicago welcomes two acclaimed portraits to its galleries: Kehinde Wiley’s painting of President Barack Obama and Amy Sherald’s portrait of former First Lady Michelle Obama.

Chicago is the first stop for the Obama portraits as part of a five-city tour organized by the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery Washington D.C. As the family’s longtime home Chicago has a unique connection to the Obamas as does the Art Institute. Michelle Obama recalls visiting frequently with her family when she was growing up on the South Side and the museum was also the site of the couple’s first date.

Not only do the portraits feature history-making subjects but they were made by groundbreaking artists. Wiley and Sherald are the first African Americans to be commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to create official portraits of a president or first lady. Wiley placed a seated President Obama against a backdrop of flowers with special significance including chrysanthemums the official flower of Chicago. Sherald captured the former first lady against light-blue ground sitting and gazing directly at the viewer.

The Art Institute is thrilled to provide our visitors—from Chicago and around the world—the opportunity to experience the power and beauty of these celebrated works in our galleries. After the Art Institute presentation the portraits will travel on to the Brooklyn Museum Los Angeles County Museum of Art High Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts Houston.

At 9 p.m. Eastern time the Cartwrights and their rivals on the other two networks were interrupted by the somewhat less popular figure of President Richard Nixon.

The word “bonanza” according to the Oxford English Dictionary was introduced into American English in the 1880s to describe a highly productive or profitable mine such as the silver mines of the Comstock Lode in Cartwright country. Ironically Nixon was disrupting Sunday evening to tell Americans that the days of precious metal were over. The link between the U.S. dollar and gold — a link that dated back to the country’s adoption of the gold standard nearly a century before — was to be severed. The age of fiat money — that is of currency backed by nothing more than the credibility of the U.S. Treasury — had dawned."

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

BATH Maine — To address a growing need for diverse housing options a new affordable apartment complex was built in Bath and on Wednesday locals got to take a look during a grand opening.



Made possible through several tax credits and the guidance of MaineHousing the new 60-unit complex was developed by The Szanton Company and sits on the corner of Front and Summer streets.



Forty-two units will be reserved for those 55 and older and cost between $800 and $1500 a month to rent according to the developers.

""The mission of The Szanton Company is to create rental apartments that are moderate- to low-income which our tenants are proud to call home"" company President Nathan Szanton said at the grand opening.



The building also features several community spaces a rooftop deck and some mixed-use retail spaces some of which have already been renting before renovations and changes. Bookstore owner Jim Rice said as a retail and housing tenant seeing more affordable housing come to the downtown area is much-needed.

""Bath is in demand. It's really popular now and it's gotten more expensive"" Rice said. ""For me being right by the bookstore is ideal.""



With employers drawing folks to the midcoast area in recent years Bath Housing Authority Executive Director Deborah Keller said she is hopeful the development will address a need for diverse housing options in the greater Bath area.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9nb2xkZW4tcmV0cmlldmVycy1yaXR1YWwtd2hlbi1vd25lci1iYXRoaW5nLTE4OTcwNjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golden Retriever's Ritual When Owner's in the Bath Has Internet in Stitches,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/golden-retrievers-ritual-when-owner-bathing-1897069 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9nb2xkZW4tcmV0cmlldmVycy1yaXR1YWwtd2hlbi1vd25lci1iYXRoaW5nLTE4OTcwNjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvamVzc2ljYS1iaWVsLWVwc29tLXNhbHQtYmF0aC00OTM2MDU4NtIBTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2hlYWx0aC9qZXNzaWNhLWJpZWwtZXBzb20tc2FsdC1iYXRoLTQ5MzYwNTg2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doctors Weigh In on Jessica Biel's 20-Pound Epsom Salt Bath,"It's no secret that celebrities spend a lot of time preparing for the Met Gala whether it's going through hair and makeup trials or eating a specialized diet. Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

Warren Buffett has warned people against speculating on options and accused Robinhood of encouraging users to gamble on them instead of investing for the long term. The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO predicted derivatives would lead to risky trading and reckless brokers nearly 40 years ago.

Buffett penned a letter to John Dingell the late Democratic politician who served in the House of Representatives for nearly 60 years in 1982. The investor's missive resurfaced this week courtesy of 10-K Diver a Twitter user who teaches finance and investing concepts on the platform.

The Berkshire chief wrote to Dingell to warn against introducing futures tied to the S&P 500 index. Buffett noted that investors could short the contracts to hedge against short-term volatility but he cautioned that virtually everyone buying them would be gambling on stocks rising in the near term — not betting on the long-term performance of the underlying companies.

""The propensity to gamble is always increased by a large prize versus a small entry fee no matter how poor the true odds may be"" Buffett said. ""That's why Las Vegas casinos advertise big jackpots and why state lotteries headline big prizes.""

""The unintelligent are seduced"" by low prices and huge upside he added pointing to promoters of penny stocks and brokers who allow trading on minimal margin. Similarly gamblers would use S&P 500 futures to bet on the short-term direction of the index while avoiding margin requirements he said.

Buffett also explained why introducing futures would lead to rampant speculation and result in a net loss for investors.

""Since the casino (the futures market and its supporting cast of brokers) gets paid a toll each time one of these transactions takes place you can be sure that it will have a great interest in providing very large numbers of losers and winners"" he said.

Moreover transaction costs would make futures trading a ""negative sum game"" for investors he said. In contrast investing in stocks is a ""positive sum game"" as the underlying companies grow and generate more money for their shareholders he continued.

Buffett predicted that at least 95% of the activity involving futures would be ""strictly gambling in nature."" People would use small sums of money to bet big on short-term stock movements and brokerages would encourage them to trade more and more to maximize their cut he said.

Brokers would do better over time if they didn't let their customers fritter away their cash but they're too short-sighted to care Buffett continued. ""They often have been happiest when behavior was at its silliest"" he noted.

The Berkshire chief also warned that futures would tarnish the stock market's image as many people would get ""burned"" by them and blame their losses on stocks.

Finally Buffett argued the country needed more people investing for the long term not more gamblers egged on by brokers. Large volumes of future trading would be ""overwhelmingly detrimental to the security-buying public"" and markets as well he added.

Buffett's warnings about futures nearly four decades ago could easily be written about options today as a new generation of traders continue to buy them based on memes and social media.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYmlsbF9zdG9uZS8yMDIxLzA4LzE1L2Etd2Vlay1vZi1yZXRhaWwtdGhlcmFweS1mb3ItdGhlLW1hcmtldHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Week Of Retail Therapy For The Markets,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2021/08/15/a-week-of-retail-therapy-for-the-markets/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYmlsbF9zdG9uZS8yMDIxLzA4LzE1L2Etd2Vlay1vZi1yZXRhaWwtdGhlcmFweS1mb3ItdGhlLW1hcmtldHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvd2FudC10by1yYWlzZS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLWtpZHMtamVmZi1iZXpvcy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zYXktdGhpcy1zaW1wbGUtcnVsZS1wYXlzLW9mZi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to Raise Successful Kids?

The best laptop overall

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The Dell XPS 15 OLED 2022 is our top pick for engineering students who want a slim powerful ultraportable that's easy to carry all day.

All models of the refreshed Dell XPS 15 pack the latest Intel Core CPUs and come bundled with Windows 11. Higher-end configurations feature an Nvidia GPU which gives this laptop some serious muscle for CAD work and gaming. The sheer power you can pack into this svelte elegant ultraportable make the XPS 15 one of the best laptops for engineering students and that's before you consider the great speakers and gorgeous immersive InfinityEdge display.

If you can afford it we recommend you splurge for the 3.5K OLED touchscreen upgrade -- it makes everything you do on the display look nicer. However the OLED model we tested lasted under 8 hours on our battery test which isn't great if you need this laptop to last through a full day at school. If you don't care about OLED and don't need the higher resolution for your work we recommend the XPS 15 with a discrete Nvidia GPU and a FHD (1920 x 1200) display — it should last a bit longer on a single charge with the lower-resolution screen.

The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a powerful 14-inch laptop built for gaming on the go — but engineering students can turn all that power to more productive uses.

What sets the Zephyrus G14 above other gaming laptops in our eyes is the incredible 10+ hours of battery life it delivers when you’re not gaming ensuring you can carry this through a day of classes without need to scramble for a charger. And at a price that typically ranges from $1000 - $2000 the ROG Zephyrus G14 is pretty affordable for a gaming laptop — and that's key for students trying to keep costs down.

The Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra is a powerful laptop that’s capable of handling everyday computing tasks video editing and high-end gaming thanks to its discrete Nvidia GPU. All of that muscle makes it a great choice for doing demanding work and running GPU-intensive tasks in engineering school.

In addition to its impressive performance this notebook also packs a gorgeous 16-inch OLED display that makes viewing content and playing games a pure joy. On its own it’s a fantastic Windows 11 laptop.

The biggest rival to the Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra is the MacBook Pro 16-inch and you might consider the Macbook Pro 2023 if you'd prefer a macOS laptop. But Samsung’s laptop is remarkably lighter has a full-size USB port and offers a more colorful (albeit dimmer) OLED display.

5. Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 The best 2-in-1 for engineering students Our expert review: Specifications Display: 14.4-inch 120 Hz touchscreen (2400 x 1600 pixels) CPU: 13th Gen Intel Core i7 GPU: Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050-4060 GPU RAM: 16-64 GB Storage: 512GB - 2TB SSD Weight: 4.18 lbs (integrated graphics) 4.37 lbs (Nvidia GPU) Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (1TB) View at Best Buy (1TB) View at Microsoft US Reasons to buy + Display is bright and color-accurate + Doubles as a solid gaming laptop + Expanded port array is a nice upgrade + Sliding screen gives this 2-in-1 unique value Reasons to avoid - Middling battery life - No stylus included limits this laptop's versatility

Microsoft's Surface Laptop Studio 2 is a powerful 2-in-1 with a MacBook Pro-like design and an eye-catching hinged display. This is Microsoft’s flagship device for Windows 11 which promises to make Windows a more inviting place for both work and play. Like Windows 11 the Surface Laptop Studio is advertised as a one-stop shop for productivity entertainment and creative work.

And for the most part it is all that: its 13th Gen Intel CPU and 16+ GB of RAM gives you enough power to tackle most work and if you splurge for a model with the discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 or 4060 GPU the Surface Laptop Studio also doubles as a decent machine for gaming or video editing on the go. We've also heard it's an ideal choice for college engineering programs which require laptops that both have a discrete GPU and can be used with an active stylus. While you have to pay extra for the Microsoft Surface Slim Pen 2 stylus its haptics make writing or drawing on the Studio's 14.4-inch 120Hz touchscreen feel great.

However it's a bit pricey when you kit it out and despite its great components the Surface Laptop Studio delivers subpar performance compared to the best MacBooks and Windows laptops. But few laptops can match its intriguing sliding hinged display which can be tented over the keys like an easel or slid all the way flat to turn the Studio into a heavy tablet.

6. Alienware m18 The best big-screen engineering laptop Our expert review: Specifications Display: 18-inch QHD+ 165Hz CPU: Intel Core i9-13980HX GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 RAM: 32GB Storage: 1TB SSD Dimensions: 16.1 x 12.6 x 1.05 inches Weight: 8.5 - 8.9 pounds Tested battery life: 4:33 Today's Best Deals View at Dell (AMD Ryzen) View at Dell (AMD Ryzen 7) View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Great performance + Satisfying CherryMX keyboard + Speakers get nice and loud + Big screen great for work/gaming Reasons to avoid - Bigger and heavier than nearly every other laptop - Awkward port placement

The Alienware m18 is the biggest most powerful gaming laptop we've tested to date. It's too heavy hot and loud to be of much use on the go but when plugged in it runs the latest games as well as some of the best gaming PCs truly earning the term desktop replacement.

If you want a PC for school but want something more portable than a traditional tower and a monitor the m18 is an interesting compromise. The 18-inch screen feels almost as big as a full-size monitor and the incredible weight of this laptop isn't a big problem when you rarely move it.

The low-profile CherryMX mechanical keys are also a delight to type on and the speakers and screen are good enough for gaming. The port placement is a little odd (why put a single USB-C port on the right-hand side right up near the front?) and the heat this thing kicks off is truly scorching when it gets going but if power and screen size are all you care about (and price is no object) this is the biggest best laptop to buy.

7. Razer Blade 15 Advanced An excellent — and expensive — laptop for engineering students Our expert review: Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Display: 15.6-inch QHD 240Hz as reviewed CPU: 10th-Gen Intel Core i7-10875H 2.3GHz GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 RAM: 32 GB Storage: 1 TB SSD Dimensions: 14.0 x 9.3 x 0.7 inches Weight: 4.4 lbs Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Sleek lightweight design + Great gaming performance + Lots of ports Reasons to avoid - Lackluster touchpad and keyboard - Convoluted screen options

The Razer Blade 15 Advanced does exactly what you’d expect a Razer laptop to do: it looks great offers plenty of ports and runs games and other graphically-demanding apps beautifully. It’s also as expensive as you’d expect a Razer laptop to be — you could easily spend $3000 on a higher-end model.

Obviously that's a bit steep for many students but it's about on par with comparable laptops. The Alienware m15 R4 is similarly priced for example and both offer great performance in a slim package. However the Razer Blade 15 Advanced is just a bit lighter and a bit smaller than the m15 R4 and it lasts an hour or so longer during normal (i.e. non-gaming) use.

However the Blade 15 Advanced's keyboard and touchpad are lackluster at best. They'll work well enough for classroom use but if you expect to be doing a lot of typing on this laptop you'd be well-served by investing in one of the best keyboards.

How to choose the best laptop for you

How to choose the best engineering laptop for you

Performance: If you're going to be spending years studying engineering you're going to need a computer with enough power to handle anything your teachers throw at you. We recommend at least a new mid-range CPU (Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5) and at least 8 GB of RAM though if you can afford to spend more on on a laptop with better specs it will pay off in the long run.

Graphics and gaming: Most gaming laptops come with discrete graphics cards so they can run the latest games well but the same card can be equally vital to engineering students who will be using CAD (computer-assisted design) and 3D analysis programs. These kinds of applications really benefit from the power of a good GPU so if you're expecting to do any graphics or 3D work it's a good idea to invest in a laptop with a discrete Nvidia or AMD graphics card.

Operating system: Laptops typically come in three flavors: Windows (most mainstream PCs) macOS (MacBooks) and Chrome OS (Chromebooks). Chrome OS isn't good for much besides web surfing file management and light computing so a Chromebook isn't a great choice for serious schoolwork. However a crafty student could install Linux on a high-powered Chromebook to turn it into a decent laptop for engineering work.

Many engineering students spend a lot of time working with specialized or self-developed software so Windows is often preferable over macOS because it throws up fewer roadblocks when using such tools. However even Windows can sometimes get in the way of serious engineering work which is why many engineering students get Windows laptops and install Linux on them so they can dual-boot into either operating system.

As mentioned above when making your buying decision be sure to consult your teachers and/or the engineering department at your school for more specific advice on what you'll need for your studies. Whichever system you decide on it's a good idea to pair it with the best mouse for your particular work situation.

How we tested these laptops

How we test the best laptops for engineering students

To find the best laptops we run every machine through a rigorous suite of benchmarks and real-world tests to gauge how it will perform during everyday use.

We measure the average brightness and color quality of each laptop's display using our in-house light meter and colorimeter. For general performance we run our machines through tests that include Geekbench 5 (CPU performance) as well as various 3DMark tests to measure graphics capabilities. We also run a file transfer test to measure how fast a machine's hard drive is and a custom battery test that has the machine browse the internet over Wi-Fi until it runs out of juice.

Plus we run the graphics benchmark test in Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Gathering Storm to get a sense of how well a laptop can handle basic games. When testing dedicated gaming laptops we run benchmarks for a number of games such as Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Far Cry: New Dawn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZzMzNTMzNjk4L3NhZmVzdC1tb3N0LXJlbGlhYmxlLWNhcnMtYW5kLXN1dnMtZm9yLXRlZW5zLWZvci11bmRlci0xMDAwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Used Cars Under $10000 for Teen Drivers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g33533698/safest-most-reliable-cars-and-suvs-for-teens-for-under-10000/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZzMzNTMzNjk4L3NhZmVzdC1tb3N0LXJlbGlhYmxlLWNhcnMtYW5kLXN1dnMtZm9yLXRlZW5zLWZvci11bmRlci0xMDAwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NzaG9vdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE0L3BvZHN3YXAtYmF0dGVyeS1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC1mb3ItYWdpbmctYWlycG9kcy1pcy1pdC13b3J0aC1pdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Podswap battery replacement for aging Airpods. Is it worth it?,"Many products these days are designed not to be repaired. It’s a shame too as landfills are bursting all over the globe and recycling helps but it’s just not enough. I always feel bad when electronic products die and can’t be repaired.

I ran into this issue recently with my first-generation AirPods. I really like these as they fit in my ear perfectly and sound pretty darn good. Unfortunately their battery is starting to wear out and they don’t last more than 15 minutes anymore. What to do? Chuck em and buy new ones? Maybe.

I was researching other options for earbuds and a Twitter friend recommended Podswap. They replace the battery on both first and second-generation AirPods. Now you don’t get yours fixed. They send you a repaired pair and you send yours back to them and the cycle continues.

At first I wasn’t sold on the idea since it cost $59 to get a pair with fresh batteries. My Airpods lasted for years and only in the last few months did I notice the battery dying quickly and more in one than the other but I do like them and I figured why not! So I went for it.

The process is as simple as it gets. You order the same version of Airpods that you own. You can’t send them a Gen 1 and order a Gen 2 or upgrade. It has to be the same model. Gen 1 costs $59 and Gen 2 models are $69. Shipping was $4.99 to San Diego and they came from Florida so I’m assuming that is about as much as it will cost since it’s clear across the country.

They arrived quickly and in good condition. One of the Airpods had some scratches but it doesn’t affect the feel in the ear. I had to remind myself that these are refurbished and not new.

They come in plastic containers with a foam insert so they travel in comfort. I swapped them out and inserted the newish Airpods in my charging case and let them charge up. Podswap states it will take several charges to get them to peak battery life performance.

All in all I’m pleased with the service. I now have a pair of Airpods that are as good as new with a much longer battery life again plus I feel good finally not throwing a piece of electronics to the landfill.

What You Get

2 Recycled* AirPods (R & L)

Good as New Battery Life

Fully Sanitized and Cleaned

Free Return Shipping Included

90 Day Warranty

*The AirPods you receive are recycled therefore fine scratches and other minor imperfections may be visible on your replacement units.

I bought a new pair of Airpod Pros anyway but for different use as the noise canceling and audio quality are really good. For casual use and phone calls the gen 1 is perfection.

Ineligible Physical Conditions

While the service is straightforward there are some rules you have to abide by. You keep your charging case and Podswap doesn’t repair the battery on the cases.

Broken or have broken mesh

Permanently stained

Cracked or with deep dents

Broken or have broken mesh

Fake or discolored

Water damaged or corroded

Ineligible Functional Conditions

Cannot power on

Microphone does not work

Another cool option is if you lost one Airpod you can purchase a replacement for $49.99. Not as good of a deal as getting the replacement battery but hey good to have the option.

If you want to give this service a try you can use this code to save 10% off. I get nothing from this except the good feeling of one less thing that goes to the trash heap.

Every year EISA's Expert Group members including editors from this publication test a very wide range of new products from their field of expertise before comparing results and voting to decide the cream of every product category.

To win an EISA award all products undergo a comprehensive multi-step judging process. So while EISA's annual Convention in Antwerp in May and Awards Meeting in June were once again both cancelled due to the pandemic the comprehensiveness of the Association's product testing was not diminished. EISA hosted no fewer than 40 webinars that put new technologies and brands in front of its expert editorial audience. This combined with regular video conferences for the Expert Groups and the shipment of products between member countries allowed judging to extend over many months fuelling lengthy and highly informed discussions. EISA's democratic voting process was reinforced establishing a consensus of excellence that ultimately determined the winning products.

EISA FLOORSTANDING LOUDSPEAKERS 2021-2022

Monitor Audio Silver 500 7G

The seventh generation of Monitor Audio's Silver Series incorporates a wide range of acoustic innovations all on show in the magnificent floorstanding flagship of the range the Silver 500 7G. The C-CAM metal/ceramic tweeter has a new motor and housing for cleaner sweeter treble while the RST II midrange and bass drivers are fashioned from an improved ceramic-coated alloy for greater stiffness. Add in a refined crossover and a beautifully-finished enclosure into which the drivers are fixed with bolt-through mountings and you have a speaker as adept with the finest detail as it is developing a massive powerful view of the music.

The original EISA Award-winning LS50 loudspeaker was widely acclaimed but KEF's engineers have taken it to a new level with numerous detail revisions including the use of Metamaterial Absorption Technology to further control unwanted driver resonances. That may seem like a small internal upgrade but the result is a magnificent compact speaker capable of a huge soundstage generous bass and terrific imaging. It's an already impressive speaker now transformed into something truly special and at the price is the very best of its genre. If space is tight – or even if it isn't – these remarkable speakers are the ones to have and the strikingly attractive looks further enhance their user-appeal.

System Audio's elegant active speaker is not only slender but it's packed with technology to allow the user to achieve the optimum sound and then tweak it to their own taste. Use it with the optional wireless Stereo Hub and you get a choice of automated and manual equalisation to adapt the speaker to your room. System Audio offers a generous pick 'n' mix approach to DSP including downloadable 'RAM Tweaks' to further reconfigure the sonic balance. However most impressive of all is this wireless speaker's compelling sound which majors on resolution bass power and a fine grasp of rhythm.

Developed from the original LS50W design using the same Metamaterial Absorption Technology found in the LS50 Meta model this is much more than just a pair of speakers. In fact it's a complete wireless hi-fi system able to play music from portable devices local network storage and streaming services all under the control of a cleverly-designed app. Set-up and configuration is simple meaning you'll have music playing in minutes while the combination of KEF's Uni-Q driver and plenty of internal amplifier power delivers a focused involving sound way beyond expectations for speakers so small. They can handle hi-res music or just Bluetooth from your phone look fabulous whether on shelves or their dedicated stands – and of course have that 'hi-fi without all the boxes' appeal.

Wilson Audio's Sabrina was long-established as a remarkable compact high-end speaker but for this X model the company has made some major changes to further enhance performance. These start with those beautiful cabinets now made from the inert X-material from which the speaker takes its name finished in a choice of WilsonGloss paint colours. The tweeter is derived from the company's flagship models for better detail and 'air' and while the midrange is retained from the original Sabrina a new woofer delivers tighter faster bass. The result? An expanded soundstage and extended bass delivering massive scale with free-breathing atmosphere and ambience – whatever you play.

On rare occasions it's hard to associate the equipment before you with the sound you're hearing. Take as an example the amazing KEF KC62 subwoofer – it's tiny at just 25cm per side with a pair of drivers just 16.5cm in diameter and yet this seemingly miraculous speaker delivers massive fast and tautly controlled bass down to subterranean depths. So the KC62 is so small you can hide it away almost anywhere but the performance is all down to clever design – the opposed drivers use Uni-Core force cancelling each powered by a 500W amplifier all under the control of digital signal processing. Want even more fun? Try using two of them!

Compact clever and capable of driving even demanding speakers to deliver a room-filling sound – whether from your phone your computer or streaming services – the EVO 150 is all the system many users will ever want or need. It has style on its side and amazing flexibility including balanced inputs and a phono stage but the most outstanding feature here is how simple it makes set-up and operation for breathtaking performance. The Cambridge Audio engineers have considered everything from the way the EVO 150 leads you through installation to the superb StreamMagic app control making this a system all the family can enjoy with class-leading sound.

This may be the more affordable of two integrated amplifiers in Rotel's revived Michi lineup but it's undoubtedly the sweet spot of the range combining 'drive anything' confidence with speed warmth and the ability to switch from pile-driver to a gossamer touch when required. There's no shortage of power here but the Michi X3 carries its massive output lightly being fast detailed and beautifully controlled and is all the more rewarding as a result. Add in its flexibility build quality and sheer style and you have an amp able to take on all the super-integrated amplifiers now available and show most of them a clean pair of heels.

NAD started its story making amplifiers and has been researching and developing the technology for almost half a century. All that shows in the unassuming-looking C 298 power amplifier designed for use in everything from conventional hi-fi and home cinema systems to hideaway custom installations. It has single-ended and balanced inputs for flexibility and switchable signal-sensing for remote operation while its energy-efficient Purifi Eigentakt amplification technology gives it the ability to drive just about any speaker with impunity. The sound is spectacular and upgradable too – switch it into bridge mode and you have a 600W+ monoblock!

Hegel has taken its time adding a dedicated phono stage to its acclaimed series of amplifiers but it's been worth the wait. The V10 is designed to service a wide range of moving-coil and moving-magnet cartridges aided by its highly flexible gain loading and subsonic filter settings that are selected via a matrix of DIP switches underneath the black case. Indeed the elegant but functional Norwegian styling belies the scope of this vinyl-loving preamp. So it's worth taking the time to dial-up the optimum settings and realise a sound that's both smooth and gloriously insightful and clearly 'voiced' to partner Hegel's other electronics.

Bluesound's multiroom wireless system was revolutionary when it first appeared its BluOS platform having been designed to play music all the way up to hi-res with a process of refinement and development ever since. This latest version of its NODE music player is a simple way to bring multiroom to your system with Wi-Fi Ethernet Apple AirPlay 2 aptX HD Bluetooth and USB-A to access audio content from streaming services Internet radio and your own music library. And the new NODE now also has HDMI ARC for audio from TVs and gaming systems – all controlled using the intuitive BluOS Controller app or via the popular voice assistants.

It's hard not to form initial impressions of the RS150 based on the way it looks from its build quality to that graphic-filled full-width touchscreen display but it soon becomes clear there's more to it than meets the eye. This is an accomplished – and extremely flexible – player/DAC that will play everything from Bluetooth streams to hi-res content and you can even install SSD storage to make it a complete library and player in one unit. The sound is striking too majoring on richness and detail that contributes to a very mature presentation. This is a decidedly impressive debut for the Korean brand.

Cambridge Audio has been making DACs since 1994 and it all shows in the latest addition to its DacMagic line the 200M. It lives up to the precedent of its illustrious forebears with an attractive combination of solid build ease of use and performance plus wide-ranging file-format compatibility all the way up to 768kHz/24-bit and DSD512 (at least via its USB input). Easy to use it's not only an excellent 'desktop audio' device that'll drive headphones to good effect but it will also serve up a storm in a main audio system with its crisp rewarding and expressively-detailed sound.

Launched to celebrate the company's 30th anniversary this very refined version of Pro-Ject's entry-level turntable comes with a raft of improvements not least of which is a new one-piece alloy/carbon fibre tonearm. The platter is now more heavily damped and non-magnetic the suspension of both arm and motor have been enhanced and a new Pick it Pro cartridge comes pre-fitted for near instant set-up and use. Described as 'the ultimate expression of the Debut concept' it sounds assured and involving – it's an absolute knock-out and a new champion for the entry level.

It may have ceased production more than half a century ago but the Thorens TD 124 turntable retains legendary status and is still much sought after. While the latest version may look much like the original the 'DD' on the model number shows this is now a direct-drive design complete with a new and very adjustable tonearm to complete the retro looks especially when fitted with the SPU 124 pick-up. There's even a pop-up adapter for 'jukebox' singles but whatever you play on the TD 124 DD it delights with its speed slam and sheer weight. It may look vintage but the sound is compellingly up to date.

The latest variation on Ortofon's long-running 2M moving-magnet cartridge design pays tribute to Beethoven 250 years after his birth complete with a picture of the composer on the side of its body. It fits the bill with a silky sophisticated presentation especially well-suited to classical jazz and acoustic music. Refined and composed it uses a version of the stylus and cantilever found in the company's Cadenza Black moving-coil cartridge. This along with a new suspension all contributes to a sound that boasts rock-solid imaging great stereo focus and depth along with a smooth lush view of strings and other acoustic instruments.

Marantz's 30 series has a new style influenced by the design of classic models from the company's past combined with up-to-date capability within. The Model 30 amplifier and its matching SACD 30n player are a triumph: the amplifier plays it simple concentrating on the purest possible sound from its all-analogue design while the SACD/CD/network player brings a whole world of musical opportunity to the party from discs to streaming and more. 'Modern Musical Luxury' is how Marantz describes this combination and with its blend of rich powerful sound features and gorgeous build quality this stereo system delivers on that promise.

With an eye to the seemingly unstoppable rise of headphone listening Naim created this version of its entry-level Uniti Atom dedicated to headphone use. With amplifier technology trickled down from the company's flagship Statement product the Uniti Atom Headphone Edition combines wide-ranging network and streaming audio capability with both balanced and single-ended headphone outputs and it can also be used as a streaming preamp into a power amplifier or active speakers. Whichever you choose it plays music with authority and immense impact and will really make the most of partnering equipment.

Focal's Clear headphones were already a superb performer but with the arrival of the Mg version the company has raised the bar even further. Changes include a new pure magnesium driver (hence the name) improvements to resonance control within the open-back housings and in the alignment of those drivers relative to the user's ear. The result is a headphone sound that retains all the openness of the original but now offers better speed clarity and precision. It reveals even more detail in the music and creates a palpably realistic sense of an acoustic spread before you not enclosed within your head.

T+A made an ambitious entry into the headphone arena aiming straight for the top with its Solitaire P model and a matching HA200 headphone amplifier. The P-SE is a little more affordable than the original design thanks to some simplification of the planar magnetic drivers and their motor system but this is still an unapologetically high-end design able to deliver a wide-open view of the music while still presenting it with weight richness and impact. Above all they impress with the way everything hangs together from the weight of a double bass to the finest detail in the high treble making for an entirely thrilling listen.

Sennheiser has long had an enviable position in the audio market from its excellent headphones to its role as a supplier of microphones for everything from recording to live performances. And in the HD 560 S Sennheiser brings together all that knowledge in a design able to deliver a wide-open sound with exceptional detail and fast clean bass plus a realistic impression of soundstage. The new drivers use a polymer blend for linear response and an airy treble while the angled drivers combine with the open-backed design to create a real sense of presence.

Power is everything – that's the thinking behind the Hypsos a hugely flexible DC power supply from Polish brand Ferrum designed to replace all those plug-top supplies with which so many hi-fi components are now provided. It can deliver clean DC power over a range of 5V to 30V and comes complete with pre-loaded settings for over 100 popular products. Or you can set up your own output parameters complete with fine adjustment to find the power setting 'sweet spot'. It represents a potent upgrade for a wide range of devices not least USB DAC/headphone amplifiers typically encouraging a sound with greater ease and smoothness – and yes power!

This article was first published at Labor Notes.

History repeated itself as hundreds of miners spilled out of buses in June and July to leaflet the Manhattan offices of asset manager BlackRock the largest shareholder in the mining company Warrior Met Coal.

Some had traveled from the pine woods of Brookwood Alabama where 1100 coal miners have been on strike against Warrior Met since April 1. Others came in solidarity from the rolling hills of western Pennsylvania and the hollows of West Virginia and Ohio.

Among them was 90-year-old retired Ohio miner Jay Kolenc in a wheelchair at the picket line — retracing his own steps from five decades ago. It was 1974 when Kentucky miners and their supporters came to fight Wall Street in the strike behind the film Harlan County USA.

“Coal miners have always had to fight for everything they’ve ever had” Kolenc said. “Since 1890 when we first started nobody’s ever handed us anything. So we’re not about to lay our tools down now.”

The longest that miners ever went on strike was for 10 months in 1989 against the Pittston Coal Company in West Virginia defending hard-won health care benefits and pension rights. Some 3000 miners got arrested in that strike. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka who passed away on August 5 was president of the Mine Workers (UMWA) at the time.

In Manhattan mixed in the sea of camouflage T-shirts outside BlackRock was a smattering of red and blue shirts — retail grocery stage and telecom workers. The miners and supporters circled the inner perimeter of four police barricades chanting “Warrior Met Coal ain’t got no soul!” and whooping it up.

Postal and sanitation trucks honked in solidarity. “You’re in New York City” Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts told the crowd. “When somebody comes by driving a trash truck they’re in a union. Chances are somebody comes along with a broom in their hand they’re in a union.”

“Where’s Our Money?”

The strikers are fighting to reverse concessions that were foisted on them in 2016 when newly formed Warrior Met Coal bought two mines and one preparation plant from Jim Walter Resources during bankruptcy proceedings. BlackRock became one of the three majority shareholders in the new company.

Since then the union calculates that workers have forked over $1.1 billion in pay overtime vacation safety health care and other benefits to help the company regain solvency. Today 26 hedge funds have investments in Warrior Met stock signaling their confidence in its profitability.

“We want everything back. And then some. That’s the message we’re trying to send to BlackRock” said Michael Wright a miner for 16 years.

Warrior Met produces coal used in steel production in Asia Europe and South America. In response to the strike it has scaled back production left one mine idle and stopped stock buybacks Bloomberg reported. The strike has cost the company $17.9 million according to its second-quarter earnings report.

Shortly after the miners walked out management returned to the table with an offer that would have recouped just $1.50 of the $6 cut in wages from the 2016 contract and left intact punitive disciplinary policies and benefits concessions. The miners voted it down 1006 to 45.

“We come back to the table and they’re offering less what we were making originally” said Brian Seabolt another 16-year coal miner.

“We go underground to sacrifice our lives for our families” said Wright. “They’re making billions of dollars. Where’s our money?”

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has burnished his public image as a benevolent capitalist concerned about climate change and social justice. The strikers hope to gain leverage by tarnishing that image.

BlackRock has a shield that makes that harder: two-thirds of its investments are in index funds passively managed portfolios that bundle together investments regardless of social impact.

But it’s even harder to hit it hard enough in the pocketbook to have an impact: Warrior Met makes up just a tiny fraction of BlackRock’s portfolio. The asset manager had a record $9.5 trillion in assets under management at the end of June.

Nonetheless to hurt profits strikers were blocking scabs from entering the mines — until the company obtained an injunction to stop them. Despite that the mines produced only 1.2 million tons of coal during the second quarter — a million less than the same period last year.

A Grueling Job

Another striker on the Manhattan picket line was Tammy Owens a former steelworker. She switched to mining because it had better pay and benefits though the job was grueling. “And then a few years later I ended up with worse benefits than what I had at the steel plant” she said.

Since the strike she has picked up a side job to provide for her family. The union has also distributed $4.3 million to miners to cover health care.

Besides pay and benefits the 2016 concessions included a punitive attendance policy that one miner’s wife described to journalist Kim Kelly as “four strikes and you’re out.”

“If I had a heart attack they can give me a strike” Owens said. “They don’t accept a doctor’s excuse. Even if I have something contagious that I can give to other people — pneumonia the flu strep throat you name it — you have to come to work.”

Excessive overtime is another flashpoint (shades of Frito-Lay and Amazon). Miners have been forced into 12-hour shifts stretching into weekends — without the double pay on Saturday and triple pay on Sunday that they used to get.

And health care looms large. Costs shot up; the company now covers only 80 percent of the premium. “We need 100 percent” said miner Dedrick Gardner. “Considering the work conditions in a coal mine health care is vital. You’re dealing with silicosis black lung diesel smoke.”

Black lung is caused by breathing in coal dust. The dust silts up the lungs scarring and destroying them.

“Health insurance went from $12 for seeing any doctor in the world to $1500 family deductible and co-pays up to $250” said Local 2245 President Brian Michael Kelly.

Toxic and Dangerous

Safety is a perennial concern. “I work 2200 feet underground in one of the most gaseous mines in the world” Owens said. “If something goes wrong it could blow the top off the ground.”

In 2001 13 workers died at one of the mines now owned by Warrior Met after a slab of rock fell and set off a methane gas explosion burning and pounding miners to death with chunks of rock.

Despite that tragedy the 2016 contract eroded safety standards. And the situation is presumably even worse for the scabs inside now.

“Nonunion mines are continuously known for cutting corners and creating unsafe working environments in order to increase production” said union spokesperson Erin E. Bates via email. “Warrior Met Coal is currently mining and processing coal with unskilled workers. We are concerned it is only a matter of time until someone gets seriously hurt.”

Without the union watchdog apparently the company’s environmental practices slipped too. Shortly after the strike began wastewater from one of the mines suddenly turned local creeks black with pollution.

Blackstone holds a 34.18% stake in the auto component maker through an entity called Singapore VII Topco III PTE Ltd. The private equity firm had sold 31.48% stake worth ₹5250 crore in the company’s IPO in June.

“Under the ERI Plan Singapore VII proposes to give the identified employees cash payments from the proceeds it received/receives from a Disposition Event (Disposition Payments). These Disposition Payments may be made in three installments part at the time of the Disposition Event and then on the first and second anniversaries of Singapore VII’s complete disposition of its ownership in the Company as per ERI Plan. Thus through staggered long term payment structure the ERI Plan is expected to promote retention of the employees"" the AGM notice said. The AGM will be held on 9 September.

The amount of the cash awards made to the employees will depend on the multiple of the invested capital and returns realised by Singapore VII from the proceeds of the stake sale it added.

“Subject to Singapore VII achieving the identified return thresholds and an upper cap the indicative amount of cash awards for the eligible employees (collectively) may range between 1 % (one percent) and 4% (four percent) of the gross proceeds realized by Singapore VII across all Disposition Events. No payments will be made under the ERI Plan if the identified threshold returns are not satisfied in a Disposition Event"" the notice said.

“The payment of such cash awards is intended to be a gesture of appreciation and recognition towards the identified employees and their contribution to the growth of the company and the value which they create for all shareholders"" it added.

The company did not specify the number of employees covered under this plan.

As of today Blackstone’s stake in the company is worth ₹10000 crore which at current prices will imply a payout of between ₹100 crore and ₹400 crore under the incentive plan. To be sure the final number will depend on the eventual value achieved when Blackstone exits the company and the various conditions laid down under the plan.

Such exit-linked incentive plans are used by PE firms to attract top industry talent to their companies and ensure alignment of interests between the senior management and investors.

Last year Blackstone had announced a similar plan for Essel Propack where select employees of Essel can make up to $89 million or ₹672 crore if Blackstone exits the firm at certain predefined return thresholds.

At the lower end of the targeted returns range the total cash award could be as much as $22 million while the maximum cash award under the incentive plan could be $89 million. To be sure no pay-outs will be made under the ERI Plan if the identified threshold returns are not satisfied.

On Friday Aug. 13 2021 Boeing and NASA officials said the capsule is grounded for months and possibly even until next year because of a vexing valve problem. Credit: NASA via AP

Boeing's astronaut capsule is grounded for months and possibly even until next year because of a vexing valve problem.

Boeing and NASA officials said Friday that the Starliner capsule will be removed from the top of its rocket and returned to its Kennedy Space Center hangar for more extensive repairs.

Starliner was poised to blast off on a repeat test flight to the International Space Station last week—carrying a mannequin but no astronauts—when the trouble arose. A similar capsule was plagued by software issues in 2019 that prevented it from reaching the space station.

""We're obviously disappointed"" said John Vollmer vice president and program manager of Boeing's commercial crew program. ""We will fly this test when we're ready to fly it and it's safe to do so.""

Kathy Lueders head of NASA's human exploration office said it's ""another example of why these demo missions are so very important to us ... to make sure we have the system wrung out before we put our crews on.""

Boeing's performance is in stark contrast to that of SpaceX NASA's other contracted taxi service. SpaceX has flown 10 astronauts to the space station in just over a year with four more due to launch aboard the company's Dragon capsule at the end of October. Elon Musk's company will mark another first next month when it launches a billionaire into orbit with three guests two of them contest winners.

Vollmer said moisture in the air somehow infiltrated 13 valves in the capsule's propulsion system. That moisture combined with a corrosive fuel-burning chemical that had gotten past seals preventing the valves from opening as required before the Aug. 3 launch attempt.

As of Friday nine of the valves had been fixed. The other four require more invasive work.

Rain from a severe thunderstorm penetrated some of the capsule's thrusters at the pad but engineers do not believe that is the same moisture that caused the valves to stick. Engineers are trying to determine how and when the moisture got there; it could have been during assembly or much later Vollmer said.

The 13 in question are among dozens of valves that are tied into thrusters needed to get the capsule into the proper orbit and to the space station and to also re-enter the atmosphere at flight's end. All the valves worked fine five weeks earlier and performed well in the 2019 test flight Vollmer said.

Vollmer said it's too soon to know whether the valves will need to be replaced or even redesigned. Aerojet Rocketdyne supplied the valves along with the rest of the propulsion system.

Given all the uncertainty Vollmer was reluctant to say when Starliner might be ready for another launch attempt. Boeing will need to work around other space station traffic as well as a NASA asteroid mission that's due to launch on the same kind of rocket from the same pad in October.

The Boeing 787 FFS and FTD will be delivered to LAT’s Training Centre in Frankfurt by the second half of 2022. The two new L3Harris devices will support their pilot and cadet training on this new model. L3Harris has also developed and delivered two advanced A320 FTDs and an A350 FFS to LAT.

FTDs enable airlines and training operators to reduce their training costs while maintaining pilot training effectiveness while addressing the changing European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. Recent amendments to both EASA and FAA regulations provide the flexibility and clarity for an increased proportion of simulator training hours to be flown on FTDs. This mixed training device approach reduces reliance on higher-cost full flight simulators for type rating and some elements of recurrent training. It also addresses the importance of providing improved flexibility and cost-effectiveness in the wake of the pandemic whilst maintaining world class pilot training standards.

“We are investing in and leveraging our expertise of manufacturing flight training devices to develop fixed base devices. This is offering trainers a wider variety of high-fidelity devices giving them more versatility to tailor their programs to specific aircraft and airline requirements” said Alan Crawford President Commercial Aviation L3Harris. “We are excited to launch this new device for our customer.”

“We already have a good working relationship with L3Harris as a manufacturer. Two of our FTD training devices which we operate in Vienna and Zurich as well as our A350 full flight simulator in Munich were purchased from L3Harris said Matthias Spohr Managing Director of Lufthansa Aviation Training GmbH. “All training devices are convincing in daily training operations – not only for us but also for our customers. The newly ordered FFS and FTD of the Boeing 787 type therefore not only complement the existing L3Harris family at LAT but also significantly expand our training portfolio for the needs of Lufthansa Airlines in the course of the introduction of the new aircraft type as well as for external market customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL2ZsMzYwYWVyby5jb20vZGV0YWlsLzE2LXllYXJzLWFnby10aGlzLWRheS1oeXBveGlhLWJlY2FtZS10aGUtcmVhc29uLWZvci1mdWVsLXJ1bi1vdXQtYW5kLWNyYXNoLW9mLWEtYm9laW5nLWI3MzctMzFzLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWtpbGxpbmctYWxsLXRoZS1vY2N1cGFudHMvNjQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,16 years ago  this day  Hypoxia became the reason for 'Fuel run out' and crash of a Boeing B737-31S aircraft killing all ...,"The Hellenic Air Accident Investigation and Aviation Safety Board (AAIASB) concluded that below chain of events became the reason of the this Fatal accident.

► Non-recognition by the pilots that the pressurization system was set to ""manual""

► Non-identification by the crew of the true nature of the problem

► Incapacitation of the crew due to hypoxia

► Eventual fuel starvation

► Impact with the ground.

The Boeing B737-31S aircraft belonged to the Helios Airways and unfortunate journey was Flight 522 on 14 August 2005 that crashed Killing all 121 passengers and crew on board near Grammatiko Greece.

On that day the aircraft was flying from 'Larnaca Cyprus' to 'Prague Czech Republic'  with a scheduled stopover at 'Athens Greece' but that crashed on 14th August 2005 killing all 121 passengers and crew on board due to Hypoxia induced Crew incapacitation and Fuel Run out.

On the Day of Accident :

The accident aircraft 'Olympia'  registered as 5B-DBY arrived at Larnaca International Airport with a PIREP (Pilot Report) of ""frozen door seal and abnormal noises coming from the right aft service door"" .

The Ground engineer carried out inspection and performed a pressurization leak check using ""manual mode"" without the engines. At the end of the check  the engineer failed to reset it to ""auto"" on completion of the test.

Cockpit crew also failed to notice the ""Pressurization mode change"" at numerous occasions and continued with the take off after the aircraft was declared serviceable.

The aircraft took off with the pressurization system still set to ""manual"" and the aft outflow valve partially open.

As the aircraft climbed with the manual mode the pressure inside the cabin gradually decreased and at an altitude of 12040 feet the cabin altitude warning horn sounded.

This was the time when the Cockpit crew could have stopped the climb  but they ignored the warning assuming it as a ""take-off configuration warning"".

Overhead panel in the cockpit mushroomed with multiple warning lights in the next few minutes. illuminated. Equipment cooling warning lights came on to indicate low airflow through the cooling fans (a result of the decreased air density) accompanied by the master caution light.

The passenger oxygen light illuminated when at an altitude of approximately 18000 feet the oxygen masks in the passenger cabin automatically deployed.

Ground Contacts could not help !

The captain contacted the Helios operations centre and reported ""the take-off configuration warning on"" and ""cooling equipment normal and alternate off line.

He also spoke to the ground engineer complaining about the ""cooling ventilation fan lights were off. The engineer (the one who had conducted the pressurization leak check) asked: ""Can you confirm that the pressurization panel is set to AUTO?""

However the captain under the influence of hypoxia's initial symptoms disregarded the question and instead asked in reply ""Where are my equipment cooling circuit breakers ? . No further Communication could be made with the aircraft.

Hypoxia is a condition where not enough oxygen makes it to the cells and tissues in the body. This can happen even though blood flow is normal. Hypoxia can lead to many serious sometimes life-threatening complications.Under influence of Hypoxia blood oxygen falls below a certain level you might experience shortness of breath headache and confusion or restlessness.

The aircraft continued to climb until FL340 the aircraft passed from Cyprus flight information region (FIR) into Athens FIR without making contact with Athens ATC.

Nineteen attempts to contact the aircraft were made without a success the aircraft entered the holding pattern for Athens Airport at the KEA VOR still at FL340. With auto-pilot It remained in the holding pattern for the next 70 minutes.

Two F-16 fighter aircrafts of Greek- Hellenic Air Force intercepting the aircraft jet saw that the first officer was motionless at the controls and the captain's seat was empty.

Cabin Crew tried to save the Aircraft !

Inside the Aircraft Flight attendant Andreas Prodromou who held a UK Commercial Pilot Licence tried to control the aircraft from the Captain's seat while using a portable oxygen supply but was not qualified to fly the Boeing 737.

Before both the engines flamed out in a succession of 10 minutes Prodromou succeeded in banking the aircraft away from Athens and towards a rural area. At last  the aircraft crashed into the hills near Grammatiko killing all 115 passengers and 6 crew on board.

It is considered as the deadliest aviation accident in Greek history.

Share Comment 0

PEORIA Ill. — A block that had once been home to more than 100 people was down to six who lived amid the ruins of another era. There were gaping holes in roofs and crumbling foundations. Some houses were so bad that even the squatters had quit on them and now only raccoons and rodents sought them out for shelter.

And then for reasons that no one in Peoria could fathom people from all over America began snapping them up. By early summer seven houses on this block of West Lincoln Avenue had sold to buyers from Los Angeles San Diego Long Island Tacoma Wash. and other far-off places.

Among them was Jayvon Michael Culver a barber in Salt Lake City where in the waning days of the pandemic the median price of a single-family home had raced past $515000 far more than Culver could ever afford to spend. With a few frenzied clicks and emails he had grabbed 2011 West Lincoln Ave. for $4500 sight unseen.

“First house I ever bought in my life” said Culver 36.

Most of the buyers had acquired their homes through online auctions. None had ever actually been to Peoria; nor did they have any plans to move there. And yet they bid by the dozens if not hundreds on homes throughout Peoria’s dying south end drawn by the desire to own property an essential piece of the American Dream that had eluded them in the places where they lived and seemed to grow more distant with each passing month. Somehow they had found a version of that dream online — and in a place called Peoria — that seemed almost as good. “I felt like I had finally found a cheat code” Culver said.

Now he was the owner of a house in a city that he had until recently never heard of on a block whose ever-dwindling numbers included a 20-year-old named Benny Cook. In the spring amid the buying frenzy Cook and his fiancee had rented one of the block’s last habitable homes and cleaned out the soiled clothes and spoiled food left by the homeless people who had been staying there. For protection from the addicts who sought shelter in the block’s abandoned houses Cook bought a guard dog security cameras and an AR-15 rifle.

“If you ain’t scared to go in an abandoned house at night you ain’t scared to do something to me” he said.

It was the first place Cook could call his own and a place where he and his fiancee hoped to start a family. “I can make it our dream house” he said. Some 1500 miles away in Utah Culver was starting to make plans too: for his first trip to Peoria and for the house and land he believed might someday change his life.

The story of West Lincoln Avenue’s bizarre summer land rush starts with the deindustrialization of the Rust Belt which had hollowed out Peoria’s once-thriving south end. It spans decades of growing inequality which had turned America into a place of winners and losers with less and less in between. The trigger though was the pandemic the recession and the recovery.

In much of the country this spring low interest rates bidding wars and pent-up demand had sparked a real estate boom. In California the median single-family home price hit a record $818260 up nearly 40 percent since the start of the pandemic. Utah prices surged 30 percent during the same period. By June economists were using words like “unprecedented” to describe the rise and speculating that in some markets the dream of homeownership might be forever out of reach for most middle-class Americans.

Peoria had the opposite problem: hundreds of decaying homes that it couldn’t afford to demolish. In 2020 pandemic-related budget cuts had forced the city to suspend all non-emergency teardowns. Many of these abandoned houses were funneled to the county’s tax foreclosure auction which that September included 190 properties more than double the previous year.

On the ground in Peoria these homes were worthless. Online though they had value. A 31-year-old investor from Texas bid $751 — $1 over the minimum — on virtually every property in the auction and walked away with 54 of them. He sold 43 to an investor in Sarasota Fla. for about $1400 each.

The Sarasota investor put a few of the homes on bid4assets.com an online auction site each week this spring and early summer. “Great Opportunity” his pitches usually began. Lower down a disclaimer cautioned: “In rare cases house might be demolished or burned down.” Most of the houses sold for $3000 to $6000.

Ross Black the city’s community development director likened the investors who bought houses in bulk to vultures trying to extract the last bit of value from a dying place. They had almost no incentive to sink a penny into the homes before they flipped them usually for a small profit. Black had more sympathy he said for the “unfortunate buyers” bidding for them online. In early May he pressed play on his office phone where a woman from Stockton Calif. had left him a voice-mail message.

“I am a new property owner in Per-rora. … I can never say it” she began. “There has been a huge misunderstanding.”

Soon Black was driving to the house down potholed streets and past an abandoned brick elementary school with Gothic-style windows and soaring smokestacks a remnant of the days when Peoria’s south end was home to 42000 people many of whom walked to work at the hulking factories along the river. Now the area was down to about 12000. The shell of a school had been slated for demolition a decade ago but the city lacked the $1.2 million necessary to tear it down.

Minutes later Black’s car pulled to a stop in front of the Stockton woman’s home which was boarded up and missing most of its roof. Weeds were growing in the bathroom sink. All of which led Black to ask the question that he had been pondering for weeks: “How does someone in Boston or Salt Lake City or Los Angeles end up buying a home in Peoria that they’ve never even seen?”

There were so many ways to answer that question on West Lincoln Avenue.

For a Boeing worker from Tacoma who got a layoff warning notice last year 2102 West Lincoln was his “emergency plan” in case the economy cratered he lost his job and he couldn’t pay his mortgage.

For a laid-off union representative from Los Angeles the decision to spend $5300 on 1915 West Lincoln came down purely to price. “When I saw something that cheap I decided to spend on it” she said as she rushed off to a job interview in June.

For Culver the answer to the question could begin in Littlerock Calif. a threadbare desert town outside Los Angeles where he was raised by his grandmother who owned a few rental units that she had sold when Culver was still a child. “When I was a kid it seemed like all the old folks owned property” he said. “I didn’t want that to die with me.”

Or it could begin in Salt Lake City where he worked as a barber and had scraped together enough cash to finance a 2016 Porsche SUV and buy a 1988 Chevy Caprice that he jacked up on 30-inch rims and drove with the windows down so he could hear screamed compliments from the sidewalk. To Culver property was the “most ultimate thing you could own” and the one big thing that had always seemed beyond his means until a day in March when he was scrolling through his Instagram feed. Up popped a video of a 19-year-old who was talking about buying and selling homes with little to no money. “If he can do it I can do it” Culver recalled thinking.

He began Googling and after a few clicks landed on bid4assets.com where much of America seemed to be within his grasp. Empty lots in Arkansas and New Mexico were going for $800 and run-down houses in West Virginia and Pennsylvania were selling for a few thousand. Even a neo-Gothic church in Illinois was up for grabs.

“It was overwhelming” said Culver of the rush he felt as he took in the possibilities and soon he had bid on more than a dozen properties. Most of the auctions ran for a week with bids starting at $1 and rising in $50 or $100 increments. Culver’s first win was a plot of land in Arkansas he snagged for $800. On his computer screen the property was just a square of grass and weeds next to a narrow ribbon of blacktop in a town he’d never heard of called Blytheville. It was the first piece of property he had ever owned and to Culver it felt like the beginning of something big. “I’ll never sell it” he told a friend who was watching over his shoulder as the auction closed. They bought a bottle of champagne to celebrate.

Soon Culver was setting alarms on his phone so he could make sure he was in front of his laptop and not cutting hair during the final frenzied minutes of an auction when it seemed like everyone was putting in bids. In total he spent about $20000.

He won a commercial building in Dallas City Ill. for which he was the only bidder a few small pieces of land somewhere in New Mexico and an empty lot on West Lincoln Avenue that the Sarasota investor had put up for bid.

The investor offered to sell him an adjacent house on West Lincoln for $6500. Culver was interested but wanted to visit Peoria before he bought there again. Then the investor cut the price by $2000 and suddenly Culver decided he couldn’t afford to wait.

“I’d never seen a house for $4500” he said.

He texted a picture of the brown and white two-story home to his brother who wondered if it was a scam and to his Uncle Jay an actor who appeared in the 1990s in movies alongside Mel Gibson and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

“Koo!” he replied. “What city?”

And he shared it with his 16-year-old daughter Nikkia who lived with him in Salt Lake City and had decorated her room with Bible verses reminding her that God was always watching after her.

“Look baby” he said.

Her first thought which she didn’t share was that her father’s new house was ugly. Then she asked if they were going to move there.

“No” said Culver who was trying to imagine life on West Lincoln Avenue using an online photo of his new house and what he could glean from the fish-eyed pictures on Google Street View. He assumed Peoria was poorer than his hometown of Littlerock or Los Angeles’s Compton neighborhood where he had family. Even the cheapest homes in both those places sold for far more than $4500.

“To me it’s more like Nepal” he said. “The people are probably really nice and humble.”

Around the same time Culver was buying 2011 West Lincoln Cook was walking through his south end neighborhood and spotted a man fixing up a West Lincoln Avenue duplex that he had purchased at the Peoria County tax foreclosure sale for $750. Cook asked him about a job. The man replied that he didn’t have work but was hoping to rent out the unit on the second floor.

The outside looked rough but to Cook it was a way out of his grandmother’s apartment and a difficult childhood that included a three-year stint in foster care a mother who struggled with drug addiction a father who died of cancer when Cook was 9 and two half brothers who had been murdered nearby.

“I fell in love with it” Cook said of his new home.

He planned to strip the peeling blue paint from the exterior and promised his fiancee NeNe that she could pick the new color. Inside the two tacked posters from their favorite shows “Stranger Things” and “Rick and Morty” to the clean white walls. NeNe who graduated from high school in May added her glitter-covered mortarboard bearing the message: “All it took was faith trust n’ pixie dust.” They hung their high school graduation tassels from the television.

And then one sweltering Saturday in June when the public swimming pools were either closed due to a lifeguard shortage or filled to capacity Cook decided that what their new home really needed was a pool. Not the little inflatable kind that people set up for splashing but a big aboveground pool of the sort that he had always wanted as a kid. He was unemployed having quit a $12-an-hour warehouse job that he found stressful and depressing. But he and NeNe had some money saved up from stimulus checks a stint on unemployment and her job working full-time at a fast-food stand.

NeNe found a lightly used pool for $400 on Facebook Marketplace and Cook and his brother drove to pick it up later that afternoon. They stayed up until 5 a.m. Sunday digging out a flat spot in the grass and putting it together by moonlight.

The next morning Cook spent the last of his cash on an extra-long garden hose. His duplex didn’t have an outdoor faucet so he crossed a muddy trash-strewn alley to an empty house that had a working spigot. Cook had inspected all the uninhabited homes on the block in the first days after they moved in and knew which were frequented by drug addicts and squatters which were too far gone for humans and which still had running water or lights.

Soon water was rushing out of the garden hose. Cook leaned over the pool’s railing and dipped his hand in the cool crisp stream. “It’s getting up there” he said thinking of the pool party he was planning that evening for family and friends. “Pretty soon we’re going to have a pool.”

Around him life on West Lincoln Avenue continued as usual. At one end of the block a half-dozen elderly drunks gathered under a shade tree sipping vodka. Sometimes when they were feeling lucky they would stop by Smith’s Corner Market to buy lotto scratchers or cigarettes. “Those guys are the forgotten souls of Peoria” said Aaron Smith the store owner from behind a pane of cracked bulletproof glass. “They’re just waiting on a casket.” They were also Smith said his best customers.

Across the street the congregation of the New Beginnings Worship Center of the Apostolic Faith gathered to pray for each other and their city. The plain white building had been vacant for several years before the congregation bought it in 2017 for $25000. “When we first started the mold was so bad that I couldn’t stand it in here” said Luwanda Ogilvie 58 the church secretary and music minister.

Four years later the church still couldn’t afford to fix the air conditioner so big fans blew stale air over the small flock which on this Sunday numbered about a dozen people. Ogilvie shook her tambourine and led the congregation in song. “The blood of Jesus will heal your body!” she cried. The youth minister delivered the sermon. “The reason we saw another sunrise is not because of our might and strength” he preached. “It’s because of the Lord’s mercy and grace.”

That evening a little after 9 p.m. about two dozen family and friends gathered around Cook’s new pool. It was the first-ever party at a place he could call all his own and most likely the block’s first housewarming in decades. The water was now only knee-deep but Cook’s nieces and nephews who were splashing and shrieking seemed not to care. “You so little you can really go swimming in there” Cook teased one of his nephews as he climbed into the pool.

Cook built a fire for s’mores and then disappeared upstairs to grab a twin-size air mattress that the kids used as a makeshift pool float. “That’s some ghetto s---” someone joked.

The neighborhood grew dark and eventually the kids went inside to play video games in Cook’s living room. Outside Cook and his friends were sitting by the pool when Cook noticed smoke in the distance and then an orange glow coming from a few blocks away. Soon he was bounding up the stairs.

“Big-a-- house fire!” he yelled excitedly.

Everyone gathered again by the pool where they watched white smoke from the blaze drift across the cloudless black sky and listened to the emergency radio traffic on a cellphone app.

“That’s one of my biggest fears” Cook said “coming home to a fire”

“My biggest fear is that you’re asleep in the house” one of his nephews replied.

By 1 a.m. the party had ended Cook’s family had gone home and all was quiet but for the buzz of the occasional car on West Lincoln Avenue and the sound of water trickling from the garden hose into Cook’s half-full pool.

Slowly over the course of the summer the distant buyers made their way to Peoria to check on their homes. Malkebu Moore a long-haul trucker from Philadelphia pushed open the unlocked door to his house on West Millman Street and stepped over piles of rotting food used condoms and feces smeared across the floor and walls. Minutes later he was back on the sidewalk catching his breath when a prostitute propositioned him.

“How are you?” Moore asked.

“Drunk” she said. “What are you selling?”

“I’m not selling” Moore replied. “I’m buying. I bought that house. I’m going to fix it up.” But by that point Moore knew the structure wasn’t worth rehabilitating. A few days later city officials found a dead body inside.

Two blocks south the West Lincoln Avenue buyers weren’t faring any better. “It’s a goner” said the Boeing worker from Tacoma of his new house. “I’m now looking at plan B whatever that may be.” The owner of 1915 West Lincoln the former union representative from Los Angeles said she wanted to “punch someone in the face” after seeing her home in person. She tried calling contractors. “Because of the neighborhood nobody wants to work there” she said.

Culver had exhausted his savings to buy his properties and by mid-July was still short the money to make the trip to Peoria and see them. “I know I really need to go” he said.

In pictures online he had noticed a crack that ran the length of his house where the siding met the foundation and he had begun researching alternatives in case the structure was too rotted to repair.

His cousin had seen something called a Boxabl accessory dwelling unit on Instagram and mentioned that celebrities were buying the $50000 micro-homes and putting them in their backyards for their kids. “Complete right out of the box” the ad promised. “Setup in just one day.” Culver wondered if a tiny home fashioned out of old shipping containers might be even cheaper and more practical. He had seen them online and they didn’t look too bad.

Even though Culver knew that he probably wouldn’t have the money to build Boxabls or much else on his property any time soon he held fast to his dreams. He started subscribing to real estate newsletters that promised to teach him how to make “$5000 an hour” flipping houses. And he pitched his daughter who was about to start her senior year of high school on joining him in the real estate business if she didn’t go to college.

For motivation Culver liked to go for drives through some of Salt Lake City’s most upscale neighborhoods where homes sold for more than $1 million. He turned into a neighborhood just down the road from the elementary school where his daughter worked as a part-time custodian. “Look at this one” Culver said as a sprawling two-story compound emerged through a gap in nine-foot hedges. “It wraps around the entire block.”

When Culver first ventured into these neighborhoods he had expected he would see mostly BMWs Mercedes and maybe a few Ferraris. Instead he saw lots of Hondas Toyotas and Chevrolets. “I love how humble they are” he said.

Sometimes Culver took his daughter with him on these drives but usually he went alone. His favorite houses were the modern ones with Asian-inspired statuary manicured gardens and artfully placed boulders. He steered down another a quiet tree-lined street with a burbling creek and peaked roof lines that mirrored the mountains on the outskirts of the city. There he spotted a group of teens walking down the sidewalk. “So these are rich kids … really really privileged” he said. “It’s such a blessing to have your kids be privileged. They are really well taken care of.”

Because Culver was a mobile barber and cut people’s hair in their homes rather than in a salon his business hadn’t taken a huge hit during the pandemic. He typically made $75 to $100 a haircut with tip. He liked the way the right haircut could restore a person’s self-confidence and the way his best customers treated him as an old friend.

Lately though that didn’t seem good enough. Culver thought about his credit score which was “poor” and about Jeff Bezos whose net worth had somehow grown by $70 billion in 2020 despite a recession and global pandemic. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

He thought about the movie “The Founder” which chronicles the rise of Ray Kroc and McDonald’s. In a pivotal scene Kroc realizes that the real money in his business doesn’t come from selling food but rather from land the company leases to franchisees. “You’re not in the burger business” Kroc’s chief financial officer tells him. “You’re in the real estate business.”

Culver also thought about his ancestors freed slaves who had been promised but never given 40 acres and a mule as reparations. How might his life be different if that promise had been kept?

“If you have to work for every dollar that you make then you’re not making it” he said. “If I have to physically get up and go to work for my next meal then I am getting by but I am not living.”

There were many visions of how the summer land rush might end on West Lincoln Avenue. Peoria officials were sure that it would turn out badly for everyone.

Some of the new homeowners would flip their properties and perhaps extract a little bit more money from an already broken place. Those who couldn’t find a buyer would become overwhelmed by the amount of work required to fix their homes and stop paying taxes triggering yet another tax foreclosure in three years. The houses would return to auction in slightly worse shape — a process that would repeat itself until the structures were beyond any hope of repair. “It’s very frustrating” said Black the Peoria development official. “Every month these properties take a step closer to demolition and a step further from someone being able to renovate them.”

Meanwhile a new crop of more than 650 properties — including seven houses and empty lots on the same block where Culver’s house sat and where Cook was living — were headed to the tax foreclosure auction scheduled for Aug. 27. It was by far the biggest auction Black could remember in 29 years of working for the city and he worried that the bulk buyers would once again snap up most of the properties.

Cook had a different vision for the duplex where he was living and his block on West Lincoln. Two days after his backyard party his pool was finally full. He hiked himself up on the air mattress and dipped his toes in the water.

“Decent” he said as another summer day stretched out in front of him.

He had been trying to get a job and had applied for positions as an exterminator a forklift operator and in laying concrete. He briefly toyed with the idea of becoming a video game streamer. “Why not try to make money doing something you love?” he asked. But he dropped that plan when he realized how hard it was to attract a big online audience. Eventually he landed a job with a steel company working at the rail yard.

For now though he was floating in his pool imagining what life must have been like when all the houses on the block were full of factory workers and their children. “Look at all the stuff back here” Cook said pointing to the towering shade trees and backyard garages crammed full of decades-old junk. “Why was this the block to give up on? This is one of the main blocks. Who would want to leave this?”

He gazed up at the rotting abandoned house in front of his duplex. Paint hung in strips from its siding revealing wood the color of weathered bone. Another winter and a few big snowstorms he guessed might cause it to collapse. City officials would then have to come out and cart away the debris leaving behind an empty lot where Cook hoped that his and NeNe’s future child might play. He planned to add a covered patio by the pool and maybe a small kennel for family dogs. “We can plant some grass back here and fence this all in” he said imagining how it would someday be.

And then there was Culver. Deep down he sensed he might not make money on any of his properties in the next few years or even decades. But he had bigger reasons for buying his land and his house on West Lincoln. For much of his life Culver’s mother struggled to keep a job. He barely knew his father. “I am the stereotype of the Black male who grew up without a dad” he said.

Now Culver had found a path to success and providing for his family that seemed achievable. Land would be his legacy; it would break the pattern that he had inherited from his parents.

“I don’t want my struggles to roll off on my kids” he said.

Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito were both wealthier in 2020 than they were in 2018 according to their annual financial disclosures filed earlier this year

Manchin’s estimated net worth for 2020 was $8.6 million compared to $7.6 million for 2018. Capito was worth $2.53 million compared to $2.15 million in 2018.

The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probably range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

For 2020 Manchin’s asset values ranged from $4376067 to $12844100. He reported no liabilities. The midpoint was $8610083.50.

Capito’s assets ranged from $1596629 to $4996000. She reported liabilities ranging from $475005 to $1065000. Using the formula put her range of worth from $531629 to $4520995 with the midpoint at $2526995.

Here’s a look at some selected details from their reports.

Manchin

OpenSecrets ranked Manchin 19th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 67th overall in Congress. OpenSecrets hasn’t yet published its compilation of 2020 filings.

For comparison the richest senator in 2018 was Mark Warner D-Va. worth $214 million. Current Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was worth $1.12 million and current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was worth $34.14 million.

Manchin reported collecting $48282.24 from the state Public Employees Retirement System in 2020.

Members are required to report both their own and their spouse’s assets and liabilities. His wife Gayle Manchin currently co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission holds a savings account worth $500001-$1 million which paid interest ranging from $2501-$5000.

Manchin reported two savings accounts ranging respectively from $100001-$250000 and $50001-$100000. They produced interest ranging from $201-$1000 for the first and less than $201 for the second.

The Joe Manchin III Qualified Blind Trust is worth $500001-$1 million and generated revenue of $5001-$15000.

He owns a storage building in Fairmont worth $50001-$100000 that collected $2501-$5000 in rent. A commercial rental property in Fairmont is worth $250001-$500000 and collected $5001-$15000 in rent and $2382 in “ordinary business income.”

He owns stock in Fairmont-based Enersystems which he founded and is described as providing services and materials for utility plants (according to news reports it supplies coal to Mon Power’s Grant Town plant). The stock is worth $1000001-$5 million and produces $100001-$1 million in dividends plus $491949 in business income.

Manchin holds stock in two Morgantown-based companies. Figure 8 Surgical makes a sternal closure tool. CereDX (now Valtari Bio) is developing a blood test to aid rapid triage in stroke patients. The stock holdings for each is worth $1001 to $15001 and both generate dividends labeled “none” meaning less than $201.

The final asset on Manchin’s list is the house boat that recently made headlines as the site of a gathering of senators from both parties where Sen. Lindsey Graham R-SC subsequently reported testing positive for COVID despite being vaccinated.

Manchin reports the house boat being worth $100001-$250000.

Capito

Open Secrets ranked Capito 46th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 169th overall in Congress.

Capito has a stake in Disney magic. She owns Walt Disney Co. stock worth $15001-$50000.

She and her husband have stock in a number of energy companies: Duke Energy ($1001-$15000) NextEra Energy ($1001-$15000) ExxonMobil ($1001-$15000) Royal Dutch Shell ($1001-$15000) Chevron ($1001-$15000) Phillips 66 ($1001-$15000) Wisconsin Energy ($1001-$15000) and BlackRock ($1001-$15000).

They each have a Wells Fargo bank account each worth $50001-$100000 and they report four separate stock holdings in Wells Fargo. They also have several Citigroup holdings.

Their high-tech stock includes Microsoft Apple AT&T Cisco Verizon and IBM.

Her husband owns stock in Viatris (which closed its Morgantown plant last month) worth $1001-$15000. Their other pharmaceutical holdings include Johnson & Johnson Merck Novartis Pfizer Roche Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

They have a wide variety of holdings in the food industry: General Mills Kellogg McDonald’s J.M. Smucker Coca-Cola Mondelez and PepsiCo.

They have three box stores covered with holdings in WalMart Target and Lowe’s.

Other holdings include Nordstrom UPS Ford Colgate-Palmolive Proctor & Gamble #M and Nike.

Reps. David McKinley Carol Miller and Alex Mooney all had reports due in May and all three filed for extensions. Their new deadline was Friday and a story on their filings will follow after their reports are published.

The redshirt junior arrived at Coastal Carolina as an underrecruited high school prospect out of Parkview High in Georgia.

By the time he left Conway via the transfer portal he’d made a significant impact for the Chanticleers: 108 catches for 1534 yards and 11 touchdowns. That’s in addition to 35 carries for 439 yards and two more scores.

After the 2023 season wrapped Brown was ready to take his game to the top level of college football in the Southeastern Conference. He turned down scholarships from Auburn Louisville and others in favor of heading to Columbia.

“I came here to be a complete receiver” Brown said during a recent appearance on The Garnet Trust Hour.

Brown arrived in January going through winter workouts before spring ball got ramped up. Once practice began Shane Beamer and his staff made the decision to shift Brown from an exclusive slot player to an outside receiver.

He’s enjoyed the transition so far.

“I feel like if I can play inside and outside that’ll be better for me. I would say the big difference for me is having somebody in front of you the whole game. I’m not really used to that. I’m used to free access” he explained.

Playing outside has also opened up more route options for Brown who had identified his route running as an area that he wanted to improve after last season.

“That’s really one thing that I need to work on” said Brown. “Like at Coastal we were in a triple option offense so I wasn’t really running routes like that. One thing I’m really going to harp on this summer is the route tree and the mental aspect of the game.”

Brown noted that the competition level – facing off against guys like OD Fortune Judge Collier and other South Carolina defensive backs this spring – is making him better.

“I love to compete. I go against OD every day and OD really opened my eyes. I was like this is what I’ve got. I feel like Judge is really going to make me take that next step. Judge likes to put his hands on you and Judge is long so just going against him and getting one-on-one reps those are going to help me. It’s going to translate to the game the stuff I do in practice.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvd2hhdHMta2lsbGluZy1zb3V0aGVybi1jYWxpZm9ybmlhcy1icm93bi1wZWxpY2FuLXBvcHVsYXRpb24vMzQwOTAwMC_SAXNodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNsb3NhbmdlbGVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3doYXRzLWtpbGxpbmctc291dGhlcm4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYXMtYnJvd24tcGVsaWNhbi1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLzM0MDkwMDAvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's killing Southern California's brown pelican population?,"It’s a mystery that remains unsolved.

After the emaciated dying birds started showing up on beaches from Orange County to Malibu several weeks ago there are now indications that their young are being affected too.

Biologists who study pelican populations on Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands off the Ventura coast say her that pelican chicks are being found dead in their nests there according to Debbie McGuire executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach.

“Either something happened to the parents that couldn’t keep feeding them or the parent just wasn’t able to forage and catch enough fish to keep themselves alive” McGuire said.

The National Park Service website says that “the only long-term breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in the United States” are on the islands.

The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center which has an on-site veterinarian has seen a huge increase in pelicans being brought in for treatment according to McGuire. At present the center has treated 186 patients total with only half of those surviving.

Other marine wildlife care centers are reporting similar numbers with many birds suffering from ""emaciation dehydration malnutrition anemia"" according to Elizabeth Wood a veterinarian with the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center.

“We know they’re starving but we don’t know why” Wood said.

McGuire said there are number of theories being considered since no pathogens have been discovered so far from necropsies performed on the dead birds. Among them: food sources such as bait fish that have been swimming out of reach of the pelicans which typically only dive to a maximum of 6 feet when hunting.

But why the bait fish are doing that is still unclear McGuire said.

Anyone who encounters a starving pelican is urged to report it to authorities or a marine animal rescue organization immediately said Wood because it probably has less than two hours to live.

Two of the most prominent live music venues on the Las Vegas Strip the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay and Brooklyn Bowl at the Linq Promenade are expected to require ticket-holders to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test beginning October 4. Concert giant Live Nation adjusted its policy on Friday and will require the same of all artists crew and attendees at its festivals and venues across the country.

In Las Vegas Live Nation is one of the largest concert and live entertainment event promoters operating those two popular theaters and partnering with Caesars Entertainment to run residency shows at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood as well as with MGM Resorts for events at Park Theater among other shows on and off the Strip. Casino-owned and operated venues like those big residency rooms fall outside of Live Nation’s policies but the company said it has developed best practices for artists to request the policies at third party venues.

Live Nation previously announced it would be up to its artists to enforce the mandates but instituted the stricter guidelines for shows this fall where permitted by law due to the continued spread of the Delta variant. Its recent Lollapalooza festival in Chicago where attendees were required to show proof of vaccination or negative test was considered successful in avoiding superspreader status and a Live Nation spokesperson told Rolling Stone 12% of fans said the festival was the reason they were vaccinated.

Other entertainment companies and Las Vegas events and venues recently announced similar policies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhc3ZlZ2FzYWR2aXNvci5jb20vcXVlc3Rpb24vcGFuZGVtaWMtY2FzaW5vLWVtcGxveWVlLWJlbmVmaXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Did the Casino Companies Treat Their Employees during the Pandemic?,"Now that we're getting close to that light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel for the pandemic can you give us an update on how well the different casinos/resorts/companies treated their employees during the pandemic? I'm thinking along the lines of severance pay health benefits guarantee of jobs etc. I will most likely use this kind of info to decide where I spend my money when I get back to Vegas. From what I heard about TI early on I will not be spending any time or money there. Now that we're near the end I'm sure there's a better overall picture of how employees were treated.

A:

We got ""no comment"" responses from Wynn Resorts and Boyd Gaming. At least Boyd was polite about it and we expected more from the Wynn since they were very good to their employees.

The Culinary Union sent back four paragraphs of self-congratulations for the passage of the “right to return” law that gives displaced casino workers first dibs on their old jobs.

Las Vegas Sands was altogether more helpful. “At the insistence of [Sheldon] Adelson the company conducted no furloughs or layoffs” wrote spokesman Ron Reese. “We continued paying and providing benefits for team members throughout shutdowns and slowdowns.” Reese was being too modest. Las Vegas Sands also paid the wages including averaged tips to workers at its restaurants that weren't actual employees of the company. We'd say that per your criteria Venetian/Palazzo should be at or at least near the top of your list.

Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli recently tracked workforce changes at MGM Resorts International and found that 40 percent of its nationwide employee base had been pink-slipped of whom only a fourth or a fifth would be returning to their jobs. At present the company has gone from 70000 to 42000 employees. Speaking generically he wrote “We would note that at present we think Strip labor costs are down 40%-50% versus 2019 levels.” Part of the reason for that is a scenario at Caesars Entertainment that's similar to MGM Resorts'.)

Still to give you an idea of what happened in Las Vegas we’ve constructed the following timeline of employee relations during the Great Shutdown (culled mostly from our own coverage of the issue in Vegas News):

March 17: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas closes but keeps all of its employees on payroll.

April 2: Wynn Resorts discloses that it is cutting executive pay from 30% to 100% to help underwrite 30 days of pay and benefits for its employees later extended to 60 days.

April 4: Las Vegas Sands announces that it is paying the salaries of 1200 indirect employees who work in restaurants that are tenants in The Venetian and Palazzo. Hourly and part-time workers are to receive a stipend.

April 7: Cirque du Soleil sacks 4700 workers 95 percent of its total employee base.

April 10: Boyd Gaming lays off most of its nationwide workforce although it extends health-care benefits through June 30.

April 11: Station Casinos extends pay and benefits to furloughed workers through May 15. The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas meanwhile has laid off workers but will carry their health benefits through June 30.

April 27: Caesars Entertainment initiates an employee-assistance program for individuals facing “unusual hardships.” The program is funded by donations from Caesars execs and board members. Caesars also commits to extend pay and benefits through June 30.

May 2: MGM Resorts International is reported to have termed four hotel presidents as the number of furloughed employees at the company reaches 63000.

May 3: South Point lays off its employees for an “indefinite period.” Owner Michael Gaughan tells the workers they will “be better off” applying for unemployment benefits than looking to the casino for assistance. Health benefits are extended through July 31.

May 7: MGM extends health-care subsidies through August 31 but warns that six-month furloughs could become permanent. Wynn Resorts extends pay and benefits for idled workers by an additional 15 days.

May 14: Rampart Casino gives all its employees the boot via a pre-recorded phone message.

May 19: Colorado Belle in Laughlin closes for good throwing 400 workers onto the unemployment rolls.

July 23: A dark day. Wynncore announces additional layoffs although benefits are extended through October 31. Circus Circus owner Phil Ruffin pink-slips 252 workers but Tropicana Las Vegas outdoes him by eliminating 620 positions.

July 28: MGM lays off most of its entertainment staff.

July 30: Las Vegas Sands extends pay and benefits an additional 90 days.

That covers the worst of it.

According to this article Usher has performed well at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace and has until December and early January to finish his scheduled performances.

However last weekend a woman going all out with pole dancing has gone viral performing Mr. Raymond's ""Bad Girl."" The dancer captivated the audience in the venue and online as well.

Who Is The Scene-Stealer?

The scene-stealer in the main show was said to be under contract ever since Usher's residency show started. Users online even got so invested in her dancing that it took them a few watches to realize she was not the main act.

Twitter user @kailahdee who posted the nearly 800000 viewed clip credited the dancer with a tweet saying ""this is her show. period.""

Numerous users have already discovered her name and she is Keanu Ivana Washington with Isis the Goddess as the name she uses online according to TMZ. She is not just a professional dancer but she is also a personal trainer and teaches pole dancing classes.

Twitter Reacts To Viral Video

Due to how the internet has recognized Washington's talents in pole dancing Twitter users questioned how pole dancing is not an Olympic sport but pointed out something associated with the sex industry.

Pole dancing however was considered but it didn't happen in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. One user noted that there is a worldwide pole dancing competition and Washington is the best candidate for it.

More have gone on Twitter and dropped their praises on the dancer.

Pole dancers are just incredible. The amount of strength flexibility and sex appeal just motivates me to try it! pic.twitter.com/wu6bBdquqx — Rhianna ☽ (@rhi_diamond) August 15 2021

Washington's newly discovered fans jokingly asked if she is paying Usher well to go with the idea of her being the main part of the Las Vegas residency.

Others also trolled with Usher bucks which has gotten the singer criticism in the past. And other than that more have also noticed what Usher did to gain back the attention he lost from Washington's performance. The ""Confessions"" singer even had to get the male dancers to continue with the show.

Usher is the back up singer here at HER show! Do you know what kind of upper body strength and control you have to have to pull that off?! Wooooooo 😅 — Tunde (@OHHMGitstbaba) August 15 2021



The replies also revealed how Usher should take notes on making a spectacular show just like Washington wowed the audience. Or else the pole-dancing queen might steal the rest of his stages.

View the current offers here .

Every merchant in the world that accepts credit cards is assigned a merchant category code by each credit card network (American Express Visa Mastercard etc.). Credit card issuers (Amex Chase Capital One etc.) then use these codes to determine which categories your purchases fall into. These codes are important because they determine:

How many points your rewards card will earn for your purchase

If you can redeem credit card rewards points toward your purchase

For example when you swipe a Visa card at Walmart your purchase will often code as ""5310"" which tells your card issuer that you've shopped at a ""discount store."" However a Walmart just down the road may code as ""5411"" which indicates to Visa that you were shopping at a ""grocery store."" So if you've got a credit card that earns bonus points for groceries you may get a bonus at one Walmart but not the other. The same is true with other categories as well such as travel or dining.

By now you probably know or have heard how easy it is to redeem Capital One miles at a rate of one cent each toward travel purchases when you have either the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card or the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card (miles' value is less than that when cashed in for statement credits toward other types of purchases). That makes Capital One miles great for lowering your out-of-pocket vacation expenses for things like airfare hotels rental cars and more. As long as a purchase you make with your Capital One card codes as some type of travel category you should be able to redeem Capital One miles at that rate of one cent apiece for it.

But did you know you can also use miles at that preferential rate for food purchases? Capital One doesn't necessarily intend for their miles to be used in this way but I'll show you how to do it.

The secret: Restaurants inside hotels

The Capital One Venture and Capital One VentureOne cards are issued by Visa. Restaurants generally code with Visa as ""5812"" (Eating places and Restaurants) or ""5814"" (Fast Food Restaurants) which are not travel-related. That's disappointing because eating out can be a big expense during your travels -- the ability to offset the price of food would be a huge boon to folks with Capital One miles.

But there actually is a way to use Capital One miles toward dining: Eat at restaurants inside hotels. They're not hard to find if you're in the city or a popular tourist destination and purchases at them usually code as a hotel charge rather than a restaurant one. So if you have Capital One miles you might be able to redeem them for purchases at the 1-cent rate since hotels fall into Capital One's travel category.

I personally used Capital One miles to offset the cost of afternoon tea at the Skyview Bar & Restaurant in Dubai at the top of the legendary Burj Al Arab hotel. Because the charge was coded as hotel purchase it was easy to redeem miles from my Capital One Venture for the charge at 1 cent apiece.

The seven-course tea costs approximately $170 per person and it's an experience I wouldn't have booked unless I knew I could offset the cost with rewards and save a few hundred dollars. In hindsight though it was so lavish and delicious that I would have paid cash for it. I highly recommend it.

Not all hotel-operated restaurants code as travel however. When that happens there's a simple solution.

How to find qualifying restaurants

How will you know if your hotel restaurant purchase will code as a travel merchant? Because the Capital One Venture is a Visa card you can use this Visa Supplier Locator to determine how your purchase will code with reasonable accuracy.

What works

Let's run through my above meal in Dubai. I'll enter the location and hotel into the Visa Supplier Locator.

(Image courtesy of Visa Supplier Locator)

Visa then reveals that the Burj Al Arab codes as ""HOTELS & MOTELS - 7011."" That's definitely travel-related.

(Image courtesy of Visa Supplier Locator)

But when I search for the Skyview Bar & Restaurant instead of the Burj Al Arab Visa cannot find the venue. That's because as far as Visa knows Skyview is the same entity as the Burj Al Arab. Whether I'm spending money on a hotel room at the Burj or just a meal at its restaurant it will code as ""HOTELS & MOTELS - 7011.""

(Image courtesy of Visa Supplier Locator)

What doesn't work

Now let's look at a hotel restaurant that doesn't code as travel. Admittedly I haven't personally tested this hotel with a Capital One credit card so if this doesn't work for some reason I'd love to hear about it.

The Andaz Maui possesses a handful of quality dining options. On the premises is Morimoto Maui an expensive Japanese fusion restaurant. Here it is with the Visa Supplier Locator coding as ""RESTAURANTS/BARS."" That's not good. You won't be able to redeem Capital One miles for a meal here.

(Image courtesy of Visa Supplier Locator)

But if we look at another restaurant at the Andaz Maui Ka'ana Kitchen Visa can't find it. It's the same entity as the Andaz Maui. That's good. When you spend money at Ka'ana Kitchen Visa should indicate to Capital One that you're at a hotel.

Earn Capital One miles

Until 2019 there was only one reasonably valuable option for redeeming Capital One miles: Redeeming them at a rate of 1 cent each for travel charges. Now you can transfer Capital One miles to airlines and hotels to potentially get even more value from them. Per TPG valuations Capital One miles are worth 1.85 cents each when you transfer to travel partners.

However using your points to offset travel purchases is by far the easiest way to use your miles -- and still a very popular option. No matter which avenue you choose you can earn Capital One miles quickly by earning the sign-up bonuses on and spending regularly with credit cards including:

Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card: Earn 75000 bonus miles when you spend $4000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.

Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card: Earn 20000 bonus miles after spending $500 on purchases within the first three months from account opening

Capital One Spark Miles for Business: Earn 50000 bonus miles after spending $4500 on purchases within the first three months from account opening

Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card: Earn $300 after you spend $3000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening (you can convert your $300 back into 30000 miles if you also have a Capital One miles-earning card)

The information for the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Bottom line

Capital One miles are easy-to-use for travel purchases and get you a solid rate of return of 1 cent per mile when you redeem them this way. Unfortunately miles are worth less when redeemed for statement credits toward non-travel charges including dining and restaurants. However if you find a restaurant inside a hotel Capital One will often code this spending as a hotel charge instead of a restaurant one and thus allow you to redeem your miles at the higher rate against these purchases.

Tons of eligible restaurants worldwide code as hotels and you can use the Visa Supplier Locator to find them easily. If you're actually staying at a hotel you can order room service and food that you pay for as part of your room bill should code as travel too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9uZXctdG8tdGhlLXUtcy1jdXJ2ZS13aWxsLW9mZmVyLWNhc2gtYmFjay1wbHVzLXRoZS1yZXdhcmRzLXlvdS1hbHJlYWR5LWVhcm4tb24teW91ci1jYXJkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Updates].: Curve Will Offer Cash Back Plus The Rewards You Already Earn On Your Cards,"I receive compensation for content and many links on this blog. Citibank is an advertising partner of this site as is American Express Chase Barclays and Capital One. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own and have not been reviewed approved or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles points and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). Terms apply to the offers and benefits listed on this page.

Update: Referrals for Curve now bump you 100 places on the wait list rather than 50 spots (ends September 6 2021) and terms explain that cash back on top of your usual rewards won’t be awarded for paying taxes or insurance or buying gift cards. (HT: Frequent Miler)

Curve has been a U.K. product for some time and is coming to the U.S.. You can get on their announcement/pre-registration list and there’s a potential benefit in extra cash back to do so. The card should become available next month.

They have an interesting model: you load your current rewards card into their app and then when you use their card you earn the rewards you would earn anyway plus an additional 1% cash back on top for six months by joining the waitlist.

You get a single credit card and card number linked to your other rewards cards. As they explained to me You can use the Curve credit card with the physical card or with our xPay integration. Every time you use the Curve credit card and for example purposes with the underlying card being AAdvantage card you’ll get 1% cashback from Curve on top of your miles.

They even promise that you can move charges from one card to another up to 30 days in the past. Put a charge on the wrong card maybe you regret not earning the most points for it they say they’ll let you change which card the charge is on.

Actually their ‘Go Back In Time’ feature could save a lot of relationships between the rewards-obsessed and their spouses. Let them put charges on whatever card they want no more arguments and just move the charges onto the “right” card later. Or maybe you didn’t realize a purchase was going to get coded as travel and so you realize you’ll earn more points by moving it to the most lucrative card for the travel category.

For every person that you refer you’ll be bumped 50 places up the waitlist. If you’re in the top 100 people on the waitlist by the time the card launches you’ll earn 10% cashback for the first six months. Note that you’d have to refer a lot of people to do that though. When I joined the waitlist the other day the email confirmation from Curve stated that I’m in 13109th place. I’d therefore need to refer more than 250 people – with people above me not referring anyone – in order to crack the top 100 which seems unlikely.

Curve says that the “top 100” on their waitlist are actually going to get 10% cash back for the first 6 months up to $1000 then 1%. You move up ’50 spots each time’ you refer someone successfully. I don’t see most of us breaking into the top 100. As I write this I’m 14308 in line. So I’d need to refer 285 to break the top 100 but other people are going to be referring folks as well so I’d need even more than that.

In the U.K. Curve doesn’t work with Amex. I’d be surprised if they’re able to here in the U.S. We don’t have all of the answers yet on the product but the UK version gives us some insight. It’s worth signing up for their wait list since of course you’re not obligated and should get extra cash back if you do decide to get Curve later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbnNidXJnaC5jb20vMjAyMS84LzE1LzIyNjIzODE3L2NoZWNraW5nLWluLW9uLXRoZS1jYXBpdGFscy1leC1wZW5ndWluc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Checking in on the Capitals' ex-Penguins,"From 2009 Cup-winner Brooks Orpik apologizing for a late hit on Olli Maatta in Game 2 of the 2016 second round to Marc-Andre Fleury taping over Matt Niskanen’s name on his helmet’s list of 2009 champions after a postseason collision with Sidney Crosby in 2017 the pipeline of one-time Penguins leaving to don red white and blue in Washington D.C. is one fraught with drama.

The 2020-21 Capitals roster contained four members of the Penguins’ 2016-17 championship squad. Four years later everyone’s role has changed— so let’s take a look at just how they did in Washington last season.

CAPS TODAY: Carl Hagelin Justin Schultz and Conor Sheary will become the first set of teammates since 1997 to win multiple Cups with one team and then skate in the postseason together with another club. More info and Caps Clips at https://t.co/HecIC0ECg1 pic.twitter.com/vYXXksLRC1 — CapitalsPR (@CapitalsPR) May 14 2021

Conor Sheary

It’s likely we’ll never see another 2016-17 campaign from Sheary when he put up a career-best 3.3 pts/60 on Sidney Crosby’s wing but 2020-21 was still a solid season for the speedy winger.

Sheary started out on the Capitals’ fourth line but by the end of the season was skating on the second— a promotion that earned him a two-year $1.5mil AAV contract extension in April. One of the Capitals’ best drivers of high-danger scoring opportunities it’s becoming clear that although Sheary likely won’t see first-line duties in Washington he fits well as a winger on their second or third line. He showed off his well-placed shot by scoring 14 times in 53 games for a career-high 15.9% shot accuracy.

Carl Hagelin

Penguins fans remember Hagelin best for his role on one of the Penguins’ most successful third lines in recent memory but for the first time since his rookie 2011-12 season with the New York Rangers Hagelin was assigned almost exclusively to the fourth line in 2020-21. His 14:06 of ice time per game was the lowest of his NHL career.

Hagelin’s success with the Penguins didn’t stem from his offensive production— in 2016-17 he scored six times in 61 games— but from his asset as a puck possessor. He trailed only Patric Hornqvist and Sidney Crosby with a 53.81 CF% at 5v5 that season and was gratifyingly solid in the defensive zone. Even if he couldn’t finish most of his chances he was a reliable way to get pucks on net.

Travis Boyd redirects a shot by Carl Hagelin and the @Capitals are on the board! #NHLonSN pic.twitter.com/BkeGBwMAdC — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) August 6 2020

Hagelin is at his best when he’s on a line with gifted scorers (let’s say as a random example one Phil Kessel) who can finish off the scoring opportunities Hagelin earns with his speed. While skating besides the Capitals’ fourth-liners in 2020-21 he wasn’t used to the most of his capabilities— and served as a rather expensive bottom-three forward at $2.75 million. Still he put up a respectable 16 points even if his possession numbers did dip slightly.

Daniel Sprong

Sprong’s success in Washington felt very nearly inevitable.

The only thing clearer than Sprong’s obvious talent— a laser-like shot— was that he wasn’t fitting into the lineup in Pittsburgh. His defensive numbers were abysmal in his rookie 2016-17 campaign perhaps part of the reason he only spent 18 games in the lineup. He would never top that total in his three Penguins seasons.

Daniel Sprong just looked off Ovechkin on a 2-on-1 shot it scored and this was his reaction pic.twitter.com/ZnsoJZM8Vn — Dimitri Filipovic (@DimFilipovic) March 10 2021

In 2020-21 Sprong joined the Capitals for 42 games of the shortened season— where he recorded 20 points and 13 goals even though he was on the ice for fewer than 12 minutes every contest.

Rotating through a cavalcade of linemates as he filled in for various empty roster spots— many of which came in the Capitals’ top two lines— helped the winger convert on a career-high 17.6% of his shots. Although that shooting percentage is unsustainable this season showed that Sprong has the capability to be what the Penguins wanted from him— a cheap high-volume shooter who can make the most of opportunities around the net.

Justin Schultz

Former Oiler Schultz enjoyed two bounce-back championship seasons in Pittsburgh before his possession numbers began to dip once again in 2017-18— but his consistent offensive contributions helped offset his defensive struggles. Then those numbers began to fall as well. A 2019-20 campaign where he recorded a career-low 12 points in 46 games was the end of his Pittsburgh career.

On the bright side for Schultz his offensive totals soared while on the Capitals’ second pairing in 2020-21. He trailed only Nicklas Backstrom and John Carlson for the team lead in assists with 24 helpers in 46 games.

On the disappointing side the change of scenery did not give Schultz the kind of bounce-back defensive recovery that he once saw in Pittsburgh. He still struggled to drive puck possession even behind some of the Capitals’ best lines— and his most memorable moment of the season may be his infamous miscommunication with Ilya Samsonov behind the net in Game 3 of the 2021 first round.

The question for the Capitals is whether Schultz’s stellar offensive production is worth the $4 million contract and defensive struggles.

So now for the million-dollar (or in Sprong’s case just $725k) question: if you could steal any of these ex-Penguins back for 2020-21 who would you take— and why?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Flci1saW5ndXMtY2FuLW5vdy1mbHktZnJvbS11ay10by11cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aer Lingus can now fly from England to the US opening up new possibilities for American travelers (eventually),"After postponing its new routes between the U.K and the United States earlier this year Aer Lingus has now received permission from the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority to start service between England and the U.S.

These new routes are excellent news for travelers in the northwest of England and potentially eventually for Americans. Aside from the new nonstop service and extra Avios earning opportunities this also provides them with a convenient way to get to these destinations on points without having to go to London first.

At least for now these flights are not for sale to U.S. consumers as you can see in the press release announcing the routes.

An Aer Lingus spokesperson told TPG ""While Aer Lingus awaits imminent approval from the US Department of Transport (DOT) tickets on the Manchester to U.S. services can not be sold in the U.S.""

The DOT has given 'approval in principle' for the route but tickets can't be sold in the U.S. until final approval is granted.

These new flights can be booked with Avios and Aer Lingus has recently been added to the American Airlines and British Airways joint venture meaning there's ample backup in case of a delay or rebooking.

According to a statement issued by Aer Lingus the following rates apply for the new flights (per one-way in economy class):

Manchester (MAN) to New York-JFK: 20000 Avios in the summer of 2021 (down to 13000 in autumn and winter)

Manchester (MAN) to Orlando (MCO): 25000 Avios in the summer of 2021 (down to 16250 in autumn and winter)

Manchester (MAN) to Barbados (BGI): 16250 Avios in autumn and winter of 2021.

Avios amounts for flights to Boston are yet unknown but are expected to be around 20000 Avios given the similar distance to the New York-JFK flights.

In recent years Aer Lingus has really upped its game with new aircraft and refreshed cabins. The Boston and New York City routes will be flown on the single-aisle Airbus A321Neo of which the airline took delivery back in 2019.

On the Orlando and Barbados routes a wide-body Airbus A330 will be used.

The carrier will operate its flights to and from New York out of Terminal 5 alongside its Oneworld partner British Airways. All other American routes will originate from Terminal 3.

The decision to divide and conquer across two terminals is a curious one. It would seem to make more logistical sense at least for passengers to have an airline operate all of its flights from the same terminal.

American moved all of its Heathrow flights to T5 in July 2020 as the pandemic forced the shuttering of T3 due to lack of airport traffic. A benefit of the move is it made it easier for American passengers to make connections with BA.

But now those travellers who may not be aware that American is working out of two different terminals could find themselves a bit lost.

Another factor to consider with this split is how it affects travellers on the ground. The lounge situation in Terminal 3 isn't ideal at the moment. The Cathay Pacific First Class Lounge and the Qantas Lounge are both closed as is the Admirals Club. The only Oneworld lounge currently open in Terminal 3 is the British Airways Lounge and it's limited to business-class flyers.

Terminal 5 has the British Airways Galleries Club Lounge as well as the First Lounge that's reserved for Oneworld Emerald status holders. So at least while most lounges remain closed in T3 passengers flying American between London and New York City would seem to have a much better lounge situation at Heathrow."

McGee hopes Warren city leaders pause to consider what residents may want it to do with the nearly $500000 it could receive in a possible opioid lawsuit settlement announced earlier this month.

McGee 72 tragically lost two sons four years ago. One son Brian to a motorcycle accident and another Dennis P. McGee to a drug overdose.

“There’s nothing more painful than losing a child” McGee said.

His son Dennis P. 38 a former firefighter line man and Amish driver fought his opioid addiction before he died in December 2017.

McGee and his wife Barbara watched as the drugs took over his son’s life. They watched as he battled the addiction. He stole from them. He was in and out of jail.

“He overdosed in the bathroom” McGee said.

SETTLEMENT STATS

Warren is one of more than 52 Mahoning and Trumbull communities that may be awarded a portion of more than $804 million the state and local communities could receive over an 18-year period — if enough political subdivisions approve the settlement.

Ohio and numerous counties villages townships and cities took opioid distributors AmerisourceBergen Cardinal Health and McKesson to court.

Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said Friday 86 percent of the political subdivisions that are litigants in the matter 114 of 145 have signed on to the agreements. Communities were given a Friday deadline to pass legislation allowing them to participate in and receive a portion of the settlement amount but Yost on Friday extended the deadline to Aug. 20 to allow more communities to opt in.

Settlement funds will be provided to the communities over an 18-year period.

“To seal the deal the state must have the support of local governments representing at least 95 percent of its population” a news release from Yost states.

Yost said the OneOhio settlement money “represents the best opportunity for the many communities hit hard by the opioid crisis to begin to recover from the devastation.”

But the 86 percent is “not enough” Yost said.

“We need everyone on board for there to be a deal. The distributors could still walk away” Yost said.

The settlement resources could be used by the state and local communities to create or expand opportunities for opioid substance-use-disorder treatment prevention and education Yost said.

“We desperately need this money on the ground combating the opioid epidemic” the press releases states.

But a few governments are holding out and could “nix the deal for the whole state” he said.

“That would be a bigger tragedy” Yost said.

SIGNING ON

Trumbull and Columbiana counties have signed on as litigating communities according to Yost’s documentation. Although not listed on Yost’s list Mahoning County commissioners signed on commissioners said.

Litigating communities Warren and Youngstown have signed off on the settlement.

Howland trustees last week approved a motion for participating in the settlement agreement. Howland Trustee Chairman Rick Clark said because Howland has at least 10000 residents it is allowed to participate in the settlement.

Locally Mahoning and Trumbull county governments would receive the bulk share of the settlement. In the first distribution of funds Mahoning could receive up to $2.256 million and Trumbull could receive $2.848 million.

Youngstown may be awarded up to $811053 and Warren up to $496367 in the first distribution of the settlement. As these cities are the largest in their respective counties they are expected to receive more than the other political subdivisions in both counties.

The state’s OneOhio plan divvies up the potential funds between state’s communities.

“Under the OneOhio plan the settlement money would be distributed locally with 55 percent going to a foundation created to disburse the money and fund programs that benefit Ohioans affected by opioids and / or prevent addiction; 30 percent earmarked for community recovery programs at the local level; (and) 15 percent going to the state of Ohio.”

Non-litigating communities Niles Warren Township Girard Liberty Newton Falls Sebring Lordstown and Poland also have passed the appropriate legislation according to Yost’s documentation Friday which may not be a complete list.

“Every politician in the state needs to do the right thing” Yost said Friday. “This is not a time for gamesmanship or politics. This is ‘we’ time not ‘me’ time.”

If the settlement moves forward the first awards are expected to be distributed in 60 to 90 days according to Warren Law Director Enzo Cantalamessa.

AMOUNTS UNCLEAR

Communities across the Mahoning Valley are looking at ways to use the funds although many officials declined to comment on the issue while it still is pending.

McGee said local government officials should meet with people like him those personally affected by the opioid crisis to hear their opinions of the use of the funds before making any decisions.

“What the city should do is meet with all those affected by opioid addictions — whether it is those who have gotten through the addictions or the loved ones left behind” McGee said. “They should ask what we would like to see done with these funds.”

The communities cannot begin to make plans until the court reveals guidelines and limitations.

Mahoning County Commissioner Anthony Traficanti said he hopes that much of the money will go toward programs that help people in recovery and their families.

“Outside of the regular government funding programs this will be one of the largest sources of income specifically aimed at drug recovery and counseling services” Traficanti said.

Trumbull Commissioner Frank Fuda said the influx of opioids into the community has been crippling.

The commissioners will have to study the best way to prioritize use of the funds he said.

Girard Mayor James Melfi said opioids placed a huge burden on the city’s first responders.

“The burden it placed on them were at times overwhelming” Melfi said. “It was terrifying for what it did to families as their loved ones were crippled by addictions sent to prison or lost their lives.”

He described the opioid era as “tragic.”

“It overwhelmed communities and families” Melfi said.

Girard could be awarded as much as $98 571.50 in the first round of awards which isn’t a lot considering the heavy impact the crisis has had Melfi said.

“This is not a great deal of money when we look at the costs cities incurred for all the calls and life-saving measures that had to be taken.”

Police fire medical and emergency services personnel in hard-hit areas have responded to hundreds if not thousands of accidental fatal and nonfatal overdose calls tasked with distributing opioid-overdose reversal drugs and other life saving measures at an increased rate during the pandemic which still shows no signs of stopping.

Melfi said he would like to see some of the money used for education so this era will not be repeated.

Meanwhile Trumbull County continues to move forward with a separate prong of the same lawsuit.

While the settlement at hand deals with the part of the federal suit naming the distribution pharmacies a part of the suit naming the retail pharmacies as defendants moves toward a trial day.

The suit “a piece of the” opioid lawsuit “pie” names CVS Walgreens Rite Aid Walmart and Giant Eagle said attorney Frank Gallucci representing Trumbull County commissioners on the case.

Jury selection is scheduled for Sept. 29 before Cleveland federal court Judge Dan Aaron Polster Gallucci said. A jury trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 4 according to the court docket although a settlement could be reached before then.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvaGVhbHRoL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL2NhcmRpbmFsLXJheW1vbmQtYnVya2UtaG9zcGl0YWxpemVkLWNvdmlkLzYzLTg2YmFjZWExLTk2NDQtNGE5Mi05M2QwLTdhYWFjZDM1OWY2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former St. Louis archbishop Burke in hosptial with COVID-19,"A message from Cardinal Burke's Twitter page asks for prayer during this time although doctors said he is getting better

The first cruise ship is now taking shape as it’s roughly halfway to her proposed delivery schedule.

Many see China as the most significant potential growth market worldwide and several cruise lines have already committed ships to China including Costa Cruises Princess Cruises MSC Cruises and Royal Caribbean.

New cruise line builds on Carnival Corporation’s brand identity strategy

Carnival Corporation has long built on its strategy to have a separate geographic identity for most of its brands. For example AIDA is focused on the German market Costa is focused on Italy and Carnival Cruise Line on the USA. The decision to open up a cruise company to the world’s largest emerging cruise market China is no surprise.

Their first effort is so far only known by its project name Hull H1508 at the Waigaoqiao Shipyard in Shanghai. The first of two 133500 gross tons cruise ships are based on the plans for the Vista-class ships sailing for Carnival Cruise Line which will be launched by 2023 and will have space for 4200 passengers.

There are plans for a total of four additional Carnival China ships to be built at a later stage. It does seem that at least the first vessel will feature AIDA Cruises branding. This is also the first Carnival Corp cruise ship being constructed in China.

China’s cruise economy which first opened in 2006 has seen no less than 45 percent annual growth in the past decade. Before the pandemic started estimates said 4.5 million Chinese people would go on cruises by 2020.

Zheng Xuewu chairman of China Tourism Group Co Ltd:

“The China cruise market is growing rapidly. In 2017 more than 3.6 million trips were made and that figure is expected to reach at least 10 million trips by 2030.”

Operating a new cruise line in China only makes sense seeing the tremendous growth that is possible here. In comparison in the United States which is currently the largest cruise market worldwide 13.79 million passengers embarked on a cruise ship in 2019.

Carnival China

Carnival Corporation signed the agreement with Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding and China Investment Corporation in 2015 to establish the Hong Kong-based China joint venture CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping Ltd. The goal is to start up the cruise ship construction industry and introduce a new cruise line to the country focused exclusively on Chinese and Asian cruise passengers.

Carnival CEO Arnold Donald said the following:

“This represents another important milestone in building a sustainable and prosperous cruise industry and demonstrates our commitment to contributing to China becoming a leading cruise market as part of its five-year economic development plan”

CSSC or Carnival China already purchased two cruise ships in the build-up for launching the Carnival China Brand; Costa Atlantica and Costa Mediterranea. Both of which are currently awaiting re-deployment in Dubai.

In recent weeks announcements have been made about more cruise ships that will be built in China including a 6500 passenger 140000 gross tons vessel that RINA will classify the Italian ship’s classification agency which has worked with Carnival Corporation extensively in the past although no buyer for this vessel has been disclosed so far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vR01BL05ld3MvdmlkZW8vMjctdmFjY2luYXRlZC1wZW9wbGUtYm9hcmQtY2Fybml2YWwtY3J1aXNlLXRlc3QtcG9zaXRpdmUtNzk0NTQzMzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video 27 vaccinated people on board Carnival Cruise test positive for COVID-19,27 vaccinated people on board Carnival Cruise test positive for COVID-19 All the positive cases are now in isolation but this is the largest number of cases since the cruise industry restarted operations in America.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWxhd25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdW5jYXRlZ29yaXplZC9pbmZlY3RlZC1hdC1zZWEtdGhlLW5ldy1ub3JtYWwtb24tY3J1aXNlLXNoaXBzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Infected at Sea – The New Normal on Cruise Ships?,"A reader just sent me a YouTube video by cruise vloggers Dee and Jay who operate the popular ParoDeeJay YouTube page. Dee and Jay went on a cruise on the Carnival Mardi Gras last week and Dee began experiencing symptoms (which she described as a tickly throat fever and an “icky feeling”). She was given a PCR test on the ship (Jay was given an antigen test) and she tested positive for COVID19 during the cruise. In the video posted this morning she says that she wants to stay “as positive as possible” and the symptoms were “not terrible.” She subsequently lost her taste and smell. And her treatment included receiving oxygen.

They were in the middle of preparing videos which they called the “Mardi Gras Cruise” series and which they abruptly suspended.

During self-quantaine in their cabin they say that getting infected on a cruise is “kinda the new normal” like getting the virus at “Walmart or a grocery store.”

Jay states that they are both vaccinated “but COVID is out there . . . it’s something that we have to deal with.” He continues: “. . . and the point of the vaccination is that it’s gonna make I guess an easier time to deal with and you’re not gonna be as symptomatic or as spreading or you know it’s not as dangerous necessarily . . . “

I’m not sure that I agree with the conclusions of these well-liked cruise vloggers but that’s what they are saying.

The vloggers don’t mention whether there was any contact tracing which might have (and should have) occurred following her infection. I understand that there were other vloggers and bloggers on the cruise who they enjoyed time with during their back-to-back cruises on the Mardi Gras. The Mardi Gras has a capacity of around 5000-6000 passengers so if it was operating at 60-70 capacity then there were well over 3000 guests on the ship during their cruise. And if this infection involved the highly contagious Delta variant the R0 (pronounced “R naught”) (the mathematical term that indicates how contagious the infectious disease is) is as high as “7” or “8.” The virus on the Diamond Princess had a R0 of only “2.”

It also debatable that you are as likely to get infected in a Walmart or a grocery store as on a cruise ship. Most people don’t spend more than 45 minutes in a grocery store compared to spending as long as one week (168 hours) on a cruise ship with several thousands of crew members and other guests eating and drinking non-stop. The video also ignores the reality as federal district court judge Kathleen Williams recently ruled (in the NCL versus State of Florida lawsuit) “scientific research shows that cruise lines are hotbeds for COVID-19 transmission.” This is not of course what cruise fans want to hear.

In any event we hope Dee recovers from her infection and that her partner stays safe.

As China's cultural and creative industry continues to boom the country's navy has also decided to join in on the trend as a way to showcase the fighting force's uplifting spirit and push navy culture among young Chinese.The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's second aircraft carrier the Shandong recently had its own fashion show with young sailors posing on the deck as photographers snapped pictures. The photos from the shoot were published on Wednesday.The fresh set of photos shows young models dressed in dark blue jackets that echo the sea over T-shirts decorated with pandas wearing flight helmets standing in different corners of the carrier.The newly out robot panda T-shirt is very popular on its sales website on Taobao which is currently ranks number one among all of its products. And the dark blue jacket sold out on Taobao on Sunday.The inspiration of both the panda-printed T-shirt and the jacket comes from the aircraft pilots.The jackets' dark blue on the outside matches with the life-jacket orange color inside which achieves a trendy effect of contrasting colors according to the introduction on the website.The motto of the aircraft carrier - named after the Chinese province of Shandong - is also printed inside the newly designed clothes: loyalty courage accomplishment and victory.The company that designed the clothing is Glory Made which has cooperated with the PLA Navy for years and once designed the logo for the carrier as well as a string of other naval creative products including caps sunglasses computer mice and keyboards featuring the Shandong aircraft carrier.After the Shandong's commissioning ceremony in Sanya South China's Hainan Province in December 2019 the country's first domestic-made aircraft carrier launched a premiere ceremony for related merchandise at The Military Museum in Beijing on January 1 2020 marking the PLA Navy's first step into the cultural and creative industry.The company designed products with a more youthful feel to attract the public's interest in naval culture and to allow them to feel the positive energy the aircraft carrier has brought to the country.After its commissioning ceremony the Shandong returned to the Dalian Shipyard where it was constructed conducting three training voyages throughout 2020. The first was held in the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea from May 25 to June 17 the second in the Bohai Sea from September 1 to 22 and the third in the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea from November 21 to December 13.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3RyYXRuZXdzZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlZC12aWRlb3MvaW5kaWFzLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXJzLWZyb20tdmlrcmFudC10by12aWtyYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India’s Aircraft Carriers: From Vikrant To Vikrant,NEW DELHI: The successful sea trial of Indigenous Aircraft Carrier 1 adds a distinguished feather in the Make in India cap.

British woman Laura Groome 35 who works as a childminder was walking in her garden when she spotted the mysterious looking creature earlier this week.

She walked over to take a closer look and at first thought it was a snake.

However Laura was left confused as the creature didn’t flinch or move like a reptile.

She decided to upload photos of her discovery to Facebook in the hopes of finding out what the creature it was – but was left in stitches by the response from social media.

Facebook users' toilet humour

Facebook users were gobsmacked by the mysterious creature with guesses on what it could be ranging from poo on a kitchen roll to a ""dog turd"".

“Thought it was s*** on the kitchen roll at first” one user said.

“Straight to the comments as I definitely thought it was a turd on kitchen roll at first glance” another user wrote.

“A s***apillar?” a third person joked.

“Not going to lie I honestly thought this was a dog turd” a fourth person said.

“It looks like dog sh*t with eyes” a fifth person wrote.

Other users thought the creature looked like a Pokémon with one person commenting: “Definitely a Pokémon!”

“Pokemon comes to mind” another user added.

After further research and assistance Laura realised the creature was in fact an elephant hawk caterpillar that will eventually transform into a beautiful pink moth.

The creature remains in her garden and she told Jam Press it has now buried itself into the soil.

His work can be found in many public places in Prague and beyond.

A 10-metre-high work by Kurt Gebauer which appeared this year on Prague’s Vítězné náměstí is meant to symbolise the “caterpillar of early capitalism” in the Czech Republic.

Sculptor and Prague 6 resident Gebauer designed the work in 1997 in response to the period’s ""bad mood"" a term coined by former president Václav Havel to describe the evaporation of post-communist-era euphoria among the country’s citizens.

The caterpillar is located on the same spot where a statue of Lenin was removed 30 years ago. It is not his only provocative work.

""It is not only art connoisseurs or snobs who meet in the public space but mainly ordinary people. They walk by and are either attracted or annoyed. The sculptures help them vent their aggression when people discuss them and that's a good thing"" says Gebauer a long-time professor at the Academy of Arts Architecture & Design in Prague who was a neighbour of Václav Havel’s in Střešovice.

He dedicated a heart-shaped monument to him at the National Theatre piazzetta. Also well-known are Gebauer's Dwarfs in Vojanovy Sady and his Bohemian Pond featuring sculptures of women with water spraying from their heads and mouths.

Gebauer uses unusual materials: textiles fibreglass and rough stone.

I mean I've lived with a lot of people who have periods and it never ceases to amaze me how – once a month – we all morph into highly irate variations of the Hungry Caterpillar at exactly the same time.

Whether we're crying over literally nothing or comparing notes on how menstruation masturbation is working out for us (surprisingly well – thank you v much) it definitely feels as though menstruation is something we all experience together as oppose to errrm taking turns.

For many people who have periods it's a given that our periods will inevitably sync up with the nearest uteruses (usually belonging to our flatmates) but is there actually any science to back this up? The short answer is no. GLAMOUR chatted to Dr Jack Pearson who is the Medical Affairs Manager at Natural Cycles to find out why.

Is period syncing real?

To my knowledge the first research on period syncing was conducted in the 1970s which studied American college students living together in dormitories. It found that those students that were close friends had menstrual cycles that synced compared to those that just lived in the same room whose cycles did not sync. It was suggested that menstrual syncing occurred due to a strong bond which meant more time for pheromone communication.

Since then the majority of research that has been conducted into menstrual syncing does not support its occurrence and [the] studies that suggest that [period-syncing] exists have been poorly designed. So overall there is not much scientific support.

Why do people think periods sync?

It’s very interesting to look at why there is a misconception that periods do sync! Firstly small amounts of research and mathematical common sense suggest that if women's cycles are less regular then it's likely that menstruation will overlap when groups of menstruating individuals are living together – for instance our research found that only 13% of cycles are 28 days long.

This is more due to chance than communication between our bodies. Sometimes they will align and others they will not. In society we like meaningful exciting stories (period syncing being a thing!) whereas if things happen by chance it's generally not that interesting.

Secondly it was believed this was an evolutionary strategy where individuals co-operate between each other to prevent them becoming a harem for a single dominant male. If a group of menstruating individuals were all fertile at the same time one male could not reproduce with them all. Pretty primitive stuff! The release of this research coincided with an increase in the presence of the feminist movement which is one reason why the theory became so popular.

I believe the idea of syncing between individuals is also comforting given the taboo around menstruation and women's health. If you are aware that someone close by is also on their period the idea of you both sharing this potentially difficult time gives you the feeling you are conquering this societal taboo together.

It has also been suggested that the attachment of mythical communication such as period syncing between women has roots in misogyny and that we should move away from the view that we'll never know the answers in women's health to performing good quality research on menstrual cycle data.

In society we like meaningful exciting stories (period syncing being a thing!) whereas if things happen by chance it's generally not that interesting.

Where do pheromones come into this?

It has been suggested that a menstruating individual smells different (gives off different pheromones) at different stages of their menstrual cycle with more 'attractive' (to non-menstruating individuals) pheromones being produced mid cycle when ovulation is occurring.

This makes sense given that if you're trying to conceive you want to have sex around the time that you ovulate to maximise the chance of success. Research does support this idea (male-female pheromone attraction) but not that there is pheromonal communication between menstruating individuals (woman to woman cycle syncing).

Desmond Sim CEO at Edmund Tie & Company (SEA) however is deserving of that adjective.

The 47-year-old is the co-founder and drummer of indie-pop outfit Lilac Saints. The group racked up several hits in the ’90s including ‘Wasting Time’ that was featured in 12 Storeys Eric Khoo’s seminal exploration of local angst and ennui.

“But I couldn’t run away from real estate” says Sim who has a degree in the field. He got his start when the former DBS Land appointed him to do valuations and then he switched to research. Next he did a decade at global real estate firm JLL before working for nine years at international real estate advisory giant CBRE.

(Related: How Jolyn Yong bootstrapped her artisanal organic choc brand Happy Cioccolato )

Sim is reportedly one of the youngest CEOs in the industry. He took over from Ong Choon Fah one of the original co-founders of Edmund Tie. The home-grown SME with offices in Malaysia and Thailand is celebrating its 26th anniversary this year.

During his former work as a valuer he had to lug clipboards spare batteries and a box of five or six rolls of film to photograph clients’ homes. “You took every shot three times in case one was spoiled” he says. “Thank goodness for digital cameras now.”

Naturally one key push under Sim’s watch is digitalisation. “Real estate transactions create a lot of data. Digitising ours breaks down silos in the business and reduces the number of processes.”

[[nid:528244]]

While capital markets or investment sales remain a key priority for Edmund Tie – it has brokered the sale of 23 redevelopment sites totalling more than $4 billion since 2017 – Sim wants to expand its property management business. Also in the pipeline: sustainable ESG initiatives such as using automation to optimise climate control lighting and electricity use.

Talent development is another priority. Sim plans to roll out internships and work attachments for students and wants to set up a special millennial committee that will contribute feedback on corporate decisions regarding various subjects from new tech adoptions to staff amenities.

Despite his plans Sim whose idol is former Manchester United manager and firebrand Sir Alex Ferguson says he is not a radical disruptor. “I like to joke that the S stands for small and ME for mature experience” he says. “Individually the team is skilled and doing well. I just want to show them the benefits and give them a shared vision we can work towards together.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Peter Dey is chairman of Paradigm Capital and executive-in-residence at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. Sarah Kaplan is distinguished professor at the Rotman School and author of The 360º Corporation: From Stakeholder Trade-offs to Transformation. They are the co-authors of the Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship’s report 360º Governance: Where are the directors in a world in crisis?

As boards of directors reconvene in person and emerge from their virtual boardrooms they will be well-advised to review and update the purpose of the corporation to reflect the realities of easing pandemic restrictions.

What does it mean to have a purpose? “Making money” is part of it but will not be the sole purpose of the corporation. The corporation needs to make money to function. But making money alone gives no definition to why the corporation exists and no framework within which a board of directors can assess the best interests of the corporation.

And according to the Supreme Court of Canada’s 2008 BCE decision – which changed the legal landscape for Canadian boards – the best interests of the corporation must account for the interests of the corporation’s stakeholders and not just the shareholders.

The pandemic has had two important effects on the implementation of this legal framework and on the future of corporate governance in Canada. First the crisis has created many stresses for corporations from which boards of directors can derive insight. Boards will need to assess what they learned in the course of overseeing their companies through the pandemic and to implement changes to make the company more resilient to future crises.

Second the pandemic has created increased expectations of companies concerning their role in society – not just as engines of profits but also contributors to the environmental and social well-being of citizens. These expectations are not just coming from everyday citizens and activists – investors are also getting into the game by increasing their focus on stewardship of companies’ environmental social and governance (ESG) performance.

Indeed these two impacts are interrelated as emerging research in finance and management shows that the companies that attend most carefully to stakeholder interests are those that are more resilient to shocks.

One of the most graphic illustrations of the changed world of corporate governance is a series of recent decisions regarding the climate impacts of oil and gas companies. Activist investors obtained three seats on Exxon Mobil Corp.’s board; a court in the Netherlands ruled that Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s climate abatement plans were inadequate and demanded more; and Chevron Corp.’s shareholders approved a resolution requiring the company to set tougher targets on the emissions from the products it sells. These events highlight the changing definition of a board’s duty of care to exercise good business judgment. Canadian companies can expect to be subject to similar scrutiny.

A specific message for directors coming out of these developments is that for a board to discharge its duty of care to the corporation it must understand the risks to the long-term sustainability of the corporation’s business and have a strategic plan for dealing with those risks. Climate change is a good example of a development which creates a risk for virtually all businesses. Boards should be asking not just “How does climate change impact our business and what is our strategy for dealing with this impact?” but also “How are we contributing to climate change and what can we do to mitigate our impact?”

The message goes beyond the environment. Many social issues – such as board and work force diversity conditions in the supply chain and the inclusion of Indigenous people – must be credibly addressed by corporations in order to assure long-term sustainability. Further boards will only be considered as committed to tackling social and environmental concerns if they develop compensation plans that tie executive pay to achieving positive outcomes.

Knowing and managing the expectations of the corporation’s stakeholders will become a larger responsibility for boards of directors as social accountability is demanded by the corporations’ stakeholders including its shareholders. As we have argued elsewhere stakeholder management is a 21st century competency that all corporate boards will need to have.

Corporate boards cannot afford to be laggards in a changing governance landscape. Environmental and social sustainability and corporate sustainability are increasingly one and the same and the purpose of the corporation must reflect this new reality.

For those wondering where the BBHOF is it's at The Buffalo Bar and Grill located at 307 Louisiana Street in Buffalo. In any event there is going to be a duel celebration for Rachael as she commemorates 40 years on this earth with 20 of them standing behind the wood... um I mean bar. Friends industry people and patrons who just want to have an excuse to happy hour with a Buffalo bartending legend.

On Friday August 27 2021 Rachael and the Casa Di Pizza family will be hosting a celebration. Uncle would have it no other way than to dreadfully turn 40 without making it a big deal. And although turning forty isn’t on her list of favorite things to do she's glad she's made it this far with 20 years of bartending under her bedazzled belt.

I hung out with Uncle and here are her thoughts on the celebration

Instead of paying homage to my back pain and brain farts I would rather celebrate the two decades of working in the bar industry as my days of being a career bartender will soon come to an end.

2021 may be the end of an era for Rachael but she is excited to pick up where she left off as a school teacher welcoming new beginnings in 2022.

I have worked from casinos in Vegas to being inducted into the WNY Bartender’s Hall of Fame I feel I have given my all to the industry and I have reached my plateau. I will always choose to be a part of this industry (service) but I am ready to move forward with my other aspirations and it would bring nothing but happiness to me to celebrate with all who have been part of her journey.

Now Rachael will be working and celebrating during her regular shift at JJ’s Casi Di Pizza from Friday August 27 from 11 am-4 pm and celebrating through the evening. Stop by for a shot some pizza birthday spankings (preferred by Rachael) and hugs. All she asks is to take it “easy on her”.

Rachael also wanted to share some thoughts with all her industry friends and family.

""I’ve been bartending for 20 years. I’ve worked in dive bars neighborhood pubs upscale lounges Vegas casinos live music venues and all places in between. If you can order alcohol in an establishment I have probably poured a drink there. One of my first and most memorable gigs was at Alternative Brews on Sheridan in Amherst. This is where I learned the most. Not in the casinos or posh bars in Las Vegas. This is where I met Paul and Darryl and so many lifelong friends. Darryl was one of the most entertaining bartenders I have ever met. I learned from the best when I got to work under Darryl. I learned how to really connect with people make them feel special and just find the good in their lives. I also learned how to use sarcasm properly (most of the time). If Paul had not hired me I would never have had this amazing opportunity. After about two years Paul and I became the closest of friends. To this day Paul will always be one of my best friends. The years I spent at JP Bullfeathers Cozumel and Lenox have also granted the lifelong friends and memories I will never forget. I am humbled and grateful for the vast amount of people I have befriended all these years. I am one girl who truly feels love in all directions from so many. Being in the industry we all feel aches and pains. The missed holidays and family events. Wolfing down in less than five minutes all while standing up. From the long endless nights to the nights that fly by.

I want to give my gratitude to Casa Di Pizza. My current home. I don’t think I can say I’ve ever been prouder to work for such great people and such a great place.

I love everything about this place this family; what they stand for and how they run their business. From the day I started I felt like I was “home”. It’s no coincidence that Casa means Home. It is a true honor to work for Jeff and Lori and I could not be more content with ending my bartending career here. Last but not least the biggest shout should probably go to my LIVER. Thanks liver for putting up with all of our vodka shots seltzers whiskey wine craft beers or whatever liquid courage spirited painkillers our crazy brain decides to subject us to. Keep it up! To all of you that have been part of this crazy ride…Cheers!""

Cheers to you Rachael. And thank you for not getting me in trouble for accidentally leaving without paying my tab. Yes it happens to us all.

Starting Monday New York City will become the first major U.S. city to impose a vaccination requirement for indoor dining leaving restaurant operators across the five boroughs with a host of new challenges to tackle.

Prompted by the surge in new Covid-19 cases tied to the delta variant the city is requiring proof of at least one vaccine dose for a number of indoor activities including dining fitness clubs and attending indoor performances in New York City making it the first major U.S. city to impose such restrictions. Employees of those venues are also required to be vaccinated. Following a few weeks to transition enforcement is slated to start Sept. 13.

The policy is gaining traction. On Thursday San Francisco followed New York's lead implementing its own vaccination requirement for indoor activities that will go into effect in Aug. 20. The California city's mandate differs slightly from New York's by requiring proof of full vaccination but allowing two months for employers to verify their workers' status. Los Angeles is considering a similar plan.

As more vaccine mandates come from localities and the eateries themselves Booking Holdings ' OpenTable has rolled out a feature that allows restaurants to display their Covid inoculation requirements to customers. The reservation service also plans to publish a national list of restaurants that require proof of vaccination.

Inevitably New York's mandate will have a learning curve. But restaurants are also still waiting on more detailed guidance from city officials like how much information they need to collect and record from customers.

""I feel like it's going to be a bit of a free-for-all come Monday where customers and restaurants aren't really going to know what's happening with this"" said Art Depole who co-owns a Mooyah Burgers Fries and Shakes franchise with his brother Nick in midtown Manhattan.

Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol told the Washington Post on Wednesday that the the city should figure out how the vaccination requirement applies to people who can't be inoculated for medical or religious reasons. Otherwise they'll be left out of the workforce.

Labor has been an ongoing challenge for the industry which needs all the workers it can get. Restaurants have turned to raising wages and offering retention bonuses to attract new workers but the unemployment rate for eating and drinking places was still 8.4% nationwide in July according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Depole said that more than half of his Mooyah employees are vaccinated. However he's seeing vocal pushback from a handful of his unvaccinated workers who are threatening to quit if the inoculation becomes a term of their employment. Enforcing the mandates also puts the burden on his staff who would have to handle noncompliant customers.

And checking for proof of vaccination could also mean scheduling an extra worker just to stand by the door throughout the shift adding to restaurants' rising labor costs. Chipotle is still figuring out how it will check for proof of vaccination.

""Obviously it's something that is going to require some thinking if we want it to be truly executable"" Niccol said.

Tourists present another difficulty in implementing the mandate. Depole's Mooyah restaurant is located between Times Square and Herald Square two tourist hot spots and those customers' orders are needed.

""It seems like more of the locals are on board and understand it but the tourists and the out-of-towners say 'Oh no that's the last time you're going to see me in the city'"" Depole said. ""It's a polarizing issue.""

And although the number of international tourists isn't expected to rebound to pre-pandemic levels until 2025 some are still traveling to New York City. For those visiting from outside the U.S. some might find themselves struggling to get their proof of vaccination accepted.

For example retail consultant and founder of SW Retail Advisors Stacey Widlitz received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the United Kingdom. While the World Health Organization has approved the vaccine Widlitz has faced difficulties getting some New York businesses to accept her proof of vaccination: a QR code generated by the National Health Service's mobile app.

""I'm not a tourist but I had my vaccine in London and they don't know what to do with a barcode from a foreign country on an app they don't recognize"" Widlitz said. ""They give you a blank stare.""

So far an Upper East Side gym has already told Widlitz that it would only accept the Moderna  Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson vaccines if she wanted to exercise without a mask. Workers at several independent restaurants told her she wouldn't be able to eat indoors once the mandate kicked in because they had no way to verify vaccinations that occurred outside of the United States.

But restaurant operators will also see some benefits from the vaccine mandate besides stemming the tide of new Covid cases. For one it could limit the number of workers that call out sick because they tested positive or came into contact with someone who did. Niccol for example told the Washington Post that the burrito chain is seeing more workers miss shifts due to the delta variant although the burrito chain won't implement a company-wide vaccine mandate until the vaccines receive final approval from regulators.

The mandate could also encourage some consumers who have been reluctant to return to restaurants to dine indoors again. Le Bernadin chef Eric Ripert said Thursday on CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange"" that his restaurant's existing vaccination policy has made customers feel relieved and safe rather than alienating them.

""It's a very big difference between what we see on social media and the reality of what's happening with the business"" he said.",,,,,,

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vcmVsaWdpb24vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9sZHMtd29tZW4tY2h1cmNoLWxlYWRlcnMtd2hlbi1kaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LDS women push back — again — against an address delivered by a Relief Society leader,"(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints explained that even though she worked outside the home her priority has always been motherhood.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 100 tires left on church property as vandals strike again,"We’re Sorry!

Most of the people who signed up to testify addressed resolutions that would add people to the official church calendar. Because the calendar often known as Lesser Feasts and Fasts is considered part of the Book of Common Prayer any changes require action by two consecutive General Conventions.

Resolution C021 would affirm a second reading and place Élie Naud on the calendar. Naud was a French Huguenot who came to New York in the 1700s after spending time as a galley slave. He became a member of Trinity Church Wall Street where for 15 years he worked with Black slaves and Native Americans to prepare them for baptism. He later became a member of Église du Saint-Esprit a French-speaking Episcopal parish in New York and he also started a school for poor children and the children of slaves.

St. Esprit’s rector the Rev. Nigel Massey who has served the church for 30 years spoke in favor of the resolution. Early in his tenure serving the church he read a former rector’s history of the parish and was struck by a sentence that has stayed with him ever since: “Our church can claim at least one who in another community would have been canonized as a confessor and missionary the saintly Élie Naud slave and servant of slaves.”

Parishioners Wendy Range and Joris Burmann also supported the resolution. Range described how the church annually commemorates Naud’s death on Sept. 7 with prayers in French and English at his grave in the Trinity Church Wall Street’s churchyard. Burmann who also is a postulant for Holy Orders in the Diocese of New York said Naud could serve as “an ecumenical bridge” both for individuals and for churches since many people have been members of other denominations before finding The Episcopal Church

Four people three from the Diocese of Hawai’i spoke in favor of A124 which would approve on first reading the addition of Liliʻuokalani of Hawai’i to the calendar. A confirmed member of the Cathedral of St. Andrew in Honolulu she was queen of the Hawai’ian Kingdom when her government was overthrown in 1893 by forces backed by the U.S. Navy. With her people facing such overwhelming force she chose not to fight to hold her crown and urged her people to respect her decision. She later was imprisoned.

The Rev. Steve Costa archdeacon of the Diocese of Hawai’i said that through her selfless service to her people and her surrender to prevent the deaths of others “she personified the beloved community long before we even thought of these things.” He also noted that Liliʻuokalani had composed what is known as the Queen’s Prayer or Ke Aloha o Ka Haku which still is sung by almost every church in Hawai’i on Sundays.

Two other Hawai’i deputies Mary Carpenter and Ryan Kusumoto also spoke in favor with Carpenter calling Liliʻuokalani “a model of the living native Hawaiian spirit for most of us Indigenous Pacifica people” while Kusumoto praised her selflessness in saving her people at the cost of her crown. “She stood down so her people could stand up” he said. “If she did not surrender to the American militant colonizers there may not be native Hawaiians here today.”

House of Deputies Vice President the Rev. Rachel Taber-Hamilton a member of Shacken First Nation said that recognizing Liliʻuokalani would be an important part of “the church’s overall commitment to reparation and reconciliation with the Indigenous peoples of every land in which our church had a part in weaponizing theology to justify genocide.”

The commemoration of Howard Thurman a Black pastor educator theologian and civil rights leader on first reading was proposed in C011 by the Diocese of California and in C012 by the Diocese of Northern California. The two resolutions differ only slightly in their language and Northern California deputy the Rev. James Richardson spoke in favor of both. The explanation accompanying each one describes well his “biography and influence on the civil rights movement which was enormous and the reasons for adding him to the calendar” Richardson said. He noted that while about 300 people currently are commemorated in The Episcopal Church’s calendar only about a dozen are African American and fewer still are African American theologians.

Thoma Lipartiani from the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe joined the meeting from the Republic of Georgia to support Resolution C020 adding Ilia Chavchavadze of Georgia on first reading. He described Chavchavadze as a public figure journalist publisher writer poet and human rights activist “who united Georgian society around three cornerstones of our nation – language homeland faith.” Chavchavadze was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1987 according to information provided with the resolution.

Turning to matters of liturgy James Frazer a member of St. Stephen and the Incarnation in Washington D.C. suggested a variety of changes to Resolution A114 which would authorize two expansive language versions of the Book of Common Prayer’s Eucharistic Prayer C. Frazer offered some changes in and reorganization of some proposed wording.

Deputies committee chair the Ven. Stannard Baker of Vermont asked Marty Wheeler Burnett associate professor of church music and director of chapel music at Virginia Theological Seminary to speak about two resolutions dealing with hymns and hymn texts – A130 and A131.

Burnett who also is a member of the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music said that A130 came out of a 2022 General Convention resolution mandating the commission to examine colonialist racist white supremacist imperialistic and nationalistic language in hymns. Focus groups since then have shown “widespread interest in and need for alternative versions of problematic texts” she said.

The resolution calls on the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music to develop and for Church Publishing Incorporated to publish a digital collection of alternative versions of hymn texts that congregations could use with permission of the diocesan bishop. Burnett noted that copyrights can be an issue on all hymn texts and any that the commission would include in this new collection would have permissions secured as needed.

She also spoke in favor of A131 which calls on the commission to develop a new supplement to the Hymnal 1982. “It has been 20 years since The Episcopal Church published a hymnal supplement and much has happened in 20 years” she said. “It is time.” Current hymnal supplements are Wonder Love and Praise (1997) and Voices Found (2003).

Among the resolutions that drew no testimony were second readings authorizing calendar additions of the consecration of Barbara Harris; Harriet Tubman; Simeon Bachos the Ethiopian eunuch; and Frederick Howden Jr.

Action will be taken on all these resolutions at a future meeting. They then will be considered by the 81st General Convention when it meets in Louisville Kentucky June 23-28.

Istilah cinta dan sayang seringkali diartikan sama karena keduanya mempunyai makna yang spesial. Penggunaannya dalam bahasa yang bebas dan cair membuat batasan arti keduanya menjadi kabur.

Sebenarnya ada penjelasan bahwa perbedaan cinta dan sayang ini cukup kontras dan kurang tepat untuk disamakan penggunaannya.

Lalu apa definisi sebenarnya dari cinta dan sayang serta di mana letak perbedaan dari kedua kata istimewa tersebut? Berikut penjelasannya.

Definisi Cinta

Seorang pakar psikologi Zick Rubin menjelaskan bahwa cinta merupakan sebuah emosi yang terbentuk dari tiga perasaan yaitu perhatian kasih sayang dan keintiman.

ADVERTISEMENT

Sementara menurut kamus Merriam-Webster definisi cinta berarti rasa sayang yang konstan dan ditunjukkan bagi seseorang.

Makna cinta berdasarkan hierarki emosi dan perasaan disebut memiliki kedudukan di atas rasa sayang. Sebab prosesnya seperti investasi yaitu dipupuk dari rasa suka kemudian berkembang menjadi rasa cinta.



Definisi Sayang

Definisi sayang menurut kamus Oxford adalah sebuah perasaan lembut berbalut ketulusan atau tidak mengharapkan balasan.

Pakar percintaan Monica Parikh menuturkan bahwa makna sayang lebih merujuk pada rasa ikhlas karena proses menyayangi ini umumnya didasari logika serta naluri.

Sayang termasuk bentuk respons dari dalam diri seseorang untuk menunjukkan empati peduli perhatian dan rasa ingin melindungi.

Sifat dari sayang cenderung umum dan dapat diberikan kepada siapa saja tidak terpaku hanya ke satu orang.

Perbedaan Cinta dan Sayang

Ilustrasi. Perbedaan cinta dan sayang. (Foto: Pixabay/Picography) Ilustrasi. Perbedaan cinta dan sayang. (Foto: Pixabay/Picography)

Dari penjelasan di atas tentu sudah terlihat perbedaan cinta dan sayang itu memang nyata adanya.

Cinta

Cinta lebih tertuju bagi sosok yang istimewa dan erat kaitanya dengan hal romantis seperti pada lawan jenis (pasangan).

Contoh analoginya Anda tidak mungkin mencintai seseorang jika tidak ada rasa suka dan interaksi yang dibangun.

Beda cerita jika sebelumnya telah memperlihatkan antusias ke lawan jenis lalu berinteraksi atau istilahnya saling berinvestasi maka di situlah tumbuh rasa cinta.

Dengan begitu apabila Anda mencintai seseorang maka sudah dipastikan akan menyayanginya. Karena pada dasarnya cinta termasuk suatu kebutuhan.

Sehingga tidak heran ada istilah 'investasi' karena maksudnya untuk saling memberi dan menerima supaya rasa cinta tersebut terpelihara.

Sayang

Sayang didefinisikan pada ketulusan karena memang lebih tepatnya kepada orang tua keluarga atau teman.

Contoh analoginya kasih sayang yang dicurahkan seorang ibu untuk anak-anaknya yang tanpa pamrih atau tidak mengharapkan balasan.

Atau ketika memiliki teman dekat sedari kecil dan sering bersama sampai dewasa itu bisa tumbuh rasa sayang yang dianggap seperti keluarga sendiri.

Apabila menyayangi seseorang maka belum tentu mencintainya. Tapi sudah pasti memiliki rasa peduli tulus serta ingin melindungi.

Selain itu rasa sayang ini tumbuhnya secara alami. Bahkan seringkali tidak terbatas oleh waktu dan keadaan.

Perbedaan cinta dan sayang lainnya yaitu kalau cinta harus dimiliki sedangkan sayang membuat Anda selalu ingin memastikan bahwa ia baik-baik saja.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9oeXBlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbWFsbWFsL3BvdHJldC1wZW1lcmFuLWtldGlrYS1jaW50YS1iZXJ0YXNiaWgtYzFjMtIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9oeXBlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYW1wL21hbG1hbC9wb3RyZXQtcGVtZXJhbi1rZXRpa2EtY2ludGEtYmVydGFzYmloLWMxYzI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lebih Satu Dekade Potret Pemeran Ketika Cinta Bertasbih,"Follow IDN Times untuk mendapatkan informasi terkini.

The deal is estimated to be in the region of $500 million with co-founders Nitzan Shapira and Ran Ribenzaft both Israeli military intelligence veterans taking their company to that valuation within just four years. The deal first reported by Calcalist  will turn most of Epsagon's employees into millionaires.

Prior to reaching the agreement with Cisco Epsagon was in the midst of closing a Series B funding round reaching tens of millions of dollars at a $200 million valuation. Ultimately Epsagon decided to accept Cisco's offer instead due to the global impact it will be able to make as part of an international corporation and as it will also result in many of the company's employees receiving millions of dollars for the sale of their share options.

Epsagon develops software-as-a-service (SaaS) automated end-to-end monitoring technologies for serverless cloud-based systems specializing in monitoring and tracing for microservices and cloud-based applications. Serverless cloud-based systems are highly decentralized and event-driven making it difficult to identify potential performance issues. Epsagon’s software uses artificial intelligence to predict and troubleshoot such issues.

Epsagon has raised just $30 million to date over three funding rounds from backers including DTCP Lightspeed Venture Partners USVP and StageOne Ventures. The VCs that invested in Epsagon are set to make a return of at least 10 times their investment.

The company currently employs 60 people 35 of them in Israel and the rest in its New York offices. Epsagon serves hundreds of clients including giant companies like Deloitte and Toyota. The company's R&D center in Israel is expected to expand significantly following the acquisition.

This will be Cisco's second acquisition in Israel within three months after it purchased Sedona for an estimated $100 million in May.

""Epsagon's technology and talent align well with Cisco's vision to enable enterprises to deliver unmatched application experiences through industry-leading solutions with deep business context"" Liz Centoni Cisco's Chief Strategy Officer and GM of Applications wrote in a blog post. ""By contextualizing and correlating visibility and insights across the full stack teams can improve collaboration to better understand their systems solve issues quickly optimize and secure application experiences and delight their customers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZW4uZ2xvYmVzLmNvLmlsL2VuL2FydGljbGUtY2lzY28tY29uZmlybXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tb2YtaXNyYWVsaS1zdGFydHVwLWVwc2Fnb24tMTAwMTM4MTcxONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco confirms acquisition of Israeli startup Epsagon,"US tech giant Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO) has confirmed Friday's report in ""Globes"" that it is to acquire Israeli application monitoring company Epsagon. No financial details were disclosed but sources close to the matter said that Cisco will be paying $500 million.

Cisco EVP chief strategy officer and GM applications Liz Centoni said "" I’m pleased to announce our intent to acquire Epsagon Ltd. a privately held modern observability company with offices in New York and Tel Aviv.

She added ""Epsagon’s technology and talent align well with Cisco’s vision to enable enterprises to deliver unmatched application experiences through industry-leading solutions with deep business context. By contextualizing and correlating visibility and insights across the full stack teams can improve collaboration to better understand their systems solve issues quickly optimize and secure application experiences and delight their customers. When the acquisition closes the Epsagon team will join our Strategy Incubation and Applications group.""

Epsagon was founded by CEO Nitzan Shapira and CTO Ran Ribenzaft. According to PitchBook the company has raised $30 million probably at a company valuation of between $100 and $200 million and has thus succeeded in increasing its valuation up to five-fold in just the 18 month since completing in most recent financing round. Investors include US Venture Partners (USVP) Lightspeed Venture Partners and Stage One Ventures.

Epsagon provides an end-to-end monitoring solution that enables DevOps and engineering teams to monitor visualize troubleshoot and quickly fix their cloud applications across any type of microservice - containers Kubernetes or serverless workloads. Epsagon's technology is fully automated for modern environments where the host may not be accessible which makes traditional monitoring agents obsolete.

Epsagon has tripled its work force over the past year to 60. The company has been undergoing rapid growth including in its number of customers which include major corporations and Israel startups coping with vast amounts of data.

But out of those hardships important lessons — and future possibilities — have emerged.

In a Q&A interview education futurist and NPR commentator Anya Kamenetz discussed how this new hybrid learning model is evolving. Along with her vision of how innovative technology and teaching can usher in an era of education that’s more flexible inclusive and creative than ever before.

Q. The pandemic forced an abrupt massive shift to online learning. What are some of the successes and shortcomings from the past year and a half that you would highlight?

A. Without the pandemic we would not have seen such a swift movement into remote learning. And it has been an incredible learning experience. It was a shift in mindset for so many educators and there were many frustrations along the way. But I think that there’s some pride amongst teachers as they look back. They had to reinvent everything about what they were doing in such a short period of time.

Q. And what are some of the positives for children?

A. On the student’s side there was an incredible amount of new choice in how they learned. Also the building of bridges between home and school has been an important goal in education for decades but now it’s happening in a completely different way. Parents just gained so much insight into their children as learners.

Q. Teacher burnout is one downside to remote learning that you have addressed. Can a collaboration platform like Webex lessen the stress on teachers and students moving forward?

A. Having better technology in a more seamless integrated platform removes a lot of the grief. Teachers never intended to be IT professionals so having something where you click the link and it works it’s secure and all the tools are right there reduces friction and exhaustion.

But burnout also comes from feeling like you’re not being effective and many teachers felt ineffective partly because their students were having such emotional and social struggles. In a wider sense there’s a whole societal effort needed here. You need to have services for parents for families you need to address housing healthcare and employment. And only then do you have children showing up ready to learn.

Q. Speaking of societal challenges the digital divide is one of the many inequalities that have been exposed by the pandemic. How can we close it for students?

A. Never waste a crisis. People in the education space have been talking about the digital divide and the homework gap for a decade but now suddenly it’s top of mind. There’s dedicated federal money coming both from infrastructure investments and from the education department to schools. But schools obviously can’t solve this on their own.

Q. The hybrid model combining in-class and virtual offers some great advantages like supporting individualized learning. Can that address learning differences and neurodiversity?

A. An individualized education plan is something every student wants. But the special education movement is fascinating in terms of how it uses new technologies with high expectations and support to help children reach their goals. So yeah that’s an area that I’m excited about as far as the new bars that are being set and the innovation that’s continuing to happen. I just see so many innovative educators out there who are sharing new resources and innovations.

Q. Moving forward do you see a shift in the fundamentals of how we learn? And how does hybrid learning support that?

A. Knowledge is important of course. But equally important we want students to have ways of thinking and seeing that inform the kinds of questions they’re asking and the types of people that they’re aspiring to be. We’re seeing the importance of social justice in our schools of inclusivity. So how do we have a values-based education that’s creative innovative and individualistic but with a sense of shared purpose?

Technology can help. But even before the pandemic children had more hours in the day spent on media than spent in school. A big part of hybrid education will be to help children understand what’s good information and what isn’t and to question what they’re hearing. As well as how to become lifelong learners.

Q. Do you see new trends in education arising out of emerging technologies like 5G AI virtual and augmented reality?

A. Absolutely across the board! There’s a lot of great experimentation in VR for example to capture the benefits of in-person education in a virtual setting including field trips and labs. And it’s only going to accelerate. With the advent of broadband and the mobile revolution the experience of online learning became entirely different. Mobile plus broadband gave us the MOOC with open online courses. I expect that 5G is going to up that game. Video making is as natural to my 9-year-old as writing an essay or a text. I can only imagine what kinds of presentations she’ll be making when she’s older. There’s another whole language that children are expressing themselves in that could be augmented in a 5G world.

Q. Any final thoughts on what you see for hybrid education moving forward post pandemic?

A. Right now kids just need to reconnect with school. They need to love school and they need school to be fun again. That needs to be the focus instead of just intensively drilling kids so they can catch up. We need to take the long view. Because we can’t have kids kicked off course especially teenagers who are frankly the most endangered group. And the technology can help. Anywhere anytime education is not going away. So as long as the technology is seamless and simple to use teachers and students will have the sense of security that they can connect and learn in innovative ways.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMzU1Mjk1LzVnLXNlcnZpY2VzLW1hcmtldC1uZXh0LWJpZy10aGluZy1tYWpvci1naWFudHMtcXVhbGNvbW0tY2lzY2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5G Services Market Next Big Thing : Major Giants Qualcomm Cisco Systems Samsung Electronics,"5G Services Market Next Big Thing : Major Giants Qualcomm Cisco Systems Samsung Electronics

Head coach Andreas Aguirre welcomes back 24 of 34 lettermen from last year’s 8-3 playoff squad including five offensive and four defensive starters

After a runner-up finish in District 4-2A Division I the Armadillos are projected by Dave Campbell’s Texas Football to again finish behind Cisco in the league race. San Saba is expected to place in front of Coleman Winters Goldthwaite and De Leon.

“Our culture is strong we’ve got a great coaching staff and a great group of kids. We lost a strong senior class but they’ve been saying that the last three years” Aguirre said. “These kids are winners they’ve been through it they love what it tastes like what it feels like to win ball games. We have high expectations around here high expectations for this coaching staff for these kids and myself.”

Among the players to watch for San Saba are DCTF District 4-2A Division I preseason defensive player of the year WR/DB Reagan Mejia who plays cornerback and receiver RB Wesley Lackey WR/DB Drake Bryant DB Franco Franco OL Leonel Aranda QB Lance Taylor OL/DL Christian Ramirez and WR/LB Tyler Johnson.

“We have Reagan Mejia he’s a six-sport athlete” Aguirre said. “He’s going to be holding it down at the corner position. Franco Franco will be at the other corner. We have Lance Taylor running our quarterback position. We have a plethora of skill guys. We’ve got some big guys coming back like Christian Ramirez and Leonel Aranda who are holding down the lines. I’m excited about the kids we’re having back this year.”

Among the greatest strengths for the Armadillos according to Aguirre is the team camaraderie.

“It’s unreal” Aguirre said. “They hang out together they listen to music together they go hunting together they fish together they eat together they hang out in the locker room together. It’s crazy to the see the camaraderie this group has around here. We just have to execute and be able to execute when times get tough and battle adversity. These kids have a played a lot of meaningful snaps a lot of ball games but I want to see what they do as a group.”

San Saba opens the season against Eldorado Rogers Mason Llano and Dublin which will provide stern tests ahead of the 4-2A Division I slate.

“It’s going to be tough” Aguirre said. “I just want to see us play as hard as we can one play at a time. I’m not worried about the next game or the last game or district the playoffs or whatever I just want to see us to continue to get better every day.”

Once district begins San Saba will tangle with Goldthwaite in Brownwood on Thursday Oct. 7 followed by Winters De Leon Coleman and Cisco.

“It’s a great group of coaches and the teams are well-coached with great cultures” Aguirre said. “It’s going to be a battle and we just want to be there in the end.”

After playing 40 games the past three seasons Aguirre said when asked how good this San Saba team can be “The sky’s the limit with this group. We just have to continue to stay together when the times get tough and keep battling and moving forward and I think we’ll be in it in the end.”

It appears that the beloved mascot is safe from extinction at Citizens Bank Park for now.

The franchise has a legal right to continue using the modified version of the Galapagos Island native amid an ongoing copyright dispute with the mascot's creators a federal magistrate judge in New York recommended in a 91-page report issued Tuesday.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn said that the ball club's modifications to the Phillie Phanatic were enough to protect it under the Copyright Act's Derivative Works Exception which allows a copyright holder to continue using amended versions even when said rights no longer exist.

""To be sure the changes to the structural shape of the Phanatic are no great strokes of brilliance but as the Supreme Court has already noted a compilation of minimally creative elements 'no matter how crude humble or obvious' can render a work a derivative"" Netburn wrote.

Netburn broke down the difference between the original and updated Phillie Phanatic.

""P2 has pink star-shaped eyelashes light blue eyebrows round eyes oval pupils a cylindrical snout (that is one that is the same diameter the whole way across) 'wing tips' on its arms and a blue-tipped 'duck butt'"" Netburn wrote. ""P1 for its part has scalloped-shaped eyelashes dark blue eyebrows oval or egg-shaped eyes a ‘'megaphone'-shaped snout no wing tips and a dark blue tail that comes to a smaller point.""

Netburn also said that Harrison/Erickson Inc. should be allowed to reclaim the copyrights to the original Phillie Phanatic and prevent the team from challenging the legitimacy of those rights.

Both sides can object to the report but the Phillies appear satisfied with Netburn's recommendation.

""We are pleased that Judge Netburn agreed with us that the redesigned Phanatic and related artwork are derivative works that the Club can continue to utilize under the Copyright statute"" Phillies attorney David J. Wolfsohn told the Inquirer.

The report now goes before Senior U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero who is presiding over the case.

The two-year-long copyright dispute began in August 2019 when the Phillies filed a lawsuit to keep the Phillie Phanatic as the team's mascot after the New York-based company sent the franchise a notice of termination in June 2018.

The notice of termination claimed that Bonnie Erickson and Wayde Harrison created the copyrighted character and had the right to end the contract if both parties didn't reach a new agreement by June 2020. Artists are permitted by federal law to renegotiate their rights after 35 years.

The Phillies argued that a 1984 renegotiation with the company transferred the rights ""forever."" The team also pointed to its role in creating the costume character and personality of the Phillie Phanatic.

A new modified Phillie Phanatic was unveiled by the team during spring training last year in order to bring the company's legal argument to a close.

The updated features included new shoes and socks different shades of green scales underneath the arms a new nose a shortened and reshaped snout a longer tail and new-looking eyes. The modified Phanatic is also noticeably lighter in weight than the original one.

The mascot's creators issued a statement last year blasting the team's updated Phanatic calling the changes ""an affront to our intellectual property rights.""

Harrison/Erickson was hired in the 1970s by the Phillies to create the Phanatic which debuted at Veterans Stadium in April 1978. The company is also known for its work with the Muppets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpbmlkYWRleHByZXNzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9sb2NhbC9iYXJpdGEtcy1wcm9maXQtanVtcHMtODMvYXJ0aWNsZV82Mzk2OGFjMi1mZTIyLTExZWItYjQwZC0xZjdiNzJjMGYwNDcuaHRtbNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpbmlkYWRleHByZXNzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9sb2NhbC9iYXJpdGEtcy1wcm9maXQtanVtcHMtODMvYXJ0aWNsZV82Mzk2OGFjMi1mZTIyLTExZWItYjQwZC0xZjdiNzJjMGYwNDcuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barita’s profit jumps 83%,"THE distance between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago as well as the route it has to take through Venezuela’s territorial waters are two major obstacles hindering the construction of a natural gas pipeline to export gas from Guyana to T&T ExxonMobil’s country manager Alistair Routledge has said.

Nick Castellanos and manager David Bell were ejected in the first inning after Castellanos disagreed with a called third strike. Jesse Winker who missed the last two games exited in the third inning with an injury. Starting pitcher Sonny Gray lasted only 4 2/3 innings.

It didn’t stop them from winning a series against the Philadelphia Phillies earning a 7-4 victory at Citizens Bank Park on Sunday. The Reds finished their road trip with a 3-4 record but they ended on a high note by taking two of three games from a playoff hopeful.

'I feel like a different person':Reds' Sean Doolittle found more velocity midseason

There were contributions up and down the roster. Jonathan India scored three runs. Shogo Akiyama hit a two-run double. Tyler Stephenson hit a pinch-hit two-run homer. The bullpen kept pitching out of jams.

""This has team win written all over it"" Gray said. ""This took everyone on the roster. This took everyone outside of the roster. I mean this took the entire traveling party to come away with this one.""

The Reds were clinging to a one-run lead before the bottom of the lineup provided some breathing room in the eighth inning. Tucker Barnhart was gifted an extra strike and made it count with an RBI double into the right-field corner. Stephenson followed his two-run homer his fourth pinch-hit homer of the season and his third straight game with a homer.

Despite playing without a couple of All-Stars for most of the afternoon the Reds could count on production from their rookies.

""We’ve been talking about it all year this is awesome"" India said. ""I’m so happy for (Stephenson). He doesn’t play every day. For him to step up like that it’s hard to pinch-hit like that and he does it a lot. He always steps up in big situations for us.""

Castellanos received a quick hook after he disagreed with a pair of called strikes in his first-inning strikeout. Castellanos turned to home-plate umpire Sean Barber after the final pitch was called a strike off the outside corner and he was ejected within five seconds.

Bell ran out of the dugout once Castellanos turned to face Barber but he was too late to prevent an ejection. An animated Bell aired out his grievances for about 30 seconds before crew chief Alan Porter ejected him too.

Winker felt his intercostal strain when he flew out to right field in the third inning replaced by Aristides Aquino . He will be re-evaluated Monday in Cincinnati.

""We've been challenged a lot to this point"" Bell said. ""I know I've said this a lot and I can't say it enough: Just really proud of how our team responds to the challenges when it gets tough.""

India continues to spark the Reds lineup. He hammered a solo homer on the third pitch of the afternoon from Phillies starter Aaron Nola pulling an elevated 94-mph fastball over the left-field fence.

It was India’s fourth career leadoff homer.

Gray and India hit back-to-back singles in the third inning. Akiyama in the lineup after Castellanos’ ejection saw four consecutive pitches off the outside corner. He lined the fourth one down the left-field line for a two-run double.

India scored from first base beating a throw to the plate with a headfirst slide. India pumped his right fist a few times once the umpire ruled him safe.

""I mean in my mind the first two strikes that they called were obvious balls to me but there was no way to know that for sure during the at-bat"" Akiyama said according to interpreter Luke Shinoda. ""I just got closer to the plate. The last ball I hit was a ball as well.""

India added one more run in the fifth inning. He led off with a single and scored on a bases-loaded walk to Tyler Naquin. He leads the league in runs (54) since he was moved to the leadoff spot on June 5.

""We talk about our team responding and it’s a team effort and many guys are responsible for that but I also think Jonathan in some ways sets a tone"" Bell said. ""He had a couple games where he didn’t get a hit which is no big deal but at the same time to be able to bounce back from that and have a game like he did today just continues to show us what he can do and how valuable and how important he is to our team.""

Gray permitted four hits and three runs in 4 2/3 innings striking out two and walking three.

The Phillies loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the fifth inning for the middle of their lineup. Bryce Harper had an eight-pitch battle with Gray with most of the 28544 fans rising to their feet when it became a full count and booing when Gray stepped off the rubber to run through another set of signs with the catcher.

Harper drew a walk after fouling four pitches and Didi Gregorius followed with a sacrifice fly cutting Philadelphia’s deficit to one run. That ended Gray’s afternoon after 78 pitches but reliever Lucas Sims stranded two runners by striking out Andrew McCutchen with a slider.

""This day clearly wasn't about me"" Gray said. ""It was about timely hitting. It was about our bullpen coming in and shutting the door and giving us what 4 1/3 really quality innings. It was about everyone picking each other up. This was a complete team win.""

The Phillies had the tying run at the plate in the eighth inning after three two-out hits against Luis Cessa. Mychal Givens pitched out of it inducing a flyout on his second pitch and he earned a four-out save."

""Right now I feel like it's so much better than what I expected because starting this week I had so many things to work on and I was not really feel comfortable with my game"" Jutanugarn said. ""So right now I feel like it's much better than what I thought so there's nothing to lose tomorrow.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday formally announced the launch of a National Hydrogen Mission to accelerate plans to generate the carbon-free fuel from renewables as he set a target of 2047 for India to achieve self-reliance in energy.Delivering his Independence Day address from the ramparts of the Red Fort he said India can achieve self-reliance in energy through a mix of a gas-based economy doping sugarcane extracted ethanol in petrol and electric mobility.India he said spends over Rs 12 lakh crore on energy imports every year.While India is 85 per cent dependent on imports for meeting its oil needs overseas supplies make up for roughly half of the local requirement for natural gas.""For India to progress for Atmanirbhar Bharat energy independence is necessary"" he said. ""India has to take a pledge that it will be energy independent by the year we celebrate 100th year of Independence.""The roadmap for that is to increase usage of natural gas in the economy setting up a network for supply of CNG and piped natural gas across the country blending 20 per cent ethanol in petrol and electric mobility he said.The country has achieved the target of 100 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity ahead of the target Modi added.""I announce National Hydrogen Mission"" he said.The target is to make India a global hub for production as well as export of green hydrogen. ""Green hydrogen will give India a quantum jump in achieving its targets"" he asserted.The National Hydrogen Mission was first announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22 in February this year.Hydrogen is produced predominantly through Steam Methane Reforming or SMR which utilises fossils fuels such as natural gas or coal and through Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using a current of electricity.Currently all hydrogen consumed in India comes from fossil fuels. By 2050 three-fourth of all hydrogen is projected to be green -- produced by renewable electricity and electrolysis.Speaking at the 'Urja Sangam' conference in March 2015 Prime Minister Modi had set a target of cutting India's oil import dependence from 77 per cent in 2013-14 to 67 per cent by 2022. Import dependence has however only increased.The government is now looking at substituting some oil by one that is produced from sugarcane and other bio-materials. It is looking to supply petrol mixed with 20 per cent ethanol by 2023-24 up from the current 8 per cent.Also the government is looking at raising the share of natural gas in the economy to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current 6.2 per cent.On Sunday Modi said the roadmap for making India self-reliant in energy is clear -- ""promoting a gas-based economy a pan-India network of CNG and piped natural gas and achieving 20 per cent ethanol blending target.""""India has also moved towards electric mobility"" he said.While electric vehicles gain currency Indian Railways is also moving towards 100 per cent electrification.Out of the target of setting up 450 gigawatts of electricity generation capacity from renewable sources by 2030 India has already achieved 100 GW ahead of schedule he said.In line with the government's focus on hydrogen both private and public sector companies have announced ambitious hydrogen projects.While Reliance Industries and Adani Group are pushing ahead with their plans to make hydrogen a part of their portfolio the nation's biggest state-run refiner IOC has also unveiled hydrogen plans.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is working on technology to develop hydrogen-spiked compressed natural gas or H-CNG.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9zanZuLWJhZ3MtMjAwLW13LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLXByb2plY3Qtd29ydGgtcnMtMTAwMC1jcm9yZS1pbi1iaWhhci9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTMyNzkzMS5jbXPSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L3JlbmV3YWJsZXMvc2p2bi1iYWdzLTIwMC1tdy1zb2xhci1wb3dlci1wcm9qZWN0LXdvcnRoLXJzLTEwMDAtY3JvcmUtaW4tYmloYXIvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1MzI3OTMxLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SJVN bags 200 MW solar power project worth Rs 1000 crore in Bihar,"

State-run SJVN Ltd on Saturday announced that it has bagged 200 MW grid connected solar PV power project worth Rs 1000 crore in Bihar . SJVN chairman and managing director Nand Lal Sharma said in a statement that SJVN Ltd bagged the project through Open Competitive Tariff Bidding Process for quoted capacity of 200 MW Rs 3.11/unit on Build Own and Operate (BOO) basis during e-reverse auction held on August 13 2021.SJVN participated in tariff-based competitive bidding process for solar project of capacity 200 MW floated by Bihar Renewable Energy Development Agency (BREDA) wherein three other bidders also participated.He further informed that the tentative cost of construction and development of this project is Rs 1000 crore.The project is expected to generate 420.48 MU (million units) in the 1st year and the project cumulative energy generation over a period of 25 years would be about 10512 MU.The PPA shall be signed between BREDA and SJVN for 25 years.Sharma also told that presently SJVN has a total installed capacity of 2016.5 MW which includes two hydro power plants of 1912 MW and four renewable power plants of 104.5 MW (two solar plants of 6.9 MW and 2 wind plants of 97.6 MW).Earlier SJVN bagged two solar projects totalling 145 MW in the state of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Both these solar projects have also been bagged through open competitive bidding.With this recent allotment of 200 MW SJVN now has 345 MW of solar projects under execution.He stated that all these solar projects are scheduled to be commissioned by March 2022 which shall be a gigantic leap for SJVN's renewable capacity.The Government of India has envisaged the vision of Power to All 24X7 and has set a target of 175 GW of renewables  out of which 100 GW is to be met through solar by 2022.In September last year at the United Nations Climate Action Summit Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced increasing the renewable energy target to 450 GW by 2030 from 175 GW by 2022.In line with the target set by the Government of India SJVN has set its shared vision of capacity addition of 5000 MW by 2023 12000 MW by 2030 and 25000 MW by 2040.",,,,,,

Acquiring CCBCE will allow HBC to accelerate its growth in Egypt which the statement described as “the second largest non-alcoholic ready-to-drink market [in Africa] by volume.” Coca-Cola HBC’s presence in 28 markets globally would bring CCBCE greater opportunities to innovate for efficiency and maximize growth it added.

The transaction follows a strong six months for HBC which on the same day reported net income of USD 233.1 mn in 1H2021 an 88% jump from the same period last year. The company attributed the bottom line growth to a pickup in revenues (+23%) on the back of improving market share.

Leading a massive corporation may seem like a dream to many but with great power comes great responsibility. Huge decisions inevitably have huge consequences so even one word entered carelessly into a computer could bring reputation and profits crashing down in an instant.

Of course the stress of industry titans is likely to be considerably offset by the big bucks that executives are known to earn. An analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies showed the average annual pay for executives who helm some of America's biggest brands was $15.3 million in 2020 (via The Guardian). The research also found ordinary workers for the same companies earned a yearly average of $28187.

All that money does create problems of its own such as what to do with the gallons of champagne that require drinking on a daily basis. That could well be less of a problem for the CEO of Coca-Cola James Quincey who is known to be a major fan of Coke Zero (via The Coca-Cola Company). Not that Quincey is in any way short of cash – he receives a multi-million-dollar paycheck every year (via Food Dive).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY2xhc3NpYy1zb2RhLWJyYW5kcy11cGRhdGluZy1mb3JtdWxhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Classic Soda Brands That Are Updating Their Formulas Right Now,"Without even thinking about it you count on your favorite beverage to consistently deliver the flavor you crave.

4 Major Coca-Cola Brand Changes…

Recently Coca-Cola's been making some major shifts perhaps most notably in the form of discontinuations. In the spring the Coca-Cola Company announced the discontinuation of Coke Energy. This had been preceded by last fall's news that for the first time since 1963 Coca-Cola will no longer make Tab; nor are they continuing production of Odwalla juices and smoothies or Zico coconut water.

It's been reported that the shuttering of Coca-Cola's quieter-performing brands is due in large part to James Quincey the Coca-Cola Company's CEO since 2016 and chairman of the board since 2019 and his desire for aggressive investment in business development strategies and progressive corporate social responsibility initiatives like recycling.

It opens with a cocky teenager donning a Pepsi shirt. The text “T-SHIRT 75 PEPSI POINTS” appears to the beat of a military drum line.

Said teen then swaggers through a door in a leather jacket (“LEATHER JACKET 1450 PEPSI POINTS”) and flips on a pair of blue-tinted sunglasses (“SHADES 175 PEPSI POINTS”).

The narrator chimes in — “The more Pepsi you drink the more great stuff you’re gonna get!” — and the scene shifts to the teen landing a computer-generated Harrier fighter jet in front of his high school blowing the clothes off a bewildered principal in the parking lot.

“HARRIER FIGHTER … 7000000 PEPSI POINTS” flashes across the screen as the music crescendos into a fade-out.

The commercial was the national debut of a promotion called Pepsi Stuff.

It was per The New York Times the “largest promotional campaign in the company’s history” — one that Pepsi hoped would steal market share from Coca-Cola at the tail end of the decades-long Cola Wars.

In total this promotion cost Pepsi an estimated $200m ($350m today) to roll out including $125m worth of merchandise.

Pepsi Stuff worked like so:

Billions of Pepsi products around the US were marked with “Pepsi Points.” A 2-liter bottle of Pepsi was worth 2 points; a 12-pack of cans yielded 5. Customers could save up the points and redeem them for items listed in a Pepsi Stuff catalog. Customers could also purchase Pepsi Points for 10 cents each.

The catalog included 53 items in total — most of which were your run-of-the-mill corporate swag: T-shirts hats and beach towels.

The Hustle

Notably absent from this list of items was the Harrier fighter jet.

Most of the kids who saw the commercial — members of the so-called “Pepsi Generation” a new class of youthful consumers who cared more about lifestyle than brands — figured that the jet was part of Pepsi’s zany sense of humor and not a real prize.

But in Seattle Washington a young man named John Leonard wasn’t laughing.

I’ll take the jet

Leonard first saw the commercial during a Pacific Northwest test run in February of 1996.

Then a 21-year-old business student at Shoreline Community College he saw the Harrier jet as a legitimate offer — and sniffed an opportunity for promotional arbitrage.

He knew from an interest in flying that the Harrier was a US Marine Corps aircraft used extensively in the Gulf War. Capable of taking off vertically and carrying 10k pounds of bombs it had been called the “most captivating and the most dangerous plane in the US military.”

Moreover it cost ~$33m to manufacture and — needless to say — wasn’t available to the general public.

At 7m Pepsi Points the jet was a steal. So he decided to go for it.

Leonard during a CBS interview in 1996 (CBS News via YouTube)

Leonard was a 10-cans-per-day kind of guy.

But even at this high rate of consumption collecting 7m points was a daunting task.

Each 12-pack of Pepsi was worth 5 points meaning he’d have to consume 16.8m cans to reach his mark. That amounted to:

46k cans every day for 1 year

cans every day for 1 year 552k total ounces of Pepsi

total ounces of Pepsi 2.5B calories and 689m grams of sugar

calories and grams of sugar ~$4m in expenditure

Luckily there was a workaround.

The catalog only required participants to submit 15 points they’d collected from cans and bottles; the rest could be bought directly from Pepsi for 10 cents each by mailing in a check.

All Leonard had to do to get 7m points was raise $700k.

Over several months the enterprising college student put together a business plan researched case law on promotional advertisements and convinced several investors — wealthy clients he’d met while working as a climbing guide — to front the cash.

On March 28 1996 he mailed 15 Pepsi Points along with a check for $700008.50 (including shipping) to Pepsi and politely asked for his jet.

Several weeks later Leonard received a reply from Pepsi.

The company returned Leonard’s check threw in some pity coupons and made it clear that the jet in the commercial was purely “fanciful.”

By this point Leonard had already sunk ~$4k into consulting with legal professionals and researching case law on deceptive advertising.

Instead of backing down he secured an attorney and doubled down on his demand:

A mock-up of Leonard’s correspondence with Pepsi (legal proceedings via Justia)

Leonard’s letter made the rounds at PepsiCo and eventually ended up in the hands of BBDO New York the advertising firm Pepsi had retained to create the commercial.

A VP at the firm Raymond E. McGovern Jr. seemed perplexed by Leonard’s persistence.

“I find it hard to believe that you are of the opinion that the Pepsi Stuff commercial really offers a new Harrier Jet” he wrote back. “No reasonable person would agree with your analysis of the commercial.”

So Leonard decided to go to battle for his fighter jet.

A battle in the courts

With the help of counsel Leonard filed suit claiming that Pepsi’s ad had constituted as a binding offer and that the company had breached contract by refusing to exchange 7m Pepsi Points for a Harrier jet.

A flood of news reports followed the filing — and Pepsi made no qualms about publicly sharing its thoughts on the matter.

“Tens of millions of Americans and people around the world saw the spot got the joke and laughed” a PepsiCo spokesman told CBS News. “Mr. Leonard saw the spot hired business advisers and lawyers and decided to take legal action.”

“I didn’t want any publicity on this” Leonard retorted. “I’m not trying to make a statement. I’m not looking for a settlement. I just want a plane.”

In an interview with The Associated Press he reiterated that he was “simply trying to take Pepsi up on an offer it made to the public.”

PepsiCo the parent company of Pepsi beverages was swift to counterattack.

The conglomerate responded with its own suit in New York seeking to recoup $88162 in attorney’s fees and dismiss Leonard’s claims as frivolous without going to trial.

As things often play out in America’s justice system the case turned into a 3-year-long procedural slog before making its way to Judge Kimba Wood of New York’s Southern District Court.

Ultimately the case came down to whether Pepsi’s TV ad constituted a legally binding “offer.”

And on Aug. 5 1999 Judge Wood ruled resoundingly in Pepsi’s favor.

Newspapers around the country followed Leonard’s saga (various news sources; 1999)

The decision came down to 3 key points:

Advertisements are generally not considered offers in contract law: “Ads for the sale of goods (TV radio newspaper newsletter)… are merely the requests to offer or negotiate” and an advertiser must accept an offer from a customer for it to be legally formed. The ad was obviously a joke: An “ordinary reasonable person” would conclude that a soft drink company would not give away a fighter plane as part of a promotion. An enforceable contract requires both parties’ signatures: Under existing law any contract for the sale of goods worth $500+ must be evidenced by writing; Pepsi did not sign anything.

Leonard would not get his jet.

But as a Defense Department spokesman clarified a fully demilitarized jet probably wouldn’t have been much fun anyway.

“Even if the lad were able to get the plane from Pepsi it would not be one he could fly” the official said at a Pentagon briefing.

The aftermath

After mounting an unsuccessful appeal in 2000 Leonard pursued his next adventure.

He moved to Alaska where he became the chief mountaineering ranger at Denali National Park. In recent years he was promoted to the DC Bureau of the National Park Service.

Despite — or perhaps thanks to — the controversial press Pepsi Stuff was a massive success.

The company did not respond to requests to comment on the campaign’s impact. But in 1996 one Pepsi executive called it “by far the most successful promotion” the company had ever run.

After Leonard’s lawsuit was filed the Harrier jet commercial continued to air but with some minor tweaks to drive home the joke.

The points for the jet were increased from 7m to 700m and 2 words were tacked onto the closing text: “just kidding.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHA6Ly9pc2xhbmQubGsvY29jYS1jb2xhLWNsb2Nrcy02MC15ZWFycy1pbi1zcmktbGFua2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola clocks 60 Years in Sri Lanka,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='island.lk', port=443): Read timed out.

The Gamecocks’ head coach stopped by the Tea with A & Phee podcast telling Wilson and Collier she thinks college basketball has changed.

“It’s gotten younger” says Staley “the mentality the maturity level.”

The South Carolina coach blames social media for the shift stating that players today are competing for attention online.

“You know a mature person… a mature player because they stick out.”

Staley says parents are also “more lax” contributing to a generational change in players’ attitudes.

“It’s not a good or bad thing until you run into trying to help them prioritize their time and manage their time.”

This is where Staley thinks the new name image and likeness law could benefit the players and the game.

“I like the fact that we have NIL now because they [the players] have to grow up” Staley tells Wilson and Collier. Staley adds that student-athletes will have to mature and “be a business.”

The NCAA’s reversal on NIL allows athletes to profit off their name image and likeness permitting students to pursue business ventures that use their image for promotion.

“You can’t do the same things that you’ve been doing because [now] you’re a brand.”

She interned during summer 2021 with the RockSol Consulting Group.

Where are you working this summer and what made them stand out in your internship search?

This summer I have been working at RockSol Consulting Group! I knew that I wanted to pursue an internship with RockSol largely because of the company culture. Every employee I talked to raved about the great people they get to work with. During my interview the president made sure I knew that my internship would be largely influenced by my interests; essentially I could choose what projects I would be working on. I knew that RockSol would take great care of me and I would be able to tailor my experience to my interests.

What kinds of projects have you had a chance to work on over the summer?

I have been placed on the Environmental Team on RockSol's I25 South Gap project. The Environmental Team is mainly in charge of erosion control; essentially our job is to ensure all of our construction materials and sediment stays on our project and doesn't discharge onto the private or state property. We conduct inspections of the job site and communicate when our erosion control measures need to be fixed or replaced. My day-to-day consists of inspecting the jobsite and monitoring our subcontractors' work!

Was there a particular problem or challenge that really pushed your engineering skills?​

There has been a problem area on our project that continuously erodes and discharges off of the project so we have had to come up with creative erosion control measures to implement in this area. Our consulting team has had to debate the best way to control the severe erosion in this area while being cognizant of budget and labor. This has pushed my problem-solving skills as well as an my understanding of how land erodes to try to help come up with ways to aid this area.

What advice do you have for other students interested in working or interning in a related field?​

Relationships with coworkers are huge. It is important to work with everyone and do your best to build quality relationships with people you are working with.

Eve’s Bayou Beloved and Their Eyes Were Watching God were probably films I should have actually watched now at this point in my life. I would have appreciated their context more and not been as perplexed as I was when I watched them but regardless they had a huge impact on me.

1. Eve’s Bayou

Eve’s Bayou was the first movie I can recall where voodoo and its practice were introduced to me. Centering on the quest of a child trying to right the wrongs of her father (his infidelity and alleged molestation of his other daughter) troubled me. After Roz receives a reading by Elzora I was so fearful of chicken bones and what future they may tell me that I did not eat bone-in chicken for a while. I also made sure to leave my grooming utensils free of my hair. Aunt Mozelle’s hoodoo practices were also another factor that left me at a quandary but it would be Eve’s gift of sight that piqued my interest. Could dreams really be that significant or were they [dreams] figments of our imagination during our subconscious state? Was Aunt Mozelle cursed as the Black Widow? Was Cisely possessed when she kissed her father? Were the events leading up to Matty Mereaux’s husband Lenny killing Dr. Louis the intentional actions of a spell or were those consequences of a brazen affair? The movie was a bit too much for me to process at the time. However the movie and its ties to African/Caribbean spirituality embedded themselves in my memory.

2. Beloved

I remember hearing Oprah rave about the book Beloved and announcing there would be a movie based on it. My mother made plans for opening day. I was no way involved in those plans but my mother was on pickup/drop-off duty with me. So instead of me being in school a full day which would mean my mother would miss her matinee showing she scooped me early. By default I had to watch Beloved. For the longest I wished my mom would have been late picking me up rather than me watch that movie. The movie creeped me out.

Sethe is haunted by past life as a slave. Granted she was raped by the school teacher’s nephew and slits her fourth child throat to spare her of a life of abuse as a slave. I followed along that the Poltergeist possessed the home and drove off her two boys. What I couldn’t wrap my head around was Beloved and the Poltergeist’s leaving. Beloved emerges from a swamp riddled with insects. Was she the Poltergeist in human form now? At the time I couldn’t tell if insects were crawling on Beloved because of proximity to the swamp or were these insects eating her rotten flesh because she was deceased. Denver’s affection towards Beloved’s despite finding out she was Sethe’s allegedly deceased daughter bewildered me. Sethe openness to a very manipulative yet cognitive delayed individual worried me throughout the movie. However it would be Beloved telling Paul D to “touch her on the inside part” that let me know I was over it. By the time the church women came to exorcise the house I wanted to throw the entire movie away. Too late saints. The demon raped a man sucking the life out of her mother and has her poor sister Denver contemplating if life is really worth all of this.

3. Their Eyes Were Watching God

Their Eyes Were Watching God is the only movie I followed the closest although parts made me question things. Janie’s luck with her husbands can be summarized in her quest to find love as she leaves her former life behind. Her arrangement with Joe falls through because of his jealousy. Logan wants her to labor as hard as he does and when she finally finds love in Tea Cake a bite from a rabid dog during the flood destroys it. Rabies engulfs his mind. Janie kills Tea Cake who was trying to kill her. She leaves town after she is exonerated in Tea Cake’s murder.

What I understand now:

As a more mindful adult I can now understand the implications of each movie. Eve’s Bayou introduced African/Caribbean spirituality to me. It showed similarities between the accepted religion with the gift of sight which is widely accepted as the gift of prophecy in the Christian sector. It also played around with intentions. Eve’s intentions to correct her father dances throughout the film.

Beloved was a prime example of allowing the past to hunt us and not being able to practice nonattachment to things or people. Sethe was attached to her past life. She let trauma place her in bondage. When Sethe’s biggest fear manifests as a parasitic demon from her past Sethe worships Beloved feeding into her own demise.

Their Eyes Were Watching God toyed with idea of a white savior and how Black people looked to heaven as a place of refuge. It also showed how Blacks internalized hate for themselves. Janie was admired because she had “white features”. The parallel between religion and suffering emerges as a theme as well. There could be no paradise on the other side if there wasn’t any suffering on this side. I also felt like Janie’s suffering with husbands was caused by her hope in them being able to save her from a loveless life. Each husband is taken away from her. It was like a reminder that the Highest is a jealous God.

Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito were both wealthier in 2020 than they were in 2018 according to their annual financial disclosures filed earlier this year

Manchin’s estimated net worth for 2020 was $8.6 million compared to $7.6 million for 2018. Capito was worth $2.53 million compared to $2.15 million in 2018.

The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probably range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

For 2020 Manchin’s asset values ranged from $4376067 to $12844100. He reported no liabilities. The midpoint was $8610083.50.

Capito’s assets ranged from $1596629 to $4996000. She reported liabilities ranging from $475005 to $1065000. Using the formula put her range of worth from $531629 to $4520995 with the midpoint at $2526995.

Here’s a look at some selected details from their reports.

Manchin

OpenSecrets ranked Manchin 19th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 67th overall in Congress. OpenSecrets hasn’t yet published its compilation of 2020 filings.

For comparison the richest senator in 2018 was Mark Warner D-Va. worth $214 million. Current Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was worth $1.12 million and current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was worth $34.14 million.

Manchin reported collecting $48282.24 from the state Public Employees Retirement System in 2020.

Members are required to report both their own and their spouse’s assets and liabilities. His wife Gayle Manchin currently co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission holds a savings account worth $500001-$1 million which paid interest ranging from $2501-$5000.

Manchin reported two savings accounts ranging respectively from $100001-$250000 and $50001-$100000. They produced interest ranging from $201-$1000 for the first and less than $201 for the second.

The Joe Manchin III Qualified Blind Trust is worth $500001-$1 million and generated revenue of $5001-$15000.

He owns a storage building in Fairmont worth $50001-$100000 that collected $2501-$5000 in rent. A commercial rental property in Fairmont is worth $250001-$500000 and collected $5001-$15000 in rent and $2382 in “ordinary business income.”

He owns stock in Fairmont-based Enersystems which he founded and is described as providing services and materials for utility plants (according to news reports it supplies coal to Mon Power’s Grant Town plant). The stock is worth $1000001-$5 million and produces $100001-$1 million in dividends plus $491949 in business income.

Manchin holds stock in two Morgantown-based companies. Figure 8 Surgical makes a sternal closure tool. CereDX (now Valtari Bio) is developing a blood test to aid rapid triage in stroke patients. The stock holdings for each is worth $1001 to $15001 and both generate dividends labeled “none” meaning less than $201.

The final asset on Manchin’s list is the house boat that recently made headlines as the site of a gathering of senators from both parties where Sen. Lindsey Graham R-SC subsequently reported testing positive for COVID despite being vaccinated.

Manchin reports the house boat being worth $100001-$250000.

Capito

Open Secrets ranked Capito 46th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 169th overall in Congress.

Capito has a stake in Disney magic. She owns Walt Disney Co. stock worth $15001-$50000.

She and her husband have stock in a number of energy companies: Duke Energy ($1001-$15000) NextEra Energy ($1001-$15000) ExxonMobil ($1001-$15000) Royal Dutch Shell ($1001-$15000) Chevron ($1001-$15000) Phillips 66 ($1001-$15000) Wisconsin Energy ($1001-$15000) and BlackRock ($1001-$15000).

They each have a Wells Fargo bank account each worth $50001-$100000 and they report four separate stock holdings in Wells Fargo. They also have several Citigroup holdings.

Their high-tech stock includes Microsoft Apple AT&T Cisco Verizon and IBM.

Her husband owns stock in Viatris (which closed its Morgantown plant last month) worth $1001-$15000. Their other pharmaceutical holdings include Johnson & Johnson Merck Novartis Pfizer Roche Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

They have a wide variety of holdings in the food industry: General Mills Kellogg McDonald’s J.M. Smucker Coca-Cola Mondelez and PepsiCo.

They have three box stores covered with holdings in WalMart Target and Lowe’s.

Other holdings include Nordstrom UPS Ford Colgate-Palmolive Proctor & Gamble #M and Nike.

Reps. David McKinley Carol Miller and Alex Mooney all had reports due in May and all three filed for extensions. Their new deadline was Friday and a story on their filings will follow after their reports are published.

Shopee Mom’s Club Special: In-depth talks by mommy influencers and parenting experts

She was born on March 20th 1957 in North Dakota to her parents Homer and Deloris (Jacobs) Danduran. Janice graduated from Huntington Beach High School in 1975 and later studied art in junior college. She met her husband Mark while working part-time at a night-shift job in 1976. At that job she would keep throwing bean bags at him to get his attention. Mark was told many times that she told her friends “I am going to marry that man”. They dated for approximately three years before getting married on March 22nd of 1980. In 1987 they added to their family a wonderful daughter Carly.

For many years Janice worked in the insurance industry as an insurance underwriter. She had a few other jobs but working with children was her calling. When Janice and the family moved to North Georgia in 1995 she worked for the county as a bus monitor for special needs children. She would help children suffering from seizures and many other medical conditions. It takes a special person to be able to assist in this capacity. Not many people could. This was something she enjoyed and she made many close relationships with the children she helped. She could always calm and comfort the children. She loved being with them.

In June of 2021- Mark Janice and Carly moved from Georgia to Central Florida in The Villages. She loved the new home and The Villages. Janice and Mark were very happy that they made it to a place where they all could eventually retire. She would love the golf cart rides and exploring Florida. She also loved being so close to many in her family that had relocated in Florida. Life was very good.

On July 17 2021 there was a family wedding in Wisconsin that she and most of her family attended. Being with so many family members made her so happy. She was always happiest when she was around family and friends. She was part of a big family.

Some of the most important things to Janice were her faith and attending her local Catholic Church. Janice taught Sunday school for a few years. She also loved cooking sewing caring for her cats and dogs trying her hand at Amateur Radio (at the urging of her husband) and she especially loved the holidays. Janice would make Christmas cookies and goodies. She loved it so much she would start in October. Janice always liked to have kids friends and family involved. She could watch holiday movies all year. Janice was caring loving very direct sometimes stubborn and maybe a little gullible. But you always loved to be around her. Janice was greatly loved by all who knew her and she will be sorely missed.

Janice is survived by her husband Mark Allman; and her daughter Carly.

As of Saturday morning there were only a few dozen seats remaining in left and right field where fans have snapped up tickets hoping to witness -- or maybe even catch -- Miguel Cabrera’s 500th home run.

It was the same on Friday night when the Tigers returned home to face the Cleveland Indians. There were thousands of seats available in the upper deck but the lower bowl -- and especially the outfield seats -- were stuffed with fans.

The announced attendance was 22107 but it felt like more especially when Cabrera was at the plate.

“I think Miggy loved it. I think our players loved it. And I think this is how the stadium is going to be when we get back to our winning ways and we get to where we want to be and build this team to be not just better but really good” manager A.J. Hinch said afterwards.

“I know the fans here care about Miggy a lot. That’s why they showed up tonight hoping to witness him conquer a big number. They’re going to continue to do that because we have some really good fans and tonight’s atmosphere will show our players that if we earn their love again to come out and support us this stadium can be rocking.”

Cabrera went 0-for-4 but he’ll get another chance on Saturday. Hinch said he’ll play first base for the 6:10 p.m. game against the Indians.

“He’s in a good place” Hinch said. “It’s not like you can just walk up there and will (the ball) out of the ballpark. He’s not taken any of this at-bat that way this year and I hope he’s not going to do it now. It’s counterproductive to think that you can just hit it when you want to.

“I know everybody’s rooting for it. We can’t allow ourselves to be disappointed if it’s an at-bat that doesn’t end in a homer. There’s a lot of ways to contribute.”

Cabrera faced Indians reliever Bryan Shaw in his final at-bat and Hinch noted that Shaw touched 98 mph on the radar gun for the first time this year.

The message was obvious: Pitchers aren’t going to roll over. If anything they’re more amped up than usual when facing Cabrera.

“Pitchers are well aware that he’s teetering on these numbers and they’re not going to concede” Hinch said.

The pressure of every at-bat being a spectacle can be overwhelming but Hinch said Cabrera is handling it well.

“He wants to play well and I don’t think he’s (worried) with the success or failure being whether he hits a home run or not” Hinch said. “He’s hit over .300 for a few months now. He’s been a productive hitter. That’s going to be more important to him than calling his shot or trying to end every at-bat with a homer. I know that’s what people want. I know that’s what we’re waiting for. But maybe (Saturday) he has a couple of base hits and that leads to a homer and we’ll all be happy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL21sYi90aWdlcnMvMjAyMS8wOC8xNC9kZXRyb2l0LXRpZ2Vycy1jbGV2ZWxhbmQtcGhvdG9zLWNvbWVyaWNhLXBhcmsvODEzMjAzMTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Detroit Tigers vs. Cleveland: Photos from Comerica Park,"Detroit Tigers vs. Cleveland: Photos from Comerica Park

He’s been saintly patient to this point no sense getting ahead of himself now.

But the reality is if things stay on track he could be activated and back on the mound at Comerica Park against the Blue Jays either Aug. 28 or 29.

“The patience is tough” said Boyd who was back at Comerica after throwing 20 pitches over two scoreless innings in his first rehab start with Toledo in Columbus Friday night. “This is one thing you can’t will yourself through. You have to give it time to let your body recover.”

Boyd has been on the injured list since June 15. But he said he thinks the root of the injury — which the Tigers list as general arm discomfort though the pain was mostly in the elbow — came from swinging the bat in his start on June 1 against the Brewers in Milwaukee.

“I wasn’t really worried but it was more of an ‘Oh shoot’ kind of thing” Boyd said. “I don’t think swinging the bat in Milwaukee helped. This wasn’t a one-pitch sort of thing. There was discomfort and maybe (swinging the bat) pushed me over the edge.

“Whether that was the straw that broke the camel’s back or it was something else I don’t know.”

He beat the Mariners on June 8 allowing only an unearned run over six innings. But he came out of next start on June 14 in the third inning.

“What I expect out of myself is 100% of me attacking on every pitch and if there is any bit that's away from that then I am not only cheating myself but I’m cheating everybody else” Boyd said. “My focus needs to be right there not on the last pitch or my elbow or knee or shoulder or whatever.”

That’s why he was happy with his outing Friday. His velocity was back up to 94 mph but more importantly he was attacking hitters without regard to anything else. He just let it go.

“The injury was a couple of starts in the making and it got to the point where my focus was leaving here (attacking) and going there (to the pain)” Boyd said. “That’s the point where I drew the line and said ‘I’m not doing what I was called to do what I’m supposed to do.' ”

The plan is for Boyd to make two more rehab starts hopefully building him up to five innings. If there are no setbacks then he would be on track to make five or six starts before the end of the season.

“It’s been so much fun watching this team” he said. “It’s the fruits of everything we’ve been working for. We saw it start to cultivate in the spring and then we had the tough April. But May and June you started to see it again.

“Being removed from it and watching it on TV it’s palpable the excitement. It’s really special and I can’t wait to be a part of it.”

There is other news in the Boyd household by the way. His wife Ashley is pregnant with twins a boy and a girl due to arrive Nov. 13.

What a journey

Manager AJ Hinch announced Saturday that the contract of veteran right-hander Drew Hutchison would be purchased from Triple-A Toledo and he would make the start on Sunday in the series finale against the Indians.

The Tigers DFA'd reliever Buck Farmer to make room for Hutchison following Saturday's win over Cleveland.

For Hutchison who won 13 games and was the Blue Jays Opening Day starter in 2015 it’ll be the first time he’s pitched in the big leagues since 2018.

“I’m excited to be here” said Hutchison who was at Comerica Park Saturday morning to throw a light bullpen. “It’s been a little bit of everything just kind of an interesting ride so far. I’ve had a good season so I’m excited to get going.”

Hutchison tore his UCL his rookie season in 2012 and had Tommy John surgery. He worked his way back into the Blue Jays rotation making 60 starts in 2014 and 2015. He didn’t make the roster out of spring training in 2016 he lost a battle for the fifth spot in the rotation to Aaron Sanchez and a crazy five-year journey was on.

Before landing in Toledo where he was 8-3 with a 3.63 ERA Hutchison pitched for the Pirates Phillies Dodgers Rangers Yankees Twins and Angels between 2017 and 2019. In 2020 he pitched in the independent American Association and won a championship with the Milwaukee Milkmen.

“Yeah 2019 was a tough year I bounced around a lot — 2018 and 2019” he said. “But I put in a lot of work the last few years and it’s good to see it pay off. Last year I played independent ball just to see if what I was doing was helping me and to see where I was at.”

So a week before his 31st birthday (Aug. 22) Hutchison will start a game in the big leagues for the first time since Aug. 31 2018.

“Yeah I guess it’ll be a little like (a second big-league debut)” he said. “But I have a better idea of what to expect. Just looking forward to it.”

Police in Santa Cruz and the FBI are investigating a bank robbery that occurred Friday.

On Friday at 2:19 p.m. officers with the Santa Cruz Police Department responded to a report of a bank robbery at the Comerica Bank at 25 River Street.

Police said the masked suspect presented a note to the bank teller with a drawing of a bomb on it and demanding money.

The suspect was able to steal cash and fled the scene on a bicycle before officers arrived. Police wouldn't say how much the man got away with.

No weapon was seen during the robbery and no one inside the bank was injured during the incident.

The suspect was described as a man of unknown race and age.

Responding officers searched the surrounding area and located evidence where the suspect changed clothes to evade capture police said.

It was an untamed wilderness full of potential and individuals such as William Boles and Samuel Deneen saw the promise that the land held. The 1830s was a busy decade of settlers trickling in and building mills homes and more.

Among them was William Imlay who ventured from New York with his close friend Walter Beech and while Beech stayed in the Almont area Imlay came a bit farther north where he set up three sawmills. He was only here around a decade but the township was named for him when it was organized in April 1850.

A community called Imlay Post Office sprung up at Blacks Corners Road and was later called Blacks Corners. It was expected to be the commercial center of the township but that changed in 1870 when the Port Huron and Lake Michigan Railway came through.

Inside the Imlay City Historical Society Museum there is a photo hanging on the wall of the Palmer House. Charles Palmer was the chief engineer of the Port Huron and Lake Michigan Railway and he selected the site of Imlay City as a likely place for a produce market between Lapeer and Capac. He purchased 240 acres of land surveyed it and began platting the streets. He gave the town the name Imlay City since the township had already been named Imlay. On June 1 1870 Palmer began building the Bancroft House hotel. Trains began running to Imlay City on Aug. 15 that year and the hotel opened for business two days later. Imlay City was born.

As a side note descendants of Palmer were expected to tread the streets their great-great grandfather platted on Saturday. Historical Society Board Secretary Marilyn Swihart said a dozen of Charles Palmer’s adult descendants would be walking in the sesquicentennial parade and afterward they were to have a reception for the family at the Historical Museum and then take them to the Palmer house in town for photos.

A year and a half after Imlay City came into existence as an official city the population had grown to 500 people. There was a school two hotels two shoe stores two hardware stores a furniture store a drug store two carriage and blacksmith shops a saw and planing mill a livery stable and an elevator. The hotel was marking around 20 arrivals per day.

The following are a few historical tidbits from Imlay City history borrowed from the book put together for the city’s centennial in 1970:

• In the early 1890s in summer usually in June a band of gypsies — it is unclear whether these were Romani people or just a band of nomads though these days the word “gypsy” is considered a slur — would settle for a few days along M-21 and camp in tents and wagons. The men would trade horses and the women would tell fortunes. It is said they would steal everything they could until they were run out of town and they would sell junk jewelry.

• In the 1890s milkman Jake Buck carried milk around town in pails selling it for five cents a quart. Many families had their own milk cows though.

• In 1887-88 Imlay City had its first baseball team the Daisies.

• In the late 1880s a 90-foot-tall flagpole called the Liberty Pole was erected in the middle of the corner of Third Street and Almont Avenue. A flag was raised on Decoration Day Independence Day and other days of importance. Members of the Grand Army of the Republic would gather at the pole and lead a parade to the cemetery.

• Every summer in the 1890s Imlay City was visited by a six- to eight-piece German band which would play a few pieces in front of the stores take up a collection and move on to the next town.

Imlay City is surrounded by rich muck lands where there was a large cranberry marsh before the white man arrived in the area. Farming the muck land started with John DeHaan who decided to clear some of the muck land to grow celery. That grew into quite an industry and a trip along M-53 and some of the back roads today shows farmers taking advantage of the fertile jet-black muck soil to grow carrots onions and other vegetables.

Farming the muck also made its mark on Imlay City in another way. The farmers needed help caring for their crops so migrant workers began coming to the area from Mexico in the 1930s to work. Over time some of the families decided to settle permanently in the area and now according to Imlay City Downtown Development Authority Director Lorrelei Natke make up around 30% of the city’s population adding to the cultural diversity of the area. Some people still choose to come here in the summer to work and return home to Mexico after the season is over.

Summertime in Imlay City also means a sharp pleasant tang in the air from the pickle factory. As early as 1925 farmers in the area were contracted to grow cucumbers and in 1946 the Patzeur Food Products Co. built a large plant to make pickles and sauerkraut. In 1957 Vlasic Food Products Co. bought the plant from Patzeur. Today Vlasic is owned by Pinnacle Foods a subsidiary of Conagra Brands.

We would be remiss to recount some of the history of Imlay City without mentioning some of its most entertaining aspects — namely the Whitney Family Show and the Eastern Michigan State Fair.

George Whitney and his wife established their circus and made the Imlay Hotel built in 1860 at Blacks Corners their home base. The circus had one ring 52 people 45 horses and 22 wagons. They left Imlay every April to travel and perform returning in October. The circus was in operation from 1879 to 1908.

In 1896 an agricultural society was formed in Imlay City and held its first fair. Edison’s Gramophone was displayed at the first fair and in 1908 there was an electric theater at the fair. In J. Dee Ellis’s book Pioneer Families and History of Lapeer County Michigan Ellis notes that in 1918 there was a very popular girlie show on the midway. It later turned out the girls were in fact men.

The fair is still an extremely popular event not just for Imlay City and Lapeer County but far and wide. Following a one-year suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic the 2021 edition of the five-day Eastern Michigan State Fair set an alltime attendance record. Paidat gate attendance was up 32% from 2019 for a total of 50319 patrons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMzU1NTc2L3Nhdm9yeS1zbmFja3MtbWFya2V0LWlzLWJvb21pbmctc28tcmFwaWRseS10b3AtcGxheWVycy1tYXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Savory Snacks Market Is Booming So Rapidly | Top Players - Mars General Mills Nestle,"Savory Snacks Market Is Booming So Rapidly | Top Players - Mars General Mills Nestle

But in many ways the rise and fall of chief executives’ pay packages simply mirrored the turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that has shaped everything over the last year and a half.

In the virus’ wake a new leader rose to the top of the pack.

Jay Adair CEO of Copart Inc. a Dallas-based used car online auction company received the largest total compensation for 2020 in The Dallas Morning News’ annual ranking of the 100 highest-paid leaders of North Texas-based public companies. The ranking is compiled for The News by Houston-based compensation firm Longnecker & Associates.

» See the full ranking at the end of this article.

Adair’s pay rose a whopping 16384% to $25.7 million even though he’s only paid $1 a year in salary. Stock options — long-term incentives that make up the biggest part of most CEO pay packages — are what caused Adair’s compensation to soar.

Companies are required to report stock options at the value when they’re granted as part of the CEO’s total pay for that year. Boards of directors use stock options that vest over time at various prices as a way to align CEO performance with the company’s share price. If the share price rises to pre-established levels the options can be sold — giving them value beyond what’s now largely paper wealth.

“Adair will only realize income upon the exercise of these option awards and only to the extent the underlying value of Copart shares exceed the strike price” the company said in an emailed response about Adair’s ranking. “Our board considers this calculated value to lack material meaning as it does not reflect the actual value if any that Adair will receive under the award.”

His base salary has been $1 since April 2009. He last received stock options in 2014 totaling $22.86 million at the time.

Adair’s new stock options vest over a three-year period and contained a clause that he couldn’t exercise them until the company’s share price closed above $106.30 for 20 consecutive trading days. Copart shares have traded above that price continuously since March 31.

Copart turned in a 40% return for shareholders last year and the company’s revenue rose 8% to $2.2 billion.

Enter the pandemic. When virus-related supply chain problems resulted in a shortage of new vehicles available on dealership lots demand and prices for used cars took off. That made parts hard to find sending so-called “vehicle dismantlers” to Copart websites in search of what they needed. Salvagers are among the company’s biggest buyers.

“I used to say before 2008 that we were a recession-resistant company” Adair told investors in a conference call that ended its 2020 fiscal year. “After 2008 I started saying that we were recession-proof. And now after 2020 I can confidently say we are a pandemic-proof company.”

The pandemic also conspired to push perennial pay leaders at AT&T Exxon Mobil and Tenet Healthcare down in this year’s rankings as each of their companies faced unusual challenges.

The oil and gas industry struggled throughout 2020 although Exxon is bouncing back strong this year. Hospitals reliant on elective surgeries for revenue such as Tenet had to pause those procedures for a portion of 2020 and then had to convince reluctant patients it was safe again to go back to a surgical center. And AT&T facing a mountain of debt from a series of acquisitions found itself jettisoning parts of its business to recover.

It was such an unusual year that the highest-paid executive in Dallas-Fort Worth companies’ regulatory filings wasn’t even a CEO.

Jason Kilar who was brought in to run AT&T’s WarnerMedia entertainment division got a massive $52 million compensation package made up largely of stock awards to be paid out over five years. In May AT&T struck a deal to merge WarnerMedia with Discovery — a move that ultimately could zap much of Kilar’s expected payday. Kilar has said he expects to stay with the company into next year though Discovery CEO David Zaslav will take the helm of the merged powerhouse.

Winners and losers

This year’s rankings point out the clear winners and losers of the pandemic-influenced year.

Take the nation’s largest homebuilder Arlington-based D.R. Horton which benefited from record demand for new homes. Its CEO David Auld saw his compensation rise 34% year-over-year to $19.1 million. That elevated him to fifth in the rankings.

And the company’s founder and executive chairman Donald R. Horton collected $32.5 million — more than any CEO on this year’s list.

Brain Yarbrough senior analyst at investment firm Edward Jones said D.R. Horton was already on strong footing entering 2020 but the increased importance people placed on their homes after being locked down and a surge in relocation to suburban and rural areas made the company’s profits shoot up.

“The demand we’ve seen over the last year is unprecedented and the companies will tell you that” Yarbrough said. “This even supersedes what we saw in the [2006-07] housing boom.”

Dallas-area home prices rose 18.5% year-over-year in May — the region’s biggest percentage gain ever recorded in the closely watched Corelogic Case-Shiller home price index of major cities. That gain was almost 2% above the national average.

Trailing Adair in this year’s ranking is Perry Sook CEO of Nexstar the nation’s largest owner of local TV stations. His pay package rose 44% to $23.5 million. The Irving-based company benefited from political advertising surrounding last year’s hotly contested national state and local races.

On the opposite side of the pandemic equation is Exxon Mobil.

The Irving-based oil giant’s chief executive typically ranks in the top five in the annual ranking. In 2020 CEO Darren Woods tumbled to 10th with a pay package of $15 million. His pay fell 33% last year as Exxon suspended its executive bonus program to deal with the economic turbulence.

“Oil and gas at the beginning of 2020 was hurt even more than most of the industries outside of maybe retail” said Longnecker & Associates chief operating officer Tyler Brown.

In addition to dramatically reduced travel Russia and Saudi Arabia also put a price squeeze on oil and gas Brown said. Woods abandoned Exxon’s $200 billion growth strategy and slashed spending. While painful last year that put the company in a strong position to reap benefits from this year’s crude rally.

When Exxon’s CEO doesn’t top the rankings Dallas-based AT&T’s usually does.

This year however new CEO John Stankey could do no better than fourth with a $21 million pay package. He replaced longtime CEO Randall Stephenson in 2020 and has been responsible for selling off many of the assets AT&T acquired during his predecessor’s tenure. (Stephenson now the company’s executive chairman received $29.1 million in compensation last year.)

Tenet Healthcare CEO Ronald Rittenmeyer the second-highest-paid CEO in last year’s ranking was one of 30 chief executives among the top 100 who took pay cuts. His pay declined 31% to $16 million.

But that hasn’t made Rittenmeyer immune from criticism. Striking nurses at a Tenet-owned hospital in Massachusetts regularly point to his eight-figure compensation in complaining about what they contend are staffing and personal protective equipment shortages jeopardizing patient safety. Politicians have joined in asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the company’s use of CARES Act money.

Tenet’s CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 2020 was 306-to-1 with a median wage of $54501 paid to the company’s 110000 employees.

Rittenmeyer 74 last week announced he will turn over CEO duties on Sept. 1 to Saum Sutaria Tenet’s president and chief operating officer. He will remain the Farmers Branch-based company’s executive chairman through 2022.

While Tenet’s pay gap was sizable it wasn’t close to being the widest in D-FW.

That dubious honor fell to Plano-based movie theater chain Cinemark which chalked up a 1150-1 ratio with its employees collecting median pay of $6000. Significant pay gaps are common with companies like Cinemark that employ part-time and seasonal employees but the divide deepened as COVID-19 closed theaters and workers were furloughed by the thousands.

But like Adair there were others who got hefty pay bumps.

Mahesh Aditya CEO of Dallas-based auto lender Santander Consumer USA Holdings saw his pay rise 1948% to $2.4 million. Michael Willoughby of PFSweb Inc. got a 474% raise Chris Easter of Daseke Inc. received a 540% increase and Charles Vogt of DZS Inc. earned a 594% pay hike.

Median pay for CEOs in North Texas rose 2.5% last year to $5.95 million.

What will stick from 2020?

Most experts in executive pay say it’s too soon to tell whether 2020′s changes will extend beyond this year.

Amit Batish marketing and content manager for research firm Equilar said CEO pay across the nation only dropped 1% to 2% on average last year. Most companies cut salaries and bonuses instead of long-term stock awards and options where CEOs get most of their pay to conserve cash on hand.

“Last year was obviously an anomaly. So we imagine most of those salaries to pick up where they left off pre-pandemic” Batish said. “No real long-term changes I would imagine at this point but again that’s TBD at this moment.”

It’s also anyone’s guess how long the housing market will continue to drive economic growth. Edward Jones’ Yarbrough said some people believe companies’ return-to-office plans will be key.

“When they can’t work from home and they gotta go back to the office it’s going to be a different animal” Yarbrough said.

He also worries that wages aren’t increasing at rates comparable to home prices.

“Over the next year to year and a half we’re going to kind of see how this plays out. I think we’ll get a better picture of how sustainable the demand is” Yarbrough said. “You can’t expect the demand we’ve seen over the last 12 to 16 months to continue. There’s just no way because you know housing prices are going up.”

Longnecker & Associates’ Brown is more optimistic. While 2020 brought unprecedented challenges he said many boards of directors stepped up and “worked longer harder hours than they’ve ever worked before to make sure that businesses stayed alive.”

“They are actually really trying to do a good job for the shareholders and the continuity situation of business” he said. “I think that’s the overarching theme here.”

A heated debate has broken out in a city in the Sunshine State after the building of a new Costco was approved. Some residents oppose the project and some have allegedly issued threats on social media against local government officials.

A Facebook post from a private group that's in opposition to the new Costco has surfaced with descriptions of personal information collected about the city commissioners WPTV reports. The post allegedly asked members to share the home addresses of officials and take pictures of their cars homes and even their families.

Stuart Commissioner Troy McDonald spoke with WPTV saying ""[The] first thing I did was call my wife and say 'Hey just be a little extra vigilant' because I'm more concerned about her than myself. It is unacceptable to put that kind of rhetoric out there online. It puts people in danger and quite honestly I'm outraged.""

Authorities have reportedly looked into the post but so far they have not opened a full investigation.

""Even if it wasn't malicious intent the potential of causing a copycat or pushing somebody else over the edge is also what concerns me"" McDonald said.

The Costco project was recently approved by the city of Stuart CBS 12 reports. The project had drawn huge crowds to debate the building of the new store on 49 acres of property. Some residents were concerned about the area’s wetlands along with a disruption to the quality of life in the area.

(KY3) - Costco is just days away from opening doors in Springfield.

Costco is a membership-based warehouse retailer offering food household supplies clothing electronics appliances and other merchandise.

The upcoming Springfield location will soon open doors at 279 N. Eastgate Ave near U.S. 65 and Chestnut Expressway. The grand opening is set for Wednesday August 18 at 8 a.m.

Angela Bauer the General Manager of the new Costco told KY3 last month that there are around 240 people on staff including 185-190 employees from within the Springfield community.

The new 160000 square-foot facility has 700 parking places available and hundreds of shopping carts ready to go for customers.

Springfield mayor Ken McClure said the city had been trying to get the industry giant to come to the Ozarks for years.

“It’s an effort we’ve been working on for so many years” McClure said in a May 2021 interview. “I think it takes the community to the next step and they’re so good in terms of what they give back to the community what they pay their employees. So Costco is at the top rung of the types of businesses we want to attract.”

“Springfield was very vigilant in letting us know how much they wanted a Costco here in this community” said Bauer

Those looking to shop will be required to purchase either a $60 or $120 membership. For more information CLICK HERE.

Costco has the SanDisk Extreme 1TB portable SSD on sale for a measly $99.99. This might be the lowest price ever on the 1TB drive. It's definitely the lowest price we've seen this year. The same drive sells for $150 at other retailers like Best Buy (and that's a sale according to them!). You may need to be a Costco member to really save here because otherwise Costco tends to include a surcharge but even with that extra price it'd still be a much better price than anywhere else.

This is a newer version of a SanDisk Extreme portable SSD we have recommended before. The older version has gone much lower than today's deal before but right now it's going for $140. That means you can get the newer faster version for just $10 more.

The portable SSD uses a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 interface. That's an upgrade from 3.1 on the previous generation and ensures a wide compatibility with USB-C connectors including on both computers and smartphones. Because of that USB-C connection and the NVMe technology built into the solid state drive you can get some really fast transfer speeds too. The drive has read and write speeds up to 1050 MB/s and 1000 MB/s respectively. It is backwards compatible but you won't be able to reach top speeds without a modern system.

You also don't have to worry about this drive getting damaged while you're out and about. It is drop resistant and can survive falls up to two meters. It's also IP55 rated which means it can withstand both dust and water. It comes with a silicon shell that's durable and feels great while protecting the internal drive.

A worldwide audience of 500 million tuned in their TVs to watch the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle back in 1969. The high spot of the ceremony was the moment when the Prince watched by his mother Queen Elizabeth 11 placed the coronet on his head.

What few of those half a billion viewers knew was that the coronet was made in Cinderford Gloucestershire.

The Royal Collection Trust in whose care the coronet resides today describes it as “24 carat gold with the four Crosses Patées and the four fleur-de-Lys made from a nugget of Welsh gold reinforced with platinum and decorated with diamonds and emeralds.

The orb mounted on the top of the arch is surrounded by 13 diamonds arranged as the constellation of Scorpio The Prince of Wales’s star sign. The diamonds set horizontally represent the seven gifts of God on one side and the seven deadly sins on the other.”

The prince probably wasn’t aware that the priceless piece of pageantry poised on his royal cranium had been made in a former biscuit factory. This was built by Meredith Drew & Co in the Forest of Dean town in 1951 and for the next decade manufactured cream crackers.

In 1962 the company switched production to another factory in Halifax and 346 employees at the Cinderford works were made jobless. However shortly afterwards the premises were taken over by Engelhard Industries the firm that made the prince’s coronet.

All of which may lead you to wonder what else Gloucestershire has given to royal personages. Well in the case of Edward V11 the answer is a good lunch.

In June 1909 Gloucester city centre was decorated in royal style when the king came to tour the Royal Agricultural Society show which was staged on the Oxleaze.

Alighting from the royal train at 12.10pm his majesty was driven in a horse drawn coach to Alney Island and lunch in the royal pavilion. The monarch-sized menu comprised melon gonzalez eoufs en cocette a la soubise fillets de sole a l’Anglaise noisette de mouton a l’epicurien poulardes de Surrey salade jambon d’York froid delice de fraises glace friandises peches and coffee (melon eggs fish lamb duck ham ice cream peaches and coffee).

This fortifying blow out was accompanied by five wines including an 1824 champagne and liquers.

No doubt Edward felt like pushing his chair back and having a little snooze after that lot but instead took a quick tour round the show then popped into the cathedral and caught the royal train back to London at 4.26pm arriving in time for dinner.

Visiting Cheltenham as Prince of Wales a few years earlier Edward sat down to a banquet in Pittville Pump Room where an equally gargantuan scoff was staged.

But it was the biscuits made by George’s a local baker and confectioner that really tickled the regal palate as was reported in the national press on the day following. “The Princess of Wales was much pleased with a dainty kind of biscuit flavoured with vanilla and honoured the maker with a request for the recipe.”

This royal approbation did wonders for the baker’s business and George’s suddenly found itself the fashionable doyen of aristocratic nibblers.

Local Severn lampreys have long been a favourite of the aristocratic dining table. King John once fined Gloucester for not sending him enough of the snake-like fish with their sucker mouths while Henry 1 died from eating a surfeit of lampreys.

In 1952 Howard Sibson who was the city’s High Sheriff reintroduced an age old local custom. In mediaeval times the people of Gloucester sent a decorated lamprey pie to each newly crowned monarch Thanks to Howard Sibson such a pie was prepared for the coronation of the present Queen in 1953.

Sufficient of the pouting mouthed fish were caught from the Severn then the gastronomic adventure was prepared at Innsworth school of cooking and freshly baked. The pie went off to Windsor Castle for Her Majesty’s pleasure while a second identical pie was made and placed in the city library for people to try.

On the occasion of the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in 2002 the Court Leet of Barton St Mary decided to resurrect the tradition and send a lamprey pie to the monarch with best wishes from the people of Gloucester. This they did and received a thank you letter from Her Majesty. However the lampreys had to be ordered from Canada as those residing in the Severn enjoy protected species status.

We move from British monarchs to a German Kaiser Wilhelm 11 to be precise.

Old spot pigs paid for - but not delivered

In summer 1914 with boiling unrest in the Balkans lurking revolution in Russia arch rivalry between Britain and the Fatherland and Europe poised at the threshold of the most destructive conflict in the history of mankind Kaiser Wilhelm ordered and paid for two Gloucester Old Spot pigs from a farmer in Berkeley Gloucestershire.

Events intervened and Wilhelm never did get his pigs. Neither did he get his money back.

Perhaps it’s easier to feel sympathy for the Maharaja of Indore who in 1936 commissioned Gloucester Wagon Works to build him a state railway coach. Almost twice as long as a standard railway coach the specification for this palace on bogies was fit for a prince and cost a king’s ransom.

When completed the state coach was taken to Southampton for shipping to India but while the voyage was underway there was an uprising in Indore and the unfortunate Maharaja was deposed so he never enjoyed the benefits of Gloucester craftsmanship at its finest.

The city is looking at the section of the line between Kostner and Califoria avenues which runs on an elevated embankment roughly mid-way between Taylor and Fillmore streets. Ald. Michael Scott (24th) whose ward includes most of North Lawndale said that he’s been interested in turning the line into a trail for the past few years.

The potential project area. Image: Google Maps The project area. Image: Google Maps

On August 12 he along with Chicago Department of Planning and Development and the North Lawndale Community Coordinating Council held a community planning session at Douglass Park field house located about four blocks south of the rail line to get input from residents about what they’d like to see on and around the trail. Around 20 people attended over the course of two hours. As officials emphasized several times the planning process is still in preliminary stages. Two more meetings will take place in the fall and the final report isn’t expected to be completed until January 2022.

While the officials touted the trail’s potential to spur development they acknowledged concerns that while the new amenity would increase property values it could also lead to higher property taxes and housing costs and housing displacement. Scott said that the city learned its lesson from the Bloomingdale Trail situation and he argued that displacement would be easier to avoid near the North Lawndale greenway because the amount of city-owned land near the trail would give the city more leverage in shaping development.

The Planning Process

The rail line was originally built by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1893 going as far west as the present-day Altenheim retirement community in Forest Park. The line served several factories and warehouses in North Lawndale – most notably the Sears Roebuck and Company’s campus. The line had commuter service but it lasted less than three decades. While the western portion of the line gets regular use DPD staff said that the North Lawndale portion is used an average “once or twice a year.”

Scott said that not long after he was first elected alderman in 2015 he toured the redeveloped Sears campus. As he looked at around from the top of North Lawndale's Sears Merchandise Building Tower the original Sears Tower he saw the rail line cutting through the community.

“I needed to know what was going on with that line” Scott said. “Since then I’ve been on the mission to get this done.” The alderman said that he didn’t get much traction until Maurice Cox was appointed Planning and Development Commissioner in Oct 2019. But it still took the better part of two more years before the study kicked off this summer.

The North Lawndale Community Coordinating Council is a coalition of North Lawndale community organizations institutions business owners community activists and other people involved in the community. Jesse Green the organization’s senior director said that as soon as the council heard about the proposal they wanted to get involved.

Green added that NLCCC wanted to make sure residents were involved early on. “Oftentimes what happens in the community is that people don’t get engagement until after the design has been completed and we don’t want to do that approach.""

Green said that NLCCC assembled a committee made up of “renters homeowners business owners and youth” to work with the city on the trail design and review feedback from outreach events. “This isn’t one and done – this is a repetitive engagement process that is transparent and inclusive.""

NLCCC shares its regular committee meeting schedules and Zoom access information through its newsletter but planning committee meetings haven’t been included. When I brought that up Green said that while he never thought of it before posting video recordings of the meetings online would be a good idea.

During the planning session residents were asked to comment on what kind of development they would like to see around the rail line including what kind of art and recreational amenities they're interested in. Adding a grocery store was a recurring theme as were community gardens historical installations and recreational spaces such as skate parks.

Attendees were even asked to suggest trail names. Brian Hacker DPD’s West Side coordinating planner said they are simply using the existing Altenheim Line name but they would go with whatever the community wants. Some of the suggestions included “Peace Trail” “Lawndale Trail” and several variations of “OutWest Line”

Theresa Thomas of North Lawndale feels the trail idea has potential. “It would keep us connected as a community because it would give us more things to do. It will give us a new perspective. Sometimes when people get something new it makes them feel good.”

Tito Cantres of North Lawndale said that he grew up near the Bloomingdale Line before it was converted into the trail. He was leery because he recalled the line being dangerous and he didn’t want the Altenheim trail to become “a highway for gang members” crossing gang territories and evading police. But he added that it could be avoided with community involvement. “I am also optimistic because [the trail] could help economic growth and improve the neighborhood.""

Displacement Concerns

The planning process kicks off amid several efforts to bring development to North Lawndale. As part of the city's Invest South/West initiative DPD is soliciting redevelopment proposals for the former Silver Shovel dump site at the west end of the proposed trail as well as the seven lots along Ogden Avenue between Homan and Trumbull avenues.

At the same time Scott has been working with several developers to build homes on city-owned vacant lots throughout North Lawndale through the City Lots for Working Families program. Most notably Lawndale Christian Development Corporation and Pullman-based Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives are trying to build 250 homes.

One challenge has been that the city's definition of affordable housing is based on the Area Median Income for the entire Chicagoland region which puts rents out of range for most North Lawndale residents. LCDC would try to address this issue through housing subsidies. But Scott and the developers said that one of the goals is to attract new residents to make up for decades of population loss and many of those newcomers may be more well off.

Developments involving city-owned land are automatically subject to the Affordable Requirements Ordinance even if the developer isn’t getting city funding or asking for a zoning change. The city can also attach covenants to the land sale. The current version of the ARO also incentivizes putting affordable units in gentrifying communities.

Before that Hasaranga had performed well for Sri Lanka during their tour of England. He is a right-arm leg-spin bowler who can also contribute some important runs with the bat in the lower-middle order.

Speaking of his records in T20 cricket so far Hasaranga has played 22 T20 internationals for the Sri Lankan cricket team. He has scored 192 runs at a strike rate of 110.98. With the ball he has taken 33 wickets with his best bowling figures being 4/9. Overall in T20 cricket Wanindu has aggregated 762 runs and picked up 80 wickets in 60 T20 matches. He can be an asset for any IPL franchise. As per reports four IPL franchises are in line to sign him as a replacement for the second phase of IPL 2021 in the United Arab Emirates. While the names of those four fra

While the names of those four franchises are not revealed yet here’s a list of the possible four teams that could target Hasaranga.

1. Royal Challengers Bangalore can sign Wanindu Hasaranga as a replacement

The Royal Challengers Bangalore received a bad news ahead of IPL 2021’s resumption. The franchise’s star all-rounder Washington Sundar may miss the remaining matches because of injury. Now RCB have an overseas spot vacant in their squad. Many fans would know that before IPL 2021 was suspended Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson pulled out of the tournament.

No one has confirmed their availability for Phase 2 of IPL 2021 as of this writing. RCB had signed Scott Kuggeleijn as a replacement for Kane but Zampa’s spot is still vacant. Hence RCB can bring Wanindu Hasaranga in their squad. He can form a partnership with the experienced RCB spinner Yuzvendra Chahal in the team.

2. Rajasthan Royals

Rajasthan Royals are a team that are in dire need of replacements especially for the overseas players. Their English trio of Ben Stokes Jofra Archer and Jos Buttler is unlikely to play in the second phase of IPL 2021. Stokes is currently on a mental health break while Archer is officially ruled out due to injury. Buttler has hinted that he might miss IPL 2021 Phase 2 because of his wife is expecting a child.

So Rajasthan can go for Wanindu Hasaranga as a replacement option. Hasaranga can form a combination with Rahul Tewatia and Chris Morris in the all-rounders’ section. The conditions in the United Arab Emirates will help him as well. Hence RR could be in line to sign Hasaranga.

3. Kolkata Knight Riders can sign Wanindu Hasaranga as a replacement

Initially there was a question mark over the participation of English and Australian players in IPL 2021. However the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have given the permission now. However Kolkata Knight Riders pace bowler Pat Cummins will miss IPL 2021’s phase 2. The reason behind it is his wife is expecting a child soon and he wants to be her.

So the Knight Riders will need a replacement. They already have some good fast-bowling options in their squad. With Lockie Ferguson available KKR might not go for a pace bowler as Cummins’ replacement. They can instead sign Wanindu Hasaranga and strengthen their spin attack because their spin bowlers did not perform their best in the first phase of IPL 2021.

4. Punjab Kings

All players of the Punjab Kings squad are likely to be available for the second phase of IPL 2021. However in case any overseas player misses out Punjab can target Wanindu Hasaranga as a replacement. Their overseas bowlers could not make much impact in the first phase of IPL 2021. Hence they can add a wicket-taking option.

Hasaranga can join forces with Harpreet Brar and Ravi Bishnoi in the spin attack to trouble the opposition batsmen. While Punjab can benefit from the services of Hasaranga it is very likely that either of the first three teams on this list will go for Hasaranga as a replacement.",,,

CVS and Walgreens will start giving third COVID-19 vaccine doses but only for those with weakened immune systems. Here's what to know.

CVS and Walgreens will start giving third COVID-19 vaccine doses but only for those with weakened immune systems. Here's what to know.

CVS and Walgreens will start giving third COVID-19 vaccine doses but only for those with weakened immune systems. Here's what to know.

CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens are both now administering COVID-19 booster shots but only for those with weakened immune systems.

It comes after the Food and Drug Administration ruled that transplant recipients and other similarly immune-compromised patients can get a third dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. But the decision offers an extra dose only to those high-risk groups - not the general public.

CVS says people can schedule vaccination appointments on their website.

A spokesperson for the company said those who want the booster shot will also be required to confirm that they are immuno-compromised during the scheduling process as well as when they get the third dose.

Walgreens locations nationwide are also offering the third dose following the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization and the new guidance from the CDC.

Same-day appointments will be available on a walk-in basis at select Walgreens stores.

If you're eligible bring your vaccination record to appointments. You'll also be required to attest to your eligibility.

Here's what else to know about the shots:

WHY DO SOME PEOPLE NEED AN EXTRA DOSE?

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines offer powerful protection for otherwise healthy people but many who take immune-suppressing medications or have diseases that tamp down their immune systems generally get less benefit from the standard two doses. The CDC cited one study suggesting about 40% to 44% of people hospitalized for a so-called breakthrough case - infection after vaccination - are among the immune-compromised.

Those hospitalized patients ""did all the right things -- they're just suffering from a lack of good vaccine protection"" said Dr. Camille Kotton of Massachusetts General Hospital one of CDC's advisers.

WHO QUALIFIES?

Roughly 7 million American adults are classified as immune-compromised but the FDA singled out transplant recipients and others with similar levels of immune suppression. The FDA didn't spell out exactly who falls into those other categories but in new guidance to doctors issued Friday the CDC listed several categories of people who could qualify including people with advanced or untreated HIV infections and those with cancers who are receiving certain chemotherapies.

ARE THERE AGE RESTRICTIONS?

For now the new policy allows a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for children as young as 12 who also meet the high-risk requirement but adults only for a third Moderna dose. That's because the Pfizer vaccine currently is the only authorized option for Americans under 18. That could change if Moderna's vaccine eventually is allowed for teens.

WILL I NEED A DOCTOR'S NOTE OR A BLOOD TEST?

The government isn't requiring either - patients will just need to tell the vaccine provider why they're seeking another dose. ""We would want to make that as easy as possible"" said Dr. William Schaffner an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.

WHAT WILL A THIRD DOSE COST?

Shots given under FDA's emergency use authorization are free.

IS MIX-AND-MATCH ALLOWED?

The government encourages the third dose to be the same as the first two but doesn't mandate it.

HOW WELL DOES A THIRD DOSE WORK?

It helps at least some people. Canadian researchers this week reported 55% of transplant recipients given a third dose two months after standard vaccination had good antibody levels compared to 18% who were given a dummy third shot for comparison. Health experts urged these high-risk patients to continue masking and taking other precautions since there's no guarantee a third dose will work.

WHAT IF A THIRD DOSE STILL DOESN'T WORK?

It's not a substitute for vaccination but the FDA has authorized an antibody treatment as a preventive treatment if high-risk patients are exposed to the virus. And it's critical for family members and others close to fragile patients to be vaccinated.

More research is underway to better tease out whether some immune-compromised patients need still other options such as carefully monitored changes to their medications.

WHAT IF I HAD THE SINGLE-DOSE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE?

There's little data on how another dose works in high-risk people who received that vaccine although it's likely a small number since fewer than 14 million Americans overall have received the J &J shot. Still CDC counts at least 90000 who have gotten another dose on their own.

FDA vaccines chief Dr. Peter Marks said the agency is working to get more information about immune-suppressed J &J patients but that for now the evidence only backs a recommendation of extra doses for Pfizer and Moderna recipients with fragile immune systems.

IS THIS A BOOSTER?

Not really because boosters are for people whose immunity wanes over time and these high-risk groups didn't get enough protection to begin with. They now will qualify for a third dose at least 28 days after their second shot - making a third dose part of their initial prescription. That's similar to how France has handled vaccinations for the immune-compromised since April.

WHAT ABOUT BOOSTERS FOR EVERYONE ELSE?

U.S. health authorities insist it's not yet time for booster doses for the general population.

""We believe sooner or later you will need a booster for durability of protection"" -- but not yet Dr. Anthony Fauci the government's top infectious diseases expert told reporters this week.

The CDC is closely monitoring rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths as well as long-running studies of how often vaccinated health workers experience breakthrough infections especially with the contagious delta variant. That evidence will drive any decision.

Just two days ago to mark the Field Of Dreams game between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox in Iowa Sheen took to Instagram and shared a photo of himself hanging out with a few legendary baseball players that he originally posted back in September 2017.

'Rock Raines The Wizard Lefty Tony Tee and The Sheen' he wrote in the caption of the photo seemingly taken in the cornfield of the Field Of Dreams set along with 'hashtag - we got this.'

He referenced the nicknames of iconic players Tim Raines Ozzie Smith and Steve Carlton along with longtime friend Tony Todd.

Sheen's personal tailspin a decade ago included pleading guilty to assaulting his former wife Brooke Mueller on Christmas day in 2010 and his very public feud with Two And A Half Men creator Chuck Lorre where he used such comments as 'winning' and 'tiger blood.'

Instead of paying homage to my back pain and brain farts I would rather celebrate the two decades of working in the bar industry as my days of being a career bartender will soon come to an end.

2021 may be the end of an era for Rachael but she is excited to pick up where she left off as a school teacher welcoming new beginnings in 2022.

I have worked from casinos in Vegas to being inducted into the WNY Bartender’s Hall of Fame I feel I have given my all to the industry and I have reached my plateau. I will always choose to be a part of this industry (service) but I am ready to move forward with my other aspirations and it would bring nothing but happiness to me to celebrate with all who have been part of her journey.

Now Rachael will be working and celebrating during her regular shift at JJ’s Casi Di Pizza from Friday August 27 from 11 am-4 pm and celebrating through the evening. Stop by for a shot some pizza birthday spankings (preferred by Rachael) and hugs. All she asks is to take it “easy on her”.

Rachael also wanted to share some thoughts with all her industry friends and family.

""I’ve been bartending for 20 years. I’ve worked in dive bars neighborhood pubs upscale lounges Vegas casinos live music venues and all places in between. If you can order alcohol in an establishment I have probably poured a drink there. One of my first and most memorable gigs was at Alternative Brews on Sheridan in Amherst. This is where I learned the most. Not in the casinos or posh bars in Las Vegas. This is where I met Paul and Darryl and so many lifelong friends. Darryl was one of the most entertaining bartenders I have ever met. I learned from the best when I got to work under Darryl. I learned how to really connect with people make them feel special and just find the good in their lives. I also learned how to use sarcasm properly (most of the time). If Paul had not hired me I would never have had this amazing opportunity. After about two years Paul and I became the closest of friends. To this day Paul will always be one of my best friends. The years I spent at JP Bullfeathers Cozumel and Lenox have also granted the lifelong friends and memories I will never forget. I am humbled and grateful for the vast amount of people I have befriended all these years. I am one girl who truly feels love in all directions from so many. Being in the industry we all feel aches and pains. The missed holidays and family events. Wolfing down in less than five minutes all while standing up. From the long endless nights to the nights that fly by.

Rachael at JJ's Casa Di Pizza Rachael at JJ's Casa Di Pizza loading...

I want to give my gratitude to Casa Di Pizza. My current home. I don’t think I can say I’ve ever been prouder to work for such great people and such a great place.

I love everything about this place this family; what they stand for and how they run their business. From the day I started I felt like I was “home”. It’s no coincidence that Casa means Home. It is a true honor to work for Jeff and Lori and I could not be more content with ending my bartending career here. Last but not least the biggest shout should probably go to my LIVER. Thanks liver for putting up with all of our vodka shots seltzers whiskey wine craft beers or whatever liquid courage spirited painkillers our crazy brain decides to subject us to. Keep it up! To all of you that have been part of this crazy ride…Cheers!""

Cheers to you Rachael. And thank you for not getting me in trouble for accidentally leaving without paying my tab. Yes it happens to us all.

He won the U.S. Junior Amateur in 2003 and competed on both the 2005 and 2009 Walker Cup teams. Harman played his first full PGA Tour season in 2012 and has been a steady contender ever since notching wins in 2014 at the John Deere Classic and in 2017 at the Wells Fargo Championship.

“It’s just hard to win” Harman told hosts Colt Knost and Drew Stoltz in this week’s episode of Subpar. “It’s really really hard to win because you have to beat a PGA Tour player that’s having the week of their life every week.”

To claim his first victory Harman had to beat local favorite Steve Stricker at the John Deere. For his second victory Harman had to hole an absolute bomb (28 feet!) for birdie on the 72nd hole to pull ahead of Dustin Johnson who was gunning for an historic fourth-straight victory and Pat Perez.

As Harman relived his winning moment for Knost and Stoltz he explained that Johnson and Perez were hanging around for a potential playoff and were watching the action on the final hole from the locker room.

“I hit kind of a marginal chip and both of them were getting ready to go out to the range” Harman said. “So I make the putt and Dustin looks at Pat and says ‘What happens now?’

“And Pat’s like “We go home! That’s what happens now!”

Harman’s impersonation of Johnson and Perez had the hosts rolling but according to Harman “Pat tells the story much better than I do.”

The Vestaburg resident was scooting around the track in a highly modified John Deere lawn mower for heats and a 15-lap feature race in front of hundreds of spectators in the grandstands.

""People ask me 'What do you do on the weekends?'"" Freeman said. ""I race lawn mowers. It's definitely something different.""

The United States Lawnmower Racing Association hosted exhibition races at the fairgrounds for the first time as a potential test run for future events at the site and to help grow the sport in the region.

""We said we would come out and get a bunch of racers together and show what we can do and then hopefully we'll have a future race here"" said Chris Webb a scorekeeper for the USLMRA. ""Mowers from all over the United State would come; hundreds and hundreds of mowers.""

MORE: Calhoun County Fair organizers expecting 'record crowds' this year

The first USLMRA races were held in 1992 but the motorsport dates back to 1962 when the first organized lawn mower race was held in Indiana. Each year the organization hosts about 150 races with its regional affiliates including the Michigan Mower Racing Association.

Drivers as young as 8 can race with parental permission. All cutting blades are removed and the mower must originally have been designed or sold commercially to mow lawns. There are at least five classes from a straight-from-the-factory stock class to the highly modified FX (factory experimental) mowers.

Since crashes are part of the sport there is a tethered kill switch on each mower and drivers are required to wear a helmet a neck brace pants long sleeves and gloves.

""You are constantly tweaking stuff fixing stuff"" Freeman said. ""Especially when you hit the hay bales.""

The MLB played its first ever regular season game in Iowa on Thursday. The game went down in history and was the most watch regular season game in 16 years.

As the excitement winds down the preparation began for the one night two years ago when Brightview sports turf began building the second ball field among the corn fields.

“We went about a thousand feet from home plate to home plate. That’s where we picked the site we needed for the ball field"" said president Murray Cook.

But no ball game is complete with out the fans in the stands. That is where Iatse came to build the amenities for the 8000 fans.

“We do audio lighting video electrics carpentry there's just so many things that go into it"" said union stage hand Shawn Fay.

After the win from the Chicago White Sox the stands have to come down. Construction to disassemble the temporary stands will take about a week and a half to complete. It took five weeks to get it up.

“They’re taking everything down. We got quite a bit down already. We’re taking out all the electrical the air conditioning. Everything has just got to go. They’re leaving very little. There’s not much that’s going to stay"" said Fay.

However the ball field will stay. Brightview said they will be working with local companies to keep the grounds maintained to a certain level.

""We have a great relationship with John Deere another local company. They have been phenomenal with providing equipment and materials and so we’ll be leaning on them for equipment. We'll have a staff of a couple guys there to take care of it"" said Cook.

The iconic line from the movie ""Is this heaven? No it's Iowa"" was chanted out loud by fans before the first pitch. The reality of having the field in Iowa is the harsh winters.

Crews will begin prepping for snow and cold temperatures before we know it.

“We will be winterizing the field as it relates to the irritation system. Draining the lines so those don’t break because it gets really cold' said Cook ""we’ll have some turf growth blankets well put out to kind of keep and help reduce the amount of winter kill you might get.""

The MLB announced they will be back for another game next August. Fans and crews are already looking forward to bringing professional baseball back to Iowa.

""So we’ll wake it back up when they wake the corn back up in March early April and take it from there"" said Cook.

Delta has issued the following statement:

Effective immediately Delta is making the following permanent changes for travel within the U.S. (including Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands): Eliminating the $150 redeposit fee to cancel an award ticket and the $150 reissue fee to change an award ticket for all SkyMiles Members. This covers travel on all tickets excluding Basic Economy fares.

Allowing changes and cancellations on award tickets before departure for all SkyMiles Members excluding Basic Economy fares. No longer will changes and cancellations made within 72 hours of departure result in the loss of miles on domestic award tickets.

AA Changes Basic Economy

American Airlines announced a number of changes to basic economy:

In addition to enjoying Priority Access/Preferred Boarding our elite members who purchase a Basic Economy fare will now be able to access their: Upgrade privileges.

Elite seat privileges including access to Main Cabin Preferred and Main Cabin Extra seats.

Same-day confirmed flight change benefit. Effective Jan. 1 2021 Basic Economy tickets will no longer earn elite qualifying dollars miles or segments toward future status.

View the current offers here.

The term 'Spirit Airlines' evokes lots of emotions especially in light of some of the airline's recent operational challenges. But while that was a pretty terrible run of events for the airline and its passengers during times of normal operations Spirit can be an affordable and underrated way to get across the country (and beyond).

Flying Spirit can be a solid choice even if you decide to sit in the admittedly cramped economy seats. But Spirit also has bigger seats at the front of the plane that it calls Big Front Seats. And if you book these Spirit seats you can fly in what is essentially a domestic first-class seat for at least 50% off the regular cost on most traditional airlines.

Spirit's Big Front Seats are in the first couple of rows of each aircraft. And if you've never flown in them you may be surprised by the experience -- in a good way. They are essentially the same as other domestic first-class seats available on most U.S. airlines but are usually available for a much lower price.

What are Spirit Airlines Big Front Seats?

On Spirit Airlines every advance seat assignment costs extra whether you pick the last row or the first row. The difference of course is how much the various seat assignments cost. Unquestionably Big Front Seats cost several times more than any other seat on the Spirit aircraft.

Spirit's Big Front Seats are covered in leather have 36 inches of pitch and are 18.5 inches wide. This means you have an additional six inches of legroom beyond Spirit's standard seats and they are two across per side of the aisle instead of three with the regular seats.

As with all Spirit's seats Big Front Seats come ""pre-reclined."" So you can't change the recline on a Big Front Seat.

Big Front Seat on Spirit Airlines (Photo by Javier Rodriguez/The Points Guy)

I've flown in both types of seats with Spirit — multiple times.

Historically the easy advice to give is that yes Spirit's Big Front Seats are absolutely worth it. But since that's just too easy of an answer (and prices seem to have recently increased) I'll be slightly more nuanced.

Related: 8 thoughts after first Spirit Airlines flight in several years

When are Spirit's Big Front Seats worth it?

If the flight is short (less than two to three hours) you are on the smaller side and every dollar counts skip Spirit's Big Front Seats if you can't justify the cost.

For a family of four even a $60 Big Front Seat upgrade would result in $480 of additional charges based on round-trip travel. This is not a small amount especially if you're traveling on a budget.

Spirit's Big Front Seats don't get you any included bags snacks or other perks besides the larger seat. So keeping that cash safely tucked in your wallet can sometimes make sense. After all you're probably flying Spirit because it's cheap not because it's luxurious or comfortable.

But on the other hand if you can fly in a nice big seat for far less than the cost of an economy ticket on another airline it's worth considering.

I've found that when you fly in the Big Front Seats you are often with small business owners and relatively frequent flyers who largely put on their headphones and sleep or work (since the trays are actually large enough up there for a laptop). In that way it ends up feeling a lot like every other airline.

It can also make sense to book the Big Front Seats if you want more space. My husband is a taller guy and while he doesn't get especially excited about flying Spirit he will agree to it if -- and only if -- we book the Big Front Seats. On our recent flight home to Houston from Las Vegas Spirit had a good departure time and a much lower price than United even when factoring in the additional $68 fee per seat Big Front Seat assignment. So we booked Big Front Seats and didn't look back.

Happy kids in Spirit's Big Front Seats. (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

How much does the Big Front Seat cost?

The price of a Big Front Seat upgrade varies based on your flight and if you have elite status. I've seen the price for a Big Front Seat cost a little bit less for those logged in with Gold elite status but only by a few dollars.

While you can see the number of available Big Front Seats when pricing out Spirit flights you don't see the actual upgrade price until much further in the booking process. I've seen these upgrades start at around $20 per person on shorter flights in the past. But currently the lowest prices I'm seeing are in the $40 to $60 range.

(Screenshot courtesy of spirit.com)

In test searches done for updating this article the cost to select a Big Front Seat is currently much higher than it used to be.

In fact on many of the routes I tested Big Front Seats now cost $100 or more per flight. However I rarely found routes higher than $100 even just a few weeks ago. In my recent tests I found a handful of shorter routes (such as Los Angeles to Las Vegas) priced at under $100 for the Big Front Seats. But on average the prices were twice what I used to see and can frequently be in the $100 to $140 range.

(Screenshot courtesy of spirit.com)

Here's a current real-life example.

A month from now Spirit Airlines wants $54 to fly in a standard seat without a specific advance seat assignment from Houston to Las Vegas on a Saturday night. Going for an assigned Big Front Seat adds $135 for a total of $189 for a pretty comfy nonstop ride to Vegas.

United wants $242 for the same route at about the same time on a basic economy fare that also wouldn't come with an advance seat assignment. A regular economy ticket with a seat assignment on United costs $281. United's domestic first-class seat which is basically the same as Spirit's Big Front Seat rings in on that flight at $510 — over 2.5 times the cost of Spirit's similarly sized seat.

Related: Style vs. savings: Comparing JetBlue's Mint Studio and Spirit's Big Front Seat

That's a pretty good example that even with higher prices for the Big Front Seat than I'm used to it's still possible to save real money over the traditional air carriers' cheapest economy tickets while still sitting in a much larger Spirit Big Front Seat. Of course there are other trade-offs to factor into the equation when deciding to fly Spirit. But on a seat-to-seat comparison Spirit's Big Front Seats are often one of the best values in the sky for those looking for a little more than just the cheapest available seat.

It's also worth noting that in Spirit's new frequent flyer program you now earn 12 to 20 points per dollar (depending on your status level) for ancillary charges such as Big Front Seat assignments. TPG values Spirit points at 1.1 cents each which means that you'll essentially earn a 13 to 22% return in Spirit points on any money you spend to reserve Big Front Seats.

We've also experienced Big Front Seat purchases counting towards cards' annual travel and airline fee credits with cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve and The Platinum Card® from American Express (enrollment required). If you have a card like that in your wallet that's a way to potentially enjoy some extra space when flying with Spirit without spending as much out of pocket for the 'upgrade.'

Bottom line

You may not always need a larger seat to get where you're going with Spirit. Sometimes the cheapest available ticket is the best one for the situation. However if your budget can accommodate the added cost of a Spirit Airlines Big Front Seat your back — and perhaps your mood — will probably thank you for the extra investment in the journey.

If I'm flying with my two kids it sometimes makes more sense for us to sit three across in less expensive seats than spend several hundred dollars more on the Big Front Seats. But on the flip side if I'm flying by myself or just with my husband who really appreciates the extra space then paying for Big Front Seats can make sense.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMTQvdGhpcy1pcy1ob3ctcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy1hY2hpZXZlZC0xMDAtY3Jldy12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi1hZ2FpbnN0LWNvdmlkLTE5LXdpdGhvdXQtaXNzdWluZy1hLW1hbmRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This is How Qatar Airways Achieved 100% Crew Vaccination Against COVID-19 Without Issuing a Mandate,"Qatar Airways has quietly become one of the very few airlines that can boast of having 100 per cent of operating cabin crew vaccinated against COVID-19 and it did so a spokesperson says without ever having to issue a formal mandate for employees to get vaccinated or get fired.

The news that Qatar Airways has achieved what few other airlines have managed comes at a time that corporations are weighing up the benefits of issuing vaccine mandates. The pressure to decide has become even greater after United Airlines became the first U.S. carrier to announce compulsory employee vaccination.

That announcement was quickly followed by similar vaccine mandates from Frontier and Hawaiian Airlines but the likes of American Airlines and Southwest are standing firm in their decision to leave vaccination as an individual choice. Delta Air Lines is likely to issue a mandate as soon as a vaccine gets full FDA approval.

There are obvious ethical and legal questions to be considered before issuing a vaccine mandate and so it’s no surprise that some airlines aren’t immediately following in the lead of United. Eventually however it might transpire that duty of care obligations dictate mandatory vaccination (an issue that Alaska Airlines is considering) but we’re not quite there yet.

So how did Qatar Airways achieve 100 per cent crew vaccination without threatening dismissal against vaccine-hesitant workers?

Unlike the United States cabin crew in Qatar weren’t immediately prioritised for the vaccine and supply issues meant that Qatar hasn’t had a surplus of vaccines that are going to waste either. But when crew did become eligible they had a simple choice – get vaccinated or have an invasive COVID-19 test every few days to prove your negative status.

It appears that the incentive of avoiding regular testing alongside education and incentives was enough to convince enough cabin crew to get vaccinated without the need for a mandate.

Qatar Airways’ employee demographic may also play into vaccine uptake but the fact that Qatar has only approved the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines could also have improved employee trust in the vaccination programme.

Rival airline Etihad Airlines was the first airline in the world in February to achieve full vaccination amongst operating cabin crew and pilots and it did so with the Chinese manufactured Sinopharm vaccine. Some crew however refused to take the vaccine and were simply placed on administrative leave.

Despite its early successes Etihad says 92 per cent of staff based in the UAE have chosen to be vaccinated. The Abu Dhabi-based airline doesn’t yet appear to be under any pressure to extend its vaccine mandate beyond flight crew.

In comparison Delta is under pressure to issue a vaccine mandate although through voluntary measures alone around 73 per cent of eligible U.S.-based employees are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

So how could this play out over the coming weeks and months? Frontier has also opted for a hybrid model that allows employees to choose between vaccination or regular testing. It’s a policy that other airlines are likely to follow while also limiting what unvaccinated employees can do – such as removing flight benefits or barring crew from working certain flights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMjE4NzY3L3RoZS1yZWFzb24teW91LW1pZ2h0LW5vdC1iZS1hYmxlLXRvLWdldC1hLWJsb29keS1tYXJ5LW9uLXlvdXItbmV4dC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Reason You Might Not Be Able To Get A Bloody Mary On Your Next Flight,"The Reason You Might Not Be Able To Get A Bloody Mary On Your Next Flight

The world's airlines are taking off again after the COVID-19 crisis almost completely stalled their business (via FlightGlobal). Returning passengers may want a glass of Chablis or a double bloody mary to calm the usual flight jitters and ease their nerves about traveling again especially since the CDC warns that air travel is risky because social distancing can't always be maintained. But fliers might get a tall glass of disappointment instead. Several airlines are restricting alcohol on flights or banning it altogether (via CNN).

The airlines aren't trying to make their passengers any grumpier than they already might be. Carriers around the globe such as Delta American Airlines and KLM have come to this decision out of a concern for travelers' health. The restrictions are intended to limit up-close interactions between fliers and flight attendants and airlines really want their customers to keep their face masks on to best protect themselves and others. (Someone should alert the airlines to these really cool face masks on Etsy with holes just big enough to fit a drinking straw through.) Plus more imbibing means more trips to the bathroom something flight attendants are trying to closely manage."

The company operates a footprint of more than 60 data centers around the world providing services to more than 2300 leading enterprises and U.S. federal government agencies. It provides data center colocation enterprise application cloud computing hybrid cloud cyber security and analytics solutions to government enterprises and service providers. It offers Cyxtera Portal enabling customers to monitor manage and control their digital infrastructure from a single dedicated platform; colocation services; data center services; Cyxtera Extensible Data Center platform a platform that transforms IT infrastructure design configuration and deployment. The company also provides AppGate SDP a network security platform to secure any application; and AppGate Insight which provides cloud and network architects visibility into all of the network traffic. In addition it offers threat analytics safe browsing and detect monitoring services.

Activist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive operational activism experience helping boards and management teams run companies more efficiently and improving margins. This is their 102nd 13D filing. In those 102 filings they have averaged a return of 30.25% versus 13.76% for the S&P 500. Their average 13D hold time is 18 months.

On July 29 2021 Cyxtera Technologies Inc. completed its business combination with Starboard Value Acquisition Corp the SPAC sponsored by Starboard Value. In connection with the transaction Starboard Value Acquisition Corp. changed its name to Cyxtera Technologies and changed its stock symbol from SVAC to CYXT.

Starboard is an extremely skilled and respected activist investor who has created significant shareholder value for themselves and other shareholders of their portfolio companies. However this is not shareholder activism. Cyxtera was brought public through a merger with a SPAC backed by Starboard and now Starboard owns 21.8% of the company on its own but holds 81.3% as part of a 13D group with other investors pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement. This is not Starboard identifying an undervalued public company and being the catalyst to close that valuation gap. This is Starboard using their valuation and operating skills to bring a presumably fairly valued private company public and creating shareholder value by growing it and operating it efficiently.

While the filing implies that the Starboard Sponsor owns the low-priced stock and the Starboard clients own the high-priced shares this is not the case and Starboard actually created a structure that is very friendly to the Starboard clients. All of the economics (including the sponsor shares and warrants) go to the Starboard clients and Starboard makes its hedge fund promote on any profits just like any other Starboard portfolio investment. As a result Starboard investors are in this investment for an aggregate average cost of $6.54 per share instead of $9.68 per share that the Starboard investors paid for their shares and the $1.07 per share the Founders paid for their shares. This completely aligns Starboard's interest with its investors and more closely aligns it with the other shareholders of the company who are in closer to the $10 per share SPAC price.

Cyxtera was previously owned by CenturyLink (now called Lumen Technologies) before it was sold to Medina Capital and BC Partners who partnered together to acquire the assets. Manny Medina and Nelson Fonseca both of Medina Capital had previous experience in this space together. Medina built Terremark Worldwide with Fonseca as his second. Terremark Worldwide was eventually acquired by Verizon and the two saw firsthand how larger connectivity companies like Verizon and CenturyLink are good at selling network access but do not focus as much on optimizing the data centers.

So when CenturyLink was selling Cyxtera Medina and Fonseca recognized an opportunity to run the Cyxtera data centers in a more focused manner and with the ability to offer connectivity and other services to its clients through multiple carriers (not just CenturyLink) in addition to other value-added solutions for their clients like data center as a service or AI as a service solution. Medina and Fonseca have been doing just that for the past 3.5 years but now are ready to take it to the next level through the merger with the Starboard SPAC.

The SPAC structure offers the company many advantages to allow it to grow at a quicker rate. First it has a professional board (including Jeff Smith of Starboard) with diverse experience to oversee management. Second as a public more transparent company it has much more credibility in attracting large clients who can now do their due diligence quicker before signing long-term contracts and have the confidence that they are dealing with a public government regulated entity. Lastly having better and quicker access to capital will allow the company to grow quicker whether inorganically or through M&A.

This should help the company close the large valuation gap it has with its peers. It currently trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 15x while its peers trade at much higher levels — Equinix at 29.62x Digital Realty at 30.89x CyrusOne at 23.77x and Switch at 29.98x. Moreover Blackstone recently acquired peer QTS Realty Trust at a valuation of 27x EBITDA.

DG,Dollar General,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zb21lLXNtYWxsLW1pbm5lc290YS10b3ducy1wdXNoLWJhY2stYWdhaW5zdC1kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC82MDAwODc5NTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some small Minnesota towns push back against Dollar General,"Dollar stores have multiplied across the U.S. in staggering fashion the last few years — more according to one recent count than the number of Walmart and McDonald's locations combined.

Inexpensive food and steep discounts at stores like Dollar General Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have proved a strong draw for customers in low-income big-city neighborhoods and small towns alike. But consequences for local businesses especially grocery stores have locals in some places including several small Minnesota towns organizing to push back.

""It was a battle but we won it"" said Carol Atkins the mayor of Wabasso Minn.

Earlier this year the City Council in the southwest Minnesota town of 765 people passed a one-year commercial development moratorium shortly after declining a request by Dollar General to annex a piece of adjacent farmland where it wanted to build a new store.

""They just care about coming in and making money. They don't care about your town and your people"" Atkins said. ""The family that owns our grocery store they make deliveries and they support our schools and do everything they can to support the town. Dollar General ain't going do that.""

A spokeswoman for Dollar General which is headquartered in suburban Nashville said that the company ""strives to be a positive business partner and a good community neighbor"" and that ""millions of Americans rely on Dollar General to provide convenient affordable access to the everyday products they need and want.""

Dollar General has more than 17000 locations nationwide. Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores which are now owned by the same company bring the total to well more than 30000 dollar stores nationwide.

Wabasso residents still don't have to go far to find one. There are locations in numerous nearby towns including Redwood Falls Marshall Cottonwood Tracy Springfield and Fairfax.

""We are seeing more communities around the country concerned about this over-proliferation"" said Kennedy Smith senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) a nonprofit that fights corporate consolidation and which has an office in Minneapolis. ""It's likely you already have a couple in your area. Do you really need more?""

Critics see not just threats to existing businesses but also a disincentive to prospective new retailers once a dollar store has set up in town. An ILSR report in 2018 on the spread of dollar chain stores cited studies that found local grocers typically see a 30% sales drop after a Dollar General opened a decline that makes it tough for businesses that operate on thin profit margins.

A 2019-20 survey of Minnesota's rural grocers by University of Minnesota Extension found more than half of those who participated had a dollar store move into their community in the previous five years and another 11% knew of plans for one. The survey found 80% of rural grocers knew of a dollar store within 15 miles.

Most dollar stores offer limited options or no fresh-food options in favor of high-calorie processed foods salty snacks and sugary beverages.

While the grocers who participated in the survey ""were concerned about a significant loss in profit when dollar stores move into the community the most common wider community response to the presence of a dollar store is concern over the lack of healthy and fresh foods"" read the survey report which was led by Kathy Draeger of the Extension's Regional Sustainable Development Partnerships.

Dollar General has started expanding its fresh-food options in some places. The company now offers some fresh options at 1300 locations with plans to eventually expand that to 10000 stores according to a July article in Forbes. The company won praise earlier this year when it became the first major retailer to announce it would give employees the equivalent of four hours of pay if they got vaccinated for COVID-19.

But more communities around the country have been moving to block the stores. This year alone towns and small cities in Wisconsin Iowa Ohio Tennessee Maryland New Jersey North Carolina and Alabama have rejected dollar store development plans according to ILSR's research.

Larger cities like Tulsa Okla. also have passed ordinances that clamp down on the number of dollar stores that can be located in low-income neighborhoods which often suffer from a lack of fresh grocery options.

Wabasso isn't even the only small town in Redwood County that has rejected Dollar General.

Just 20 miles east in Morgan population 872 officials and residents banded together at the beginning of the year to persuade the Redwood County Planning Commission and Redwood County Board to reject zoning that would have let Dollar General build on farmland just outside city limits.

""I think what hit home here was what happened in Fairfax"" said Daryl Seifert who co-owns Becker Supervalu in Morgan which has been in his wife's family for three generations. ""Their grocery store didn't last six months after the Dollar General came in. And that's a bigger town than we are.""

A petition against Dollar General's plans to set up in Morgan drew several hundred signatures in a matter of days said Mayor Jerry Huiras. He said Seifert's meat-cutting skills alone made it worthwhile.

""You'll never have a better steak"" Huiras said. ""And you're not going to get that at the Dollar General.""

Not every local rebellion has been successful. In tiny Cormorant Village near Detroit Lakes the Village Board in 2018 asked the Becker County Board to reject a rezoning request sought by Dollar General. The board went ahead with it.

""I haven't stepped foot in there"" Steve Sorenson a member of the Village Board said of the store. ""Nothing personal against it.""

Paul Sobocinski is a hog farmer near Wabasso and a former Land Stewardship Project organizer who worked with residents of Wabasso and Morgan against Dollar General's plans. He said the Minnesota Farmers Union has connected some of the newly minted activists with the state Attorney General's Office about steps the state might take to crack down on dollar stores for anti-competitive practices.

While food products at dollar stores seem to carry less expensive prices customers often end up paying more per ounce because dollar stores package food in smaller portions said Smith the ILSR researcher.

John Stiles spokesman for Attorney General Keith Ellison said he could ""neither confirm nor deny"" that the agency is investigating dollar store practices. But he provided a statement from Ellison.

""It's hard enough for Minnesotans to afford their lives and it's even harder for folks in rural communities be it through higher prices or lack of access or competition in services supplies and retail"" Ellison said.

In Wabasso the one-year moratorium on commercial development will expire early next year. In the meantime Atkins said the City Council is reworking the town's strategic development plan in hopes it can be used to encourage certain types of new businesses and discourage others.

""We want a Main Street with buildings that are not sitting empty"" Atkins said.

Larry Thompson the city administrator said the opposition to Dollar General in Wabasso was not universal. ""There were certainly people that wanted to see it come in as well"" he said.

The Dollar General spokeswoman said the company has no plans to open new stores in Redwood County.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqYmYuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUtbmV3cy9zdG9yZS1jbGVyay1zaG90LWF0LXdyZW5zLWZhbWlseS1kb2xsYXIv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2piZi5jb20vbmV3cy9jcmltZS1uZXdzL3N0b3JlLWNsZXJrLXNob3QtYXQtd3JlbnMtZmFtaWx5LWRvbGxhci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man believed connected to Wrens Family Dollar shooting Graniteville murder,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wjbf.com/news/crime-news/store-clerk-shot-at-wrens-family-dollar/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqYmYuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUtbmV3cy9zdG9yZS1jbGVyay1zaG90LWF0LXdyZW5zLWZhbWlseS1kb2xsYXIv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2piZi5jb20vbmV3cy9jcmltZS1uZXdzL3N0b3JlLWNsZXJrLXNob3QtYXQtd3JlbnMtZmFtaWx5LWRvbGxhci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLWJ1c2luZXNzLXN0b3JpZXMtYW1hem9uLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWNvbXBhbmllcy11bml0ZS0yMDIxLTjSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3RvcC1idXNpbmVzcy1zdG9yaWVzLWFtYXpvbi1kZWxpdmVyeS1jb21wYW5pZXMtdW5pdGUtMjAyMS04P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top business stories Amazon delivery companies unite,"Hello!

The Front Door Collective is a new national delivery player launched by more than 100 Amazon delivery companies.

Front Door Collective



What's trending this morning:

A coalition of more than 100 small delivery companies have come together to form the Frontdoor Collective. They claim that together they can make upwards of 1 million deliveries per day – and compete directly with delivery giants UPS and FedEx.

The giants of the delivery world have a new challenger to contend with and it's like nothing they've seen before.

It's not a gig-economy startup or a massive foreign corporation coming to America. It's the Frontdoor Collective a coalition of more than 100 small businesses the vast majority of them delivering packages for Amazon. Some say they are frustrated by deteriorating returns and limited growth potential and they have banded together to form their own last-mile delivery company.

The collective has been onboarding small delivery companies via a franchise model with the promise of unlocking new sources of revenue by contracting directly with retailers other than Amazon. As speed becomes more important to retailers the collective's national footprint could become a serious concern for UPS and FedEx.

As offices reopen managers need to recognize the challenges that working mothers face on a personal and professional level. Pandemic-related challenges at home can impact job performance and it's up to employers to accommodate these challenges:

Expanding employee benefits and devising flexible ways of working that support mothers and families are imperative particularly as mental-health issues skyrocket.

The toll of mental load which refers to the invisible chores and emotional labor involved in running a household is one of the primary culprits per an economist.

Roughly 9.8 million working mothers in America suffered from workplace burnout in 2020 according to a survey. Mothers were 28% more likely to experience burnout than fathers and cases were higher among Black Asian and Hispanic women.

Dollar General has over 17000 stores but their new ambitions extend past shopping bargains. Along with their new medical chief the company is making moves to break into healthcare delivery. Analysts laid out three strategies that could lead to their success:

But if Dollar General is serious about helping its communities it could usher in a new era of healthcare access for many Americans across the country experts said.

The sheer volume of Dollar General locations could displace the center of gravity in the fight to win over rural Americans as the place to go for their health. Dollar General could also benefit patients who live in areas where primary care or specialists are hard to come by.

By offering over-the-counter medications online prescription ordering or telemedicine consultations Dollar General could improve America's healthcare system for people who historically have been left behind.

Increasingly Amazon Web Services is walking a fine line with developing its cloud services network of 100000 partners including software maker Snowflake. AWS pushes constantly for cloud development and greater sales – which results in clashes between the company and its partners per internal memos.

Last year an AWS ""Premier"" consulting partner complained about getting ""completely shut out"" from discussions between its customers and AWS representatives according to an internal AWS report viewed by Insider.



""2W feels that AWS sellers too often use the veil of 'customer obsession' to justify moving direct whereas the motivation is often the quota compensation or account control issue"" an AWS employee wrote in the internal report.



Some 2nd Watch salespeople ""are afraid to submit opportunities in ACE for fear that AWS will take them direct in 6 months"" the internal AWS report said.

Finally here are some headlines you might have missed last week.

– Matt",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NhbmRzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA4L3N3aXRjaGJhY2stcmMtb3duZXJzLXN0ZWVyLWludG8tbmV3LWRyaXZlLXRocnUtY2FycnlvdXQtdmVudHVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Switchback RC owners steer into new drive-thru carryout venture,"LOWELL — Four months after Switchback RC in the Village opened on Third Street a drive-thru and carryout opened in the same building.

In what was a former Dollar General owners of the venue for remote control enthusiasts talked about opening the rest of the building sometime in the future.

This week the Switchback 185 drive-thru and carryout saw its first customers.

Owner and Lowell resident Zack Perine said he went to his future competition and realized how much gas was sold in comparison to other items.

“I decided to do it because the community needed it” he said adding Monday was the first day and he was extremely happy with the turnout.

Another reason he wanted to open it at the Third Street location was the proximity to the older community.

“I looked at the weather like the rain and snow and the cold when no one wanted to go out” he said. “This would be a prime location for it.”

He said they are looking at expanding their products but right now they offer “ice cream sundaes and milkshakes hot subs fresh salads and cold subs.”

There are also roller grill items with homemade sauce along with sloppy joes.

According to the menu there are five types of salads six types of subs chicken wraps hot dogs soft serve ice cream ice cream cookies root beer floats and “boozy” shakes such as the Cinnamon Bomb and the Banana Rama.

Perine said he hopes the business takes off through word of mouth.

“We have an outdoor seating area out back that should seat close to 40” he said. “We want to get permitted to be able to drink out there … have a beer with your lunch.”

He said a goal is to have a comedian or musician there once or twice a month on Fridays.

Much of what they sell from the milk to meats are locally sourced.

“Anything except corporate stuff that I have to get through a distributor like Pepsi and beer” Perine said.

If there are special requests from someone who is a regular customer they will be glad to order the item and stock it he said.

“That’s a big thing a lot of people like. With big corporate gas stations it is what it is” Perine noted.

The drive-thru doors also fit any size vehicle from duallies to 4-wheelers to bicycles.

“We even have walk up” he said. “It doesn’t matter how they get in here.”

(WRDW/WAGT) - It was a violent weekend across the CSRA with two related shootings killing a teenager and injuring two people leaving authorities looking for links between those shootings and a third one that injured a driver.

The fatal shooting killed 14-year-old Nathaniel Johnson at his home in Graniteville just three hours after authorities say the same suspect shot a clerk at a Family Dollar store in Wrens . And just before the Wrens shooting a driver was shot on Deans Bridge Road .

Larry Bernard McKie Jr. 30 was arrested after the fatal shooting of Johnson who’s being remembered as “a smart obedient person” who always had a smile on his face and was fun to be around .

Johnson was a rising ninth-grader who was going to be attending Midland Valley High School and a former student at Leavelle McCampbell Middle School according to the Aiken County Public School District.

“It just tore me up” said James Cosnahan a neighbor of Johnson.

“It’s just not right it’s just not right for a 14-year-old boy to lose his life” said Cosnahan.

The Aiken County school district issued a statement saying educators were “extremely heavyhearted and heartbroken as a school district family” over the “contemptible act of gun violence in our Aiken County community.”

The district continued: “We send all of our thoughts and prayers to Nathaniel’s family and friends.”

Here’s what happened

The string of shootings began around 8:06 a.m. Saturday when a female was driving north around the 5100 block of Deans Bridge Road.

Someone in an unknown vehicle pulled up next to her and shot her. The Richmond County Sheriff’s Office says the victim was transported to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening.

Authorities are working to determine whether the shooting was related to the other two. Deans Bridger Road does lead from Augusta to Wrens and authorities said Sunday that the suspect was a black male driving a black car  the same as in the other shootings. The Richmond County Sheriff’s Office expected to have a more definitive answer Monday on whether the shootings might be related.

Nearly an hour after the Dean Bridge Road shooting a man entered the Family Dollar at 505 N. Main St. in Wrens at 8:55 a.m. produced a handgun from his pocket and fired multiple shots at the store clerk striking her at least once according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

When officers got there the victim 37-year-old Cynthia Whiting was alert and talking. She was transported to an Augusta-area medical facility for treatment. The GBI says Whiting is an employee of the store but they don’t believe this was a robbery or the suspect knew the woman.

The suspect identified as McKie then exited the store and entered a black four-door 2018-2019 Hyundai Sonata and left traveling south on U.S. 1 according to authorities.

Later Saturday morning the Aiken County Sheriff’s Office says around 11:51 a.m. they received a 911 call saying that one man was shot in is arm and leg and another person Johnson was shot to death.

They say when deputies arrived they found people inside the house restraining McKie. According to a family member Mckie lived in the house on Saddlebrook Trail. The injured man who is identified as Mckie’s father was taken to the hospital and McKie was booked into Aiken County Detention Center.

Larry McKie Jr. (WRDW)

Inexpensive food and steep discounts at stores like Dollar General Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have proved a strong draw for customers in low-income big-city neighborhoods and small towns alike. But consequences for local businesses especially grocery stores have locals in some places including several small Minnesota towns organizing to push back.

""It was a battle but we won it"" said Carol Atkins the mayor of Wabasso Minn.

Earlier this year the City Council in the southwest Minnesota town of 765 people passed a one-year commercial development moratorium shortly after declining a request by Dollar General to annex a piece of adjacent farmland where it wanted to build a new store.

""They just care about coming in and making money. They don't care about your town and your people"" Atkins said. ""The family that owns our grocery store they make deliveries and they support our schools and do everything they can to support the town. Dollar General ain't going do that.""

A spokeswoman for Dollar General which is headquartered in suburban Nashville said that the company ""strives to be a positive business partner and a good community neighbor"" and that ""millions of Americans rely on Dollar General to provide convenient affordable access to the everyday products they need and want.""

Dollar General has more than 17000 locations nationwide. Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores which are now owned by the same company bring the total to well more than 30000 dollar stores nationwide.

Wabasso residents still don't have to go far to find one. There are locations in numerous nearby towns including Redwood Falls Marshall Cottonwood Tracy Springfield and Fairfax.

""We are seeing more communities around the country concerned about this over-proliferation"" said Kennedy Smith senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) a nonprofit that fights corporate consolidation and which has an office in Minneapolis. ""It's likely you already have a couple in your area. Do you really need more?""

Critics see not just threats to existing businesses but also a disincentive to prospective new retailers once a dollar store has set up in town. An ILSR report in 2018 on the spread of dollar chain stores cited studies that found local grocers typically see a 30% sales drop after a Dollar General opened a decline that makes it tough for businesses that operate on thin profit margins.

A 2019-20 survey of Minnesota's rural grocers by University of Minnesota Extension found more than half of those who participated had a dollar store move into their community in the previous five years and another 11% knew of plans for one. The survey found 80% of rural grocers knew of a dollar store within 15 miles.

Most dollar stores offer limited options or no fresh-food options in favor of high-calorie processed foods salty snacks and sugary beverages.

While the grocers who participated in the survey ""were concerned about a significant loss in profit when dollar stores move into the community the most common wider community response to the presence of a dollar store is concern over the lack of healthy and fresh foods"" read the survey report which was led by Kathy Draeger of the Extension's Regional Sustainable Development Partnerships.

Dollar General has started expanding its fresh-food options in some places. The company now offers some fresh options at 1300 locations with plans to eventually expand that to 10000 stores according to a July article in Forbes. The company won praise earlier this year when it became the first major retailer to announce it would give employees the equivalent of four hours of pay if they got vaccinated for COVID-19.

But more communities around the country have been moving to block the stores. This year alone towns and small cities in Wisconsin Iowa Ohio Tennessee Maryland New Jersey North Carolina and Alabama have rejected dollar store development plans according to ILSR's research.

Larger cities like Tulsa Okla. also have passed ordinances that clamp down on the number of dollar stores that can be located in low-income neighborhoods which often suffer from a lack of fresh grocery options.

Wabasso isn't even the only small town in Redwood County that has rejected Dollar General.

Just 20 miles east in Morgan population 872 officials and residents banded together at the beginning of the year to persuade the Redwood County Planning Commission and Redwood County Board to reject zoning that would have let Dollar General build on farmland just outside city limits.

""I think what hit home here was what happened in Fairfax"" said Daryl Seifert who co-owns Becker Supervalu in Morgan which has been in his wife's family for three generations. ""Their grocery store didn't last six months after the Dollar General came in. And that's a bigger town than we are.""

A petition against Dollar General's plans to set up in Morgan drew several hundred signatures in a matter of days said Mayor Jerry Huiras. He said Seifert's meat-cutting skills alone made it worthwhile.

""You'll never have a better steak"" Huiras said. ""And you're not going to get that at the Dollar General.""

Not every local rebellion has been successful. In tiny Cormorant Village near Detroit Lakes the Village Board in 2018 asked the Becker County Board to reject a rezoning request sought by Dollar General. The board went ahead with it.

""I haven't stepped foot in there"" Steve Sorenson a member of the Village Board said of the store. ""Nothing personal against it.""

Paul Sobocinski is a hog farmer near Wabasso and a former Land Stewardship Project organizer who worked with residents of Wabasso and Morgan against Dollar General's plans. He said the Minnesota Farmers Union has connected some of the newly minted activists with the state Attorney General's Office about steps the state might take to crack down on dollar stores for anti-competitive practices.

While food products at dollar stores seem to carry less expensive prices customers often end up paying more per ounce because dollar stores package food in smaller portions said Smith the ILSR researcher.

John Stiles spokesman for Attorney General Keith Ellison said he could ""neither confirm nor deny"" that the agency is investigating dollar store practices. But he provided a statement from Ellison.

""It's hard enough for Minnesotans to afford their lives and it's even harder for folks in rural communities be it through higher prices or lack of access or competition in services supplies and retail"" Ellison said.

In Wabasso the one-year moratorium on commercial development will expire early next year. In the meantime Atkins said the City Council is reworking the town's strategic development plan in hopes it can be used to encourage certain types of new businesses and discourage others.

""We want a Main Street with buildings that are not sitting empty"" Atkins said.

Larry Thompson the city administrator said the opposition to Dollar General in Wabasso was not universal. ""There were certainly people that wanted to see it come in as well"" he said.

The Dollar General spokeswoman said the company has no plans to open new stores in Redwood County.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito were both wealthier in 2020 than they were in 2018 according to their annual financial disclosures filed earlier this year

Manchin’s estimated net worth for 2020 was $8.6 million compared to $7.6 million for 2018. Capito was worth $2.53 million compared to $2.15 million in 2018.

The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probably range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

For 2020 Manchin’s asset values ranged from $4376067 to $12844100. He reported no liabilities. The midpoint was $8610083.50.

Capito’s assets ranged from $1596629 to $4996000. She reported liabilities ranging from $475005 to $1065000. Using the formula put her range of worth from $531629 to $4520995 with the midpoint at $2526995.

Here’s a look at some selected details from their reports.

Manchin

OpenSecrets ranked Manchin 19th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 67th overall in Congress. OpenSecrets hasn’t yet published its compilation of 2020 filings.

For comparison the richest senator in 2018 was Mark Warner D-Va. worth $214 million. Current Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was worth $1.12 million and current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was worth $34.14 million.

Manchin reported collecting $48282.24 from the state Public Employees Retirement System in 2020.

Members are required to report both their own and their spouse’s assets and liabilities. His wife Gayle Manchin currently co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission holds a savings account worth $500001-$1 million which paid interest ranging from $2501-$5000.

Manchin reported two savings accounts ranging respectively from $100001-$250000 and $50001-$100000. They produced interest ranging from $201-$1000 for the first and less than $201 for the second.

The Joe Manchin III Qualified Blind Trust is worth $500001-$1 million and generated revenue of $5001-$15000.

He owns a storage building in Fairmont worth $50001-$100000 that collected $2501-$5000 in rent. A commercial rental property in Fairmont is worth $250001-$500000 and collected $5001-$15000 in rent and $2382 in “ordinary business income.”

He owns stock in Fairmont-based Enersystems which he founded and is described as providing services and materials for utility plants (according to news reports it supplies coal to Mon Power’s Grant Town plant). The stock is worth $1000001-$5 million and produces $100001-$1 million in dividends plus $491949 in business income.

Manchin holds stock in two Morgantown-based companies. Figure 8 Surgical makes a sternal closure tool. CereDX (now Valtari Bio) is developing a blood test to aid rapid triage in stroke patients. The stock holdings for each is worth $1001 to $15001 and both generate dividends labeled “none” meaning less than $201.

The final asset on Manchin’s list is the house boat that recently made headlines as the site of a gathering of senators from both parties where Sen. Lindsey Graham R-SC subsequently reported testing positive for COVID despite being vaccinated.

Manchin reports the house boat being worth $100001-$250000.

Capito

Open Secrets ranked Capito 46th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 169th overall in Congress.

Capito has a stake in Disney magic. She owns Walt Disney Co. stock worth $15001-$50000.

She and her husband have stock in a number of energy companies: Duke Energy ($1001-$15000) NextEra Energy ($1001-$15000) ExxonMobil ($1001-$15000) Royal Dutch Shell ($1001-$15000) Chevron ($1001-$15000) Phillips 66 ($1001-$15000) Wisconsin Energy ($1001-$15000) and BlackRock ($1001-$15000).

They each have a Wells Fargo bank account each worth $50001-$100000 and they report four separate stock holdings in Wells Fargo. They also have several Citigroup holdings.

Their high-tech stock includes Microsoft Apple AT&T Cisco Verizon and IBM.

Her husband owns stock in Viatris (which closed its Morgantown plant last month) worth $1001-$15000. Their other pharmaceutical holdings include Johnson & Johnson Merck Novartis Pfizer Roche Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

They have a wide variety of holdings in the food industry: General Mills Kellogg McDonald’s J.M. Smucker Coca-Cola Mondelez and PepsiCo.

They have three box stores covered with holdings in WalMart Target and Lowe’s.

Other holdings include Nordstrom UPS Ford Colgate-Palmolive Proctor & Gamble #M and Nike.

Reps. David McKinley Carol Miller and Alex Mooney all had reports due in May and all three filed for extensions. Their new deadline was Friday and a story on their filings will follow after their reports are published.

“Days after Hong Kong lost its biggest teachers’ union the city’s leading civil society voice has also been forced out – disbanding in the face of a long-running campaign to discredit and disable it through a combination of harassment by police and pro-Beijing media.

“The Hong Kong authorities’ assault on human rights has ramped up with these attacks. Along with political parties media outlets and unions we sadly now must add NGOs to the list of those targeted simply for doing their legitimate work.

“The pattern of self-censorship seen this week also signals a concerning domino effect as Hong Kong’s draconian national security law has triggered an accelerating disappearance of independent civil society groups from the city.

“The CHRF has organized often in close collaboration with the police large-scale peaceful rallies in Hong Kong for 20 years without being accused of breaking any law. Its demise is yet more evidence that Hongkongers’ rights to freedom of association expression and peaceful assembly can no longer be taken for granted under the authorities’ obsession with ‘national security’.

“The Hong Kong authorities must respect and ensure the rights of all people to associate freely. Instead of threatening members of civil society organizations with criminal sanctions they should create the best possible enabling environment for the existence and operation of associations including the holding of peaceful assemblies by civil society.”

Background

The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) announced on Sunday that it is disbanding.

The CHRF organized the city’s annual 1 July march between 2003 and 2020. It also organized three police-authorized demonstrations in 2019 that drew millions onto the streets in protest against proposed amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition laws that many feared would lead to people in the city being sent to face trial in mainland China.

On 18 August 2019 police banned CHRF from organizing a march but allowed a rally in Victoria Park. An estimated 1.7 million people peacefully walked along the main streets of Hong Kong as they tried to enter and exit the park and attend the rally.

As part of an investigation into its operations in April 2021 police asked CHRF questions including why it was not registered under Hong Kong’s Societies Ordinance. It was also asked to provide details of its funding and explain why it co-signed a petition to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in December 2020 about excessive use of force by police in Hong Kong.

The police probe followed a series of articles critical of the group in pro-Beijing media outlets in Hong Kong. CHRF ultimately refused to comply with the police’s request.

The disbandment of the CHRF comes less than a week after Hong Kong’s largest teachers’ union the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union (HKPTU) also ceased operations in the face of “enormous pressure” from the authorities. The group had similarly faced criticism in pro-Beijing media and local education authorities subsequently stopped cooperating with the union.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXRsZXJhc2lhLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1tYXJrLWtlbmx5LWRvbWluby10YW4tdGhlLWNoaW5lc2UtZGFuaXNoLWRlc2lnbmVyLW1ha2luZy13YXZlcy1hdC1jb3BlbmhhZ2VuLWZhc2hpb24td2Vla9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: Mark Kenly Domino Tan the Chinese-Danish Designer Making Waves at Copenhagen Fashion Week,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tatlerasia.com/style/fashion/exclusive-mark-kenly-domino-tan-the-chinese-danish-designer-making-waves-at-copenhagen-fashion-week on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXRsZXJhc2lhLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1tYXJrLWtlbmx5LWRvbWluby10YW4tdGhlLWNoaW5lc2UtZGFuaXNoLWRlc2lnbmVyLW1ha2luZy13YXZlcy1hdC1jb3BlbmhhZ2VuLWZhc2hpb24td2Vla9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbC5jb20vbGl2ZXJwb29sLWZjLW5ld3MvdHJhbnNmZXItbmV3cy9saXZlcnBvb2wtdHJhbnNmZXItanVyZ2VuLWtsb3BwLWNvbW1lbnRzLTIxMzAyNDM00gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZXJwb29sLmNvbS9saXZlcnBvb2wtZmMtbmV3cy90cmFuc2Zlci1uZXdzL2xpdmVycG9vbC10cmFuc2Zlci1qdXJnZW4ta2xvcHAtY29tbWVudHMtMjEzMDI0MzQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liverpool transfer domino effect could be set to ignite after Jürgen Klopp 'changes' comments,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Transfers are often like a line of dominoes: when one piece topples a myriad follow in a ripple effect.

As activity intensifies in the market a few Liverpool players could be part of domino effects during the final weeks of the summer transfer window.

Liverpool will be relying on forces out of their control with the club currently in a predicament.

Their current squad size has prohibited Liverpool to bring in extra reinforcements with the club currently possessing an excess of players particularly in the non-homegrown category.

Xherdan Shaqiri's departure to Lyon already looks almost inevitable and that will free up one space. But his departure alone will not be enough.

Fortunately there are a few 'dominoes' that could fall in the coming days and who could affect Liverpool's business positively this summer.

One such transfer is the departure of Jannik Vestergaard from Southampton with the Norwegian set to sign for Leicester City in a £15m deal.

His departure will facilitate the need for Southampton to add a centre-back to their ranks and with Nathaniel Phillips available for the same price after an impressive season the domino effect may lead a path towards Liverpool.

Phillips' departure could provide extra funds in order to bolster Liverpool's transfer kitty. However Vestergaard's domino effect will not solve Liverpool's homegrown problem.

Even with Xherdan Shaqiri's departure Liverpool still have 17 non-homegrown players which is the maximum amount you can register for a Premier League season.

If Liverpool are to enter the market they must trim those 17 players.

The most likely candidates to be cut could be Divock Origi or Loris Karius.

And Origi could be involved in a domino effect of his own.

Patrick Cutrone of Wolves has agreed to a loan move away from the club which could see Bruno Lage's side reignite their interest in Liverpool's Belgian forward.

Origi's departure could then allow Liverpool to enter the market. If they could somehow find a way to cut Loris Karius from the squad too there would be space for even two potential new arrivals to be registered into the club's Premier League squad.

Who those new arrivals will be and whether there will be any remains to be seen.

But one thing is clear: Liverpool's does not appear to be over. Klopp has hinted at that previously in an interview with TV2:

“You have to make changes from time to time but then there must be room to do it. We do not want more players. If something happens somewhere something can happen somewhere else but it makes no sense to add more players.”

The domino effect is what Liverpool's transfer policy will hinge on. And fans will be hoping Michael Edwards will be able to flog some of the club's deadwood in order to bolster the squad before the window shuts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nYmVsaXplbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNS9tYW4tY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW11cmRlci1mb3ItZG9taW5vLWdhbWUtc3RhYmJpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man charged with murder for domino game stabbing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2021/08/15/man-charged-with-murder-for-domino-game-stabbing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nYmVsaXplbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNS9tYW4tY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLW11cmRlci1mb3ItZG9taW5vLWdhbWUtc3RhYmJpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZ3Jvb3ZlY2FydGVsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Fsb2stdmludGFnZS1jdWx0dXJlLWRvbWluby1veGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oxia's techno classic 'Domino' gets a new spin with Alok and Vintage Culture,"ALOK and Vintage Culture have teamed up to reissue Oxia‘s 2006 techno hit “Domino” which is out now on CONTROVERSIA (download).

‘Domino’ a mesmerizing progressive house tune with an emotionally driven 303 bassline and euphoric breaks creates a lasting impact. The tune a version of Oxia‘s techno classic of the same name is filled with brooding synth leads teeming with diversity while imparting character that is unmistakably ALOK & Vintage Culture.

Keeping unaltered the iconic main melody this new version introduces more hypnotic vibes with faster and groovy beats. The wide and heavier bassline flow seamlessly into the iconic harmonies for a feeling of lightheartedness and peace that only this track can deliver.

I was ecstatic to be able to get my hands on Oxia’s classic Domino and to be able to rework it with my fellow Brazilian brother Vintage Culture especially for release on my Controversia imprint. We wanted to add our own style of deeper sounds that still honours the original release with each of our unique stamps on the production. I can’t wait to play it live during my European tour starting later this month! – Alok

Working with Alok on “Domino” provided the opportunity to work with a good friend in music on a timeless song. I believe we created a fresh sound for this classic track without losing the essence of the original version. I’m looking forward to bringing “Domino” to audiences around the world on my tour. – Vintage Culture

The Dow jumped 110.02 points or 0.3% to 35625.40. The Nasdaq Composite dipped roughly 0.2% to 14793.76.

The S&P 500 has now doubled its level from its pandemic-low close on March 23 2020. The 100% rally is the fastest bull-market doubling off a bottom since World War II according to CNBC's analysis of S&P 500 Global data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 notched fresh record closes on Monday ahead of major retail earnings reports this week.

Retail stocks inched higher ahead of quarterly earnings reports from major companies. Home Depot and Walmart rose 1.1% and 0.8% respectively ahead of Tuesday reports. Target and Lowe's both edged higher ahead of reports slated Wednesday.

The major U.S. stock indexes saw losses earlier Monday amid fears of slowing global growth with China's economic recovery lagging and oil prices falling.

Data showed Chinese economic growth slowing more than expected. China's retail sales increased by 8.5% in July year-over-year below the 11.5% forecast from economists polled by Reuters. Online sales gained just 4.4% for the month. On the manufacturing sector in the country industrial production increased by 6.4% below the 7.8% consensus estimate.

China's National Bureau of Statistics noted an impact from Covid and domestic flooding saying the country's ""economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.""

""Delta driven slowdown grips China"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said in a tweet. ""Not sure of impact here yet.""

Oil prices dropped after the release of the Chinese economic data. U.S. oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell pressuring energy names. Occidental Petroleum closed 3.8% lower while Exxon Mobil and Chevron both lost more than 1%.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dipped to 1.26% Monday afternoon as investors worried about global growth. Bond yields fall as their prices rise.

Bank stocks trended lower as the 10-year yield fell. Bank of America shed 0.8% JPMorgan edged 0.6% lower and Goldman Sachs dropped nearly 0.6%.

Tesla's stock retreated 4.3% after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced a formal probe into the electric vehicle maker's Autopilot partially automated driving system.

Shares of Moderna which are up more than 250% this year closed more than 4% lower.

U.S. stocks also pulled back amid growing support within the Federal Reserve to announce a tapering of its bond purchases in September and begin the reduction in buying a month or so after. Interviews with central bank officials along with their public comments show growing support for a faster taper timeline than markets had expected a month ago.

The major stock indexes for much of the last month have ground to new records on the back of robust corporate earnings results. The S&P 500 has closed at a record high 49 times this year out of 156 trading days or 31% of the time — the most frequent closing highs on record back to 1950.

Eighty-seven percent of S&P 500 companies have reported positive earnings per share surprises for the second calendar quarter according to FactSet as of Friday. If 87% is the final percentage it will mark the highest percentage of S&P 500 companies reporting positive EPS surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008.

""These are the dog days of August and low volume and directionless volatility are the order of the moment with 2Q21 earnings season mostly behind us"" Raymond James' Tavis McCourt said in a note.

The S&P 500 is now hovering at 4468 while the Dow is now above 35515. For its part the Dow was buoyed by gains in Disney which rallied on the heels of its quarterly earnings results. The Nasdaq also climbed higher.

Investors pushed stocks into record territory despite data that reveals consumer sentiment is dropping. According to the University of Michigan’s preliminary data the consumer sentiment index fell to 70.2 in August its weakest point in about a decade and down from a reading of higher than 81 last month. Wells Fargo economists described the results as “disastrous.” Economists are blaming the rise of the delta variant for the dampened mood.

So far investors have managed to see the glass half full thanks to largely better than expected second-quarter earnings out of corporate America. While valuations are lofty Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni on CNBC likened the current environment to that of the “roaring twenties on Wall Street” suggesting that investors “buy a little bit of everything.”

Stocks to Watch

SoFi Technologies sank 14% on Friday after the fintech company reported a wider-than-expected Q2 loss despite a doubling of net revenue. A lockup period on the stock for select shareholders is reportedly coming to a close in the coming days which could have pressured the stock. SoFi has been bolstering its crypto trading offering.

ContextLogic which runs the e-commerce platform Wish tumbled nearly 20% on Friday. Wish is being hit by a one-two punch weaker demand and rising costs.

Look Ahead

Earnings season is winding down with just over 10% of companies in the S&P 500 still waiting to report their results. Separately the bitcoin price is perched above the USD 47K level once again so investors might want to keep an eye on the cryptocurrency.

On Tuesday retail sales for the month of July will be released. Wells Fargo economists are predicting a slowdown in sales growth not least due to the delta variant which has thrown a wrench into plans for the economy to reopen more fully.

Meanwhile industrial production and housing starts for July come out on Tuesday and Thursday respectively.

The answer is six. Six west African pygmy hippopotamuses.

That was the precious haul reeled in by the Gulf Breeze Zoo which welcomed Queyah and Qiu Hsiang Zhu Chang Sirana Ayana and Abina to the zoo earlier this summer.

Gulf Breeze Zoo worked extensively with its parent company Zoofari Parks to have the pygmies safely ushered into Northwest Florida as the zoo looks to conserve the six members of the endangered species.

“Conservation is at the core of our beliefs"" said Zoofari Parks CEO Eric Mogensen in a Thursday press release. ""Our parks along with our very valued guests allow us the opportunity to make a huge impact on saving species globally.""

From April through July the six captive-bred hippos — two males and four females — began arriving in stages at Miami International Airport from zoos in Switzerland the United Kingdom Singapore and Taiwan.

Zoofari Parks helped the zoo organize the international transfers of all six hippos and followed them all the way through to their new home in Gulf Breeze.

Today Queyah and Qiu Hsiang are on display at the Gulf Breeze Zoo for visitors and guests to learn about and appreciate. The remaining four hippos — Zhu Chang Sirana Ayana and Abina — are in an off-exhibit breeding center specially constructed to meet this reclusive species' unique needs.

► Reunited and it feels so good:Pensacola military family improbably reunited with long-lost dog after 3 years

Pygmy hippos have partially webbed feet which reflects how much time they spend on land traveling through the forest in search of food. The species tends to secrete an oily substance from its pores that acts as a natural sunscreen. That comes in handy because pygmy hippos have naturally sensitive skin according to the zoo.

Wild pygmy hippos are an endangered species found native only in four countries in West Africa: Sierra Leone Liberia Ivory Coast and Guinea. As a result the zoo said there are fewer than 3000 left in the wild.

In their native range pygmy hippos are solitary and generally only come together for breeding. On average they weigh about 500 pounds which is one-eighth the size of their cousins the Nile hippo.

The Gulf Breeze Zoo opens at 9 a.m. daily at 5701 Gulf Breeze Parkway.

But in many ways the rise and fall of chief executives’ pay packages simply mirrored the turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that has shaped everything over the last year and a half.

In the virus’ wake a new leader rose to the top of the pack.

Jay Adair CEO of Copart Inc. a Dallas-based used car online auction company received the largest total compensation for 2020 in The Dallas Morning News’ annual ranking of the 100 highest-paid leaders of North Texas-based public companies. The ranking is compiled for The News by Houston-based compensation firm Longnecker & Associates.

» See the full ranking at the end of this article.

Adair’s pay rose a whopping 16384% to $25.7 million even though he’s only paid $1 a year in salary. Stock options — long-term incentives that make up the biggest part of most CEO pay packages — are what caused Adair’s compensation to soar.

Companies are required to report stock options at the value when they’re granted as part of the CEO’s total pay for that year. Boards of directors use stock options that vest over time at various prices as a way to align CEO performance with the company’s share price. If the share price rises to pre-established levels the options can be sold — giving them value beyond what’s now largely paper wealth.

“Adair will only realize income upon the exercise of these option awards and only to the extent the underlying value of Copart shares exceed the strike price” the company said in an emailed response about Adair’s ranking. “Our board considers this calculated value to lack material meaning as it does not reflect the actual value if any that Adair will receive under the award.”

His base salary has been $1 since April 2009. He last received stock options in 2014 totaling $22.86 million at the time.

Adair’s new stock options vest over a three-year period and contained a clause that he couldn’t exercise them until the company’s share price closed above $106.30 for 20 consecutive trading days. Copart shares have traded above that price continuously since March 31.

Copart turned in a 40% return for shareholders last year and the company’s revenue rose 8% to $2.2 billion.

Enter the pandemic. When virus-related supply chain problems resulted in a shortage of new vehicles available on dealership lots demand and prices for used cars took off. That made parts hard to find sending so-called “vehicle dismantlers” to Copart websites in search of what they needed. Salvagers are among the company’s biggest buyers.

“I used to say before 2008 that we were a recession-resistant company” Adair told investors in a conference call that ended its 2020 fiscal year. “After 2008 I started saying that we were recession-proof. And now after 2020 I can confidently say we are a pandemic-proof company.”

The pandemic also conspired to push perennial pay leaders at AT&T Exxon Mobil and Tenet Healthcare down in this year’s rankings as each of their companies faced unusual challenges.

The oil and gas industry struggled throughout 2020 although Exxon is bouncing back strong this year. Hospitals reliant on elective surgeries for revenue such as Tenet had to pause those procedures for a portion of 2020 and then had to convince reluctant patients it was safe again to go back to a surgical center. And AT&T facing a mountain of debt from a series of acquisitions found itself jettisoning parts of its business to recover.

It was such an unusual year that the highest-paid executive in Dallas-Fort Worth companies’ regulatory filings wasn’t even a CEO.

Jason Kilar who was brought in to run AT&T’s WarnerMedia entertainment division got a massive $52 million compensation package made up largely of stock awards to be paid out over five years. In May AT&T struck a deal to merge WarnerMedia with Discovery — a move that ultimately could zap much of Kilar’s expected payday. Kilar has said he expects to stay with the company into next year though Discovery CEO David Zaslav will take the helm of the merged powerhouse.

Winners and losers

This year’s rankings point out the clear winners and losers of the pandemic-influenced year.

Take the nation’s largest homebuilder Arlington-based D.R. Horton which benefited from record demand for new homes. Its CEO David Auld saw his compensation rise 34% year-over-year to $19.1 million. That elevated him to fifth in the rankings.

And the company’s founder and executive chairman Donald R. Horton collected $32.5 million — more than any CEO on this year’s list.

Brain Yarbrough senior analyst at investment firm Edward Jones said D.R. Horton was already on strong footing entering 2020 but the increased importance people placed on their homes after being locked down and a surge in relocation to suburban and rural areas made the company’s profits shoot up.

“The demand we’ve seen over the last year is unprecedented and the companies will tell you that” Yarbrough said. “This even supersedes what we saw in the [2006-07] housing boom.”

Dallas-area home prices rose 18.5% year-over-year in May — the region’s biggest percentage gain ever recorded in the closely watched Corelogic Case-Shiller home price index of major cities. That gain was almost 2% above the national average.

Trailing Adair in this year’s ranking is Perry Sook CEO of Nexstar the nation’s largest owner of local TV stations. His pay package rose 44% to $23.5 million. The Irving-based company benefited from political advertising surrounding last year’s hotly contested national state and local races.

On the opposite side of the pandemic equation is Exxon Mobil.

The Irving-based oil giant’s chief executive typically ranks in the top five in the annual ranking. In 2020 CEO Darren Woods tumbled to 10th with a pay package of $15 million. His pay fell 33% last year as Exxon suspended its executive bonus program to deal with the economic turbulence.

“Oil and gas at the beginning of 2020 was hurt even more than most of the industries outside of maybe retail” said Longnecker & Associates chief operating officer Tyler Brown.

In addition to dramatically reduced travel Russia and Saudi Arabia also put a price squeeze on oil and gas Brown said. Woods abandoned Exxon’s $200 billion growth strategy and slashed spending. While painful last year that put the company in a strong position to reap benefits from this year’s crude rally.

When Exxon’s CEO doesn’t top the rankings Dallas-based AT&T’s usually does.

This year however new CEO John Stankey could do no better than fourth with a $21 million pay package. He replaced longtime CEO Randall Stephenson in 2020 and has been responsible for selling off many of the assets AT&T acquired during his predecessor’s tenure. (Stephenson now the company’s executive chairman received $29.1 million in compensation last year.)

Tenet Healthcare CEO Ronald Rittenmeyer the second-highest-paid CEO in last year’s ranking was one of 30 chief executives among the top 100 who took pay cuts. His pay declined 31% to $16 million.

But that hasn’t made Rittenmeyer immune from criticism. Striking nurses at a Tenet-owned hospital in Massachusetts regularly point to his eight-figure compensation in complaining about what they contend are staffing and personal protective equipment shortages jeopardizing patient safety. Politicians have joined in asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the company’s use of CARES Act money.

Tenet’s CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 2020 was 306-to-1 with a median wage of $54501 paid to the company’s 110000 employees.

Rittenmeyer 74 last week announced he will turn over CEO duties on Sept. 1 to Saum Sutaria Tenet’s president and chief operating officer. He will remain the Farmers Branch-based company’s executive chairman through 2022.

While Tenet’s pay gap was sizable it wasn’t close to being the widest in D-FW.

That dubious honor fell to Plano-based movie theater chain Cinemark which chalked up a 1150-1 ratio with its employees collecting median pay of $6000. Significant pay gaps are common with companies like Cinemark that employ part-time and seasonal employees but the divide deepened as COVID-19 closed theaters and workers were furloughed by the thousands.

But like Adair there were others who got hefty pay bumps.

Mahesh Aditya CEO of Dallas-based auto lender Santander Consumer USA Holdings saw his pay rise 1948% to $2.4 million. Michael Willoughby of PFSweb Inc. got a 474% raise Chris Easter of Daseke Inc. received a 540% increase and Charles Vogt of DZS Inc. earned a 594% pay hike.

Median pay for CEOs in North Texas rose 2.5% last year to $5.95 million.

What will stick from 2020?

Most experts in executive pay say it’s too soon to tell whether 2020′s changes will extend beyond this year.

Amit Batish marketing and content manager for research firm Equilar said CEO pay across the nation only dropped 1% to 2% on average last year. Most companies cut salaries and bonuses instead of long-term stock awards and options where CEOs get most of their pay to conserve cash on hand.

“Last year was obviously an anomaly. So we imagine most of those salaries to pick up where they left off pre-pandemic” Batish said. “No real long-term changes I would imagine at this point but again that’s TBD at this moment.”

It’s also anyone’s guess how long the housing market will continue to drive economic growth. Edward Jones’ Yarbrough said some people believe companies’ return-to-office plans will be key.

“When they can’t work from home and they gotta go back to the office it’s going to be a different animal” Yarbrough said.

He also worries that wages aren’t increasing at rates comparable to home prices.

“Over the next year to year and a half we’re going to kind of see how this plays out. I think we’ll get a better picture of how sustainable the demand is” Yarbrough said. “You can’t expect the demand we’ve seen over the last 12 to 16 months to continue. There’s just no way because you know housing prices are going up.”

Longnecker & Associates’ Brown is more optimistic. While 2020 brought unprecedented challenges he said many boards of directors stepped up and “worked longer harder hours than they’ve ever worked before to make sure that businesses stayed alive.”

“They are actually really trying to do a good job for the shareholders and the continuity situation of business” he said. “I think that’s the overarching theme here.”

“We are on track to restore power by the end of tonight to about 95% of those who lost power due to last week’s severe weather and will continue to work around the clock until all customers are restored” the utility stated in a news release.

DTE’s power outage page late Sunday showed pockets of outages throughout Macomb County.

As of 5:30 p.m. Sunday approximately 63000 DTE customers impacted by the storms remained without power. That’s down from about 700000 during the height of the outages.

According to DTE some of the hardest hit communities include multiple areas of damage to DTE lines and equipment. These areas of layered damage can compound restoration times.

DTE restorations start with life critical public services like hospitals and the circuits that have the highest number of outages getting the power back on for the largest groups of people first the utility said in an outage update.

But some properties without electricity won’t have power restored until 11:30 p.m. Monday according to the utility’s website.

The exact number of outages is unclear as the outage map — a digital tool available to the public on DTE Energy’s website — on Sunday did not contain the figures that are normally provided in embedded messages. It was not known if that was a glitch in the system or intentionally done.

The site also also indicates DTE has about 3000 workers in communities working to restore power as fast as possible. Some 1200 lineworkers are New York Louisiana and Florida have joined in the restoration effort as well as Canada.

Two severe waves of weather that swept through Macomb County Wednesday and Thursday carried heavy downpours hail and winds gusting in excess of 60 mph. The storms caused more than 3100 downed wires broken poles and tree-related damage.

Numerous traffic signals were left inoperable leaving lengthy lines of motorists trying to navigate through the roadways. Other streets were temporarily closed due to flooding brought on by heavy rains. The Macomb County Sheriff’s Office said the storm disrupted their 911 emergency phone lines for about three hours.

A stretch of cooler less humid air moved through the region over the weekend bringing sunny skies and a high near 79 degrees expected for Sunday.

According to the National Weather Service there chances of rain for the upcoming week but no severe storms are in the forecast.

For Monday look for partly sunny conditions with a high near 80. Chances of rain are 30%.

On Tuesday showers and thunderstorms are possible after 2 p.m. The high will be around 84.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pY2hpZ2FuLzIwMjEvMDgvMTQvbWljaGlnYW4tcG93ZXItb3V0YWdlcy10cmVlLXRyaW1taW5nLWZpeC84MTI0NjE1MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan power outages under scrutiny; providers say tree trimming is fix,"Your subscription supports:

DTE said about 145000 customers remained without power Saturday afternoon while Consumers Energy had about 77000 still without service. Both companies expect to have power restored to nearly all of their customers by Sunday night.

The silver lining is a glorious weekend ahead with sunshine and blue skies expected at least through Monday.

""The weather is perfect through Monday — highs around 80 dry sunshine light winds today Sunday and Monday"" Steven Freitag a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in White Lake Township said Saturday morning.

""Nighttime temperatures will be in the 50s or 60s so if you're without power that's obviously good sleeping weather.""

DTE said it had 2800 workers in the field Saturday working 16-hour shifts to safely restore customers as quickly as possible.

""We have restored about 75% of customers affected by the storm earlier this week and are targeting to have more than 80% of customers restored by the end of today"" DTE said in a news release.

Over 550 Consumers Energy crews made progress restoring power overnight reducing the number without service to 77000 from an initial total of 370000 who lost service.

""We are expecting we will have the vast majority restored by tomorrow (Sunday)"" Consumers Energy spokeswoman Debra Dodd said Saturday.

The company on Saturday was diverting crews to Southern Michigan around Coldwater which suffered some of the worst damage Dodd said.

""That's where a lot of our heavy damage is — a lot of wire downs pole damage that sort of thing. We are taking crews that have finished up north and sending them down to help with that area.""

In the meantime Consumers brought relief to customers with water and ice distributions across the region on Saturday. An ice cream cone giveaway is set for 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday at the Red Barn Market in Lowell.

Dodd said Consumers would also buy tickets for the first 2500 people to visit Binder Zoo in Battle Creek on Saturday.

Surprisingly little electricity is generated from oil. So if you’re planning on buying a new GMC HUMMER EV and want to know where the electrons that will power your WTF acceleration stints will come from or how to get ready to charge your new electric truck…. read on.

How power utilities plan for the Hummer EV:

We talked to power companies in Florida and Michigan. Ben Burns of Detroit Michigan-based DTE Energy on Autoline Detroit (episode 2514) said “Our core business is to provide safe and reliable power to our customers …we have been planning for the last five years (for the EV transition).” That one small utility spends approximately one billion dollars per year in infrastructure updates and repair.

Elsewhere in Michigan much of the state is supplied by Consumer’s Energy. Spokesman Jeff Myrom director of electric vehicle programs said they “Plan to serve 1 million EVs by 2030.” He noted that a coal-fired power plant can take a full 24 hours to wind up or down production and that Michigan benefits from routine on-and-offshore wind for the companies’ wind farms to supply morning and evening power in addition to solar energy. Like many electric utilities Consumers has a peak demand charge which the company asserts might only add a dollar per month for those who don’t embrace lowering their usage 2-7 PM. Jeff noted that as most vehicles and their associated apps can schedule charging a charger without this feature may be available at lower cost. “Costs may come down (as volumes increase) and it’s why a NEMA 14-50 outlet rather than hard wiring may be smart. Before you buy a Hummer or other EV keep track of your mileage as typically you can add 160 miles of range overnight. You may not need that more-expensive 80-100 Amp charger.” Of course for longer journeys there are DCFC (direct current fast charge) chargers available on many highways.

David Reuter is a spokesman for NextEra Energy Resources LLC. whose Florida Power and Light division is Florida’s largest energy company and David told us “Today there is no issue. Regulated electric utilities must have a required capacity that exceeds historical averages.” That’s all the A/C in Florida on at once. FPL plans 30 million solar panels—11 Gigawatts of solar energy production—by 2030 and already has the worlds’ largest battery storage system for off-hour supply. It also plans to have DCFC stations every 15 miles along major Florida highways.

Like most utilities FPL incentivizes off-peak charging. “Customers are not putting 60kW into their batteries every night. One thing to note don’t assume a 30 Amp circuit will be sufficient to charge your vehicle. Plan for a 60 Amp.”

Charging speed for Hummer EV?

What needs to be known and understood is the “acceptance rate” or how quickly your battery pack can absorb energy. That ranges from 3.3 kWh for an older Leaf to 19.2 kWh for LYRIQ and some other vehicles which we expect will include the HUMMER EV family.

Most electric vehicles charged on 120-volt circuits add about four miles of driving range per hour. 48 miles overnight is hardly massive yet perhaps sufficient for daily around-town excursions. A higher charging rate more Amperes more volts more Watts is necessary for any other use. (Never Forget that repeatedly using a DC Fast Charger to charge fill your “tank” puts a strain on your battery pack.)

Kelly Blue Book suggests these approximate calculations based on a 240V Level 2 power source according to the manufacturers’ websites for the following 2021 cars:

Chevrolet Volt EV : 10 hours

: 10 hours Nissan Leaf : Up to 11 hours

: Up to 11 hours Tesla Model S : 12 hours

: 12 hours Karma GS-6 : 4 hours

: 4 hours Tesla Model 3 : 12 hours

: 12 hours Porsche Taycan : Up to 10.5 hours

: Up to 10.5 hours Audi E-Tron: 10 hours

So with battery packs ranging from miniscule—Mitsubishi i-MiEV’s 16 kWh—to 100 kWh and more Level 2 charging times with typical 32 Amp hour chargers vary from 8.5 hours for a Chevrolet Bolt (older models) to 11+ for LYRIQ and likely HUMMER EV. We expect that your HUMMER EV or Cadillac LYRIQ (or extended range F-150 Lightning) will benefit from a more-powerful charger than that which is supplied.

Cost breakdown:

To install a Level 2 charger at minimum add a 240V NEMA outlet and new high-capacity breakers to your home’s wiring and breaker box. Like anything else more power costs more and many 40-80 Amp charging stations are available for $600-$1000 without installation. Some charging stations include a NEMA 14-50 plug and mounting support for the 18’-25’ cable; you want both.

Who will connect your Hummer EV



Many manufacturers GM included utilize Qmerit to organize installation by independent contractors. According to Electrify America “Qmerit specializes in EV charger installation across the country.” Call +1 (888) 272-0090 or [email protected] and they will connect you with up to three Qmerit-certified EV charger installers in your area. Most installations range from about $750 to $1750 not including the cost of a Level 2 charging station.”

And know this or else!

Electrify Home says “Installation of a Level 2 (240v) charging station typically requires that you own your home or have building owner permission (required for permits) and if applicable have received Home Owner’s Association approval to install your charging station. Also note that “smart connected” stations require WiFi connectivity so you will want to check your coverage at the installation location. For multi-family housing most apartment complexes do not allow individual installations due to the inability to track and calculate electricity usage.”

Thousands of Chapel Hill and Durham residents are without power Saturday evening following a severe thunderstorm in the region.

The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of Chatham Durham and Wake Counties through 6:35 p.m. Saturday. As the storm passed over the area several of neighborhoods experienced power outages.

According to Duke Energy an estimated 9000 customers had lost power in Orange and Durham Counties before 7 p.m. Saturday. In Chapel Hill nearly 900 households along Homestead Road experienced an outage as well as an estimated 1000 customers between Weaver Dairy Road and Mt. Sinai Road. In Durham around 5300 residents in the Woodcroft Rollingwood Folkestone Crooked Creek and surrounding neighborhoods lost power beginning 4:24 p.m. More than 1300 households in the Woodland Acres and Farrington neighborhoods reported being without power beginning at 5:14 p.m.

Each of the outages has no cause reported on Duke Energy’s website as of 7 p.m. on Saturday.

The energy company reports different times for restoration of power in those neighborhoods affected by the outages. The estimated time of restoration for the Chapel Hill outages is around 12:45 a.m. Sunday. The Durham outages are projected to see repairs completed and power running again around 12:30 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. Sunday.

The Triangle region is forecasted more storms and rain as the weekend continues. Sunday’s forecast includes a chance for thunderstorms through the late morning and into Monday.

Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito were both wealthier in 2020 than they were in 2018 according to their annual financial disclosures filed earlier this year

Manchin’s estimated net worth for 2020 was $8.6 million compared to $7.6 million for 2018. Capito was worth $2.53 million compared to $2.15 million in 2018.

The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probably range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

For 2020 Manchin’s asset values ranged from $4376067 to $12844100. He reported no liabilities. The midpoint was $8610083.50.

Capito’s assets ranged from $1596629 to $4996000. She reported liabilities ranging from $475005 to $1065000. Using the formula put her range of worth from $531629 to $4520995 with the midpoint at $2526995.

Here’s a look at some selected details from their reports.

Manchin

OpenSecrets ranked Manchin 19th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 67th overall in Congress. OpenSecrets hasn’t yet published its compilation of 2020 filings.

For comparison the richest senator in 2018 was Mark Warner D-Va. worth $214 million. Current Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was worth $1.12 million and current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was worth $34.14 million.

Manchin reported collecting $48282.24 from the state Public Employees Retirement System in 2020.

Members are required to report both their own and their spouse’s assets and liabilities. His wife Gayle Manchin currently co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission holds a savings account worth $500001-$1 million which paid interest ranging from $2501-$5000.

Manchin reported two savings accounts ranging respectively from $100001-$250000 and $50001-$100000. They produced interest ranging from $201-$1000 for the first and less than $201 for the second.

The Joe Manchin III Qualified Blind Trust is worth $500001-$1 million and generated revenue of $5001-$15000.

He owns a storage building in Fairmont worth $50001-$100000 that collected $2501-$5000 in rent. A commercial rental property in Fairmont is worth $250001-$500000 and collected $5001-$15000 in rent and $2382 in “ordinary business income.”

He owns stock in Fairmont-based Enersystems which he founded and is described as providing services and materials for utility plants (according to news reports it supplies coal to Mon Power’s Grant Town plant). The stock is worth $1000001-$5 million and produces $100001-$1 million in dividends plus $491949 in business income.

Manchin holds stock in two Morgantown-based companies. Figure 8 Surgical makes a sternal closure tool. CereDX (now Valtari Bio) is developing a blood test to aid rapid triage in stroke patients. The stock holdings for each is worth $1001 to $15001 and both generate dividends labeled “none” meaning less than $201.

The final asset on Manchin’s list is the house boat that recently made headlines as the site of a gathering of senators from both parties where Sen. Lindsey Graham R-SC subsequently reported testing positive for COVID despite being vaccinated.

Manchin reports the house boat being worth $100001-$250000.

Capito

Open Secrets ranked Capito 46th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 169th overall in Congress.

Capito has a stake in Disney magic. She owns Walt Disney Co. stock worth $15001-$50000.

She and her husband have stock in a number of energy companies: Duke Energy ($1001-$15000) NextEra Energy ($1001-$15000) ExxonMobil ($1001-$15000) Royal Dutch Shell ($1001-$15000) Chevron ($1001-$15000) Phillips 66 ($1001-$15000) Wisconsin Energy ($1001-$15000) and BlackRock ($1001-$15000).

They each have a Wells Fargo bank account each worth $50001-$100000 and they report four separate stock holdings in Wells Fargo. They also have several Citigroup holdings.

Their high-tech stock includes Microsoft Apple AT&T Cisco Verizon and IBM.

Her husband owns stock in Viatris (which closed its Morgantown plant last month) worth $1001-$15000. Their other pharmaceutical holdings include Johnson & Johnson Merck Novartis Pfizer Roche Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

They have a wide variety of holdings in the food industry: General Mills Kellogg McDonald’s J.M. Smucker Coca-Cola Mondelez and PepsiCo.

They have three box stores covered with holdings in WalMart Target and Lowe’s.

Other holdings include Nordstrom UPS Ford Colgate-Palmolive Proctor & Gamble #M and Nike.

Reps. David McKinley Carol Miller and Alex Mooney all had reports due in May and all three filed for extensions. Their new deadline was Friday and a story on their filings will follow after their reports are published.

He often traveled on Thornton Road to work for residents living on Buck Lake Road. Interstate 10 was still under construction.

The young man born in 1939 in Spring Creek North Carolina a town populated by less than 900 was full of ambition and grit. Moore always admired the east Tallahassee property miles away from his garnet and gold-clad campus.

The blank slate represented possibilities.

Back story:

""I’d look across that property as a student and say 'If I could ever own something like that that would be OK' "" said Moore his raspy voice laced with longing.

His fondness for Thornton Road and the people who lived by his beloved Antique Car Museum never ceased not even when it came down to selling the large swath of land needed to hook the biggest commercial fish in Tallahassee's history — Amazon.

The world's largest e-commerce company found its way to Moore not because of glossy and polished presentations intended to convince companies into setting up shop in the capital city. Deeply rooted relationships deserve the credit he says.

It all began with a call from Beth (Kirkland) Cicchetti who heads the Gadsden County Development Council.

Amazon made the first move

The economic development community is tight knit and Cicchetti said she’s made connections with more than 500 peers in the industry.

In this case maintaining those relationships paid off. About a year ago Cicchetti said she was contacted by someone she knew professionally who now works at Amazon.

That person who she declined to identify requested suggestions on properties to meet the company’s needs.

At about the same time Amazon was developing a last-mile facility in Jackson County's Marianna secret plans began taking shape for a first-mile fulfillment center in or near the capital city.

More:'They came to us': Amazon makes plans to build new 'last-mile' facility in Jackson County

Cicchetti knew the area well as the previous executive director of the defunct Economic Development Council of Tallahassee/Leon County for 10 years.

She knew of land owned by Moore in Gadsden County near I-10 and Highway 90 similar but smaller than the Mahan Drive project site. Cicchetti also worked with Moore in an effort to attract Four Star Freightliner in Midway.

She worked previously on a strategic sites identification program a pilot program introduced by Duke Energy in 2015. It identified industrial properties near interstates that are shovel ready with utility hook-ups — just some of Amazon’s must-haves for a fulfillment site.

Working mostly in rural areas Cicchetti sought direction from an industrial real estate broker and began working on a short list of contenders.

Moore's 170 acres at 6720 Mahan Drive the north side between Interstate 10 and Thornton Road looked promising.

According to permitting materials much of the site is undeveloped or developed as single-family residential with three existing single-family structures a private roadway and stormwater improvements.

Cicchetti was aware of the front end work Moore paid out of pocket to create a ""ready set go"" property. Much of the time-consuming prep work wasn't a factor which was another big plus for Amazon.

“They want to come to a piece of property that they consider site ready"" she said. ""It’s ready to submit the site plans and begin the construction. There’s not this long drawn out period of due diligence on the environmental aspects of the property.

Once you do that you put yourself in a much better position to meet the demands of the market.”

Moore did just that.

She met Moore in person at his Antique Car Museum on Mahan Drive. Within a few months Amazon representatives were in Tallahassee to see the property firsthand.

“Once DeVoe decided this was something he wanted to pursue he had all the relationships there in the jurisdiction in Leon to proceed” Cicchetti said.

No more mystery for a 'competitive project'

The deal with Amazon wouldn't have happened if not for the call to Cicchetti that eventually led to Moore.

Local economic officials also say the incentives package was vital in locking down the interest of Amazon.

Before Amazon was named – when the project was still under a cloak of confidentiality as Project Mango – the promise that the company would become the largest job producer by the private sector in Tallahassee's history was widely celebrated. Business and community leaders touted it as a game changer while the project drew criticism and concern from nearby residents worried about an increase in noise and traffic.

The Intergovernmental Agency made up of city and county commissioners quickly approved a $2.56 million incentives package for Amazon's massive project.

Only Tallahassee City Commissioner Jack Porter voted against the package at a Blueprint meeting of city and county commissioners. She maintained the project felt ""super rushed"" and that officials failed to seek enough public input.

Some residents have also criticized awarding incentives to a company like Amazon that is valued at $1.7 trillion.

How Amazon unfolded:

Cristina Paredes Director of the Tallahassee-Leon Office of Economic Vitality said Amazon was never a fait accompli for the capital city.

""Amazon was a competitive project as they evaluated different properties across their network area"" she told the Democrat. ""Our community offered short-term limited property tax reimbursement through our local Target Business Program in return for 1000 new jobs a payroll of $167.6 million and more than $200 million in capital investment.""

""It is a truly transformative job creation project for Tallahassee"" she said adding that retailer will continue to pay taxes and incentives are only realized when the company meets its job creation milestones.

An economic forecast by the FSU Center for Economic Forecasting and Analysis shows the project will ultimately create 3600 new jobs $167.6 million in wages and generate approximately $451 million in local economic impact for Tallahassee-Leon County.

The company's identity was a poorly kept secret until this week's official announcement. Last week the Democrat reported that Sam Blatt an economic development policy manager at Amazon was in conversations with Leon County development officials as early as April.

In a video message played Thursday at the Chamber of Conference's annual conference in Amelia Island Blatt told leaders how the company had been working with city and county officials for six months.

“Tallahassee has been wonderful"" he said. ""They have the right site the right workforce and ultimately have the right team in place to bring this to fruition.”

Local officials say the facility will be a high-tech marvel and have 15 miles of conveyor belts. The company plans to break ground next month and open in time for Christmas season 2022.

DeVoe Moore: 'I want quality'

Over the years Moore had many opportunities to sell.

There were pushes to bring a truck stop or an outdoor mall to the Mahan Drive property due to its proximity to I-10. Bass Pro Shops initially considered building there but decided to open its Tallahassee store in the Fallschase Shopping Center about 4 miles west from where the fulfillment center will be.

Moore a wealthy self-made business man turned them all down. To sell the right company and project had to come along.

“That’s just my nature” Moore said. “I don’t want just anything on the property. I want quality.”

While he's known to many Tallahassee Democrat readers for his columns advocating for conservative positions the Florida State alum also is a generous donor to his alma mater where his namesake DeVoe L. Moore Center is located and serves as a public policy research institute.

Leon County Administrator Vince Long one of the few public officials who knew about Amazon's interest early on said the land is a point of pride for Moore.

“I think it’s safe to say he’s not someone who had to sell the property” Long said. “There were no fire sales on the property as far as DeVoe was concerned.

He was in a unique position as a landowner ... and had the ability to wait for the right deal to come along not only for him but for the community.”

DeVoe didn't hire teams of consultants to represent him which might be expected for a land deal of this scale.

“That’s the kind of guy he is” Long said. “DeVoe is very old school and he handles these projects of this magnitude which are really sophisticated with himself and a small group of people that he trusts.”

Long met with Moore dozens of times on the project. Moore was adamant about protecting his neighbors and their quality of life.

""He’d say ""I won’t do this deal Vince. I’ll walk away from this deal if they put trucks on Thornton Road'"" Long recalls. “He was steadfast about that.”

Moore made a promise to his neighbors he intended to keep. He assured them that whatever he did with the property he would work to mitigate negative impacts.

Long said he gives Moore the lion’s share of the credit on the Amazon deal adding “he really deserves it.”

He said local government helps facilitate interactions with potential buyers to help navigate permitting and land-use details. But Moore engaged with Amazon and ultimately came to terms.

“Without that” Long said “we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”

Those who look closely at a clearing in the Midlothian Meadows forest preserve might find an old foundation — stony remnants that stand out from the usual assortment of rocks because they turn at right angles.

It’s all that’s left of a gunpowder factory and storage facility operated by turn of the 20th century industrial powerhouse DuPont. It was erected on the east side of the Rock Island railroad tracks at about 155th Street in the 1890s after the company was evicted from a previous facility in what was then known as the Town of Lake on Chicago’s South Side because its facility there exploded.

The new one had its own train station between Midlothian and Tinley Park called DuPont as well as a rail siding leading directly to “what they claimed was the world’s largest gunpowder magazine and factory” according to an entry in the Encyclopedia of Chicago written by historian Larry McClellan.

The factory ceased being the world’s largest anything on an early November day in 1906 when it was “ignited by a prairie fire” and exploded according to a short story on the front page of the Nov. 8 1906 edition of the Moline Dispatch.

The only reported fatalities were unlucky teamster Charles Steffenhagen and his horses who were driving by at the wrong time.

“Glass within a radius of a mile was shattered” the newspaper story stated.

Midlothian Meadows forest preserve was host to a couple of festive gatherings Saturday but more than a century ago it was home to a gunpowder factory that exploded in 1906.

An internet search of “DuPont powder factory explosion” turns up lots of results from that time period including one catastrophe that took out an entire Indiana town a year later which may explain why the destruction of what was called the world’s largest gunpowder magazine didn’t make more of a lasting impression on the area.

With the large exception of its effects on Charles Steffenhagen and his horses and family it may have been a good thing the plant blew up when it did. Cook County officials were already in the process of planning what would become Oak Forest Hospital creating a land boom in the vicinity.

According to a report in the Dec. 28 1907 edition of The Economist land speculators purchased 200 acres “at a station called DuPont on the Rock Island road” from the gunpowder company for just under $20000.

“Part of the land years ago was occupied by a powder plant but after it exploded the owners never cared very much for the neighborhood and never rebuilt” the story stated noting the land was “attractive.”

“It may be that a town will be established and it is also possible it might be used for golf links” the report indicated.

Instead as befits attractive land it’s now a forest preserve.

Only a few years before the explosive violence at the gunpowder plant another deadly occurrence started at the DuPont train station. It was a 20th century throwback to the Old West a train robbery followed by posses tracking down murderous villains and horse thieves.

A story in the July 5 1902 Chicago Tribune details how three men robbed an express train of five Pullman sleepers and other cars from Chicago bound for Denver. The robbers who were already on the train climbed atop the engine and at gunpoint demanded it stop at DuPont.

One of the railroad workers was shot when the robbers thought he was trying to escape the Tribune story said and “some of the more venturesome passengers” in the Pullman cars began shooting from the coach windows with the robbers returning fire.

An attempt to uncouple the engine and car containing a safe and valuables was unsuccessful amid the shootout and the robbers fled instead with some jewelry and cash.

A leg of the Tinley Creek path system goes past the site in Midlothian Meadows forest preserve where a DuPont gunpowder factory once stood. It was served by a train stop along the Rock Island line called DuPont where a train robbery took place in 1902.

Once again the topography of what is now Midlothian Meadows played a role at least according to the contemporary account. “The spot selected by the robbers at which to stop the train is peculiarly adapted for holdup purposes” the Tribune story stated with its “high banks that are heavily wooded” and surrounding country “that is covered in timber.”

The robbers fled stealing teams of horses and wagons along the way from farmers in the Oak Forest area and again in Willow Springs where they exchanged gunfire with a shotgun-wielding farmer. Posses pursued them to Worth but lost the trail at Lemont where authorities feared they were able to board an Alton or Santa Fe train and escape for good.

The Great DuPont Train Robbery remains unsolved.

for title applicationsIf you need to apply for a Virginia title for your vehicle starting Monday you will be able to drop off applications at any Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles customer service center for processing.

Virginia titles for vehicles purchased from most dealerships are processed by the dealer but titles for vehicles purchased from individuals or businesses that are not dealerships are processed by DMV in three ways: by mail or by appointment at an office or via drop-off.

Here’s how it would work: Customers can take completed applications and supporting documents to an office without an appointment. Staff will review to ensure the application package is complete for processing and provide the customer an acknowledgment of receipt. DMV will conduct the transaction within five business days. Customers can opt to either pick up the credential at the same location or have it mailed to them. Customers who want same day service must schedule an appointment.

Payment is required at the time of submission by check or money order. Fee information is available at https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/webdoc/pdf/dmv201.pdf. Typically a titling fee and the motor vehicle sales and use tax are due at the time of titling the vehicle. If registering a vehicle at the same time the registration fee should also be included. Any additional fees owed will be billed.

New logo for P&HCC

Patrick & Henry Community College rolled out a new logo this week.

The college took its old compass-centric designed and added the ampersand officials adopted last month as a way to reinforce that the school is named for Patrick and Henry counties and not so much Patrick Henry a hero of the American Revolution and Virginia’s first governor — but also a slave owner.

A protracted process ended with the adding of the ampersand to the name and now the school has an official new symbol.

MCPS board sets special meetings

The Martinsville City School Board has called two special meetings this week. The first is a closed-session meeting via Zoom on Tuesday and the second is a meeting 9 a.m. Saturday at Martinsville High School.

That meeting will be a review of the 6-year plan for the schools an instructional update and a look at special education based on the agenda posted on the school board’s website.

With the city of Martinsville planning to revert to a town in Henry County the memorandum of understanding between the city and county calls for the school system to be absorbed into Henry County Public Schools. It’s unclear what that reversion means for these planning sessions.

The city and county have scheduled two days of public meetings culminated with a public hearing on reversion. They will be Sept. 7-8 at the New College Institute.

U.S. 58 project public meeting

The Virginia Department of Transportation on Tuesday will have a public information session about its widening project of U.S. 58 across the Lover’s Leap area of Patrick County.

This $300 million project has been on the drawing board for years and is expected to take almost five years to complete. This segment covers one of the most difficult portions of the highway over Lovers Leap Mountain — an altitude of approximately 2861 feet — and extends 7.4 miles from just east of Cloudbreak Road to the Stuart Bypass.

The session will be at 5-7 p.m. at the Patrick & Henry Community College site at 212 Wood Brothers Drive in Stuart.

VDOT reps will have a short presentation at 5:15 p.m. with representatives available for information and questions and answers.

Road projects

Creekside Drive in Henry County is closed to through traffic a half mile from Carver Road for a bridge maintenance project. Directional signs are posted. Weather permitting the road will reopen to on Sept. 10.

Intermittent work is being performed by contractors for Comcast along Route 57 between Route 8 and Route 701 in Patrick County. This is expected to be a 90-day installation project and motorists may experience periodic lane and/or shoulder closures.

Construction is underway on the Lover’s Leap area of U.S. 58. Flagging operations for the geotechnical borings are being in place between 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Estimated completion date is May 2026.

ETN,Eaton Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlYW11c2EuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9hdWd1c3QvMTUvamFnZ2VyLWVhdG9uLWNvcnktanVuZWF1LWhlbHBlZC1pbnRyb2R1Y2UtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXRvLW9seW1waWMtc2thdGVib2FyZGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jagger Eaton Cory Juneau Helped Introduce The World To Olympic Skateboarding,"Jagger Eaton poses on the podium following the men's street finals at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 on July 25 2021 in Tokyo.

Jagger Eaton strolled onto the late-night television stage wearing a pinstriped suit and shiny black boots and sporting a hairstyle that host David Spade described as a wide mohawk.

And no this time the 20-year-old from Mesa Arizona who became the first American to win an Olympic medal in skateboarding didn’t have his AirPods in his ears.

“I just cherished the moments” the bronze medalist in men’s street skateboarding told Spade the guest host of “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” “It was so fun to be in Japan. Japan put on such an amazing contest and such an amazing event. Coming home and getting back to reality is a little different because reality as I know it is a little different now.”

Isn’t that the truth.

Eaton and Cory Juneau were two of the athletes that introduced many around the world to skateboarding when the sport made its Olympic debut at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. Between the youth of the competitors the camaraderie they showed and the incredible tricks they performed it was a successful debut indeed. Viewers were fascinated and both Eaton’s and Juneau’s medal-winning performances earned them a whole new slew of fans.

A quick rundown of Eaton’s Instagram shows:

• A photo of him holding his medal with Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg in the background

• Video of him throwing out the first pitch at an Arizona Diamondbacks game

• Photos and video of him in New York City for a “Today” show appearance as well as a helicopter ride over the Big Apple

He also posted video of him skating down the sidewalk with a pair of young fans (and giving them a moment they’ll always remember) writing “These 2 rippers came out to see me on the @todayshow this morning and I couldn’t help myself but to skate a little with them!! Always beyond grateful for the support!!”

U.S. skateboarding bronze medalist Jagger Eaton has Bieber Fever ... 'cause the Olympic hero tells TMZ Sports he wants to personally invite Justin Bieber to a skate sesh!!

Of course Eaton became a sensation in Tokyo last month ... becoming the first American to medal in skateboarding -- and he did it with a BROKEN ANKLE!!!

TMZ Sports caught up with JE this week to check in on his health ... and he says things are really good!!

""Feeling good. Ankle’s alright just hanging out with the boys shredding a little bit. Got told yesterday I don’t need surgery so we’re all good vibes here.""

Eaton says he was skating on a broken ankle for 2 whole months ... and it was ""harsh.""

""It wasn’t the greatest situation but again Advil works magic ... you kind of need to tough it out. It was a situation I didn’t want to be in but again it’s like it is what it is.""

Given his expertise in the sport we had to ask who the best celebrity skater is ... and Beliebers will love his answer!!

""I’ve seen Justin Bieber skate a little bit. I heard he rips. I don’t know. We got to set up a skate sesh or something.""

Of course Bieber is known to be good at a TON of sports ... and has skated with guys like Nyjah Huston in the past.

So JB ... whatcha think??

There's more ... we had to ask how Eaton's social media DMs have been looking now that he's an Olympic superstar what his future holds and if he'll be suiting up for the 2024 Games ... and the dude couldn't have been nicer!!

On August 4 2021 wrestling legend ""Beautiful"" Bobby Eaton died at the age of 62 leaving behind a legacy as an all-time great whose career is often overlooked even by longtime fans. As one of the many men who represented the Midnight Express since the 1980s Eaton was primarily known for his contributions to tag team wrestling as well as the long in-ring rivalry between the Midnights and the Rock 'n' Roll Express. However one reason why he doesn't get as much attention for his accomplishments as he should is the fact that he never competed for the so-called ""worldwide leader in sports entertainment"" WWE as noted by TheSportster. He did spend some time with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) which was once WWE's main rival but even with the rise of newer promotions such as AEW Vince McMahon's company is still considered the be-all and end-all of pro wrestling for many a fan.

Looking back on his career there's a very strong case for Eaton to eventually become one of the few individuals to enter WWE's Hall of Fame despite being exclusively known for his work outside the promotion. But that's not because of his association with the Midnight Express per se; Eaton also happened to win a surprising number of championships across different companies. We're not saying how many just yet but it's far more than what many of you may be expecting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2Fubi1hYmVyLW5vdGFibGUtZ2VuZXJhbC1jb3Vuc2VsLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ann Aber Notable General Counsel 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainscleveland.com/awards/ann-aber-notable-general-counsel-2021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2Fubi1hYmVyLW5vdGFibGUtZ2VuZXJhbC1jb3Vuc2VsLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVvdXQuY29tL2hvbmcta29uZy90cmF2ZWwvaG90ZWwtZGlhcmllcy1nby1ncmVlbi13aXRoLWVhdG9uLWhrcy1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1zdGF5Y2F0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Go green with Eaton HK's sustainable staycation,"Said to be inspired by the gritty and retro nostalgia of the neighbourhood that it’s located in Eaton HK in Jordan is the cool hotel on the block that young hipsters artists and creatives frequent.

His cache of curios includes branded tote bags polo shirts ball caps and assorted tchotchkes with some mementos fetching more than $100 apiece.

The hawker who would only identify himself as Ricardo told The Post he had the “opportunity” to load up directly from Lehman’s stash of promotional gimcracks soon after the firm’s ignominious collapse in 2008.

“I bought it all on a hunch thinking people would want a piece of history. Well it worked out” he said.

Got $155 to spare? A crystal sphere paperweight emblazoned with the Lehman name can be yours. Or maybe you’re in need of a Lehman’s weekender tote with a floral print for $255.

The cheapest item is a $14 set of Lehman Bros. gift bags which Ricardo touts online as “an instant conversational piece of history.”

“Everything I sell is authentic” he said. “I own the last of it.”

4 This bag is one of roughly 30 Lehman-branded products for sale. Ebay

Using the eBay handle rmp8907 Ricardo has listed 35 items for sale though a few are not branded with the Lehman name. He’s been active on the site since 2002.

The peddler who claimed he was retired wouldn’t reveal what he did for a living or how much he’s made from his online offerings.

“Let’s say I made my investment back — and then some.”

4 This paperweight will set you back $155 to buy. Ebay

The fallen Wall Street icon’s souvenir spoils appeal to young men in finance who gravitate to the merch as a whistling-past-the-grave joke that’s guaranteed to get laughs in the Hamptons said one tristate-area hedge funder.

“It’s an inside joke a piece of history and a fashion item all in one” said the anonymous moneyman who said he’s looked over the wares but hasn’t bought anything himself.

The firm’s infamous faceplant — spurred by the company’s overexposure to subprime mortgages — was the largest in history and sent shockwaves through Wall Street.

4 This bib costs $60. Ebay

The company filed for bankruptcy after 158 years of operation and will have paid back about $129 billion to unsecured creditors this year.

On Ricardo’s eBay store you’ll see Lehman offerings like a…

Canvas tote for $89

Ball cap for $86

Golf polo for $90

Floral-print weekender bag for $225

“digital world clock” for $196

Video game developers Electronic Arts (EA) have announced a new collaboration with Interscope Records. As the gaming company prepares to release the latest edition of “Madden NFL” in a week on Friday (Aug. 13) EA Sports put out an official Madden NFL ‘22 album.

The soundtrack features 11 exclusive songs recorded just for the game. Hip hop stars Swae Lee J.I.D. Tierra Whack Moneybagg Yo 42 Dugg Morray and more artists bring the hits off the field and let the NFL superstars take care of the hits on the field.

“Over the past decades ‘Madden NFL’ has become a platform for fans to discover new music launching new stars and establishing trends that have changed the way players play the game and how they experience NFL football itself” said Steve Schnur President of EA Music in a statement. “Working with Interscope one of the most forward-thinking risk-taking labels in the industry we’ve created a cohesive innovative soundtrack that connects gaming football and music culture for the next generation.”

These artists use social media to diffuse their work all around the world.

Each with a unique style these artists try to communicate in ways that are accessible to young people today. Spanish artist Pati.Te for instance became popular for her drawings which resemble Disney cartoons and represent her relationship with God.

PATRICIA TRIGO

@Pati.te

“I think having a life of faith is very important to be able to create this type of art. Above all because I firmly believe that the more personal and realistic art is the better. And I see true beauty in art and in artists when they use it to express something personal and real.”

Trigo says that what people most value in her drawings is the authenticity and tenderness they communicate.

Venezuelan artist Richard Escalona is a pioneer in the field of digital religious art. He began in 2014 by making illustrations of Jesus in scenes of daily life. His signature style includes bold lines and bright colors.

Escalona wants to use his art to build bridges between believers and non-believers.

RICHARD ESCALONA

@richardescalona

“We always try to keep up with trends and connect them to the Catholic or Christian reality. My intention isn't to get rid of the ideals found in Christian art which are absolutely valuable and help bring us closer to God. Rather I want to add something more so that maybe a young person who isn't really into ancient art can see this (illustration of Mary) and say 'Hey I too believe in Mary I can also follow her ideals and I too can grow closer to God through her.'”

Other accounts have more specific themes. Supersantos and Polikipoliki for example focus on illustrating people in Heaven. They have vastly different styles but the same objective: to depict those who have reached the final destination as role models for those still on the way.

Bringing people closer to God is the priority of these artists. Lola and Diego for example are a married couple who use their account “The Fishermen” to inspire others.

LOLA & DIEGO

@thefishermen.es

“It's a ministry. We consider it a ministry given to us by the Lord at a time in our lives when we didn't know how to serve him. We're converts so you can say we fell off the horse (like Paul in the Bible). Both of us felt the need to work for God and His kingdom.”

Most of these artists say their works are an expression of faith and that their art comes from prayer and a search for a relationship with God. That's what Natiilustra a 24-year-old artist from Uruguay says.

NATASHA LÓPEZ

@natiilustra.uy

“What I try to do when I draw is reflect on how I feel when I connect with God and on how I see Jesus and Mary. They're my favorite people to draw. The Lord inspires me in a particular way through the Eucharist. Sometimes when I am receiving Communion an image pops into my head and I later try to draw it.”

With a variety of styles and techniques all these artists try to bring religious art to the digital world in a way that is appealing to young people in particular.

How to Use the UI Cheats Sims 4 Mod

A large number of cheats are accessible when using the UI Cheats Extension Mod but there are a few basic steps to using the Sims 4 UI Cheats extension in the game.

As mentioned above all you need do is click on an object in-game and select one of the many sims 4 UI cheats displayed in the pop-up window. You will see different controls depending on whether you are left-clicking or right-clicking on an object.

The best way to discover what The Sims 4 UI Cheats extension is capable of is to experiment on your own by clicking on everything. Test the various cheats and don’t be afraid to break something in the game.

Although we encourage you to explore the mod and see what you can do we will delve into some specific functions below. Unfortunately because there are so many Sims 4 UI cheats available we will only be able to highlight some of them.

UI Cheats Extension Moodlets

One of the best mods in The Sims 4 is a quick and easy way to control how your moods fluctuate. With just a few clicks you can quickly change someone’s feelings from happy or contented to angry or sad. You have complete power over what makes them feel good!

This tool is beneficial if one sim is a caretaker for another pregnant sim. They will be able to do whatever it takes to ensure that their loved ones are never burdened with negative emotions not even when they suffer an intense emotional event like the death of a family member!

UI Cheats: Money

The Sims 4 UI Cheats Extension mod is the most popular way of solving your household funds problems forever in the game. It provides what we believe to be some of The Sims 4’s best methods for managing in-game finances and allows your sims to live out their wildest dreams.

You will never have to worry about money again! If you ever need extra money just click on your bank account and voila-1000 simoleons appear for a quick fix. The best part is that you can repeat this indefinitely so in case of an emergency or sudden purchase craving all it takes is one left-click to quickly create riches.

If any situation arises where you suddenly find yourself running low on cash there’s always the handy solution of clicking onto your money counter to grab 1000s at random with no questions asked.

If you don’t want just to sit left-clicking all day long then you can take a little time and right-click your money once. This will cause an interface window to pop up asking for the exact amount of simoleons you desire (any amount goes). You can set household funds as high as desired without having any regrets!

The game includes a security mechanism when you set the value of your funds to negative money. When this happens it resets your money counter down to zero and starts all over again from scratch unless you give it another try.

Removing money is an excellent way to retain some sense of realism while at the same time being able to play around with different combinations that will make every playthrough unique.

UI Cheats: Sims Relationship Values

If you want to jump-start a relationship with your Sims there are several different techniques. One is by setting the attraction between them at maximum – this will happen if they have never met before and both of their bars are full but it can also be done manually. This quick way to build rapport speeds up how fast that connection grows exponentially!

All you have to do is edit the character value meter. You don’t need any particular number for instant success in-game either; 100 or 200 will do just fine depending on what level of experience you’re looking for in terms of relationships (or romance!)

Jobs Skills and Aspirations from Script Mods

Skills are another thing that you can alter however you want by clicking on the skill bar. As you can imagine this is extremely useful for any type of gameplay because skills take a lot of time to develop and level up. And with the Sims 4 UI Cheats extension you have access to an easy way to max out any skill in one click! This means it takes less time than manually leveling them yourself which means more fun for everyone involved. However some people may find controlling their progression difficult because they only want one or two levels instead so be careful when using these UI cheats!

The same goes for job performance and aspirations. At any given moment you can max the performance up to 100 if you don’t want to work for it like a normal person. All you need do is right-click on your job icon to promote or demote that skill set whenever needed!

As far as these Aspirations go When you click on them they are immediately fulfilled so no more waiting around for nighttime.

Time

The Sims 4 UI Cheats Extension Mod has many great features including the ability to control time. This feature can be accessed in just one click by clicking on the in game clock at the bottom of your screen and entering an hour you would like to set it. The change will happen almost instantly without anything else changing – everything else remains unchanged!

When you change the time in Sims 4 it may lead to a couple of technical glitches. For example if your sim is pregnant and about to go into labor but then you fast-forwarded their due date by three days ahead–you’re going to have some problems! The mod doesn’t make any changes except for messing with the game’s mechanics so when this happens there isn’t anything that you can do other than changing the time back again and waiting it out.

Needs

The Sims 4 UI Cheats Extension Mod is probably the best needs mods you will ever find! With it you can click and drag on your Sim’s needs bar directly from a menu. Instead of inserting a cheat code to keep all their needs full at any given time this way you can do every single one separately.

This has helped in several situations. For example when a sim’s bladder is low but they need to use the bathroom during an important conversation just quickly go into “needs” then click on the bladder which grants complete control over the needs bar.

Weather and Seasons

The Sims 4 UI Cheats Extension Mod is the perfect way to get your Sim experience just how you want it. With this extension you can instantly change the weather and season without any fuss all by clicking the weather icon or season icon!

Right-clicking on any of these icons will open up additional UI cheats that allow for modifying time and temperature and changing seasons with ease.

Perks

With thousands of cheats in the Sims 4 one might think it would take an eternity to unlock all of them. But with the Sims 4 UI Cheats feature you can instantly unlock any perk by just right-clicking on it! This function works for perks from any expansion or game pack so whether you want a high school diploma or new clothes there is always something waiting for your Sim courtesy of The Sims 4!!

University

The Sims 4 UI university cheats are a great way to get ahead in your University efforts. Instead of using the long arduous process typically involved with cheats for The Universities you can right-click on anything and instantly complete it! If there’s any task or rank within the experience bar at an organization level – just click the university course icon and watch as time disappears before your eyes while you do something else!

Aging Sims

This mod allows you to take control of your Sims lives. You can either add or subtract days from the current age stage by adjusting the age progress bar and this won’t just impact their happiness level but also has a significant effect on how often they age up in other stages.

What to Do if the UI Cheats Mod Will Not Work?

There are a few ways to ensure that the Sims 4 UI Cheats extension installs successfully and starts working without errors. Some of these include following all steps mentioned ensuring your computer is up-to-date with new software patches from Electronic Arts and making sure you have the current version of the mod. Certain mods may also result in errors. If none of those work but some other error persists then reinstalling the game may be worth trying. For best results play legacy edition versions of the game.

The most common reason for failure in the installation process can often be due to an outdated version of the UI Cheats Extension Mod. Usually all that is needed is an update to the latest version to solve the problem."

A century ago people diagnosed with this metabolic disorder usually survived only a few years. Physicians had no way to treat their diabetic patients’ dangerously high blood sugar levels which were due to a lack of the hormone insulin. Today though nearly 1.6 million Americans are living normal lives with Type 1 diabetes thanks to the discovery of insulin.

This medical breakthrough is usually attributed to one person Frederick Banting who was searching for a cure for diabetes. But getting a reliable diabetes treatment depended on the research of two other scientists Oskar Minkowski and Søren Sørensen who had done earlier research on seemingly unrelated topics.

I’m a biomedical engineer and I teach a course on the history of the treatment of diabetes. With my students I emphasize the importance of unrelated basic research in the development of medical treatments. The story of insulin illustrates the point that medical innovations build on a foundation of basic science and then require skilled engineers to get a treatment out of the lab and to the people who need it.

Wikimedia Commons This photo probably taken in the late 1930s or early 1940s shows nurses performing insulin shock therapy on a patient. The procedure was first made public in 1933.

Basic research pointed to the pancreas

Diabetes had been known since antiquity. The first symptoms were often a prodigious thirst and urination. Within weeks the patient would be losing weight. Within months the patient would enter a coma then die. For centuries no one had any clue about what caused diabetes.

People had though been aware of the pancreas for centuries. The Greek anatomist Herophilos first described it around 300 B.C. Based on its anatomical location people suspected it was involved in the digestive system. But no one knew whether the pancreas was an essential organ like the stomach or extraneous like the appendix.

Wikimedia Commons Oskar Minkowski discovered the pancreatic origin of diabetes almost by accident.

In 1889 Oskar Minkowski a pathologist at the University of Strassburg in what was then Germany was one of the most talented surgeons of his time. As part of a study he performed a surgical feat that was thought to be impossible: keeping an animal alive after totally removing its pancreas.

The dog he operated on survived the surgery but to Minkowski’s surprise it began exhibiting all the symptoms of diabetes. Minkowski had discovered that removing the pancreas caused diabetes. Today this is known as an animal model of the disease. Once an animal model of a disease is established researchers can experiment with different cures in the animal in hopes they’ll find something that will then work in people.

Can you grind up a pancreas and feed it to a diabetic animal to cure or alleviate the symptoms of diabetes? No that didn’t work. The problem understood in today’s terms is that the pancreas has two functions: producing enzymes for the digestive system and producing insulin. Mixed together the digestive enzymes destroyed the insulin.

Isolating the insulin

In 1920 Fred Banting a small-town doctor in London Ontario had an idea. He thought that he could surgically tie off the ducts between the pancreas and the digestive system in an animal. Wait for a few weeks while the part of the pancreas that produces those digestive enzymes decays then remove the pancreas completely. This decayed pancreas he thought would contain the insulin but not the destructive enzymes.

Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library/Wikimedia Commons Charles Best (left) and Frederick Banting with one of the first dogs to be kept alive with insulin.

On July 27 1921 he concluded this experiment in the laboratory of J.J.R. Macleod at the University of Toronto. Banting working with a Toronto student named Charles Best prepared an extract from the atrophied pancreas of a dog. Then he injected the extract into another dog that had induced diabetes due to the removal of its pancreas. The animal’s diabetes symptoms began to disappear.

Although Banting’s experiment was successful his method of insulin purification was impractical. J.J.R. Macleod assigned the biochemist James Collip the task of coming up with a practical method of purifying insulin from a pancreas.

Collip developed a method based on alcohol purification. The concept was simple: He’d mash up a fresh pig pancreas readily available from butcher shops and mix it into a solution of alcohol and water. Collip slowly increased the percentage of alcohol in the solution. He found that the insulin would stay dissolved in the solution until he reached a critical concentration of alcohol then it would suddenly fall out of solution no longer dissolved in the liquid. By collecting that solid precipitate at the bottom of a flask he had a purified form of insulin.

Collip’s extraction of insulin allowed Banting and others at the University of Toronto Hospital to begin treating patients. The first injections took place in January 1922. Within weeks the results were miraculous. These injections of insulin helped dozens of patients who were close to dying regain normal activities. Word spread. Demand for insulin increased.

Insight from a brewery

But disaster struck when Collip failed to purify larger batches of insulin. He was puzzled why following the exact same recipe as he’d used before his preparations lacked insulin. J.J.R. Macleod now turned to Eli Lilly and Company a commercial firm in Indiana that made medicinal capsules for help.

At Eli Lilly the purification problem fell to George Walden a 27-year-old chemist. Walden thought of a measure that Danish chemist Søren Sørensen had introduced a dozen years before.

The equipment has changed but breweries still monitor the pH of their beers. Here a device used to measure pH sits in buffer solution at a craft brewery.

Sørensen was the director in the early 1900s of the Carlsberg Laboratory set up by the beer company to advance the science of brewing. He introduced the concept of pH as a way to quantify the acidity of a solution. A higher pH during the brewing stage leads to a more bitter-tasting beer.

When Walden measured the pH of the pancreas solution he discovered that the acidity was far more important to the solubility of insulin than the alcohol concentration. He set up a purification procedure like Collip’s but based on pH rather than alcohol concentration. Collip’s failure to scale up purification of insulin was probably because he neglected to control the pH of the solution carefully.

This insight allowed for mass production of insulin.

Vanquishing a human disease

By May 1924 diabetes was no longer a fatal disease. Physician Joseph Collins writing in The New York Times described it this way: “One by one the implacable enemies of man the diseases which seek his destruction are overcome by Science. Diabetes one of the most dreaded is the latest to succumb.”

Today the implacable enemies of man include cancer Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. The cures for each will likely be built from advances made by basic research.

In a series of photos Ben shows off his new denim collection and even strikes a pose inspired by a framed photo of Nicole Kidman that hangs in the shop. In the picture Ben models a pair of jeans while looking over his shoulder just like Nicole.

Fans can't get enough of Ben's modeling skills and sense of humor. One fan wrote ""You and Nicole. Can hardly tell you apart…but the beard gives you away.""

The unapologetic former quarterback — lauded for his strong arm and remarkable dude energy — announced that he has been pulled from an Uber-NFL promotional campaign after voicing his opinions on school boards' strict mask mandates on children.

Cutler has quoted videos of passionate parents — including OutKick founder Clay Travis' grilling of the Williamson County Board on Tuesday — fighting for their children's right to forego masks and additional PPE in the classroom setting. All based on the CDC data that supports children's safety from serious COVID effects.

This week has seen a number of fired up speeches on behalf of parents who are determined to battle science-less decisions from school boards. Cutler a father of three has been supportive in the fight against mask mandates landing him in some hot water with corporations that are monitoring behavior in order to retain their monopoly of opinions.

The decision from Uber was a clear play at keeping the right politics on board rather than allowing for a diversity of opinion across their promotions.

As talking heads critique Cutler for ""anti-science"" remarks his work alongside pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has helped support children struggling with diabetes — a demographic heavily impacted by COVID-19 — since 2009. Cutler has also participated in Dedicated to Diabetes and is the founder of the Jay Cutler Foundation which has aided at-risk youth struggling in and out of high schools.

As data surrounding the dangers of COVID among children prove that the virus and all of its iterations are less lethal when compared to typical flu seasons companies like Uber willingly avoid the data in order to make examples out of differing opinions. Which doesn't appear to be working.

Thankfully Cutler doesn't give an eff about Uber's opinions — also adding ""Future School board member"" to his Twitter bio.

Cutler's opinions on masking children were called out by Keith Olbermann meaning the former QB must have said something right.

But in a recent interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe  the singer-songwriter and rapper opened up about how the journey toward accepting herself and owning her body was less than easy.

The 33-year-old who just released her first single in two years with none other than Cardi B  said she never had ""the luxury of hiding behind anything"" as a plus-size woman.

""I feel like fat is the worst thing people can say about me at this point"" the ""Rumors"" singer shared. ""This is the biggest insecurity. It's like 'How dare a pop star be fat?' I had to own that.""

She also stated that mainstream culture prizes thin bodies and explained what constitutes a socially acceptable pop star: ""I feel like other people who were put on that pedestal or who become pop stars probably have other insecurities or have other flaws but they can hide it behind a veneer of being sexy and being marketable.""

And when it comes to the influence of her lyricism she didn't expect it to bolster a body-positive movement. ""I was watching a commercial and it was these big girls in it and it had nothing to do with being big. And I was like 'Did I do that?'""

Welterweight contender Vergil Ortiz endured a spirited effort from Egidijus Kavaliauskas but maintained his perfect knockout record putting the Lithuanian down three times in the eighth and final round Saturday in Frisco Texas.

Ortiz 23 has now knocked out all 18 of his opponents although Kavaliauskas lasted longer than any of the Texan’s previous foes.

Kavaliauskas (22-2-1 18 KOs) fought like a man who came to win. The 33-year-old rarely took a backward step against one of the biggest punchers in the sport and had some success including a right uppercut that hurt Ortiz in the second round.

However Ortiz controlled the fight with his stiff jab and landed power shots to the head and body that gradually wore down his opponent who ran out of steam in Round 8.

Kavaliauskas went down from a power jab to the body and midway through the round hit the canvas again as the result of a left hook with about 45 seconds to go and ended up on a knee under the weight of a barrage with 20 seconds remaining.

That was enough for both Kavaliauskas and referee Laurence Cole who stopped the fight to save the loser from more punishment.

Ortiz was modestly pleased afterward.

“I think I did alright” he said. “I got the win. I could’ve looked a little prettier doing it but hey I’m happy with my performance. And we’re only going to get better from here.

“… “He caught me with a good shot but I took it well I recovered from it and here I am.”

Ortiz the top contender for Terence Crawford’s WBO 147-pound title has beaten Maurice Hooker and Kavaliauskas in succession. He’s obviously ready to take on the best fighters in the division.

Now it comes down to what those fighters’ handlers can put together given that some matchups are difficult to make because of competing entities.

“There’s so much s— going on in boxing I don’t even know what I have to do anymore” Ortiz said. “… I’m ready to fight whenever. I’m here to fight anybody. I don’t care if it’s Crawford [Errol] Spence [Manny] Pacquiao you name it. I’ll fight anyone.”"

Donna Eubanks was not looking to make history — she just wanted to take care of her children as single parent.

But Eubanks 28 is the first female lineman to work for Entergy Corporation and she’s based in Brookhaven.

Originally from Perry County she relocated to Monticello temporarily and hopes to move soon into Bogue Chitto.

Eubanks said she was initially interested in working within the electrical installation and repair business after seeing her brothers and dad working in the field.

“And being a single parent jobs that are normally for typical women don’t put a lot of food on the table” Eubanks said.

She began working for the energy company June 7 but she’s had much more than just three months of experience.

Eubanks worked 3-1/2 years with independent electrical contractors such as Southern Electric Corporation.

Entergy Brookhaven supervisor and 32-year power company veteran Mark White said he has seen women working in line installation repair and maintenance for independent contractors and knew Eubanks was a good worker because he had been around her and seen her working with SEC in emergency situations.

“Entergy is a very diverse company and everybody has an equal opportunity to come on board” White said. “Being a lineman isn’t everybody’s line of work. Hours are long in the hot or cold but it’s a good living.”

The work she does building power lines setting frame poles and maintenance is not the difficult part of the job she said. The job presents challenges for school-related things for her children and they are not able to participate in sports but they are rewards for the family too.

“Entergy came to me and offered me a job with them” she said. “On the contractor side I was on the road a lot. I chose Entergy so I could be at home more and it’s a good company.”

She said her biggest encouragers all along her journey have been her family and she is grateful to White for giving her the opportunity with Entergy.

“And my former foreman Josh Nations talked me into this step to get on with Entergy” she said. “He saw the benefit it would be for me.”

Eubanks will be a lineman trainee apprentice for 32 months after which she’ll “graduate” to journeyman. She did not attend a lineman school but started with a contractor as a greenhand learning on the job.

“You pay attention and learn the best you can” she said.

Entergy has since hired another female lineman in North Mississippi White said and Eubanks said she knows of another one in Hammond Louisiana.

White said he expects more women to move into this type of work.

“It shows our industry is changing” he said.

Eubanks said any woman who wants to step into lineman work should take the chance and learn the way that works best for them.

“It’s hard sometimes so don’t give up. Don’t cry in front of the men” she said. “You have women out there that are single parents and they’re struggling and if you can find just a little bit of a support system then you can do this.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The oil and gas sector has been experimenting with solar power as a generation source for oil operations for decades such as this Chevron (then ChevronTexaco) California project in 2003. As costs of solar come down and pressure intensifies on oil companies to cut emissions more renewable energy will de deployed but it may remain limited — in scope and effectiveness. David McNew | Getty Images News | Getty Images

Oil and gas companies are working hard on their messaging in the climate change era. If it's ""code red for humanity"" as the UN's IPCC said last Monday in its latest dire climate report it's some sort of ""code red"" for the fossil fuels industry too in terms of figuring out how to stay relevant believable — and for the market investable — in an era of carbon emissions reduction mandates from governments regulators and shareholders. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub took a stab at it earlier this year saying fossil fuels aren't the problem — it's emissions. It follows that if fossil fuel companies can find ways to eliminate emissions on a large enough scale maybe they can convince shareholders and stakeholders that they are moving into the future in more sustainable way. But there are big differences in emissions types and emissions reduction strategies. What oil and gas companies do to reduce emissions in their operations and supply chain are in the end a smaller part of the carbon reduction game than reducing what is known as Scope 3 emissions — for example from the tailpipe of your car. Those Scope 3 emissions by expert estimates are responsible for the vast majority of carbon emissions from the energy industry.

Lowering carbon emissions profile of oil and gas drilling

Companies including ExxonMobil have begun to disclose Scope 3 emissions but in terms of their efforts to reduce emissions remain focused on their own operations. What oil and gas companies do to lower operational emissions the energy used to power drilling and all the way to the trucks going to and from drilling sites does matter. Though how much it matters is inevitably smaller in the grander scheme of carbon emissions reduction efforts. ""The electricity oil and gas companies use is a pretty small contributor to their carbon footprint"" said Chris Archer head of Americas for Macquarie Capital's Green Investment Group. Occidental has been a leader in many of the new technology approaches to lowering the emissions profile of the oil and gas business. As Hollub told CNBC earlier this year ""The reality of a net-zero carbon barrel it is possible and we are doing things to make it possible. It's not a goal on a sheet of paper."" Occidental is working on multiple projects related to carbon sequestration not just for its operations but other heavy emitters in the industrial sector. A growing but smaller part of that new technology thinking for oil and gas operations which is expected to see more development in the future is solar energy — solar panel arrays spreading out in places like the Permian Basin to help lower the emissions profile of oil and gas operations. Occidental already has a 16 megawatt solar farm in the Permian — the first large-scale solar project to directly power oil and gas operations in Texas — and Hollub told CNBC earlier this year ""we will be doing more of that. We believe it will take everything and we will add more solar over time.""

Oil and gas industry's history with solar

Solar isn't a new thing for oil and gas. Chevron had a project powering operations in the Kern oil field of California as far back as 2003 and BP even got into solar panel manufacturing for decades under Sir John Browne's ""Beyond Petroleum"" mission (before solar manufacturing became mostly China's game and most everyone else went bankrupt). ""This isn't a brand new journey"" said Amy Chronis leader of Deloitte's US Oil Gas & Chemicals team in Houston. ""But it's still early days to see broad-based carbon reductions."" Now several of the European and U.S. majors are making major investments in renewable again including BP and Royal Dutch Shell  and all the big oil and gas companies have at least a few solar power projects whether they developed them on their own or signed what are known as power purchase agreements with project developers including ExxonMobil which has added to its renewable energy portfolio in recent years. It bought 500 megawatts of wind and solar in 2018 from Danish renewable energy company Orsted the largest renewable deal ever signed by a U.S. major. Chevron signed its own 500 MW project last summer with the energy generation to be split between the Permian Argentina and Kazakhstan. A lot of the renewable energy history within solar has been more fits and starts — and lower down the priority list —than consistent application to the business. Though the pressure is mounting. Benjamin Shattuck research director for Americas upstream oil and gas at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said most of the companies he follows in the U.S. are still fairly early on in their journey to a carbon reduction model but as environmental performance and ESG become more mainstream — he said ESG is top of agenda when he talks to oil CEOs lately —and more companies talk about net-zero targets and tie executive compensation to the goals the situation is rapidly changing. ""Oxy is one of the companies helping to lead the conversation between the Goldsmith solar plant [the 16 MW plant Hollub referenced] and longer-term carbon capture and storage they are thinking about it from a bold standpoint which is good to see. Everything points to it picking up and accelerating"" Shattuck said.

The Permian is well-suited to renewables

Places like the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico are well-suited to renewable energy with lots of land and a regulatory framework favorable to project development whether oil and gas or renewables but the economics have to make sense. And increasingly they do.

Archer says these companies can have a much bigger impact on carbon reduction through carbon capture efforts and flaring reduction than by going into renewables for the power. But the Permian Basin is one of the best places in the U.S. to cite solar with loads of cheap flat land and really good irradiance. ""Today solar for lots of oil and gas is the economic choice versus diesel generators"" Archer said. That implies solar and wind projects being developed may have been less about a focus on carbon reduction in his view than being driven by the power generation being economically competitive. And Archer said given how economic solar has become in places like the Permian if oil and gas companies were serious about it as a de-carbonization strategy we might have seen more of it already under development.

Never going to be oil's carbon solution

No one is suggesting solar is oil's solution. One or two solar plants ""won't move the needle"" Shattuck said. But larger power purchase agreements and multiple projects across companies in the sector isn't insignificant either in his view. ""More operations need to be powered from renewables whether they own the projects or are taking renewable generation from the grid"" Shattuck said. It's a complex process to attempt to make oil and gas drilling operations 100% renewable from running the drilling rigs to generators and compressors and fracking trucks to get people to and from the field. The energy being used to prepare and drill new wells is greater than for existing wells and these operations are not stationary either moving around the Permian from West Texas to New Mexico with electric needs variable. In other words if you build a solar plant in one area you can't just easily pick it up and move it to another where more wells are being focused on. That's why Shattuck said we may see more oil and gas companies signing power purchase agreements with project developers. ""In some cases that alleviates the capital risk"" he said. But all the diesel that is used today — especially the more remote a drilling site is —does represent a wide range of power replacement opportunities.

The oil field is emissions reduction 'low-hanging fruit'

Because Scope 3 emissions are the vast majority of emissions and the furthest from the oil and gas companies direct control — and maybe active interest in controlling with ExxonMobil saying that while it will track Scope 3 it is really up to society and consumers to make their own energy choices — renewable energy in the fields is in a sense the low-hanging fruit. ""Electrification of the oil field is important and solar and wind can play a role part of a larger puzzle that has to be solved. There isn't a single solution today that's the theme"" Shattuck said. ""It needs to be multi-technology for them."" This won't go over well with those ready to leave the fossil fuels economy behind because the model is in effect augmenting what oil and gas companies are doing in the oil field rather than representing any full-scale pivot. It's the emissions are the problem —not fossil fuels — of Hollub.

Building solar is not their solution. It's good asset management with economic benefits on their existing assets. But it's not a rubric through which they de-carbonize. Chris Archer Macquarie Capital's Green Investment Group

But that low-hanging fruit gives the companies a means to test the market see how investors and stakeholders react and going down the road of renewables because it's not what they have typically done in the past is part of the effort that will be put into winning back investors in the years ahead. ""They need to find out what's hitting the mark and what isn't and if Goldsmith [the Oxy solar project] is resonating well with investors then maybe they do more"" Shattuck said.

The first net-zero oil barrel

Archer worries it is still more about issuing a press release than executing on significant change and he is skeptical that these projects can change the image of these companies. ""When was the last time you bought something from Oxy? It's not like you're swayed as a consumer"" he said. ""Building a 20 MW solar farm and issuing a press release won't earn you many points. You need a bigger strategy and goals."" But while the consumer at the gas pump may not think in those carbon-neutral barrel terms today industrial buyers already do. ""We have talked to companies producing natural gas and the off taker is a utility and that utility does care about the carbon footprint about the gas burning in a power plant"" said Kate Hardin executive director of the Deloitte Research Center for Energy & Industrials. ""So maybe it is not as direct as a person as the end user in retail but companies buying the oil and gas may care."" And that is exactly what happened in early 2021 when Oxy shipped its first-ever carbon-neutral barrel of oil to India and issued a press release about it. There are multiple business cases to make in the future that revolve around more of these deals if on the margins and that relate back to the value of more renewable energy generation in the fields. Oil and gas companies need to find new competitive advantages and even if there is a case where the economics of a solar plant don't work on their own decreasing export risk could be another way to make the model productive. ""It will be interesting to watch that competition. It's proof of concept work really early on"" Shattuck said. That work comes at time when the sector is focused more on capital discipline and budget cuts then spending making it more difficult for oil and gas companies to pull the trigger on experiments with technology. One of the biggest questions for the future of the oil and gas industry is tied up in the question of how much renewable energy development it pursues — what percentage of the overall spending is earmarked for carbon emissions reduction. ""I don't think it will be an insignificant amount. If they want to continue to have access to funding and capital they will have to continue with a variety of these technologies and strategies and we will learn more about what's most effective"" Shattuck said. The oil and gas companies early work on solar implies they are learning and getting familiar with the technology and it will stay in the mix but other initiatives will be more material in Archer's view. ""Building solar is not their solution. It's good asset management with economic benefits on their existing assets. But it's not a rubric through which they de-carbonize. But we will see more of it"" he said. For a long time the oil and gas industry could do no right when it came to cutting spending and running operations on a more conservative basis. But in recent years the industry has been forced by investors to do just that. Now capital discipline is a top priority to stay in favor with investors. Carbon reduction efforts including renewable energy projects like solar are a different mode of thinking than deciding on exploration spending but there's a similarity: the companies are leapfrogging each other in terms of targets and as technology gets rolled out it will play a role in the sector players that investors decide on as the likely winners. ""It would be surprising if the budget line item is low"" Shattuck said. Especially with oil and gas executive compensation packages now much more frequently designed to only go up if carbon emissions go down.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless throughout this period it has overseen a flurry of activity in Malta’s voluntary organisations and has been able to support 45 new projects across four pillars: digital skills creativity heritage and the environment.

The leaders within the Melita Foundation have been asked how the foundation was set up the rationale behind it and the projects it supports.

Chair Tanya Sammut-Bonnici said the foundation was set up in February 2020 with initial funding of €500000 from Apax Partners shareholders of Melita Ltd until May 2019. Since then the foundation has been continually supported by Melita and its current shareholders EQT Partners. All administrative expenses and additional human resources are provided by Melita. This ensures that all funds and resources go to the beneficiaries in voluntary organisations.

The Melita Foundation’s primary focus is to provide support for the development of digital skills and creativity among young people in Malta while also being heavily involved in supporting the conservation of Malta’s heritage and environment. The foundation wants to help people acquire the skills they need to lead successful and fulfilling lives and at the same time understand that skills need to be supplemented by a sustainable and culturally enriching environment for a brighter future.

Environmental projects run by BirdLife Malta Friends of the Earth Malta Heritage Parks Federation and the Saġġar Project will be receiving over €50000 in support from the Melita Foundation.

Vice chair Simon Montanaro Melita’s chief technical officer spoke about the projects the foundation has supported. In the past year more than €400000 has been allocated to 45 projects across all areas of focus.

Regarding digital skills the Melita Foundation has supported events such as Code.Sprint an annual national coding competition organised by the Science Centre within the Directorate for Learning & Assessment Programme which gives students from primary age all the way up to higher education the chance to put their skills to the test.

The foundation accepts applications from organisations and individuals

The foundation also helped schools purchase the educational equipment needed to teach digital skills and collaborated with the eSkills Malta Foundation to bring important Amazon Web Services courses to Malta.

In the heritage sector the Melita Foundation has supported the restoration of the historic painting of the Great Siege at the Grandmaster’s Palace in Valletta. As regards the environment the foundation provided funding for projects with BirdLife Malta the Heritage Parks Federation and Majjistral Park. These are just a very few examples of the type of projects the Melita Foundation has been supporting and anyone who wants to know more can find information on all current projects on the organisation’s website.

The Melita Foundation is supporting training programmes coordinated by Opening Doors which provides learners with music and artistic sessions performance opportunities and a bigger platform for visibility and collaboration with other artists.

Mireille Muscat head of marketing at Melita explained the process of applying for funding. The foundation accepts applications for support from organisations and individuals with projects aligned with the four pillars of digital skills creativity environment and heritage. Applications are received online on an ongoing basis via the website.

In addition to providing background information applicants are asked to provide a description of the project they would like support for and details of who would benefit from it as well as how and when they would benefit. Applicants must provide information on the amount of funding required and how any money provided will be spent.

The Melita Foundation meets regularly to review the applications received and assuming no further information or clarifications are needed takes the necessary decisions on which projects to support. This process is ongoing so applications can be received at any time.

The first year of the Melita Foundation has certainly been a rewarding one for its coordinators; being able to provide support for worthy projects in such a short time has been extremely motivating.

Looking ahead the foundation’s leaders are determined to continue ensuring funds are allocated to innovative and worthy causes to make a difference to our community today and in the future.

The Melita Foundation and similar foundations on the Maltese and international scene serve as an example to commercial organisations seeking to align with ESG (environmental social and governance) principles and to make a positive contribution to the communities in which they operate.

Foundations of this nature which are created with clear objectives and which reflect the values of their founders and at the same time have the resources and independence needed to make decisions on beneficiaries are able to create a platform through which real change can take place

Besides Sammut-Bonnici Montanaro and Muscat the foundation also includes executives Gertrude Borg Micallef Amanda Holmes and Maria Mallia. Charlene Ciantar coordinates the foundation’s functions across all projects.

NYC NYCHA Housing. Image via AIANY

In the world of design and urban planning aesthetics and functionality seem to take the spotlight especially in how large-scale housing projects are developed. While this can be a good thing that continuously pushes the modern boundary of what we consider to be a dwelling in some aspects it has shined a negative light on how we perceive and stigmatize “bad design” in public and affordable housing the socioeconomic factors that have created the need for it and the types of residents who benefit most from these types of housing policies.

First it’s important to define the difference between public housing and affordable housing and while the definition of each varies between geographic locations in a broad sense they are often viewed similarly. Public housing contains units that are publicly owned publicly funded and feature permanently affordable units. Oftentimes these buildings are permanently affordable as they only charge 30% of each household’s rent as income. Affordable housing is owned by private developers investors or non-private corporations and the funding is sourced through public and private means. Only a fraction of units in these buildings are required to be affordable to make a project “affordable housing” and are only affordable for a certain number of years after which units can become market rate. But regardless of the financial terms of these homes occasionally they have been associated with designs that stand in contrast to the boom of luxury housing that cities around the world have been experiencing.

The way in which these buildings have historically been designed gives them a look and feel that is low-budget and low-design quality. Paired with the popular NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) mindset that low-income housing being built in certain neighborhoods will cause property values to fall this has accumulated into the perfect storm of perhaps why there is such a shortage of low-income housing. While those who are against these types of communities being built want to protect their personal investments those who cry for more affordable housing want to have a reasonably proportionate amount of their income go towards rent while also having ample access to good jobs quality schools and other daily amenities. But this black and white two-dimensional thinking on what “affordability” actually means translates into the idea that the experiential aspects of these residences shouldn’t matter because both ideas prioritize cost over design. By this same logic affordable housing should not only be cheap since people will be paying less for it but it will then visually look inexpensive as well. The resulting buildings carry an aesthetic that sometimes resembles a fortress more so than a desirable living space.

On the positive there are a number of new projects being built that aim to transform the future of affordable housing into something less monotonous and publicly accepted as aesthetically pleasing. This includes using materials that are more commonplace in the modern era of design enhancing public spaces activating the ground level and strategically locating these among other existing housing projects that nearly rival newly constructed luxury condominiums such as the Sierra Bonita Building which cost just over 13 million dollars to construct. In addition to its 42 units it also provides a community center to help serve people with disabilities and other non-profit organizations on the lower floor.

Even in New York City where NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) owns and manages more than 300 buildings that are infamous for their dreary exteriors architects have begun to reimage not only their future designs but their policies that could better serve more people. Dozens of projects are underway including the highly anticipated Holmes Tower which might eventually be the tallest Passive House building in the world. Affordable housing that looks dreary and drab is an outdated architectural concept. As we look towards the future of creating better more efficient cities for all residents aesthetics and design effort need to be put into every project regardless of its use.

The developer initially bought a house on a 1621sq m block at 8 Frederick Street and then the two neighbouring blocks of nine apartments at 10 and 16 Frederick Street for a total of about $12.6 million.

Central Equity co-founder and chairman Eddie Kutner said the Gold Coast was ripe for transformation.

“There is a permanent change that has come over the Gold Coast and we want to be a big part of it” Kutner said.

“We have developed 85 residential projects with a 100 per cent completion rate … this will be our first tower outside Melbourne.

The greatest breakdown during the storm which forced controlled electrical blackouts in Kansas and Missouri industry groups have said was natural gas which was in short supply and rose to 200 times its normal price during the worst stretch of the storm.

So far two of Kansas’ largest natural gas companies have filed to collect a combined $539.5 million from ratepayers over as long as 10 years. Some Evergy customers in Kansas will pay for $152.3 million in power costs from Winter Storm Uri over two years.

But as regulators review those companies’ plans and prepare to pass on the costs to Kansas ratepayers some groups representing large-scale customers say that — even six months later — the state has more work to do investigating the cause of huge natural gas price spikes during the storm.

“We don’t know who got the bag of cash but somebody got it” said C. Edward Watson II an attorney representing several large-scale customers including the Catholic Diocese of Wichita.

Watson on behalf of his clients joined a motion filed with the Kansas Corporation Commission by the Natural Gas Transportation Customer Coalition to subpoena a national gas price index to look for signs of market manipulation or dysfunction. NGTCC represented by attorney Jim Zakoura also wants the Kansas Gas Service to disclose the names of suppliers that charged such high prices during the storm. In the filing Zakoura wrote KGS has not challenged the extraordinarily high February gas prices.

“Essentially KGS has abandoned its advocacy on behalf of its Kansas ratepayers — the very ratepayers who will be obligated to pay $451 million for seven days of natural gas if ordered by the commission” the filing says.

KGS has yet to file a response to the motion but said in a statement it cooperated with investigations into the natural gas price spike and disputed some invoices from its suppliers. It did not answer whether it agreed with the call for subpoena of S&P Global Platts Gas Daily.

At the same time the attorney general’s office is investigating whether any price gouging took place during the storm.

The Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board the state’s dedicated consumer advocate said it’s important the parties cooperate with that investigation.

In a statement Black Hills Energy’s spokesman James Williams also pointed to the attorney general’s investigation.

“Identifying who profited from the winter storm is the responsibility of governmental bodies but the cost of gas is a pass-through expense for Black Hills Energy” Williams said. “We’re committed to helping find a solution for our customers that lessens the impact of this historic event.”

In Missouri Spire has yet to file a plan to recover the costs it incurred to keep heat on for Kansas City-area and Western Missouri residents during the storm. In an email a spokesman said the utility would file with the Public Service Commission this fall.

Spire is currently in a battle over a pipeline it installed in the St. Louis area which it says was instrumental in avoiding the need to cut off gas service to residents in eastern Missouri.

‘$1 billion and it’s all gone’

All told the Kansas Gas Service incurred an additional $390 million in extraordinary gas costs in February plus carrying costs. It has filed a plan to recover those over five seven or 10 years increasing customers’ bills by anywhere from about $5 to $11 per month.

Black Hills customers could see their bills go up by $12.23 per month to recoup $87.9 million in costs over five years.

Atmos Energy has yet to file a plan but according to its quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission it incurred an estimated $76.7 million in excess natural gas costs.

Along with Evergy’s filings loans taken out by municipalities that supply their residents power and cooperatives across the state the total cost of the storm is $953.9 million according to a filing by NGTCC. That doesn’t account for costs incurred by large-scale customers that purchase their natural gas directly such as hospitals school districts and large businesses.

Zakoura noted Kansas ratepayers weren’t getting any new wind or solar farms new or safer pipelines or other upgrades in exchange for their high bills. He called it the “most costly event in the last 50 years.”

“This is $1 billion and it’s all gone” he said.

David Nickel executive director of the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board called the event substantial but said the utilities were doing their due diligence to lessen the impact on customers. He said he understood Zakoura’s point that no new infrastructure came from the huge sum but he said it depends on “how you determine value.”

“The whole concept of being able to live through this event without having massive curtailments without having blackouts that roll through the states like we did in Texas … I think there’s value to that” he said.

To recover those costs from residents the gas utilities have to incur them prudently. If they don’t the KCC can deny the unreasonable costs. Nickel said he doesn’t see any evidence the utilities took on unreasonable costs but that CURB and KCC staff will investigate.

Williams said Black Hills’ purchases followed regulators’ instructions to “do all things possible and necessary to ensure continued natural gas service.”

And while some municipalities or large consumer customers are challenging their bills Zakoura said utilities supplying gas to residential customers aren’t doing enough to challenge the exorbitant gas prices they paid before passing the surcharges on to their customers.

Between Feb. 1 and Feb. 18 average gas prices on the Southern Star Pipeline which serves Kansas rose from $2.55 to $622.79 according to the S&P Global Platts Gas Daily which relies on gas companies to report their purchases. Zakoura said on the days the prices were highest only a handful of trades were reported to make up that average.

Zakoura filed a motion in the Kansas Gas Service’s proceedings before the KCC to subpoena the index saying there was “overwhelming circumstantial evidence of a dysfunctional market that was characterized by unconscionable price increases” during the cold snap.

The filing claimed KGS had made no effort to challenge the high prices it was charged for gas.

“This docket is not a docket that is solely focused on the issue of ‘the length of time’ that Kansas ratepayers will have in order to pay KGS $451 million” the filing said. “It is equally if not more focused on whether KGS ratepayers should pay KGS $451 million and whether Kansas residents businesses and governments should pay $1 billion for seven days supply of natural gas.”

In its statement KGS said it had made purchases tied to the S&P price which isn’t known until the market closes at the end of the day. That amounted to about 30% of the gas purchased during the storm.

The utility hasn’t “lodged an independent investigation of the prices” said spokeswoman Dawn Tripp who added that KGS disputed invoices from some of its suppliers.

KGS has yet to file a response with the KCC but has resisted Zakoura’s filings seeking to have the company disclose its suppliers saying those are confidential business dealings.

Tripp said the company submitted documents to the KCC CURB attorney general’s office NGTCC and others under a protective order. It noted the KCC staff and CURB had not objected to the protective order.

Tripp said KGS purchases gas through a competitive bid process it considered confidential.

“Natural gas suppliers may be reluctant to sell gas to Kansas Gas Service if the only option is under a public contract” Tripp said. “With fewer suppliers available to purchase gas from it would likely result in higher gas prices paid by Kansas Gas Service’s sales customers.”

Black Hills too said it does not publicly disclose contract prices.

KCC staff filed a response Thursday to Zakoura’s motion supporting KGS’ position that the documents should be confidential. In its filing it noted the KCC and CURB are designated to protect residential consumers not NGTCC.

“While staff fully understands and appreciates the extraordinary nature of the winter weather event” the filing said “staff finds it difficult to agree that the extraordinary nature of the event requires an extraordinary deviation from traditional commission practice related to confidentiality.”

Frank Helin told the TMI-2 Community Advisory Panel that the towers will come down in 2022 instead of this fall.

The decommissioner TMI-2 Solutions is a subsidiary of EnergySolutions a Utah-based company that tries to turn a profit by dismantling inactive nuclear sites under budget. TMI-2 Solutions acquired the reactor’s license from FirstEnergy in December.

The company plans to start removing what remains of TMI-2’s damaged core by mid-2022. It expects to complete the entire clean-up process by 2037.

EnergySolutions spokesman Mark Walker said the delay in taking down the cooling towers does not affect the rest of the process.

“During the planning process of TMI-2 decommissioning we determined there would be less impact to other decommissioning activities taking place on the island later this year” he said in a statement.

That includes the transfer of spent fuel from TMI-1 the plant’s other reactor out of underwater storage and into dry containers.

TMI-1 owned by Exelon closed permanently in 2019.

The state Department of Environmental Protection said the cooling tower demolition does not present a safety risk.

Eric Epstein chair of the watchdog group Three Mile Island Alert said that while he is not concerned about the cooling towers he believes the reactor building may have more radioactive material than the company is prepared to deal with.

“Our concern is making sure that the plant is finally cleaned up 42 years later” he said. “We don’t believe the company that owns TMI-2 has the technology the expertise or the resources to clean the plant up.”

On its website  TMI-2 Solutions says it anticipates the project will cost $1.06 billion. It says the trust fund dedicated to the reactor’s decommissioning contains about $877 million but that fund growth over time will provide enough money to cover the costs.

A 2020 report from GPU Nuclear a subsidiary of FirstEnergy stated that the fund contained about $899 million and that a 2018 site assessment had estimated the cleanup cost at $1.35 billion.

In a 2020 petition to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission opposing the license transfer from FirstEnergy to TMI-2 Solutions TMI Alert contended that the company failed to adequately survey the site for contamination and that the trust fund will not grow fast enough to cover the expanded price tag.

The NRC denied TMI Alert’s request for a hearing.

The DEP had also expressed concern about the company’s ability to pay for the project but the agency withdrew its objection last August.

Helin said Wednesday that TMI-2 Solutions plans to continue assessing the level of radioactivity in the reactor building including using robots to take samples of concrete walls in the building’s basement.

The reactor has been dormant since 1979 when it partially melted down during the most serious accident at a commercial nuclear plant in U.S. history.

Demolishing the TMI-2 cooling towers will mark the beginning of the end for a fixture of the central Pennsylvania landscape.

“As a kid even I went on hikes up at Rocky Ridge Park here in York County” said Shen Kreiser a nuclear planner in the county and a member of the Community Advisory Panel. At the top she recalled you get a clear view of the nuclear plant.

“You know it’s Three Mile Island because of the cooling towers” she said.

The decommissioning company said the plant’s history figures into its plans noting Wednesday that it aims to set aside pieces of the control room and other artifacts for the Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office as the project continues.

View the current offers here.

The term 'Spirit Airlines' evokes lots of emotions especially in light of some of the airline's recent operational challenges. But while that was a pretty terrible run of events for the airline and its passengers during times of normal operations Spirit can be an affordable and underrated way to get across the country (and beyond).

Flying Spirit can be a solid choice even if you decide to sit in the admittedly cramped economy seats. But Spirit also has bigger seats at the front of the plane that it calls Big Front Seats. And if you book these Spirit seats you can fly in what is essentially a domestic first-class seat for at least 50% off the regular cost on most traditional airlines.

Spirit's Big Front Seats are in the first couple of rows of each aircraft. And if you've never flown in them you may be surprised by the experience -- in a good way. They are essentially the same as other domestic first-class seats available on most U.S. airlines but are usually available for a much lower price.

What are Spirit Airlines Big Front Seats?

On Spirit Airlines every advance seat assignment costs extra whether you pick the last row or the first row. The difference of course is how much the various seat assignments cost. Unquestionably Big Front Seats cost several times more than any other seat on the Spirit aircraft.

Spirit's Big Front Seats are covered in leather have 36 inches of pitch and are 18.5 inches wide. This means you have an additional six inches of legroom beyond Spirit's standard seats and they are two across per side of the aisle instead of three with the regular seats.

As with all Spirit's seats Big Front Seats come ""pre-reclined."" So you can't change the recline on a Big Front Seat.

Big Front Seat on Spirit Airlines (Photo by Javier Rodriguez/The Points Guy)

I've flown in both types of seats with Spirit — multiple times.

Historically the easy advice to give is that yes Spirit's Big Front Seats are absolutely worth it. But since that's just too easy of an answer (and prices seem to have recently increased) I'll be slightly more nuanced.

Related: 8 thoughts after first Spirit Airlines flight in several years

When are Spirit's Big Front Seats worth it?

If the flight is short (less than two to three hours) you are on the smaller side and every dollar counts skip Spirit's Big Front Seats if you can't justify the cost.

For a family of four even a $60 Big Front Seat upgrade would result in $480 of additional charges based on round-trip travel. This is not a small amount especially if you're traveling on a budget.

Spirit's Big Front Seats don't get you any included bags snacks or other perks besides the larger seat. So keeping that cash safely tucked in your wallet can sometimes make sense. After all you're probably flying Spirit because it's cheap not because it's luxurious or comfortable.

But on the other hand if you can fly in a nice big seat for far less than the cost of an economy ticket on another airline it's worth considering.

I've found that when you fly in the Big Front Seats you are often with small business owners and relatively frequent flyers who largely put on their headphones and sleep or work (since the trays are actually large enough up there for a laptop). In that way it ends up feeling a lot like every other airline.

It can also make sense to book the Big Front Seats if you want more space. My husband is a taller guy and while he doesn't get especially excited about flying Spirit he will agree to it if -- and only if -- we book the Big Front Seats. On our recent flight home to Houston from Las Vegas Spirit had a good departure time and a much lower price than United even when factoring in the additional $68 fee per seat Big Front Seat assignment. So we booked Big Front Seats and didn't look back.

Happy kids in Spirit's Big Front Seats. (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

How much does the Big Front Seat cost?

The price of a Big Front Seat upgrade varies based on your flight and if you have elite status. I've seen the price for a Big Front Seat cost a little bit less for those logged in with Gold elite status but only by a few dollars.

While you can see the number of available Big Front Seats when pricing out Spirit flights you don't see the actual upgrade price until much further in the booking process. I've seen these upgrades start at around $20 per person on shorter flights in the past. But currently the lowest prices I'm seeing are in the $40 to $60 range.

In test searches done for updating this article the cost to select a Big Front Seat is currently much higher than it used to be.

In fact on many of the routes I tested Big Front Seats now cost $100 or more per flight. However I rarely found routes higher than $100 even just a few weeks ago. In my recent tests I found a handful of shorter routes (such as Los Angeles to Las Vegas) priced at under $100 for the Big Front Seats. But on average the prices were twice what I used to see and can frequently be in the $100 to $140 range.

Here's a current real-life example.

A month from now Spirit Airlines wants $54 to fly in a standard seat without a specific advance seat assignment from Houston to Las Vegas on a Saturday night. Going for an assigned Big Front Seat adds $135 for a total of $189 for a pretty comfy nonstop ride to Vegas.

United wants $242 for the same route at about the same time on a basic economy fare that also wouldn't come with an advance seat assignment. A regular economy ticket with a seat assignment on United costs $281. United's domestic first-class seat which is basically the same as Spirit's Big Front Seat rings in on that flight at $510 — over 2.5 times the cost of Spirit's similarly sized seat.

That's a pretty good example that even with higher prices for the Big Front Seat than I'm used to it's still possible to save real money over the traditional air carriers' cheapest economy tickets while still sitting in a much larger Spirit Big Front Seat. Of course there are other trade-offs to factor into the equation when deciding to fly Spirit. But on a seat-to-seat comparison Spirit's Big Front Seats are often one of the best values in the sky for those looking for a little more than just the cheapest available seat.

It's also worth noting that in Spirit's new frequent flyer program you now earn 12 to 20 points per dollar (depending on your status level) for ancillary charges such as Big Front Seat assignments. TPG values Spirit points at 1.1 cents each which means that you'll essentially earn a 13 to 22% return in Spirit points on any money you spend to reserve Big Front Seats.

We've also experienced Big Front Seat purchases counting towards cards' annual travel and airline fee credits with cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve and The Platinum Card® from American Express (enrollment required). If you have a card like that in your wallet that's a way to potentially enjoy some extra space when flying with Spirit without spending as much out of pocket for the 'upgrade.'

Bottom line

You may not always need a larger seat to get where you're going with Spirit. Sometimes the cheapest available ticket is the best one for the situation. However if your budget can accommodate the added cost of a Spirit Airlines Big Front Seat your back — and perhaps your mood — will probably thank you for the extra investment in the journey.

If I'm flying with my two kids it sometimes makes more sense for us to sit three across in less expensive seats than spend several hundred dollars more on the Big Front Seats. But on the flip side if I'm flying by myself or just with my husband who really appreciates the extra space then paying for Big Front Seats can make sense.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L21vdG9yaW5nLzEyNTk5Mjk2Mi9yb2FkLXRlc3QtcmV2aWV3LW1pdHN1YmlzaGktZWNsaXBzZS1jcm9zcy1waGV20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Road test review: Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross PHEV,,,,,,,

The oil and gas sector has been experimenting with solar power as a generation source for oil operations for decades such as this Chevron (then ChevronTexaco) California project in 2003. As costs of solar come down and pressure intensifies on oil companies to cut emissions more renewable energy will de deployed but it may remain limited — in scope and effectiveness.

Oil and gas companies are working hard on their messaging in the climate change era. If it's ""code red for humanity"" as the UN's IPCC said last Monday in its latest dire climate report it's some sort of ""code red"" for the fossil fuels industry too in terms of figuring out how to stay relevant believable — and for the market investable — in an era of carbon emissions reduction mandates from governments regulators and shareholders. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub took a stab at it earlier this year saying fossil fuels aren't the problem — it's emissions. It follows that if fossil fuel companies can find ways to eliminate emissions on a large enough scale maybe they can convince shareholders and stakeholders that they are moving into the future in more sustainable way. But there are big differences in emissions types and emissions reduction strategies. What oil and gas companies do to reduce emissions in their operations and supply chain are in the end a smaller part of the carbon reduction game than reducing what is known as Scope 3 emissions — for example from the tailpipe of your car. Those Scope 3 emissions by expert estimates are responsible for the vast majority of carbon emissions from the energy industry.

Lowering carbon emissions profile of oil and gas drilling

Companies including ExxonMobil have begun to disclose Scope 3 emissions but in terms of their efforts to reduce emissions remain focused on their own operations. What oil and gas companies do to lower operational emissions the energy used to power drilling and all the way to the trucks going to and from drilling sites does matter. Though how much it matters is inevitably smaller in the grander scheme of carbon emissions reduction efforts. ""The electricity oil and gas companies use is a pretty small contributor to their carbon footprint"" said Chris Archer head of Americas for Macquarie Capital's Green Investment Group. Occidental has been a leader in many of the new technology approaches to lowering the emissions profile of the oil and gas business. As Hollub told CNBC earlier this year ""The reality of a net-zero carbon barrel it is possible and we are doing things to make it possible. It's not a goal on a sheet of paper."" Occidental is working on multiple projects related to carbon sequestration not just for its operations but other heavy emitters in the industrial sector. A growing but smaller part of that new technology thinking for oil and gas operations which is expected to see more development in the future is solar energy — solar panel arrays spreading out in places like the Permian Basin to help lower the emissions profile of oil and gas operations. Occidental already has a 16 megawatt solar farm in the Permian — the first large-scale solar project to directly power oil and gas operations in Texas — and Hollub told CNBC earlier this year ""we will be doing more of that. We believe it will take everything and we will add more solar over time.""

Oil and gas industry's history with solar

Solar isn't a new thing for oil and gas. Chevron had a project powering operations in the Kern oil field of California as far back as 2003 and BP even got into solar panel manufacturing for decades under Sir John Browne's ""Beyond Petroleum"" mission (before solar manufacturing became mostly China's game and most everyone else went bankrupt). ""This isn't a brand new journey"" said Amy Chronis leader of Deloitte's US Oil Gas & Chemicals team in Houston. ""But it's still early days to see broad-based carbon reductions."" Now several of the European and U.S. majors are making major investments in renewable again including BP and Royal Dutch Shell  and all the big oil and gas companies have at least a few solar power projects whether they developed them on their own or signed what are known as power purchase agreements with project developers including ExxonMobil which has added to its renewable energy portfolio in recent years. It bought 500 megawatts of wind and solar in 2018 from Danish renewable energy company Orsted the largest renewable deal ever signed by a U.S. major. Chevron signed its own 500 MW project last summer with the energy generation to be split between the Permian Argentina and Kazakhstan. A lot of the renewable energy history within solar has been more fits and starts — and lower down the priority list —than consistent application to the business. Though the pressure is mounting. Benjamin Shattuck research director for Americas upstream oil and gas at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said most of the companies he follows in the U.S. are still fairly early on in their journey to a carbon reduction model but as environmental performance and ESG become more mainstream — he said ESG is top of agenda when he talks to oil CEOs lately —and more companies talk about net-zero targets and tie executive compensation to the goals the situation is rapidly changing. ""Oxy is one of the companies helping to lead the conversation between the Goldsmith solar plant [the 16 MW plant Hollub referenced] and longer-term carbon capture and storage they are thinking about it from a bold standpoint which is good to see. Everything points to it picking up and accelerating"" Shattuck said.

The Permian is well-suited to renewables

Places like the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico are well-suited to renewable energy with lots of land and a regulatory framework favorable to project development whether oil and gas or renewables but the economics have to make sense. And increasingly they do.

Archer says these companies can have a much bigger impact on carbon reduction through carbon capture efforts and flaring reduction than by going into renewables for the power. But the Permian Basin is one of the best places in the U.S. to cite solar with loads of cheap flat land and really good irradiance. ""Today solar for lots of oil and gas is the economic choice versus diesel generators"" Archer said. That implies solar and wind projects being developed may have been less about a focus on carbon reduction in his view than being driven by the power generation being economically competitive. And Archer said given how economic solar has become in places like the Permian if oil and gas companies were serious about it as a de-carbonization strategy we might have seen more of it already under development.

Never going to be oil's carbon solution

No one is suggesting solar is oil's solution. One or two solar plants ""won't move the needle"" Shattuck said. But larger power purchase agreements and multiple projects across companies in the sector isn't insignificant either in his view. ""More operations need to be powered from renewables whether they own the projects or are taking renewable generation from the grid"" Shattuck said. It's a complex process to attempt to make oil and gas drilling operations 100% renewable from running the drilling rigs to generators and compressors and fracking trucks to get people to and from the field. The energy being used to prepare and drill new wells is greater than for existing wells and these operations are not stationary either moving around the Permian from West Texas to New Mexico with electric needs variable. In other words if you build a solar plant in one area you can't just easily pick it up and move it to another where more wells are being focused on. That's why Shattuck said we may see more oil and gas companies signing power purchase agreements with project developers. ""In some cases that alleviates the capital risk"" he said. But all the diesel that is used today — especially the more remote a drilling site is —does represent a wide range of power replacement opportunities.

The oil field is emissions reduction 'low-hanging fruit'

Because Scope 3 emissions are the vast majority of emissions and the furthest from the oil and gas companies direct control — and maybe active interest in controlling with ExxonMobil saying that while it will track Scope 3 it is really up to society and consumers to make their own energy choices — renewable energy in the fields is in a sense the low-hanging fruit. ""Electrification of the oil field is important and solar and wind can play a role part of a larger puzzle that has to be solved. There isn't a single solution today that's the theme"" Shattuck said. ""It needs to be multi-technology for them."" This won't go over well with those ready to leave the fossil fuels economy behind because the model is in effect augmenting what oil and gas companies are doing in the oil field rather than representing any full-scale pivot. It's the emissions are the problem —not fossil fuels — of Hollub.

Building solar is not their solution. It's good asset management with economic benefits on their existing assets. But it's not a rubric through which they de-carbonize. Chris Archer Macquarie Capital's Green Investment Group

But that low-hanging fruit gives the companies a means to test the market see how investors and stakeholders react and going down the road of renewables because it's not what they have typically done in the past is part of the effort that will be put into winning back investors in the years ahead. ""They need to find out what's hitting the mark and what isn't and if Goldsmith [the Oxy solar project] is resonating well with investors then maybe they do more"" Shattuck said.

The first net-zero oil barrel

Archer worries it is still more about issuing a press release than executing on significant change and he is skeptical that these projects can change the image of these companies. ""When was the last time you bought something from Oxy? It's not like you're swayed as a consumer"" he said. ""Building a 20 MW solar farm and issuing a press release won't earn you many points. You need a bigger strategy and goals."" But while the consumer at the gas pump may not think in those carbon-neutral barrel terms today industrial buyers already do. ""We have talked to companies producing natural gas and the off taker is a utility and that utility does care about the carbon footprint about the gas burning in a power plant"" said Kate Hardin executive director of the Deloitte Research Center for Energy & Industrials. ""So maybe it is not as direct as a person as the end user in retail but companies buying the oil and gas may care."" And that is exactly what happened in early 2021 when Oxy shipped its first-ever carbon-neutral barrel of oil to India and issued a press release about it. There are multiple business cases to make in the future that revolve around more of these deals if on the margins and that relate back to the value of more renewable energy generation in the fields. Oil and gas companies need to find new competitive advantages and even if there is a case where the economics of a solar plant don't work on their own decreasing export risk could be another way to make the model productive. ""It will be interesting to watch that competition. It's proof of concept work really early on"" Shattuck said. That work comes at time when the sector is focused more on capital discipline and budget cuts then spending making it more difficult for oil and gas companies to pull the trigger on experiments with technology. One of the biggest questions for the future of the oil and gas industry is tied up in the question of how much renewable energy development it pursues — what percentage of the overall spending is earmarked for carbon emissions reduction. ""I don't think it will be an insignificant amount. If they want to continue to have access to funding and capital they will have to continue with a variety of these technologies and strategies and we will learn more about what's most effective"" Shattuck said. The oil and gas companies early work on solar implies they are learning and getting familiar with the technology and it will stay in the mix but other initiatives will be more material in Archer's view. ""Building solar is not their solution. It's good asset management with economic benefits on their existing assets. But it's not a rubric through which they de-carbonize. But we will see more of it"" he said. For a long time the oil and gas industry could do no right when it came to cutting spending and running operations on a more conservative basis. But in recent years the industry has been forced by investors to do just that. Now capital discipline is a top priority to stay in favor with investors. Carbon reduction efforts including renewable energy projects like solar are a different mode of thinking than deciding on exploration spending but there's a similarity: the companies are leapfrogging each other in terms of targets and as technology gets rolled out it will play a role in the sector players that investors decide on as the likely winners. ""It would be surprising if the budget line item is low"" Shattuck said. Especially with oil and gas executive compensation packages now much more frequently designed to only go up if carbon emissions go down.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNC9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9wcm9zcGVyaXR5LWZwc28taHVsbC1hcnJpdmVzLWluLXNpbmdhcG9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prosperity FPSO hull arrives in Singapore,"The hull for the Prosperity Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit is now moored next to the Liza Unity at the Keppel yard in Singapore as SBM Offshore prepares to commence with the next phase of construction.

SBM Offshore has announced that the hull for the Prosperity FPSO has arrived safely at the Keppel yard in Singapore paving the way for the next stage of construction to commence with the topside modules being integrated at the yard.

In a statement the company noted that despite the various challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic the FPSO remains on schedule to be completed in 2024. It was disclosed that drydock activities are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of this year with the installation of major structures that will support the Mooring and Subsea Risers.

The project is part of the Payara development project which is the third ExxonMobil-led development within the Stabroek block about 200 kilometers offshore Guyana. Some US$1.05 billion has been allocated for the construction of the FPSO.

In keeping the standardization philosophy that guides the Fast4Ward® program the Prosperity FPSO by in large replicates the design used for the Liza Unity FPSO. SBM said that this approach has showcased the value of Fast4Ward® ensuring that the final product is delivered faster to ExxonMobil. Once installed the vessel is intended to produce roughly 220000 barrels of oil per day and will be able to store around 2 million barrels of crude oil.

Once completed Prosperity will join her sister vessel Liza Unity currently under construction at the same yard and Liza Destiny operational since end of 2019 offshore Guyana.

Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited an affiliate of ExxonMobil is the operator and holds a 45 per cent interest in the Stabroek block Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd. holds a 30 per cent interest and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited holds a 25 per cent interest.

In October 2020 Exxon awarded the Prosperity contract to SBM for the next phase of the Payara development project. Under those contracts SBM will construct install and then lease and operate the Prosperity FPSO for a period of up to two years after which the FPSO ownership and operation will transfer to EEPGL. The award followed completion of front-end engineering and design studies completion of the multi-purpose hull receipt of requisite government approvals and the final investment decision on the project by ExxonMobil and co-venturers in the Stabroek Block.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNS9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9ndXlhbmEtc2hvcmUtYmFzZS1zZWVraW5nLWlkYi1sb2FuLWZvci11czEzMG0taG91c3Rvbi1leHBhbnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guyana Shore Base seeking IDB loan for US$130M Houston expansion,"The Guyana Shore Base Inc (GYSBI) is seeking Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financing to expand its Houston facility to potentially provide support for up to five floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units among other upgrades.

ExxonMobil has said that its planned scale of operations is too large for GYSBI to solely meet its needs and in March of this year advertised for firms to show their onshore support services capabilities.

While it is unclear if the company has secured any commitments from ExxonMobil on providing additional supports services the IDB project summary for GYSBI’s proposal states that the financing would help it to build additional berths at its Houston Port to accommodate the increased number of ships to be associated with future oil and gas operations.

The proposal for the expansion has been made even as across the Demerara River work is forging ahead on TriStar Inc’s six- berth facility and down north of the river a consortium of local businessmen is planning to build another mega- shore base. At Parika Stanley Ming is also developing a US$200 million shore base with a United Kingdom partner.

The summary of the proposal submitted in April of this year states that the company is seeking the support of IDB to refinance certain existing bridge loans expand GYSBI’s port and shore base facilities through the construction of four additional berths increase the size of the Shore Base logistics support area develop and construct an infill project that will allow offloading of heavier cargo purchase and construct a waste management facility install rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity to meet GYSBI’s energy needs and construct additional warehouse capacity.

It added that the company is seeking total debt financing of approximately US$130 million and that IDB Invest as a lender provide approximately US$70 million.

In April the company had facilitated a press tour of a US$16 million project expansion it was working on to add two specialty berthing facilities. This it said was after a two-and-a-half-year construction hold-up of the project by the then APNU+AFC government. It added that it was continuing “full throttle” with plans from 2019. The GYSBI and government had said that the project was being executed to further boost local content as all heavy-lifting and storage works will be transferred to Guyana from the current location in Trinidad and Tobago.

In a 2019 interview with Stabroek News GYSBI Partner Robin Muneshwer had pointed to an increase from a two to four-berth facility that would operate on a 24-hour basis at the Houston waterfront property and that it formed part of a US$100 million planned second phase of expansion.

When the company had announced the US$100 million expansion of its operations here General Manager Mark Edwards had informed also that plans were in place to invest a further US$50 million ($10.4 billion) in the next 12 months.

It is unclear if since then the company had plans to access the over US$100 million loan.

With 350 employees of which it boasts a 95% local workforce GYSBI currently provides support for oil and gas operator companies in Guyana. It also offers services such as waste management chemical storage warehousing construction berthing of supply vessels cargo marshalling area loading and offloading supply chain management expatriate management and customs services having expanded beyond the traditional pipe yards found in Guyana.

Environmental Impact

The company has submitted to the IDB not only its expansion proposals but an Environmental Assessment and Environment Management Plan having already gotten approval from the Environmental Protection Agency and said that it also plans to build an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF).

This Environmental Assessment (EA) addresses the proposed improvements to the Port’s transport and logistics improvements and acknowledges that the Project could also potentially lead to “negative environmental and social impacts during its construction and operation.”

The ES states that potential environmental and social impacts resulting from project-related activities include emissions and noise from construction and operations vehicles vessels fuel storage and equipment noise generated by construction equipment and activities dredging activities for berths’ construction and maintenance dredging flood risk waste generated by construction and operations activities decreased pedestrian and traffic safety and increased traffic congestion and disruption.

In addition to increased traffic congestion it said that there would also be increased river traffic decreased access to critical facilities shopping and bus stops.

Possible too with the expansion is the loss or disturbance of vegetation wildlife injury or mortality underwater noise degradation of aquatic habitats and increased surface water runoff from vegetation clearing.

From its assessment GYSBI said that none of the mentioned impacts were determined “to be major and would all be reduced to minor or negligible with the implementation of appropriate management measures.”

An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) was also developed outlining the measures and actions necessary to further minimise impacts to acceptable levels. The company said that implementation of the project would result in positive environmental and social impacts as the project components would address the port’s operational inefficiencies and its adjacent infrastructure.

“This EA considers both the construction and operations phase of the Project and focuses mainly on the relevant existing physical biological and socioeconomic environments within the direct footprint of the Project namely the new berths 3 and 4 the GYSBI Port area and the Annex” the project summary states.

However the company noted that it is understood that in the case of some impacts such as air quality noise and traffic impacts may extend beyond the immediate Project footprint. As such both a Direct Area influence (DAI) and an Indirect Area of Influence (IAI) were defined for the Project.

The DAI for the Project was defined as “the footprint of the Project where the majority of the impacts from the Project are expected to occur and/or be experienced most acutely namely: new berths 3 and 4 GYSBI Port and the GYSBI Industrial Estate or its “Annex”.

The IAI of the Project is defined as the area within a 500-metre radius of the project footprint where some impacts such as traffic dust and noise disturbance could occur but generally with a lower level of intensity than in the DAI.

‘Integrated waste management facility’

And with plans to have a facility to treat both hazardous and non-hazardous waste here GYSBI’s expansion plans has inclusion for an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) to be executed and managed by its partner Sustainable Environment Solutions.

The company prepared a separate Environment Management Plan for that aspect of the project. The 233-page plan says that with limited alternatives for waste management solutions for the emerging oil and gas sector the idea for the facility was birthed. “The commencement of production offshore has resulted in a greater need to develop facilities to safely receive treat and dispose of waste generated by the sector. Sustainable Environmental Solutions (Guyana) Inc (SES) has responded to this need by pursuing the establishment of an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF).

This initiative according to the company is based on a request from Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) for a facility to receive treat and dispose of waste generated by its offshore operations.

“SES intends to design build and operate an IWMF for EEPGL’s generated hazardous and non-hazardous waste and which will have the ability to safely manage all waste generated offshore and onshore. The facility will be built and operated in accordance with EEPGL’s corporate social and environmental responsibilities and conform to local national and international standard” it said.

The principle of the operation points out that wastes generated on the offshore installations will be shipped to Georgetown and received at the GYSBI berths. GYSBI will off-load the wastes from the Production Support Vessels and transport it to the IWMF reception gate. From that point onwards SES becomes responsible for the waste on-site and the operational provisions of this EMP become effective.

Additionally waste treated and neutralised by the IWMF that is identified for disposal at the Haags Bosch landfill will be collected from the IWMF by Purans Brothers Inc.

The company will no longer take responsibility from the point of departure and it will be Purans Brothers Inc that bears all such responsibilities for waste management and disposal.

On its roles and responsibilities in the waste management process the company said that already the inter-relationship between the partners and third-party contractors in this project determines their respective responsibilities for waste management.

It explained “The IWMF will treat wastes generated by EEPGL and its various subcontractors associated with the offshore oil exploration and production activities. The SES operated IWMF will not initially be accepting wastes from other businesses and activities in Guyana and is primarily intended as a dedicated facility to Guyana’s offshore hydrocarbon exploration and production industry. Once fully operational however SES may also offer its advanced waste treatment facilities to other third parties in Guyana. SES will provide the EPA with a declaration of those other waste types their provenance quantity and treatment prior to accepting such wastes.”

“GYSBI owns and operates the shore base facility and is responsible for receiving the wastes at its Production Support Vessel (PSV) berths off-loading and bringing the wastes to the reception area of the IWMF. The management of wastes on the offshore production facilities and at the GYSBI off-loading operations is not covered in this EMP as SES has no control over these off-site activities. The governance of the wastes outside the IWMF is set out in the respective Environmental Permits of EEPGL and GYSBI.”",,,,,,

The firm posted a net loss of $165.3 million or 48 cents per share in the second quarter compared to a profit of $7.8 million the year before. According to FactSet analysts expected a 6-cent loss per share.

SoFi’s revenue increased to $231.3 million from $115.0 million compared to $218.6 million expected by analysts.

Following the news SoFi’s shares fell about 12% in after-hours trading on Thursday the firm’s first since coming public in June through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company.

The company’s entire user base increased to 2.6 million from 1.2 million a year ago while total products increased to 3.7 million from 1.6 million. According to SoFi’s earnings report both growth numbers reflect the company’s product portfolio expanding.

SoFi’s loan division produced total net revenue of $166.3 million in the most recent quarter up from $95.9 million the year before. In the lending industry there were 981440 product originations including 18102 house loans 544068 personal loans and 419270 student loans.

The financial services division brought in $17.0 million in revenue up from $2.4 million the previous year. The section had $41.8 million in directly attributable expenditures bringing the contribution loss to $24.7 million. SoFi had $33.3 million in directly attributable expenditures a year ago bringing the contribution loss to $30.9 million.

SoFi’s technology division which consists mostly of the Galileo Financial Technologies activities that it purchased in May 2020 witnessed growth. Galileo is a service provider for neo-banks. As of the second quarter it had 78.9 million customers up from 36.0 million a year before.

Membership and Revenue

This segment’s revenue grew from $19.0 million to $45.3 million. The company stated that it has made significant expenditures to move its technological operations to the cloud expand globally and nearly quadruple its personnel in this area.

However SoFi’s total membership increased by 113% year over year to 2.6 million compared to 1.2 million at the same time the previous year. In addition total products increased by 123 percent to 3.7 million at the end of the quarter up from 1.6 million at the same time the previous year.

“Significant development in our offering across business categories drove growth in our member base and products” SoFi stated.

Expectations in Third Quarter

SoFi estimates adjusted net sales of $245 million to $255 million in the third quarter. It also anticipates a loss of $7 million to $3 million in profits before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $11.8 million in positive Ebitda.

“Growth in SoFi Invest and SoFi Money offers more than quadrupled the number of financial services segment goods to nearly 2.7 million up from roughly 783000 at the same period last year” according to the company.

“In the third quarter of 2021 management expects continuing strong growth with adjusted net sales of $245 million to $255 million and adjusted EBITDA of $(7) million to $3 million” SoFi stated.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Stefani's appearance was a surprise to the 16873 fans at the show who were treated to the stars singing ""I Could Be Happy Anywhere With You"" and ""Nobody But You"" together after ""Don't Speak"" on which Shelton played the guitar.

""If there was any silver lining to the quarantine in 2020 it's that I got a lot of time to sit down and jag on the guitar"" said Shelton roughly an hour into the show.

It was Stefani's first time at the Iowa State Fair and Shelton's second. He first played the Grandstand in 2008 with Tracey Lawrence.

Before the start of the fair officials said Shelton and fellow country music superstar Chris Stapleton whose Grandstand concert is Thursday had each sold more than 15000 tickets leaving just standing-room-only tickets.

""I'm genuinely shocked at how many people are out here"" Shelton said early in the show. ""Tons of people smashed up in here.""

Shelton opened his show with ""Neon Light"" as the stage lights flared brilliantly in time with his music. Over the course of the night Shelton took fans through his impressive catalog of hits from ""Austin"" to ""Hillbilly Bone"" to ""God's Country.""

The performer left the stage the first time after performing ""Boys 'Round Here"" before returning for a set of encore songs: ""Footloose"" and ""God Gave Me You.""

After his encore set and before fireworks punctuated his performance Shelton raised his guitar and addressed the crowd one final time for the night.

""Please have me back here again sometime Iowa I love you!""

Zambia’s President Edgar Lungu has declared that the country’s elections were not free and fair. The incumbent’s declaration comes as his rival opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema has extended his early lead.

Zambia held its presidential and parliamentary elections on Thursday 12 August 2021. According to official results from 31 of the country’s 156 constituencies Hichilema garnered 449699 votes versus the 266202 garnered by Lungu. 64-year-old Lungu has been in power since 2015 and is running for a second five-year term.

Hichilema is reported to have won and gained massive ground in constituencies perceived as Lungu strongholds. Following unfavourable results so far Lungu seems to be moving to nullify the elections by declaring them not free and fair.

This was revealed in a statement released by the State House through Isaac Chipampe the special assistant to the president.

Below is the full statement that iHarare is publishing in full.

PRESIDENT LUNGE DECLARES GENERAL ELECTION NOT FREE AND FAIR LUSAKA (Saturday 14th August 2021)— His Excellency Dr Edgar Chagwa Lungu President of the Republic of Zambia has said his party the Patriotic Front is consulting on the next course of action concerning the general election held on Thursday 12th August 2021. President Lungu says the general election in three provinces namely Southern Province. North Western Province and Western Province were characterised by violence rendering the whole exercise a nullity. The President said Patriotic Front polling agents were brutalised and chased from polling stations a situation that left the ruling party’s votes unprotected in the three provinces. The President also cites the killing of Patriotic Front North Western Province Chairman Jackson Kungo during voting and Mr Samuel Chihili shortly before the voting as criminal acts that rendered the general election not free and fair. “Right now some of our agents and supporters are in hiding because of these criminal acts. How can the elections be fair when people have been murdered and many others are in hiding after being brutalised. Is that democracy? We have written to the Electoral Commission of Zambia but they have continued announcing the results. So we are consulting on the next decision we have to make” the President said and added “with polling agents having been attacked and chased from polling stations we were reduced to competing in seven provinces while our opponent was contesting in 10 provinces.” ISSUED BY:

FedEx



FedEx hit big shippers with a new round of surcharges ahead of the busy holiday season.

The surcharge cycle will start with hikes on the cost for special deliveries but continue with sweeping charges that extend in 2022.

The move comes days after USPS also rolled out holiday surcharges.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

FedEx is gearing up for a busy holiday season after a year of labor shortages and increased demand and to help deal with the rush the shipping and logistics company has rolled out a new round of delivery surcharges.

The main surcharge season kicks in on Nov. 1 with a $1.50-per-piece price hike for FedEx's Ground Economy deliveries. This applies to outbound residential deliveries for small and medium-sized businesses and covers low-weight low-value non urgent deliveries – the majority of typical consumer packages.

This first surcharge expires on November 28 but will be upped to $3 per package the following day and will last until Dec. 12 to compensate for Black Friday and Cyber Monday purchases. The surcharge will then return to the original $1.50 from Dec. 13 to Jan. 16.

The company also announced a 60-cents-per-piece charge starting Jan. 17 2022 for retailers whose shipment volumes qualified for holiday surcharges. So far there is no expected date for the end of this cycle.

The move comes days after the United States Postal Service announced similar price hikes to cover ""extra costs"" that occur during the holidays. FedEx's private carrier competitor United Parcel Service has also rolled out new ""peak"" surcharges.

The new delivery surcharges could add extra pressures to merchants and retailers' operating costs because businesses must either absorb the increases or pass them on to their customers. A spike in transportation costs have pushed consumer prices higher at stores and restaurants as major companies struggle to maintain their margins.

Delivery giants like UPS DHL FedEx and USPS have been slammed by a litany of issues since the start of the coronavirus pandemic last year. With people on lockdown ordering spiked. Meantime as the US economy began to reopen this year companies have dealt with labor shortages including a critical shortage of truck drivers as well as rising fuel and commodity costs.

FedEx has turned to offering pay raises and perks for its current logistics employees. Last year FedEx was forced to place daily package limits on some businesses as its shipping network faces capacity issues around the holidays.

""If we assume that labor's going to stay tight for a prolonged period of time it is absolutely going to be more expensive to ship"" Ravi Shanker a Morgan Stanley analyst previously told Insider.

FedEx did not respond to a request for further comment about the surcharges.

Justin Rose needed to make a putt of 5 feet 4 inches to earn a trip to New Jersey and the first round of the FedEx Cup Playoffs. He missed and he punched a ticket for Chesson Hadley instead.

The PGA Tour regular season came to an end on Sunday at the Wyndham Championship meaning it was the final event for players to qualify for the postseason which would also secure their PGA Tour cards for the 2021-22 season.

Hadley age 34 was one of the pros battling to get to 125th or better in the FedEx Cup standings — or be sent to more qualifying events where the competition continues (and intensifies) to earn a card. He started the day 132nd in the FedEx Cup but got hot early and shot an eight-under 62 which included a hole in one. Hadley who started on the back nine birdied three of his first four and made a hole-in-one — the first of his life — on 16.

He said he didn’t have number in mind to start the day. He just knew he had to go low.

“After I made that [ace] and got to five under on the day I was like I can do this. I made a nice birdie on the next hole and made a nice par save on 18 and I started to tighten up a little bit” Hadley said. “I hit some good shots early on on the front nine my back side but didn’t get anything out of it. Nice par save on 4. You know I finished strong with a couple birdies. You just I don’t know it will be close. I mean it will be really really close.”

When Hadley finished he had moved up to 126th but that still meant he needed to improve by one spot or lose his PGA Tour card. Then Justin Rose came to the 18th hole needing to clean up a five-footer on 18 to close his round. He missed and with that three-putt Rose went from 115 to 126 in the standings. Hadley was in.

A costly bogey at 18 for Justin Rose.



He's now currently projected out at No. 126 and Chesson Hadley has moved in at No. 125. https://t.co/LR9EDKVLPu pic.twitter.com/FDmeAjXisy — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) August 15 2021

Rose is now out of the Playoffs but he didn’t lose his card. He’s among several players who didn’t make the top 125 but still has a card for next season (or beyond) based off previous wins. But Hadley didn’t have the security.

“That’s kind of what the Playoffs is all about right?” Rose said. “It’s a knife-edged moment. I’ve been on the winning side at East Lake where a bogey was costly and a birdie got me back into the projected No. 1 spot so I’ve been on the right side of it and maybe on the wrong side today. Yeah it’s not nice when it’s not in your hands but obviously it was in my hands up 18. I didn’t do a very good job of that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2dvbGYvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zMjAyODgyNy9oZXJlLTEyNS1wbGF5ZXJzLW1hZGUtcGdhLXRvdXItZmVkZXgtY3VwLXBsYXlvZmZzLXdoZXJlLXN0YW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the 125 players who made it into the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs and where they stand,"Golf's regular season came to a close on Sunday with a lot of last-day jockeying to get into the field when the FedEx Cup playoffs start next week at the Northern Trust.

On a wild Sunday at the Wyndham Championship at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro North Carolina Kevin Kisner survived a six-man playoff to notch his fourth PGA Tour win and his first in more than two years.

With the Wyndham now at an end the 125-man field for the first leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs is now set and a few familiar names are missing. Rickie Fowler needed a good showing at Sedgefield but failed to make the cut. Former No. 1 player in the world and 2018 FedEx Cup champion Justin Rose bogeyed the 18th hole on Sunday and dropped to 126th in the standings leaving him on the outside looking in for the first time in his career.

So exactly who did make it into the 2021 FedEx Cup Playoffs?

Kevin Kisner survived a six-man playoff at the Wyndham Championship and vaulted into the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings

While Kisner didn’t need the win at the Wyndham Championship he’ll certainly take it and he definitely worked hard to get it. Four behind 54-hole leader Russell Henley coming into Sunday’s final round which began early due to storms in the forecast in Greensboro Kisner fired a second consecutive 4-under round of 66 to get to himself into a historic six-man sudden-death playoff.

But that playoff oddly did not include Henley who shot a 1-over 71 and finished one shot behind Kisner Kevin Na Branden Grace Si Woo Kim Adam Scott and Roger Sloan. All made par on the first extra hole but Kisner was the only one to make birdie on the second after stuffing a 9-iron to four feet. The 37-year-old began the tournament in 69th place in the FedEx Cup standings but vaulted into the top 30 with the victory 29th to be exact.

The field for the first leg of the PGA Tour FedEx Cup Playoffs is now set

Here’s a look at the 125 players who qualified for The Northern Trust the first leg of the PGA Tour FedEx Cup Playoffs which will be contested at Liberty National Golf Club in Liberty New Jersey from August 19 to August 22.

Following The Northern Trust the top 70 in the FedEx Cup standings move on to the BMW Championship which takes place at Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills Maryland from August 26 to August 29. From there the top 30 in the standings will compete in the Tour Championship which remains at its usual venue at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta and will be contested from September 2 to September 5.

But as you take in the Northern Trust -- the first of three season-ending events -- don’t spend time trying to figure out exactly what you are watching or how it works.

You’d be better off working a Rubik’s Cube studying scientific journals or searching for Hoffa. Just sign off on it all and move on.

The reason it is the FedExCup is because it is sponsored by FedEx. If it was sponsored by Stanley Tools it would be the Stanley Cup which would make things even more confusing. Perhaps the winners would get their name etched on an oversized socket wrench.

If it were sponsored by The Athletic the sports news subscription outfit it would be The Athletic Cup and winners might get their names etched on an oversized athletic cup. And wouldn’t that look great on the old mantelpiece?

Regardless of the name the Cup represents the Publisher’s Clearing House of golf. If you track the FedEx package to when it arrives on Sept. 5 at East Lake Golf Club you will see it contains $15 million for the winner.

To put that in perspective one could win the first two playoff events ($1.71 million each) Masters ($2.07 million) PGA Championship ($2.16 million) British Open ($2.07 million) and U.S. Open ($2.25 million) and collect $11.97 million or more than $3 million less.

Yeah go ahead … “Baba Booey!”

These playoffs take place in stages beginning with 125 qualifiers at the Northern Trust trimmed to 70 survivors for the BMW Championship (Aug. 26-29) paired to 30 finalist for the Tour Championship finale (Sept. 2-5). It’s kind of like an NBA game in that there’s no reason to pay close attention until the final moments.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Vince Lombardi would not be a big fan of the playoffs. That is Lombardi once famously said “Show me a good loser and I will show you a loser.” That doesn’t translate well to the FedEx format.

By the time the sun sets on Sunday Sept. 5 at East Lake the winner will not necessarily be the guy with the lowest score for the Tour Championship. The playoffs leader enters the Tour Championship with a score of 10 under. So for instance although Xander Schauffele shot the best four rounds at East Lake last year he actually finished second in the weighted field. Dustin Johnson captured the FedEx pot o’ golf by virtue of finishing T4.

In short and contrary to Lombardi’s creed it takes a real winner to be a good loser in the FedEx. Again don’t try to understand just move on.

With this somewhat illogical overview complete let’s take a look at a handful of favorites make the large bank deposit on Monday Sept. 6.

Collin Morikawa

Collin Morikawa leads the Fed Ex Cup points standings.

USA Today

The 24-year old British Open winner is atop the points standings coming in. Last month he had the audacity to put new irons into play the week of his first British Open -- and then win it. Who does that? He also was T4 at the U.S. Open and T8 at the PGA. His poise maturity and iron-play are off the charts. He is first on the Tour in tee-to-green and first in birdie average. By today’s standards Morikawa is not long. But the FedEx facilities generally fall into the “shot-maker’s” category which makes him a dangerous man.

Jon Rahm

Winning the $15 million Fed Ex Cup prize would be a great end to an unlucky year for Jon Rahm.

USA Today.

If he can avoid testing positive for Covid for a third time the 26-year old Spaniard figures to be in the mix. He has been a top-10 finisher in each of the last five majors with a dramatic win at the U.S. Open in June and a T3 at the British Open. Rahm has been doing special things throughout his golf career like being No. 1 in the World Amateur Golf Rankings for a record 60 weeks before turning pro. As Ghostbuster Winston Zeddemore might say “He has the tools he has the talent!”

Jordan Spieth

Jordan Spieth is headed in the right direction and is second in the Fed Ex Cup standings.

USA Today

He is a relatively modest 12th in the OWGR but Spieth has been trending all summer and moved to second in the FedExCup standings. With a win nine top-10s and 13 top-25s he has rediscovered some ball-striking consistency. The 28-year old was especially noticeable at the British Open where he shot four rounds in the 60s … and still finished second to Morikawa. In his last 15 starts Spieth has been worse than T19 only twice. Remember he has won three majors and the 2015 FedExCup. He knows how to do this.

Dustin Johnson

Dustin Johnson won the FedEx Cup last season.

USA Today

Since winning the 2020 Masters last November the 37-year old Johnson has not been especially prominent. A T8 at the British Open was his best 2021 major and he currently stands 17th in the points parade. But that doesn’t mean “DJ” has disappeared. He is third on the Tour in scoring average (69.564) and still second in the OWGR behind Morikawa. Oh yeah he also is the reigning FedExCup champion. Last year he was first at Northern Trust playoff-second at BMW and 44-under par for the playoffs. Under different sponsorship that’s Conn Smythe Trophy stuff.

Xander Schauffele

Gold medalist Xander Schauffele watches his tee shot narrowly avoid the water at the St. Jude Classic.

USA Today

Winner of the recent Olympic golf tournament the 27-year old has made the East Lake 30 four years in a row and finished No. 2 in the FedExCup standings two years in a row. Like Morikawa Schauffele is a shotmaker who seems to perform when the spotlight burns brightest evidenced by nine top-10s in majors over the past four years. This season he has three second-place finishes seven top-10s 14 top-25s and now some gold medal momentum entering the playoffs."

Good Land And Plenty Of Demand,"Ohio has a lot of cleared flat land that has been used for farming over the past two hundred years. Most of that land also gets good sunshine. Those factors have caught the attention of companies who want to harvest that natural energy and sell it onto the power grid in the state's deregulated electricity market.

This potential solar development could provide a scaled-up approach to putting more renewable energy on the grid in a state where coal-fired electricity power plants are rapidly closing.

Innergex is a Canadian renewable energy company that is developing solar farms in Ohio. One of their facilities The Hillcrest Solar Project in Brown County is only the second in the state to be fully constructed and operational as of this summer.

In the middle of the project area next to a humming inverter on a sunny summer day there are black high-wattage panels stretching in every direction—panels that are produced just a few hours away in Toledo by a burgeoning company called First Solar. The panels follow the sun from east to west throughout the day to maximize efficiency.

The thousand acre-plus Hillcrest operation can produce enough electricity every year to power almost 40000 homes. The huge utility transmission lines that run above the facility can connect the energy produced there to the regional grid potentially serving millions of people.

Bill Behling is the Director of Development for Innergex. He started his career in the coal industry.

“No emissions no CO2 or sulfur dioxide or nitrous oxide mercury all those pollutants that are in fossil fuel plants none of that is here"" he said.

Land resources and infrastructure are just a few of the reasons companies like Behling's are looking at building utility scale solar farms in Ohio. There is one more big economic reason: corporate demand.

“So much of this is driven by the corporations and their sustainability goals"" Behling said. ""What I call the top five the big five data centers Amazon Google Facebook Microsoft and Apple. They are all going one hundred percent renewable energy.”

Big Fortune 500 companies partner with solar developers to sign something called a power purchasing agreement. In essence the companies agree to purchase all the power produced by a solar farm like Hillcrest for around fifteen to twenty years at a fixed price. The PPAs provide a steady flow of income for the solar companies and it offsets the corporations’ fossil fuel usage at their big facilities like data centers and factories.

Steven Shparber is an attorney and member of the Environment Energy & Natural Resources group for the law firm Clark Hill. He is based in Washington DC and has worked for a number of renewable energy companies. He said the PPA model helps developers get initial financing to build new utility scale solar farms which can be expensive.

""It allows the developers of these projects to go to a financier to say 'Here's a power purchase agreement. It's Company X on the other side and they're good for it because they're a large tech company or they're Ford or they're an industrial customer. So please lend us the money to build the project.'""

But it isn’t just big corporations signing power purchasing agreements. The City of Cincinnati recently agreed to a twenty year contract worth more than $125 million. It will power 100% of Cincinnati's electricity consumption for all city-owned and -operated services. In an interview Cincinnati Mayor and Ohio gubernatorial candidate John Cranley said a power-purchasing agreement became the clear choice a few years ago as he looked for the best way to make the city carbon neutral.

""Economically solar makes the most sense when you have a very large piece of land that's flat has access to the sun obviously and you get economies of scale” he said.

Cranley said that by locking in a rate for the next 20 years it is estimated Cincinnati taxpayers will save $1.8 million over the life of the contract. Beyond the economics Cranley said the New Market Solar Projectin Highland County will help combat climate change.

""I think that what's important is putting on as much clean energy as we can"" he said. ""Adding solar is going to pay huge dividends to everybody as you turn on electricity if a growing share of that electricity is coming from cleaner sources.”

Nonetheless there is a certain amount of fear and uncertainty surrounding these solar projects in the local communities where they are being built. People have been putting solar panels on their roofs for a long time but scaling up to the utility level is a different ball game.

Behling from Innergex lives in the Northeastern United States but said that he has been in southwest Ohio during fifteen of the last nineteen weeks. He said part of his time in the state has been meeting with a number of landowners who have concerns about the new developments.

Grassroots groups against utility scale solar farms have formed in Darke Greene and Preble counties. Throughout those rural areas you can find lawn signs with slogans like “Say No To Solar” or “Save Our Farmland Stop Industrial Solar.” Some are also worried about their property values.

Utility Scale Solar development is uncharted territory for Ohio. As of this month there are only two utility solar facilities in operation. But numbers from the Ohio Power Siting Board suggest there is a boom on the horizon. There are currently forty solar farms in the pipeline or already being built.

In the next part of WYSO's series on solar energy in Ohio Chris will be looking at the battle lines that are emerging around utility-scale solar.

In the order of their occurrence here are 5 of the biggest space moments in the last 5 years.

1. Earth-Size Planets Found In Space

On February 22 2017 NASA announced the discovery of a planetary system beyond our solar system that contains seven Earth-sized planets orbiting around a red dwarf star. The planetary system Trappist-1 is about 40 light-years away from the Earth in the constellation Aquarius.

Notably scientists believe that at least three of the planets in this system have water meaning that there is a chance that this atmosphere can support life. This discovery may be crucial in the following decades to answering the age-old questions of if we are alone in the universe and if there is another planet that humans could live on. The discovery also sets a new record for the greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system.

2. The Great American Eclipse

Who can forget when the entire country went dark in 2017? On August 21 a total solar eclipse came over the United States dubbed the “Great American Eclipse”. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon’s orbit crosses in front of the sun eclipsing the light for a moment. A total solar eclipse occurs somewhere on Earth every 18 months but typically takes place over water (which covers 70% of the planet). This was the first solar eclipse to pass over the entire width of the U.S. since 1918.

The band of totality the strip of land in which the sun is entirely obscured was 70 miles wide. 12 million Americans lived within that corridor and 88 million lived within 200 miles of it. Many people made a longer trip for the event some even traveling from other countries. States and cities that fell into the band of totality enjoyed a great deal of eclipse-related tourism. For example Wyoming one of the few states in the path of totality gained an estimated $63.5 million from travel lodging food and shopping over the five-day period around the eclipse. An estimated 261000 people traveled inside Wyoming for the eclipse (over 75% from out of state) and an estimated 29000 international travelers visited for the event.

3. First Image of a Black Hole

In April 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project captured and shared the very first image of a black hole something that was previously considered unseeable. The EHT is made up of over 200 scientists and is an international organization funded by organizations from all around the world.

A black hole has a point of no return—the boundary beyond which nothing not even light can escape. Therefore the interior of a black hole is impossible to photograph so the image is of the event horizon which maps out the black hole’s dark silhouette. The photo is of the black hole in the galaxy Messier 87 which is about 6.5 billion times the mass of Earth’s sun and is 54.5 million light-years away from Earth. In order to capture the image scientists linked radio telescopes from multiple countries around the world to form a virtual instrument the size of Earth. The results of the image and ongoing project provides scientists significant information such as how matter is distributed around a black hole informing them of how black holes shape the evolution of their host galaxies. For everyday people the image gives us a glimpse into how massive our planet truly is.

4. Space-X Launches NASA Astronauts into Space

On May 30 2020 SpaceX launched NASA astronauts into space during Crew Dragon Demo-2 on a Crew Dragon spacecraft. The mission marked the first time that astronauts launched into space from American soil since 2011 when the space shuttle program ended.

This SpaceX mission was historic as it marked the first time in history that a private aerospace organization carried humans into Earth’s orbit. Previously only three nations achieved this: the U.S. Russia and China. This marked a new era of space exploration with a public and private partnership. NASA provided development funds and worked alongside the company to achieve this feat. The success of the flight marked a massive step in a resurgence in space exploration for the U.S. and the role of NASA as a customer represented a foundational shift in the industry. This also launched a new space race between more private companies like Virgin Galactic and Boeing many of which are attempting to create a space tourism industry.

5. Mars Perseverance Rover Converts CO 2 into Oxygen

On July 30 2020 NASA launched the Mars Perseverance Rover their fifth robot to Mars. The rover landed on Mars on February 28 2021 and it will spend about 2 Earth years exploring the region. One of the biggest breakthroughs of this rover making it one of the biggest space moments in the last 5 years was its success in converting some of Mars’ atmosphere into oxygen. This marks the first instrument to produce oxygen in another world and is a major step in NASA’s goal to send humans to Mars.

Alongside this scientific marvel the rover’s main purpose is to better understand the geology of Mars seek signs of ancient life and test new technology to benefit future robotic and human exploration of the red planet.

The Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo spacecraft both used Venus for gravity assists within 33 hours of each other capturing unique imagery and data during their encounters.

Solar Orbiter a joint mission between ESA and NASA to study the Sun sailed past Venus on August 9 at a distance of 7995 km (4967 miles). Then BepiColombo a collaborative venture between ESA and JAXA to Mercury skimmed past at just 552 km (343 miles) from the planet’s surface on August 10.

The image above was taken when BepiColumbo was 1573 km from Venus.

Here’s a video of Solar Orbiter’s view from the SoloHI imager:

The camera observed the nightside of Venus in the days before closest approach. SoloHI will be used to take images of the solar wind – the stream of charged particles constantly released from the Sun – by capturing the light scattered by electrons in the wind. In the days leading up to the Venus flyby the telescope caught views of the bright glare of the planet’s dayside. The footage shows Venus moving across the field of view from the left while the Sun is off camera to the upper right. The planet’s nightside the part hidden from the Sun appears as a dark semicircle surrounded by a bright crescent of light ESA scientists explained.

Both flybys helped the two spacecraft reach their next destinations. BepiColombo is scheduled to reach the innermost planet of the Solar System in October 2025. The spacecraft needs flybys of Earth Venus and then several flybys of Mercury itself together with the spacecraft’s solar electric propulsion system to help steer into Mercury orbit against the immense gravitational pull of the Sun.

BepiColombo is actually made of two attached orbiters: the Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter. The Planetary Orbiter will map the planet in great detail and the Magnetospheric Orbiter will study obviously its magnetosphere.

This video of BepiColombo’s Venus flyby includes sonification of data recorded by the Italian Spring Accelerometer (ISA) aboard the Mercury Planetary Orbiter spacecraft. The accelerometer data was converted to frequency to be made audible to the human ear. The resulting sound is quite interesting with the sound reflecting variations in spacecraft accelerations due to the planet’s gravity acting on the spacecraft structure as well as effects due to rapid temperature changes and the change in reaction wheel velocity as they work hard to compensate for these effects. The audio has been matched to the timing that the images seen in this movie were captured in the moments after closest approach.

Solar Orbiter will make a final close Earth flyby on November 27 of this year coming within 460 km (285 miles) before further Venus slingshots will tilt its inclination helping the spacecraft get in the right position to get the first-ever views of the Sun’s poles a crucial part of the mission to help us understand the Sun’s 11 year activity cycle. The beginning of the primary mission also begins in November. It will take the closest ever images of the Sun as it comes within 42 million km and measure the composition of the solar wind.

There was no other option.

""I had to hit rock bottom for a little bit"" he said.

He's rising and judging by last season so are the Browns.

As he picked at lunch during a break last month while shooting commercials at FirstEnergy Stadium Mayfield exuded some of that chip-on-his-shoulder confidence that transported him from college walk-on to NFL starting quarterback.

That will always be on display defining him driving him. The brashness though has been muted.

While discussing the stuttering start to his pro career his future in Cleveland and expectations for this season during a sit-down interview with The Associated Press there was something noticeably different about Mayfield.

He's changed.

It's not a 180-degree turn by any means but Mayfield is more measured with his actions and words: business Baker. More of a leader a role model franchise quarterback.

""Experience"" he said ""definitely teaches you.""

Mayfield crashed after a record-setting rookie year only to bounce back in 2020 under first-year coach Kevin Stefanski. On the eve of his fourth training camp he was relaxed and reflective as he prepared for a season Browns fans have awaited for a generation.

Mayfield helped Cleveland end the playoff drought. Next challenge: the Super Bowl which the Browns never have reached.

He's physically fit having dropped ""bad weight"" and in a good place mentally. He's found inner peace and the 25-year-old feels a strong connection with this football-crazed city and its fans. Cleveland is where he wants to play his entire career.

""We've talked about it Emily and I"" Mayfield said referring to his wife who co-stars with him in those TV ads for Progressive Insurance. ""It wouldn't be the same if we lived in a city where they didn't live breathe and die football. That's the atmosphere we want - and it's here.""

There's an unmistakable bond between this Ohio city and this Oklahoma quarterback. Both underdogs they've been through good years and bad ones. Knocked down and counted out they've fought back.

""When I say that my work ethic and mentality fits right in here"" he said. ""I genuinely mean that.""

Even before being drafted first in 2018 Mayfield sensed Cleveland was where he belonged.

""If anybody's going to turn that franchise around it would be me"" he boasted at the combine that year.

He was right.

The Browns went 1-31 in two seasons before he arrived and spent two decades discarding quarterbacks and coaches at dizzying speed. In Mayfield they have seemingly found the leader missing since Bernie Kosar led Cleveland to three AFC title games from 1986-89.

He's eligible for a contract extension but to this point his agents and the Browns have not had formal talks.

It's possible the team wants Mayfield to replicate his strong 2020 - or the Browns are spooked by the massive deal Buffalo gave Josh Allen who signed a six-year $258 million package.

Mayfield is under contract for two more years and insists his focus is solely on winning another sign of development.

For a while though it looked as if he might be another bust.

After breaking Peyton Manning's rookie record for TD passes and going 7-8-1 Mayfield took things for granted. He didn't spend nearly enough time working on his craft got heavy and threw nearly as many interceptions (21) as TDs (22) in 2019.

Picked to contend for the AFC North title the Browns disintegrated. They went 6-10 fired coach Freddie Kitchens and Mayfield's critics circled with sharpened knives.

""For the first time in my life I was kind of listening to the outside noise and I let that affect me too much"" he said. ""I was so worried about what type of picture I needed to portray as a franchise QB because everybody was telling me I had to be a certain way instead of just doing how I've always done it - which is how I'm here.""

Mayfield quickly interjects he doesn't want to ""sound cocky or conceited."" It's just that others wanted him to be someone he's not.

""Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady aren't the same people"" he said. ""I listened to too much of that for too long had a few losing seasons and then realized OK I've got to find a peace on the inner side before I can lead this team to where it needs to go.""

While it would have been easy to blame Cleveland's ceaseless dysfunction Mayfield held himself accountable.

""The whole 2019 season was just kind of a miserable year"" he said glancing at a ""Believe In Yourself"" tattoo on his left forearm. ""I expect a lot of things out of myself and I just didn't play well. That was a humbling experience.""

Then came 2020's strangeness. But in the midst of masks and mandates Mayfield found stability and kinship with Stefanski his third coach in three years. Shortly after being hired Stefanski visited Mayfield in Texas not imagining he wouldn't see him again in person for five months.

Although most of their interactions came over Zoom coach and QB bonded.

""He's a sports junkie and not the biggest guy ever"" Mayfield said smiling when asked about their connection. ""We agree on the work-ethic mentality. You can't just show up. He loves the grind and so do I. When you put two people together with the same inner values and drive that's pretty special.""

Expectations for the 2021 Browns are enormous even excessive. Mayfield says he isn't fazed by them.

""It would bring the great tradition back"" he said. ""It's a football town because of what it's been in the past and what it deserves to be. It would mean a ton to me but I wouldn't be satisfied at just stopping at one.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndlc2EuZm0vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQtZW5lcmd5LzIwMjEtMDgtMTUvZGVtb2xpdGlvbi1vZi10d28tdG1pLWNvb2xpbmctdG93ZXJzLXBvc3Rwb25lZC11bnRpbC1uZXh0LXllYXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demolition Of Two TMI Cooling Towers Postponed Until Next Year,"The company responsible for decommissioning the Unit 2 reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant is delaying demolition of the reactor’s two cooling towers the project director said Wednesday.

Frank Helin told the TMI-2 Community Advisory Panel that the towers will come down in 2022 instead of this fall.

The decommissioner TMI-2 Solutions is a subsidiary of EnergySolutions a Utah-based company that tries to turn a profit by dismantling inactive nuclear sites under budget. TMI-2 Solutions acquired the reactor’s license from FirstEnergy in December.

The company plans to start removing what remains of TMI-2’s damaged core by mid-2022. It expects to complete the entire clean-up process by 2037.

EnergySolutions spokesman Mark Walker said the delay in taking down the cooling towers does not affect the rest of the process.

“During the planning process of TMI-2 decommissioning we determined there would be less impact to other decommissioning activities taking place on the island later this year” he said in a statement.

That includes the transfer of spent fuel from TMI-1 the plant’s other reactor out of underwater storage and into dry containers.

TMI-1 owned by Exelon closed permanently in 2019.

The state Department of Environmental Protection said the cooling tower demolition does not present a safety risk.

Eric Epstein chair of the watchdog group Three Mile Island Alert said that while he is not concerned about the cooling towers he believes the reactor building may have more radioactive material than the company is prepared to deal with.

“Our concern is making sure that the plant is finally cleaned up 42 years later” he said. “We don’t believe the company that owns TMI-2 has the technology the expertise or the resources to clean the plant up.”

On its website  TMI-2 Solutions says it anticipates the project will cost $1.06 billion. It says the trust fund dedicated to the reactor’s decommissioning contains about $877 million but that fund growth over time will provide enough money to cover the costs.

A 2020 report from GPU Nuclear a subsidiary of FirstEnergy stated that the fund contained about $899 million and that a 2018 site assessment had estimated the cleanup cost at $1.35 billion.

In a 2020 petition to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission opposing the license transfer from FirstEnergy to TMI-2 Solutions TMI Alert contended that the company failed to adequately survey the site for contamination and that the trust fund will not grow fast enough to cover the expanded price tag.

The NRC denied TMI Alert’s request for a hearing.

The DEP had also expressed concern about the company’s ability to pay for the project but the agency withdrew its objection last August.

Helin said Wednesday that TMI-2 Solutions plans to continue assessing the level of radioactivity in the reactor building including using robots to take samples of concrete walls in the building’s basement.

The reactor has been dormant since 1979 when it partially melted down during the most serious accident at a commercial nuclear plant in U.S. history.

Demolishing the TMI-2 cooling towers will mark the beginning of the end for a fixture of the central Pennsylvania landscape.

“As a kid even I went on hikes up at Rocky Ridge Park here in York County” said Shen Kreiser a nuclear planner in the county and a member of the Community Advisory Panel. At the top she recalled you get a clear view of the nuclear plant.

“You know it’s Three Mile Island because of the cooling towers” she said.

The decommissioning company said the plant’s history figures into its plans noting Wednesday that it aims to set aside pieces of the control room and other artifacts for the Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office as the project continues.

Portis and his team clinched the NBA title July 20.

At the end of July Portis — who grew up watching wrestling — got to hop in the ring at WWE Supershow at Fiserv Forum and show off the custom-made title belt WWE gave the Bucks.

At the beginning of August the 6-foot-10 forward announced that he would re-sign with the Bucks after a super brief stint in free agency.

And to top it all off Portis was given a key to the city and his own day in his hometown of Little Rock Arkansas on Sunday.

Cue the ""Bobby Bobby Bobby"" chants.

This weekend was the Bobby Portis Foundation Weekend in Little Rock. The foundation's mission is to create programs and initiatives that help single mothers in Arkansas according to the organization's website.

Portis the eldest of four grew up in a single mother household.

Portis saw his mother Tina Edwards working all shifts and still having the energy to take her kids to school according to a previous Journal Sentinel column. Portis adopted his mom's work ethic and his admiration for her continues to flow through him.

The foundation's goal is to ""serve support and empower single mother families.""

The weekend featured five events including a basketball camp — where kids got to touch the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy — bowling and community events a formal gala and a back-to-school backpack giveaway.

At the conclusion of the festivities Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. issued a proclamation to make Aug. 15 Bobby Portis Day and gave Portis a key to the city.

""We commend his servant leadership to his hometown where he aids single parents and their children"" the mayor tweeted.

""Man today was an unreal experience for myself"" Portis tweeted. ""Keys to the city and August 15th being named Bobby Portis day!! All I can say is wow..truly blessed! Thank You God #UNDERDOG.""

The Public Relations Officer of FMC Owerri Dr. Jacintha Achonu while reacting to the issue told Sunday Tribune in Owerri on Saturday that the NYSC could not do the work of the residents medical doctors in the hospital.

The PRO who described the information as “blatant lies” maintained that the Consultants and the medical officials had been doing their best in attending to the patients in the hospital.

On the report that an eye patient claimed that he was earlier on booked for surgery which was done by the NYSC doctors the PRO said that such information was purely a lie that would never hold any water and as such never existed.

Reacting to the effects of the strike on the Institution the PRO said that the strike is actually affecting the operations of the hospital.

Dr. Achonu acknowledged the fact that the strike is telling much on the consultants and medical officials as they spend much time in attending to patients in the hospital.

She said: “it will now take like four hours to attend to patients by the Consultants when in the normal circumstances it would take one hour or less to attend to patients.”

She said that FMC remained the only medica institution in Imo State that provided adequate primary and secondary medical services to people from across the communities and local government areas in the state.

The data exposure stemmed from a misconfigured instance of Pega Infinity customer engagement system running on Ford's servers.

From data exfiltration to account takeovers

This week researchers have disclosed a vulnerability found on Ford's website that let them peek into confidential company records databases and perform account takeovers.

The vulnerability was discovered by Robert Willis and break3r with further validation and support provided by members of Sakura Samurai ethical hacking group—Aubrey Cottle Jackson Henry and John Jackson.

The issue is caused by CVE-2021-27653 an information exposure vulnerability in improperly configured Pega Infinity customer management system instances.

Researchers shared many screenshots of Ford's internal systems and databases with BleepingComputer. For example the company's ticketing system is shown below:

Ford's internal ticket system exposed to researchers

To exploit the issue an attacker would first have to access the backend web panel of a misconfigured Pega Chat Access Group portal instance:

https://www.rpa-pega-1.ford.com/prweb/PRChat/app/RPACHAT_4089/

bD8qH******bIw4Prb*/!RPACHAT/$STANDARD...

As seen by BleepingComputer different payloads provided as URL arguments could enable attackers to run queries retrieve database tables OAuth access tokens and perform administrative actions.

The researchers state that some of the exposed assets contained sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and included:

Customer and employee records

Finance account numbers

Database names and tables

OAuth access tokens

Internal support tickets

User profiles within the organization

Pulse actions

Internal interfaces

Search bar history

""The impact was large in scale. Attackers could use the vulnerabilities identified in the broken access control and obtain troves of sensitive records perform account takeovers and obtain a substantial amount of data"" Willis writes in a blog posting.

Took six months to 'force disclose'

In February 2021 the researchers had reported their findings to Pega that fixed the CVE in their chat portal relatively quickly.

The issue was also reported to Ford around the same time via their HackerOne vulnerability disclosure program.

But the researchers told BleepingComputer that communication from Ford was thin and faded as the responsible disclosure timeline progressed:

""At one point in time they completely stopped answering our questions. It took HackerOne mediation to get an initial response on our vulnerability submission from Ford"" John Jackson told BleepingComputer in an email interview.

Jackson states that as the disclosure timeline progressed further the researchers heard back from HackerOne only after tweeting about the flaw but without giving out any sensitive details:

Here are some of the many things that are exposed:



Customer Databases Employee Records Internal Ticketing Systems OAuth Tokens Request Info Finances...actually there are about 8 pages worth of Database Tables so it would be really difficult to express. — John Jackson 桜の侍 (@johnjhacking) March 5 2021

""When the vulnerability was marked as resolved Ford ignored our disclosure request. Subsequently HackerOne mediation ignored our request for help disclosing which can be seen in the PDF.""

""We had to wait the full six months to force disclose per HackerOne's policy out of fear of the law and negative repercussions"" continued Jackson.

At this time Ford's vulnerability disclosure program does not offer monetary incentives or bug bounties so a coordinated disclosure in light of public interest was the only ""reward"" researchers were hoping for.

A copy of the disclosure report shared with BleepingComputer indicates Ford refrained from commenting on specific security-related actions.

""The findings you submitted... are considered private. These vulnerability reports are intended to prevent compromises which may require disclosure.""

""In this scenario the system was taken offline shortly after you submitted your findings to HackerOne"" Ford shared with HackerOne and the researchers as per the discussion in the PDF.

Although the endpoints were taken offline by Ford within 24 hours of the report the researchers comment in the same report that the endpoints remained accessible even afterward and requested another review and remediation.

It is not yet known if any threat actors exploited the vulnerability to breach systems at Ford or if sensitive customer/employee PII was accessed.

According to a study of crash data from the United Kingdom commercial truck drivers with diabetes had a three-to-five-fold increase in crashes over those without diabetes. While these statistics are distressing we are encouraged by new technology that should ease the burden that diabetes places on drivers.

In May Ford Motor Co. unveiled two new innovations for on-board diabetes management. First the auto-maker announced a partnership to develop an in-car version of WellDoc’s mobile phone-based DiabetesManager software. DiabetesManager maintains a virtual logbook and provides recommendations to the user based on real-time and historical tracking of user-provided information such as glucose status medications exercise habits and diet information. The in-car version of DiabetesManager will use Ford’s AppLink technology a SYNC feature that allows BlackBerry iPhone and Android phones to use approved applications via steering wheel buttons and voice control. Also exciting is the potential for location-based services such as informing drivers about healthy restaurant choices in the area. As we understand it DiabetesManager is expected to launch for US employers in the second half of 2011 while the car-based version should roll out sometime in late 2012.

Ford also has a new partnership with Medtronic to link continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices to cars. The system would work using Bluetooth with glucose levels and trends available through the in-car sound system and through visual displays. If glucose levels are outside the normal range audible alerts would sound and eye-catching cues would be shown. Encouragingly the applications of the system would go beyond the driver since anyone in the car with a connected glucose device could be monitored (e.g. a sleeping child in the backseat). Ford said it anticipated a two-year launch timeframe though Medtronic has emphasized that the project is still in early-stage research. --AB",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZXNlLWFyZS10aGUtbW9zdC1pbXBvcnRhbnQtY2Fycy1pbi1mb3Jkcy1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are The Most Important Cars In Ford's History,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZXNlLWFyZS10aGUtbW9zdC1pbXBvcnRhbnQtY2Fycy1pbi1mb3Jkcy1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcm9ja2ZhdGhlci5jb20vbGluY29sbi1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1jb25jZXB0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lincoln Motor Co.'s 'Anniversary' Concept Rolls Out at Quail Motorsports Gathering,"Monterey Car Week is in full effect with some stellar rides hitting the streets of Monterey California. This year one participant is straight from the future — a glimpse of what a Lincoln could be in 2040 and beyond.

The Lincoln Motor Co.’s “Anniversary” concept is one of four futuristic vehicles created as part of a challenge mounted between Lincoln and ArtCenter College of Design this summer. The full-sized concept was on display this weekend at the Quail Motorsports Gathering as part of Monterey Car Week.

“The storyboarding presented by these students was beyond impressive showcasing their rich design talent and creative approach to storytelling” says Kemal Curic global director Lincoln. “This is precisely why we decided to create a full-sized replica of one of the projects highlight the amazing talent in tomorrow’s designers and their unique perspective of our Lincoln Quiet Flight brand DNA.”

Less than a month after General Motors sued Ford Motor Co. for trademark infringement over the name of Ford's new hands-free driving technology called BlueCruise Ford wants GM's trademark rights to ""Cruise"" and ""Super Cruise"" rescinded said Ford spokesman Mike Levine.

Cruise is the name of GM's subsidiary developing autonomous cars. Super Cruise is GM's hands-free technology.

On Friday evening Ford was to file a request with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office asking it to rescind both of GM’s “Cruise” and “Super Cruise” trademark registrations.

Levine said Ford argues the terms should have never been registered in the first place so it wants the trademarks rescinded to ensure ""that it and the industry as a whole can freely use the word 'cruise' to safely describe their driver assist technologies.""

GM's response to the filing was to reiterate much of what it said when it filed the lawsuit.

""As the industry’s first true hands-free driver assistance system on the market GM’s Super Cruise was first announced in 2012 and has had a well established commercial presence since 2017 with approximately 10M miles driven using the technology to date"" said Darryll Harrison GM spokesman in a statement. ""GM remains committed to vigorously defending our brands and protecting the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market and that won’t change. At this time we have no further comment.""

Ford maintains that GM's trademark infringement lawsuit against it is ""meritless and frivolous"" Levine said adding that the lawsuit left Ford no other choice but to file the request with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

""Drivers for decades have understood what cruise control is every automaker offers it and 'cruise' is common shorthand for the capability"" Levine said. ""Any number of companies use the word 'cruise' in connection with driver assist technology.""

Ford chose BlueCruise in relation to the Blue Oval's next evolution of Ford’s Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control which incorporates hands-free ""Blue Zones"" and other advanced cruise control features he said.

GM filed the trademark infringement lawsuit against Ford July 24 in U.S. District Court in northern California after having several weeks of mediated discussions with Ford trying to reach an agreement on the use of the word ""cruise.""

GM's majority-owned self-driving subsidiary Cruise has been in business since 2013.

GM is seeking monetary damages and filed a preliminary injunction asking that Ford be ordered to stop using the name.

Ford's response to GM's preliminary injunction late Friday argues ""cruise"" is a common term used across the industry Levine said noting that GM has no issue with Predictive Cruise used by Mack Trucks Robocruise used as RoboCars' trademark Hyundai's Smart Cruise Control and BMW's Active Cruise Control.

Garmin’s Edge line-up gives mountain bikers and cyclists the tactical ‘edge’ when it comes to informed cycling that keeps you on track to your next destination. All this while keeping you safe on the road by warning speedy cars coming from behind Basically Garmin is at the top of the tree when it comes to the cycling computer market.

There are plenty of models to choose from the Garmin line-up including the Edge 530 Edge 830 or Edge Explore. So how about adding another one to the choice basket in the coming future? Industrial designer WuShuai has thought of a refreshing design for the next Garmin computer for your ride to next get stranded on any hiking trail.

His design has a more contoured aspect to it the convex display is a telltale indicator of the fact. Being a bike enthusiast himself Wu wanted to create a softer design language for a future Garmin Edge product. However he himself admits that the screen is more susceptible to breakage in this new form if there is an accidental fall. That’s a story for another day if this design is referenced by Garmin for consideration.

There are a lot of technological advances in glass design for gadgets and achieving a curved edge display while retaining durability. I’m sure reinforcing the structural strength of the glass is not a problem so we can go to the next logical step of analyzing the overall appeal and the performance of this Garmin gadget.

Just like the predecessors this waterproof bike accessory will have features including turn-by-turn directions Cycle Map automatic re-routing rider-to-rider messaging and of course alert about approaching vehicles. As for the design the rounded look will appeal to most bicycle users as it seamlessly blends into the bike frame’s design.

The designer has also conceptualized the Bianchi x Garmin version for the Garmin Edge 750 Concept which I would surely want to put on my ride. Will Garmin actually come up with such a model in the future – well that’s anybody’s guess right now!

Designer: WuShuai",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvY29yb3MtcGFjZS0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Coros Pace 2 Is My New Favorite GPS Running Watch,"After years of testing GPS running watches from a slew of brands I had accepted what felt like a hard fact: When it comes to fitness all of Garmin’s watches are so far ahead of the pack that it would be almost impossible for any other company to catch up. I’ve seen many companies try and fail. If I wanted to track a workout or map a run I’d probably strap on a Garmin.

However a year or so ago one company made me pause. Coros a California company that started out making bike helmets of all things began sponsoring some athletes with serious star power. The celebrity pro ultrarunner Coree Woltering who ran the fastest known time on the Ice Age Trail and won hearts on the World’s Toughest Race wears a Coros. So does Eliud Kipchoge the world record holder for the marathon.

It’s like watching every Nike-signed athlete suddenly migrate to a completely different shoe. What is Eliud Kipchoge doing? But it wasn’t until I saw Des Linden set a new world record with a Coros watch that I couldn’t put it off any longer. I had to test the tech. Coros sent me its Pace 2 and—surprise!—it’s now my new favorite running watch too.

Feathery Friend

Let’s start off with the most striking feature. The Pace 2 is light. It weighs 29 grams which is lighter by a few grams than its closest obvious competitor the Garmin Forerunner 45. It’s so light that I barely even noticed I was wearing it.

Photograph: Coros

You also have the option to switch out the perforated silicone band for a nylon one to save even more weight although I prefer the convenience of soaping and rinsing a silicone band to handwashing the sweat out of a nylon one. (And yes I know it’s disgusting but if you’re having irritation on your wrist under your fitness tracker you probably need to wash that strap.)

Operating the Coros watch is very simple. It has just two buttons as compared to Garmin’s five. The top button rotates like a digital crown to scroll through activities then presses to select an option; the lower button just navigates back to the previous step.

The screen is simple too. Rather than the Garmin’s crisp clear light-up memory-in-pixel display that you can tinker with and customize the Pace 2 has a basic LCD screen. You can choose different faces and select your color scheme but your choices are limited. Honestly I prefer it that way. And sports watches don't have to have the best possible screens. An LCD is usually fine.

An LCD screen is also a low-energy component which I found especially helpful when I went camping. My family is outdoors a lot and it's annoying to set out on an impromptu trail run only to discover that your battery has died. The Garmin Instinct Solar I tested last year could supplement several days’ worth of battery life with solar charging but it turns out that you don’t need to worry about recharging your battery—by any means—when the battery itself is epically long-lived.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL21vYmlsZS9maXRiaXQtYWNlLTMtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fitbit Ace 3 Review: Kids Tracker for the Fitbit Family,"Fitbit Ace 3 MSRP $80.00 Score Details “The Fitbit Ace 3 uses rewards and fun challenges to help kids adopt a healthy lifestyle.” Pros Easy to use

Comfortable kid-sized fit

Engaging animated interface

Fun family challenges Cons Clasp can break

Works best with a parental Fitbit

Activity trackers typically are targeted towards adults who want to get fit and stay fit. These trackers are sized for adults and have interfaces designed for adults and not kids. Though they may not be setting Fastest Known Times kids can benefit from the health-improving effects of a fitness wearable.

Fitbit wants to reach these children with its Ace 3 tracker that offers an animated interface and a kid-friendly design. How does the Fitbit Ace 3 stand up to the demands of childhood? We tested it with a few elementary-aged kids to find out.

Design: Small but mostly sturdy

Though it’s a kid’s device the Ace 3 is no slouch. It has a three-axis accelerometer for step tracking and detailed sleep monitoring. There’s even a heart rate monitor but it is not enabled most likely for privacy reasons. On the surface it appears that Fitbit took its adult tracker and pared it down for kids.

The touchscreen is small enough to fit a child’s wrist but not too small for children’s hands. My kids had no problem swiping or tapping on the display. The black and white display is big enough for kids to view their stats and bright enough to be viewable outside and inside. Unlike the Fitbit Ace 2 which is completely wrapped in silicone the Ace 3 has cutouts for the buttons making them easy to press.

The Ace 3 is reminiscent of Fitbit’s early fitness trackers. It is comprised of a tiny fitness tracker unit that fits into a rugged silicone band. The band is sized for smaller wrists with a standard watch clasp that is easy to use. My kids 8- and 10-years-old had no problem taking the band on and off themselves. It was comfortable to wear day or night and we had no issues with any skin rashes. We did take some preventative measures that minimized skin irritation. After a day of outside play we took off the tracker and washed both my kid’s wrist area and the tracker.

Though not as slim and sleek as Fitbit’s all-in-on trackers like the Charge 4 the Ace 3 modular design is perfect for kids who tend to be hard on electronics. When the band breaks it is easy to replace. Simply pop out the tracker unit and drop it into a new band. Be prepared to replace the band especially if your kid likes to take the tracker on and off. We broke one band in our testing while the second has withstood the test of time.

Software: Fun and kid-friendly interface

The interface sticks to basic step counting and doesn’t overwhelm your kids with advanced metrics like heart rate analysis or calorie burn. It offers a handful of fun clock faces that my kids loved. Our favorites were the animated ones that change along with the fitness stats. The rocket ship for example moved closer to takeoff as the step count neared its goal. When they reached their goal the rocket took off with a blast much to my younger kid’s delight. I did find that the younger the child the more they enjoyed these animations.

The Fitbit Ace 3 uses rewards and fun challenges that help kids adopt a healthy lifestyle.

Another feature we enjoyed was the family competitions which let my kids challenge family members and friends to get the most steps in a day. We’d often find ourselves taking an extra walk around the block to get that extra step count boost. The Fitbit Ace 3 wisely uses more than one strategy to encourage your kids to move as not every child will be motivated the same way. My younger child enjoyed the rewarding animations while my older child seemed to be motivated more by this competition than by merely reaching his goal.

Performance: Viewing fitness stats can be annoying

The Fitbit Ace 3 is a kid’s device and as such has a parental component that you must navigate. Nearly everything is done through the parent’s Fitbit account using the My Family tab in the Fitbit app. How you view your kid’s daily fitness statistics depends on whether they have their own mobile device or not. For older kids you can install the Fitbit app on the child’s device and they can track their stats themselves. It’s a bit more challenging to view the statistics with your younger children.

Younger kids who don’t have a mobile device need to use the Fitbit app on their parent’s phone or tablet to view their daily statistics. You can switch between two views — the parent’s view with their tracker information and a kid’s view with data from the child’s tracker. This kid’s view is simplified making it easy for your kids to follow their progress without being overwhelmed with too many numbers.

My kids looked forward to checking their stats multiple times each day on my iPhone and frequently changing their watch faces. Unfortunately it was a pain to switch between the kid’s and parent’s views. Every time you return to the parent view you have to enter your password. I was unable to use fingerprint or face recognition for this authentication step so I had to type in my randomly generated 12 character string. It was so annoying that I changed my Fitbit password to something shorter and easier to remember likely compromising my account security for convenience.

Our Take

The Fitbit Ace 3 takes the best qualities of its successful fitness tracker line and bundles it into a tracker designed exclusively for kids. The Ace 3 has a lively interface that encourages kids to move. It’s especially effective for elementary-aged kids who get caught up in the animations and family-friendly competitions. Older kids like the rapidly-maturing tweens may find this tracker too childish.

Is there a better alternative?

The main competitor to the Fitbit Ace 3 is Garmin’s Vivofit Jr 2 which offers a similar playful interface. Both are very capable trackers for kids so you should make your choice based on the platform. If you already own a Fitbit or plan to buy a Fitbit then the Ace 3 should be your first choice. It integrates seamlessly into the Fitbit app and allows for communication with and control over the child’s device. Likewise those with a Garmin device should stick with Garmin’s ecosystem and grab a Vivofit Jr.

How long will it last?

The Fitbit Ace 3 will last a few years depending on your child’s age and activity level. Your child may outgrow the device before it breaks. The weak point is the clasp of the band which is made out of plastic. Because the tracker can be removed from the band though you can simply replace the band if it happens to break. Thankfully Fitbit offers a one-year limited warranty that covers it from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.

Should you buy it?

If you are looking for a new fitness tracker for your kids the Fitbit Ace 3 should be at the top of your list. It has a comfortable fit and entertaining interface that will keep your child moving throughout the day. If you already own the Fitbit Ace 2 or a competing kid’s tracker you don’t need to upgrade. The Ace 3 primarily offers an improved interface which is not a compelling enough reason to upgrade.

Some aircraft feature very simplified systems such as the JMB. Others are far more complex such as the TBM 930 and the three default airliners. If you want to add at least a degree of realism to your flight sessions then getting a basic understanding of these different systems is imperative.

This guide goes over the basic ins and outs of the GPS and autopilot avionics systems featured in Microsoft Flight Simulator‘s default aircraft (not including airliners). While the panels on different aircraft may have quite a number of buttons knobs levers gauges and screens it’s not as intimidating as it might seem. Well once you know what everything is for that is. Let’s get started with the most common type of Garmin panel in Microsoft Flight Simulator that features a GPS and autopilot system.

Garmin G1000

The Garmin G1000 is a very modern panel system that makes the flying experience far more simplified and seamless. This is thanks to its powerful dual-screen array. The left side features the common gauges in digital form (altitude airspeed pitch angle compass and barometer) overlaid on top of the extremely useful synthetic vision.

Synthetic vision is a 3D rendering of the terrain that’s in front of the aircraft. It can detect just about everything including mountainous terrain. This is extremely useful when flying in unfamiliar areas or where there’s low visibility as the SV screen is perfectly clear of the visual obstructions that the real world has. It also can show terrain that’s a few miles out allowing pilots to anticipate what’s ahead even if they can’t see it yet with the naked eye. Airports and airfields are also preset on the SV screen making landings all the easier. A wind speed/direction indicator is also featured on this screen which is a very important tool for every phase of flight.

On the right side of the screen is the GPS and more digital aircraft gauges including the RPM oil pressure/temp fuel and more. The G1000’s GPS system also comes outfitted with NEXRAD capabilities. This displays precipitation that’s within range of the aircraft’s radar. The intensity of the precipitation is labeled with different colors. Green is moderate yellow is low intensity orange is medium intensity and red/pink is severe (the kind that pilots tend to avoid). Weather conditions is a topic that’s discussed more in our guide on “Essential tips for every flight.”

Here are some basic tips for the G1000 GPS including how to use its autopilot (AP) system in Microsoft Flight Simulator:

Access the wind indicator [left screen]: Select PFD > Wind > OPTN 3 (the easiest to read).

Select PFD > Wind > OPTN 3 (the easiest to read). Access the weather radar [right screen] (NEXRAD): Select Map > GPS > NEXRAD.

Select Map > GPS > NEXRAD. Command the aircraft to automatically follow the route of the flightplan (magenta line) – [left screen panel] : Press AP > press NAV. [Move to right screen] : press CDI > cycle through until compass rose (directly above) says “GPS.” The aircraft will then follow the GPS route.

: Press AP > press NAV. : press CDI > cycle through until compass rose (directly above) says “GPS.” The aircraft will then follow the GPS route. Create new flightplan from the GPS module – [right screen panel]: Press FPL > use the FMS knob to select origin airport > input airport ICAO code using the knob and then press ENT button to accept > repeat steps for the destination airport.

Press FPL > use the FMS knob to select origin airport > input airport ICAO code using the knob and then press ENT button to accept > repeat steps for the destination airport. Set the aircraft to ascend or descend to a specific altitude at a specific (vertical) speed – [right screen panel]: Select AP (if you haven’t already) > press ALT button > turn the ALT button until the desired altitude is selected (changes are displayed on the left screen above the altimeter) > press VS button > press VS UP button to ascend or VS DN button to descend (changes are displayed on the left screen to the right of the altimeter). In slower aircraft set the VS to no more than 1000ft. Ideally 300-500ft is best for maintaining a decent climb speed. Slower planes usually cruise at 2000-8000ft. Higher elevations call for more altitude but will result in reduced performance. When descending try not to overspeed. Pull the throttle back to about 60% to avoid an overly rapid descent.

Select AP (if you haven’t already) > press ALT button > turn the ALT button until the desired altitude is selected (changes are displayed on the left screen above the altimeter) > press VS button > press VS UP button to ascend or VS DN button to descend (changes are displayed on the left screen to the right of the altimeter). In slower aircraft set the VS to no more than 1000ft. Ideally 300-500ft is best for maintaining a decent climb speed. Slower planes usually cruise at 2000-8000ft. Higher elevations call for more altitude but will result in reduced performance. When descending try not to overspeed. Pull the throttle back to about 60% to avoid an overly rapid descent. Set the aircraft to bank left or right automatically in a specific direction – [right screen panel]: Select AP (if you haven’t already) > Press HDG button > turn HDG knob in the desired direction (changes are displayed on the left screen by the compass rose).

Garmin G3000

The higher end of the spectrum is the G3000 model of Garmin’s GPS system. This one features three touchscreens that span across the entire length of the aircraft. It has just about all of the same features as the G1000. The only real difference between the two is that the GPS map screen sits in the center of the console leaving both the pilot and co-pilot to have identical screens that display all of the other data (altitude heading vertical speed airspeed etc.) Unsurprisingly the G3000 also sports NEXRAD capabilities and synthetic vision.

With this module being so similar to the G1000 a lot of the previously mentioned operations are also similar. If anything this is the easier one to learn since the touchscreens negate the use of using knobs and traditional buttons for some operations. The TBM 930 is one of the aircraft that feature the G3000 panel. There are two separate screens that are identical to each other (one each for the pilot and co-pilot) that sit below the main screens. They are used to control some of the operations like the map range for example and also to change some of the info that’s displayed on the main screens.

Here are some basic tips for the G300 GPS (TBM 930 edition) including how to use its autopilot system in Microsoft Flight Simulator:

Access the wind indicator [top left/right screen]: Select PFD Settings > Other PFD Settings > Option 3 (still the easiest to read).

Select PFD Settings > Other PFD Settings > Option 3 (still the easiest to read). Access the weather radar [bottom left/right screens] (NEXRAD): Select MFD > Weather Selection> NEXRAD Settings > Home

Select MFD > Weather Selection> NEXRAD Settings > Home Command the aircraft to automatically follow the route of the flightplan (magenta line) – [top control panel] : Press AP > press NAV. [Move to upper left/right screens] : press Active NAV > cycle through until compass rose (directly above) says “GPS.” The aircraft will then follow the GPS route.

Create new flightplan from the GPS module – [lower left/right screens]: Press MFD > select Flight Plan > select Add Origin > input airport ICAO code using the touchscreen controls and then press Accept button > repeat steps for the destination airport. Alternative : Press MFD > select Direct To > input airport ICAO code using touchscreen controls and then press Accept button. This will create an immediate flightplan from the aircraft’s current position even if it’s in the air.

This will create an immediate flightplan from the aircraft’s current position even if it’s in the air. Set the aircraft to ascend or descend to a specific altitude at a specific (vertical) speed – [top control panel]: Select AP (if you haven’t already) > press ALT button > turn the ALT SEL knob until the desired altitude is selected (changes are displayed on the top left/right screen above the altimeter) > press VS button > turn the VS knob upward to descend and downward to ascend (changes are displayed on the left screen to the right of the altimeter). Faster aircraft like the TBM 930 can comfortably ascend at higher rates like 800-1000ft (or a little more). Such an aircraft can also fly a lot higher thanks to either using a turboprop engine (like the TBM) or a jet engine. Descent speed is usually greater when coming down from high altitudes and thus the throttle should be around 30% or less.

Garmin GNS 530

The most humble GPS offering in Microsoft Flight Simulator is the GNS 530 dual-screen module from Garmin. This humble little GPS/AP system handles the core operations; nothing more and nothing less. This includes a GPS screen that shows the map but lacks a weather radar and wind speed indicator. Depending on the aircraft the autopilot system may be able to guide the direction of the plane but it cannot not hold the altitude.

Create new flightplan from the GPS module – [lower left/right screens]: Press FPL button (upper screen) > press PUSH CRSR button > select enter when first waypoint is highlighted > input airport ICAO code > press ENT > use PUSH CRSR knob to navigate to destination waypoint > input airport ICAO code > press ENT > press FPL button again to return to main map screen.

Press FPL button (upper screen) > press PUSH CRSR button > select enter when first waypoint is highlighted > input airport ICAO code > press ENT > use PUSH CRSR knob to navigate to destination waypoint > input airport ICAO code > press ENT > press FPL button again to return to main map screen. Command the aircraft to automatically follow the route of the flightplan (magenta line) – [bottom control panel] : Press AP > press NAV. [Move to the small control panel at the top] : press NAV-GPS button > set it to GPS mode.

: Press AP > press NAV. : press NAV-GPS button > set it to GPS mode. Set the aircraft to ascend or descend to a specific altitude at a specific (vertical) speed – [bottom control panel]: Press AP (if you haven’t already) > press ALT button > use ALT SEL knob to select the desired altitude > press UP to ascend or DN to descend to the selected altitude (there is no VS button in this Skyhawk).

Press AP (if you haven’t already) > press ALT button > use ALT SEL knob to select the desired altitude > press UP to ascend or DN to descend to the selected altitude (there is no VS button in this Skyhawk). Set the aircraft to bank left or right automatically in a specific direction – [bottom control panel]: Select AP (if you haven’t already) > Press HDG button > turn HDG knob in the desired direction (located on the compass gauge labeled HDG) > rotate until small arrow points to the desired heading.

For planes with no Garmin system (and/or if you want to do everything really easily):

As part of Sim Update V Asobo outfitted Microsoft Flight Simulator with an advanced autopilot feature known as the Flight Assistant. This feature will completely handle all of the operations mentioned beforehand as the aircraft will fall entirely under the control of the CPU. This little hat trick is so advanced that it can even taxi takeoff and land the aircraft entirely independent of user input. It’s pretty much like a car’s self-drive mode except for airplanes. This can be used in any aircraft regardless of whether the avionics system is basic or advanced. You can use this feature for the more difficult aircraft or if you just don’t want to mess with the slightly complex operations discussed here in this guide.

Access AI Pilot: Hover the cursor over the top edge of the screen > press the Flight Assistant button (a little pilot symbol) > press the AI pilot toggle > set destination (any airport city or point of interest can be selected).

Note: So far a precise “land here” command doesn’t seem to have been implemented. But for the most part the Flight Assistant should be able to land the aircraft once an airport is selected as the destination target.

The cloud database market represents a significant shift in the way organizations around the world conduct business. Enterprise-scale companies in particular are turning away from legacy on-premise database solutions in favor of accessible flexible cloud solutions.

Gartner predicts that by 2022 75% of all databases will be deployed or migrated to cloud platforms primarily for analytics and as part of popular SaaS offerings. Organizations are realizing the benefits of their cloud database investments in the form of cost and productivity savings — it’s unlikely the market will see a downshift any time soon.

This article provides an overview of the state of the cloud database market predicted future growth key market drivers benefits of this technology and use cases.

Cloud database market

There’s a reason the cloud database market has become popular among investors — there’s no question this market will continue evolving at a steady pace for the foreseeable future. The global business community is rapidly adopting cloud database solutions.

By 2018 Gartner reported that the worldwide database management system revenue grew 18.4% to $46 billion with cloud database management systems making up 68% of that growth. Looking ahead the worldwide global cloud database market is projected to reach $68.5 billion by 2026 according to research conducted by Valuates Reports. This figure represents an annual growth rate of 38.2% from 2021 through 2026.

Key growth drivers

Valuates Reports identifies three dominant factors driving the growth of the global cloud database market:

The expense of sprawling constantly growing database infrastructure is significantly reduced by moving to the cloud. Physical infrastructure costs become obsolete and can be seamlessly affordably scaled down during non-peak usage times.

Application integration is easier and much quicker than on-premise databases. Developers can configure a database ready to integrate with applications in minutes.

Built-in security features commonly offered by cloud database providers elevate enterprise network security an area of great concern in the era of remote work and increasingly intelligent threat actors lurking in the shadows. Default encryption of data integrated identity and access management controls and regulatory compliance tools are all available as options or standard features of solutions found in the marketplace.

Primary industries

Research firm IndustryARC reports that the cloud database market in 2020 was dominated by large enterprises a segment the company projects will grow at an annual growth rate of 33.1% through 2026. The banking and financial services industry represented the primary adopter of cloud database services in 2020. Other primary industries include:

IT

Telecom

Insurance

Manufacturing

Health care

Life Sciences

Cloud database adoption by region

North America dominated the cloud database market in 2020 with a market share of 41.5% followed by the Asia-Pacific and Europe.

According to IndustryARC a major factor contributing to the North American dominance is the presence of large cloud database vendors like Amazon Google and Oracle.

Benefits of cloud databases

For many organizations the primary benefit of shifting to a cloud-based database model from a primarily on-premises database solution is accessibility. This is especially true as the global business world emerges from the 2020 pandemic with a new emphasis on remote work arrangements. Other notable benefits of cloud databases include:

Cloud database clusters can be scaled up or down based on actual usage versus pre-purchasing physical database space in anticipation of future needs that may or may not arise.

Backup solutions can be set up quicker and more affordably allowing businesses to establish continuity plans that can be activated automatically should a network failure occur.

Cloud infrastructures are inherently well-suited for disaster recovery. Saved data is replicated across servers allowing organizations to retrieve data almost immediately ultimately reducing downtime and productivity losses.

Encrypted cloud databases are extremely valuable for distributed workforces including remote workers and global organizations with multiple sites.

Leading cloud database providers

While the cloud database market is dominated by some of the biggest brands in the tech space a few niche providers in this space hold their own. These ten companies represent the majority of the cloud database market share.

IBM

Microsoft

Amazon

Google

Oracle

Rackspace

SAP

Salesforce

CenturyLink

Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC)

Cloud database use cases

According to Donald Feinberg distinguished research vice president at Gartner organizations are increasingly developing and deploying new applications in the cloud and moving existing assets a trend Feinberg expects to increase.

“We also believe this begins with systems for data management solutions for analytics use cases — such as data warehousing data lakes and other use cases where data is used for analytics artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)” Feinberg says.

“Increasingly operational systems are also moving to the cloud especially with conversion to the SaaS application model.”

Conclusions

The cloud database market trajectory is reflective of an overall trend toward cloud adoption for wide-ranging applications. For example organizations rely on cloud-based resources to centralize and share communication and proprietary resources to employees and clients wherever they may be physically. Database management in the cloud is an extension of this evolution of the way global businesses operate.

With major tech players leading the pack organizations considering investments in cloud database management have many reliable options from which to choose. Given the size of the cloud database market there is likely an attractive solution to be found for virtually every organization.

Cape Cod Times

FALMOUTH — Ben Flanagan had the spot picked out.

At the top of the last hill on the ASICS Falmouth Road Race course with about a half-mile to go there sits a crosswalk and a 25 MPH sign.

“Yesterday when I was doing my strides I was like ‘This crosswalk is where I'm going to go tomorrow because it's pretty far out that no one's expecting it but you just have that whole downhill and it's a lot of momentum’” Flangan said. “And that's where I went today and it was a long drive home but I don't think people were ready to go that early and I think that's what ultimately got me today.”

Flanagan who won the race in his first Falmouth appearance in 2018 with a time of 32 minutes and 21 seconds finished first Sunday among the men’s elite runners with a time of 32:16 just three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Biya Simbassa.

“My goal was just to make as few mistakes as possible and let other people use their energy and tire themselves out” Flanagan said.

The approach worked Flanagan said but he was also in disbelief at how tightly packed the men’s crop of runners was.

“Every time every mile I turned around” he said “I couldn't believe how many guys were still there.”

A pack of about 15 to 20 male runners kept in a tight huddle for about the first six miles of Sunday’s 7-mile race with Frank Lara leading the pack at each of the first six mile markers. Lara finished the day in fourth place with a time of 32:22.

Flanagan said the biggest difference Sunday was his amount of experience on the course. The University of Michigan alumnus took part in last year’s virtual race but he wasn’t able to compete in the 2019 race because of stress fracture in his femur.

“It's not so much about defying the odds” Flanagan said. “Today is just about doing what I need to do.”

Flanagan said he spends a lot of time in Falmouth as his girlfriend Hannah Ghelfi who’s also the daughter of Road Race President Scott Ghelfi is a native of the city.

“We come back all the time together and I've just I've got such strong roots here now” Flanagan said.

Another Falmouth native who posted a top time Sunday was Henry Gartner with a time of 38:58 which was the best among all Falmouth residents. Gartner finished fourth in the Tommy Cochary High School Mile on Saturday with a time of 4:30.68.

“I've been coming here ever since I was a little kid” Gartner said Saturday. “This means a lot to run this race.”

WOMEN’S ELITE IN THE 2021 FALMOUTH ROAD RACE

For the first time since 2003 Edna Kiplagat ran in the Falmouth Road Race on Sunday and she came up big separating herself from the pack of Elite 7-Mile runners about four miles in before finishing ahead of any in the women’s pool by 27 seconds.

Kiplagat said that Sunday’s weather was “perfect” and a lot cooler than most races she participates in during August.

Following Kiplagat pulling away there was a five-person pack of runners that included Emily Durgin Fiona O’Keeffe Makena Morley and Diane Nukuri who finished second through fifth place in that order.

“We kind of had a great pack of four or five girls working together and honestly I forgot how challenging the course was like the rolling hills the first three or four miles” Durgin said. “So it was really nice to be able to work together.”

Durgin O’Keeffe Morley and Nukuri all finished within a 16-second span of each other and Durgin O’Keeffe and Morley finished within three seconds of each other.

Following Sunday Kiplagat’s next marathon is the Boston Marathon. She said a part of participating in Falmouth was to train for Boston.

WHEELCHAIR RESULTS FOR THE 2021 FALMOUTH ROAD RACE

The first-place times of Sunday’s wheelchair results came from athletes in quite different places.

Hermin Garic of Utica New York and Emeilia Perry of Philadelphia posted the top men’s and women’s results of the wheelchair race. Both got their first-ever top time at Falmouth but Garic did so on his seventh appearance and Perry did so in her in-person Falmouth debut.

Previously Garic has finished the race second three different times and in third place twice.

“You know the conditions were a little bit rough out there and you just got to keep going” Garic said. “Sometimes you clock in and it's not going to be a fun day and you just got to keep going through it.”

Perry ran the Road Race in 2020 when it was virtual and she familiarized herself with the course for Sunday by watching a YouTube video of it.

“I wasn't expecting it” Perry said of the win. “So it was a surprise and (I’m) definitely not used to this kind of stuff.”

Olympic marathoner Molly Seidel ran for Tommy's Place in Falmouth

Olympic marathoner Molly Seidel raised $4761 for Tommy’s Place a vacation home for kids fighting cancer located in Falmouth on Sunday.

Seidel who became the third U.S. woman to medal in the marathon when she won a bronze just eight days ago in Tokyo was announced as one of several notable runners in the race field May 25. But the race announced Aug. 3 that Seidel would be starting at the back end of Sunday’s 8000-plus-person race pool and for every runner passed the race would donate $1 to Tommy’s Place.

“I felt bad because we were having to push through people and try not to knock anyone out of the way but everyone was really excited when we were coming fast” Seidel who ran the race with her sister Isabel Seidel said. “It was a ton of energy. It was really really cool so it's fun getting that coming from a race where it's very few spectators allowed and no cheering.”

This was Boston resident Seidel’s third time running the race she said Sunday and she also won the Cape Cod half marathon in 2019.

But when the Lexus struck the BMW it also hit the female. The passenger was then transported to the University Medical Center and later died.

Alexandria Louise Lind 28 was the driver of the Lexus and currently facing charges of DUI resulting in death and failing to decrease speed or use due care according to the NHP.

The freeway ramp was closed for several hours Sunday morning for the on-scene investigation.

The Clark County Coroner's office will release the name of the female killed after family has been notified.",,,

The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is wrapping up the review of the design and other critical systems reported Hindustan Times. The public enterprise is all set to sign a multi-million-dollar contract with US company GE Aviation for the purchase of 99 F404 jet plane engines to propel the indigenous Tejas.

Earlier this year India’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) awarded a whopping Rs 48000-crore contract to HAL for 83 LCA Mk-1A fighters for the Indian Air Force. The IAF’s first Mk-1A aircraft is expected to be delivered in March 2024 while the rest will be inducted into service by 2029.

“The preliminary design review is over and so is the critical design review for several systems including mission computer a digital map generator and digital flight control systems. We are integrating the active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the electronic warfare suite on the final operational clearance (FOC) version of the LCA. After it is proven there we will integrate it with the final Mk-1A version” Madhavan told HT.

Among the major advantages of an AESA radar are — resistance to electronic jamming low interception by enemy radars and it allows high bandwidth data-link between friendly aircraft.

Apart from the AESA radar the Mk-1A variant will come with digital radar warning receivers external self-protection jammer pods advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability.

The fighter’s indigenous content is expected to be around 60% compared to 50% in the existing variants.

Group Captain Badhrish Narasimha Athreya (Retd) a former Chief Test Pilot told Financial Express about how the Tejas had matured over time since its maiden test flight two decades ago. Once inducted the Tejas will form the lightweight fighter backbone of the air force for the next quarter-century.

LCA Tejas Vs JF-17

For any combat jet military aviation enthusiasts love to pitch it against a potential rival in order to assess the aircraft’s combat capabilities. The 2019 post-Balakot episode when Indian and Pakistani jets got involved in vicious dogfights also provided fodder to such discussions.

One of the most interesting insights came from IAF Chief RKS Bhadauria. “As far as the [Chinese-Pakistani] JF-17 is concerned even the LCA FOC [Final Operational Clearance] version is ahead of it.

The Mark-1A would be much ahead of the JF-17s. As far as this comparison is concerned we will be way ahead of them” the Air Chief Marshal had said earlier this year.

When asked about the specs he said “It [LCA Tejas Mark-1A] will have top-of-the-line BVR the indigenous ASTRA or better. We will have a version which will be ahead and we plan other sensors and weapons which are top of the line.”

The IAF chief confirmed that the latest variant of the indigenous ASTRA would be fitted into the fighter along with a slew of air-to-ground weapons and standoff weapons developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).

The JF-17 ‘Thunder’ is a light-weight single-engine multi-role combat aircraft designed by China and produced jointly by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC).

He also stated that the capability is beyond what was seen during the Balakot airstrikes. However military author and defense aerospace analyst Joseph P Chacko said “By the time IAF fields Mk-1A at the forward bases JF-17 would have caught up technologically with MK 4. If they were to dogfight in the future only tactics will matter.”

According to Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retired) who is currently the Director-General Centre For Air Power Studies the latest JF-17 Block III has the Chinese KLJ-7A active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar digital fly-by-wire flight control system a new helmet-mounted display network-centric warfare capability a holographic head-up display an infra-red search and track (IRST) system new electronic warfare systems weapons upgrade and a radar cross-section reducing ‘pseudo-stealthy’ airframe.

“The aircraft will be armed with two newer dual-head PL-5EII short-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs). Later PAF claims they may get a longer range and more sophisticated PL-15 AAM (150 km).

The Chinese call Block III a 4th generation-plus fighter. The AESA and PL-15 combination PAF claims would outrange all IAF aircraft other than Rafale and upgraded SU-30 MKI. The Block III variant has just begun inducting” he wrote for The EurAsian Times.

Group Captain Tej Prakash Srivastava (Retd) an airpower and security analyst said “Comparing the Tejas Mark-1A and the JF-17 comes down to what the two platforms are carrying at that time. So the issue of analyzing platform versus platform…is not an educated one.

“Air combat depends on the situation and the weapon systems being carried at the time. However if it is to be assessed solely platform-wise it is a better platform than the JF-17. It [Tejas] is an extremely good platform provided we can manufacture it in significant numbers and come armed with smart weapons.”

Earlier The EurAsian Times had carried out a comparative analysis of India’s Tejas Mark-1A and Chinese Pakistani JF-17. Compared to JF-17 many experts suggested that Tejas has an edge with its more potent engine radar system and electronic warfare suite BVR missile capability while others favored ‘tried and tested’ JF-17s.

According to experts writing for the EurAsian Times the JF-17 also comes with a Russian engine about which Malaysia’s experience has not been good when it comes to serviceability.

The country also operates the Russian MiG-29s with similar engines which are said to require significant after-sales support and maintenance. However Tejas will be powered by a General Electric F404 engine also used in Malaysia’s F/A-18s which has delivered satisfying performance.

Export Potential

Younis Dar a defense writer with The EurAsian Times had made a case for how the LCA Tejas Mark-1A may be shot down by the JF-17 in the export war. His report cites Argentine Air Force chief Brigadier Xavier Isaac who told local media that the country is reconsidering the JF-17.

Abhijit Iyer-Mitra a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies New Delhi spelled out 10 different reasons why the JF-17 is being preferred by the global market over JF-17s.

He began by saying “Tejas has a very small set of weapons integrated with it mostly Indian and some Western. So on one hand you force countries to buy Indian weapons that don’t work for them – or if you get western they’ll ask what’s the benefit of buying Indian?”

“With Pakistan – the JF-17 essentially slots into the Chinese supply chain – which has a massive variety of proven and demonstrable weapons. So nations buying the JF-17 already have Chinese weapons to mate or are comfortable with buying Chinese weapons that anyway have a proven track record. In fact countries with bad human rights records like Pakistan Iran North Korea would prefer the Chinese as they don’t impose sanctions.

“China has a Security Council Veto and any country buying weapons from China can have significant influence over any Security Council decisions (same with US or French or Russian weapon sales). India has no such Veto” he added.

He pointed out that “Tejas is confused aircraft – it doesn’t fit any known market segment. The JF-17 is a modest fighter but whatever advancements it brings are solid and proven. [On the other hand] Tejas is a nightmare – nothing about it is proven – there’s been too much mixing and matching and it inspires zero purchaser confidence.

“Finally the question of re-export. JF-17 uses mostly Chinese but some Italian (avionics and radar) and Russian (engine) equipment – all of which are cleared for re-export to third countries. Tejas uses American engines Israeli radar and a mishmash of avionics from countries that will never authorize re-export.”

Shahid Raza a defense expert from Pakistan echoed similar views. “Tejas also suffers from the fact that currently there’s no major operator of this aircraft not even the Indian Air Force which only has a handful of these aircraft in service. This reduces the confidence of any potential buyer” Raza said.

In June The EurAsian Times reported Malaysia has accelerated efforts to acquire a new light combat aircraft and released a tender. India’s HAL Tejas is in the race for the contract along with several other foreign platforms.

It is to be seen whether Indian HAL Tejas can overpower Chinese/Pakistani Jf-17 Thunder in both air capabilities and exports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL2ZsMzYwYWVyby5jb20vZGV0YWlsL2xvc3Mtb2YtZW5naW5lLXRocnVzdC1jb250cm9sLWluLWEtZ2U5MC10dXJiby1mYW4tZW5naW5lLXByb21wdHMtZmFhLXRvLWlzc3VlLWFuLWFpcndvcnRoaW5lc3MtZGlyZWN0aXZlLWFkLXRvLXJlcGxhY2UtdGhlLWZhZGVjLW1uNC1taWNyb3Byb2Nlc3Nvci82NDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Loss of engine Thrust control in a GE90 Turbo Fan engine prompts FAA to issue an Airworthiness Directive (AD) to ...,"FAA AD to address loss of engine thrust control resulting in uncommanded high thrust in General Electric Company GE90 Engines !

South Korea unveiled a prototype of the KF-21 ‘Boramae’ (Hawk) the country’s first indigenous semi-stealth fighter jet in April this year. Seoul and Jakarta had in 2015 agreed to invest $7.6 billion on the program with Jakarta paying 20% of development costs in return for access to technologies Janes reported.

In view of the Chinese belligerence in the South and East China seas Indonesia intends to procure 50 KF-21s. Jakarta is also looking to procure air defense and strike variants that Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) is working on.

While Indonesia is keen to receive the technical know-how through the transfer of technology from its South Korean counterparts the country’s priority is to protect its maritime borders from Chinese aggression.

Indonesia has also begun defense collaboration with Japan in March. This move has paved towards military exports for the Indonesian Armed Forces from Japan.

Among Beijing’s naval posturing Natuna islands stand to be particularly troubled waters for Jakarta as it lies at the epicenter of China’s maritime claims. This makes the potential procurement of eight Japanese Mogami-class stealth frigates a prospective Indonesian naval procurement. These multi-role frigates from Japan would complement the South Korean KF-21s and the combined procurement of these platforms would be a tacit response to Beijing’s designs. HAL AMCA Of South Korea – The KF-21 Boramae Fighter Jet Makes Its First Appearance: WATCH

The KF-21 Boramae

Research and development of the program which was christened as KAI KF-X (KF-21 is the designation of the Korean version) began in 2015. The KF-21 fighters would eventually replace the South Korean Air Force’s aging F-4 and F-5 jets.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in along with an Indonesian delegation led by Prabowo Subianto Indonesia’s Defense Minister had attended the inaugural event at KAI’s headquarters in the southern city of Sacheon.

While Indonesia holds a 20% stake in the KF-21 program the country’s commitment to the project has been questioned amidst payment delays and economic hurdles. Turkey too had shown interest in the program however scrapped the idea owing to production sharing issues.

South Korea’s state arms procurement organization Defense Acquisition Program Administration said “If the KF-21 development is successful the Korean Air Force has an important meaning in that it plays a role in self-defense with domestic aircraft from training (trainer) to airspace defense (fighter) and provides a foothold to leap to a strong force in the world.”

DAPA notes that the unveiling of the K1-21 stealth fighter has not only been lauded for being the country’s first indigenous stealth fighter but also for the fact that it is the eighth country in the world to have successfully developed an advanced supersonic fighter aircraft of 4.5 generations or above. T

What Does KF-21 Offer

Joseph P Chacko author and commentator on military and international affairs told The EurAsian Times “About 30 odd Indonesian aeronautical scientists have returned to South Korea to work on the KAI KF-21 Boramae project even though the payment for the country’s share of funding has not been credited to the Koreans.

“The financial implications may not be just limited to that because of the involvement of Indonesia. Indonesia’s neighbors may be uncomfortable in inducting the aircraft. ASEAN military rivalry along with the rivalry with China would be the deciding factor for such big-ticket acquisitions.”

Chacko further explained that the Korean aircraft has some American fingerprints “KAI KF-21 Boramae has critical content from the United States including Lockheed Martin and GE and is subject to the US export controls.”

While it has widely been reported that the KF-21 is about 65% indigenous Chacko argues that most of the “subsystems have been either developed with the help of foreign partners or have foreign components within the subsystems.”

When asked about the potential pricing of the fighter and its likely competitors he said “The price of the 4.5 generation KF-21 price is expected to be around $65 million per unit and it is in head-on competition with the Russian Su-75 Checkmate 5th generation fighter which is expected to cost $60-75 million per unit. Russia exerts a considerable amount of clout in the region.”

KF-21 – Salient Features

KF-21 is a 4.5 generation aircraft which will be used along with the F-35 South Korea is purchasing from the US. The onboard software is developed by the Korean company LIG Nex1 with the help of SAAB and that gives them the flexibility of adapting the payload according to Chacko.

“The South Koreans can configure the payload as required by the customers. For example MBDA has been given the contract to integrate the Meteor missile” says Chacko.

Some analysts say the design of the KF-21 is strikingly similar to the US’ F-22 Raptor although the South Korean jet has been positioned as an alternative to the F-35 Lightning-II.

The KF-21 is expected to replace the South Korean Air Force’s F-5E/F Tiger IIs and F-4 Phantoms as well as some older F-16C/Ds and F-15K Slam Eagles all of which are nearing the end of their life cycle. The KF-21 also complements the 60 American F-35As that South Korea is purchasing. An estimated 40 KF-21’s are expected to be slated into service by 2028.

It has been speculated that the batch will comprise the Block I air defense Boramae variants. The first prototype unveiled in April will be joined by three more single and two twin-seat jets as part of the pilot program. The time frame given for development before the first KF-21 deliveries begin in 2026 has been described as ambitiously brief.

The R&D has been crunched into a duration between four to five years. While the Korean aircraft resembles the F-35 in many aspects the KF-21 is a twin rather than a single-engine fighter jet the prototypes are powered by a pair of General Electric F414-GE-400K engines. GE will supply 240 F414s for the full fleet of 120 aircraft planned to be in service by 2032.

Is KF-21 Really A Stealth Fighter?

Similar to its F-35 and F-22 the KF-21 will also offer the end-user stealth however it cannot match the same degree of radar signature reduction which the US 5th Gen fighter duo offers.

The KF-21 is thought to have a radar cross-section on par with the Eurofighter Typhoon but planned upgrades should reduce its radar signature considerably The War Zone reported.

What limits the KF-21’s stealth capability is the decision to carry weapons externally on six under-wing and four under-fuselage hardpoints. However the lower stealth profile is accounted for through its more economical price range and shorter development duration which came as a result of forgoing the internal weapons bay.

The weapons for the strike variant are already a part of the ROKAF arsenal. The Paveway II laser-guided bombs GPS/INS-guided GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs and GBU-31/38 Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs plus CBU‐105 Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser kits are some such munitions.

The aircraft is expected to be able to carry a payload as heavy as 16975 pounds and maintain a top speed of Mach 1.83 (1400 miles per hour). The KF-21 seems to have a performance edge over the F-35A in some respects as it boasts an effective range of approximately 1800 miles.

South Korea’s Hanwha Systems has indigenously produced an active electronically scanned AESA radar which can complement long-range weapons such as the MBDA’s Meteor air-to-air missile.

This would help extend the Korean air defense range beyond what the F-16 presently offers. This combination provides for an F-35-style deterrent which can augment Korea’s own Joint Strike Fighter fleet and its Boeing E-737 Peace Eye airborne early warning and control aircraft.

The KF-21 despite not being a 5th generation fighter is expected to be able to hold a market edge over its contemporary aircraft from India United Kingdom Europe and Japan as it is cheaper and can be delivered faster. Another market condition which merits a mention is that the KF-21 comes with no strings attached however the same cannot be said for the American F-35A or Chinese J-10CE fighter.

The US F-35A requires the end user to integrate within the Joint Strike Fighter ecosystem (excluding the Israelis). Furthermore customers will be required to take up the software updates and avionics which are selected and controlled by the manufacturer and the US government.

Similarly the J-10CE may be financially viable but it comes with heavy-handed Chinese influence. Furthermore the lack of reliability with regards to the Chinese/Russian fighter is another aspect that sticks out.

With the South Korean aircraft’s critical avionics and associated sensors being developed customers from across the world may expect more autonomy a better product and a steady supply if they go with the K-21.",,,

She sat down at her kitchen table in Berkeley Calif. and frantically started Googling to find out what it was.

Her experience wasn’t uncommon. People working at the tourism guide Lonely Planet the travel site The Points Guy and the health and medical information site Healthline were similarly blindsided in recent years when Red Ventures bought up special interest publications in a multibillion-dollar shopping spree.

Their Googling and mandatory corporate retreats led them to the company’s South Carolina headquarters a 180-acre campus with a cluster of modern buildings a fire pit a six-lane bowling alley spin room pickle ball courts and 264 residences for employees who choose to live where they work.

Red Ventures which started as a digital marketing company has attracted serious investments from private equity firms. Its location has helped obscure what is perhaps the biggest digital publisher in America a 4500-employee juggernaut that says it has roughly $2 billion in annual revenues a conservative valuation earlier this year of more than $11 billion and more readers as measured by Comscore than any media brand you’ve ever heard of — an average of 751 million visits a month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvY2hldnJvbGV0LWNhbWFyby1iZWNvbWVzLXRlc2xhLWZpZ2h0aW5nLWZvdXItZG9vci1ldi1pbi1kaWdpdGFsLXJlbmRlcmluZy0xNjcyOTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevrolet Camaro Becomes Tesla-Fighting Four-Door EV in Digital Rendering,"EV

But will the four-doorstill look like a Camaro or will Chevy go with a totally different design? Well keeping the Camaro design language alive is a must if GM wants the nameplate to live on but the electric architecture will lead to notable styling changes.YouTube pixel master ""TheSketchMonkey"" is the latest to join the ranks of those who created digital renditions of the upcoming sedan. And his take is a bit different than the Cadillac-inspired EV we saw earlier this month.Instead of borrowing from other GM products this designer went with a more traditional approach and kept the roofline similar to the current Camaro coupe. The rest of the car is also heavily based on the ongoing model; it's basically a sixth-gen Camaro ZL1 with a stretched wheelbase and a front grille delete.And don't get mad about the ""ZL1"" badge on the front hood. With the GMC Hummer EV capable of up to 1000 horsepower General Motors has the means to develop a high-performance Camaro EV worthy of its historic badges. The muscle car may take the all-electric route but this doesn't mean that the ZL1 the Z28 and the COPO will disappear into the history books.I'm pretty sure Chevrolet will go with a more significant overhaul for the seventh-gen Camaro but this rendering is still an interesting peek into the future. At least if you want to get an idea as to how a four-door Camaro might look like.Should Chevrolet go after the Tesla Model 3 with the next-generation Camaro? Or should it keep the nameplate in the two-door territory? Yes I know we all want the Camaro to retain a gasoline-fed V8 but that's nothing more than wishful thinking at this point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd0cGxhbmV0Lm5ldC9nZW5lc2lzLXJldmVhbHMtdmd0LWdyMy1ncjQtMjAyMTA4MTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Genesis Reveals Vision Gran Turismo Concept and GT Championship Racers,"Genesis has unveiled a trio of new racing car concepts designed in collaboration with Gran Turismo destined to take their places in the racing game series in the near future.

The Korean marque part of the Hyundai Motor Group alongside Kia and electric sub-brand Ioniq unveiled the three cars during a special event at the Monterey Car Week.

Each of the three models slots into existing vehicle brackets from Gran Turismo Sport with a Vision Gran Turismo car — itself split into three separate designs — alongside Gr.4 and Gr.3 race cars. Sibling vehicles under the Hyundai brand already exist in GT Sport so it’s unclear if these cars will replace them or appear as new cars under the Genesis brand.

The first of the three and the only car physically present at the event is the G70 GR4. It’s based on the Genesis G70 sports sedan facelifted late last year to coincide with the brand’s re-introduction to the European market.

In its regular form the G70 four-door is available with the Hyundai Lambda V6 engine shared with the Kia Stinger producing 365hp and in both rear- and four-wheel drive versions. That means either version could slot into the Gr.4 class pretty easily with the class open to any drivetrain type.

Sitting above the G70 GR4 is the mysteriously named “X GR3”. That was presented only in digital form in the on-track renders you see here and it presents something of a puzzle.

It’s a two-door coupe which is a model Genesis doesn’t currently produce. However it bears strong resemblance to the larger G80 luxury sedan at the front and Genesis has registered trademarks in the USA for a vehicle called the GT80. That suggests the X GR3 previews this GT80 model a replacement for the older Hyundai Genesis Coupe.

The original Hyundai Genesis Coupe also used the Lambda V6 but a 3.8-liter version as does the new G80. We don’t yet know what will power the GT80 but it’s likely to be the same as the regular G80 which means the 420hp 5.0 Tau V8 is also possible though it will be boosted to around 600hp for the Gr.3 car.

Both of the cars feature an unusual rose gold and black livery in these preview images and the Gr.3 car also has mismatched wheels — with a classic DTM-style aero wheel at the front axle and an open seven-spoke wheel at the rear. This is a visual throwback to the Hyundai Genesis Coupe Gr.3 car in GT Sport which has red front wheels and black rears.

One final vehicle in the special event is a Vision Gran Turismo car. This wasn’t presented as a fully realized vehicle but previewed as three “potential” designs for the final product.

Described as “an elite racing vehicle” the Genesis VGT was shown in three forms: Alpha Bravo and Charlie. Notably the prototype names also included “GR1” which suggests the car is destined for the in-game Gr.1 category. That’s a pretty broad church which covers top-level Le Mans racers from the 1980s up to the most recent LMP1-H cars before the switch to hypercars but also a high performance road car-based racer in the Bugatti VGT Gr.1.

It’s not clear whether Genesis will select just one of these models to become the final Vision Gran Turismo car or whether all three will appear in Gran Turismo at some point.

Also unknown is which Gran Turismo title will see the Genesis models make their debut.

The images that accompany this patent show the pencil docked within the keyboard and the Touch Bar as we know it will be gone. A much smaller one will be used most likely in the next MacBook Pro.

Although patent images are usually nothing more but schematics that only suggest what the real-world implementations will look like the next-gen MacBook Pro pictured in the gallery at the end of this article is more than just a rough draft. However we are still talking about a sketch and with a bit of luck this is what the next-gen MacBook Pro will look like.

The aforementioned MacBook Pro renders come from Yanko Design's Sarang Sheth an industrial designer who also created other interesting concepts for technology fans such as the 2019 RAZR or the Galaxy Fold 3. In the description of the MacBook Pro renders he mentions that the original patent shows the Apple Pencil input device which will probably sit docked in an area that replaces most of the Touch Bar as we know it. Thankfully a small Touch Bar remains and it will probably be optimized for use with the Apple Pencil.

Something not highlighted in the patent but highly probable is the dual use of the Pencil which could be used to operate both the display of the MacBook Pro as well as the mini-Touch Bar mentioned above. Since the dock of the Apple Pencil will make some of the Function keys disappear it is also likely to see some on-Pencil gestures being introduced for tasks like adjusting media volume or calibrating the screen parameters.

Obviously all the above is nothing more than a rumor for now. Would you like to see it coming true? Do you have any better ideas for it? As usual the comments section is all yours so be sure to make yourselves heard.

We love how Dev collaborates with his creator pals like Taneesha Mirwani Agasthya Shah and Tarini Shah among others to create relatable and hilarious videos. This rising digital creator receives appreciation for his sarcasm-filled comedy from his viewers and therefore we say that “keep that content coming!”

Here’s what Dev Raiyani has to say about his journey

Exactly one year ago I was at 10000 followers on Instagram and right now it has come to 200000 and growing every day. I faced many challenges during this journey of being a content creator. Some of them were like managing my studies as well as content creation at the same time. I have been doing this since I was 13 years old but I always tried to balance things when I got into making reels. I divided my time – made content during the day and attend college at night. I had to do this because I love creating content for other people but at the same time did not want to take on too much on my plate as that could lead to stress and affect my mental health. Therefore I took a few breaks now and then from creating content and finally came back stronger than ever. Honestly creating content is something I would love to keep doing for the rest of my life. Moreover eventually I would like to move towards fulfilling my dream to make films and showcase the untold Indian stories that the world is not yet aware of.

It was really just a classic example of where the competition was just that much better.

Here's What You Need to Remember: For every winner there is also a second best. When it comes to military hardware there are plenty of designs that were very good very innovative and likely would have been more than up to the role required – but there was simply something just a little better.

This is certainly the case of the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 a fifth-generation single-seat twin-engine stealth fighter designed for the United States Air Force in the late 1980s as part of the American Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) challenge. The ATF program came about to address the perceived threat from the Soviet Union's Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29 and while several companies originally submitted design proposals in the end the USAF opted for designs from Northrop and from Lockheed – which partnered with Boeing and General Dynamics on the YF-22 ""Lightning II"" later adapted into service as the F-22 Raptor.

The YF-23's unique design was quite distinct from the YF-22 and it has been described as having an ""almost pancake-like airframe structure with blended wing elements."" Its diamond-shaped wings were meant to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds.

Two prototypes of the YF-23 were built each with a different set of engines – as one element of the development phase of the program was to evaluate two experimental turbofan engines. Prototype Air Vehicle 1 (PAV-1) which was painted charcoal gray and unofficially nicknamed ""Spider"" or ""Black Widow II"" – in honor of the Northrop P-61 Black Widow flown during World War II – was equipped with the Pratt & Whitney YF199 engines. Prototype Air Vehicle 2 (PAV-2) which was painted in two shades of gray and nicknamed ""Gray Ghost"" was powered by a pair of General Electric YF120 engines.

The prototype planes were both fast and stealthy. The plane's low profile and classified skin material on the airframe was said to be nearly 100% undetectable by nearly any radar system of the period. The ""supercruise"" function allowed the fighter to achieve sustained supersonic flight without the use of the afterburner.

The designs called for the YF-23 to be armed with a fixed 20mm M61 Vulcan while internal bays could house four AIM-7 Sparrow or AIM-120 AMRAAM medium-range air-to-air missiles as well as a pair of AIM-9 short-range missiles.

The YF-23 was very evenly matched with the YF-22. While the YF-23 had a top speed of 1451mph to the YF-22's 1599mph the Northrop design had a longer range and a higher ceiling – 2796 miles maximum range and a ceiling of 65000 feet. By contrast the YF-22 had a range of 2000 miles and a ceiling of 50000 feet.

Where the YF-22 had the edge however was in agility something that is of the utmost of importance in a fighter aircraft. The YF-22 ""Lightning II"" was simply better in a dogfight and that was enough to convince the Air Force that it would be the better of the two.

In the end it wasn't that the YF-23 was a bad design nor was it really a losing design. It was really just a classic example of where the competition was just that much better.

Bush was commissioned in January 2009.

Here's What You Need to Know: The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is unquestionably a symbol of American might and power projection abroad.

At 1092 feet the Nimitz-class supercarriers are more than three times the length of a football field and with a crew of 3200 sailors and 2480 airmen these are essentially floating cities. The lead ship of the class USS Nimitz—nicknamed ""Old Salt""—was commissioned in May 1975 was named after Adm. Chester Nimitz who led the U.S. Navy through World War II.

The ship was first deployed to the Indian Ocean during the Iran Hostage Crisis and has since logged untold miles providing security at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games and later service in the Persian Gulf after Operation Desert Storm. Most recently USS Nimitz was deployed against ISIS in Iraq and Syria where her F/A-18s took part in the Battle of Afar in 2017.

A total of 10 Nimitz-class carriers have been built and the last of the class USS George H.W. Bush was commissioned in January 2009. These nuclear-powered carriers which have two reactors and four shafts for propulsion with a top speed of 30+ knots (34.5mph) were the largest warships in the world until the USS Gerald R. Ford the lead ship of her class of carriers entered service in 2017. Each of the Nimitz-class has an expected 50-year service life with one mid-life refueling. These warships which have a displacement of 102000 tons were all built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding (now Northrop Grumman Ship Systems) based in Virginia at a unit cost of approximately $8.5 billion (constant year FY 12 dollars).

Each carrier has approximately 60 aircraft onboard and this includes a variety of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft with up to 90 of various types. Typical aircraft on a Nimitz-class carrier include 12 F/A-18E/F Hornets 36 F/A-18 Hornets four E-2C Hawkeyes and four EA-6B Prowlers fixed-wing and helicopters including four SH-60F and two HH-60H Seahawks. In addition the carriers could also deploy the S-3B Viking before these were phased out and replaced the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The flight deck which measures 1092 feet by 252 feet is equipped with four lifts four steam-driven catapults and four arrester wires. The carriers are capable of launching one air every 20 seconds.

The air wings of the carriers are customized according to the nature of operations with the usual air wings replaced with 50 army helicopters on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower for its operations in Haiti in 1994. Similar considerations can be made when a carrier is used for disaster response and humanitarian assistance.

In addition to the aircraft the most recently built Nimitz-class carriers are now armed with three Raytheon GMLS mk29 eight-cell launchers for NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles which has semi-radar terminal guidance. There are also four Raytheon/General Dynamics 20mm Phalanx six-barreled Mk15 close-in weapons systems that have a 3000rpm rate of fire.

While the last of the Nimitz-class carriers have been commissioned and the class will eventually be replaced by the Gerald R. Ford-class these ten carriers will still strike fear into potential U.S. adversaries for many years to come.

Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito were both wealthier in 2020 than they were in 2018 according to their annual financial disclosures filed earlier this year

Manchin’s estimated net worth for 2020 was $8.6 million compared to $7.6 million for 2018. Capito was worth $2.53 million compared to $2.15 million in 2018.

The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probably range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

For 2020 Manchin’s asset values ranged from $4376067 to $12844100. He reported no liabilities. The midpoint was $8610083.50.

Capito’s assets ranged from $1596629 to $4996000. She reported liabilities ranging from $475005 to $1065000. Using the formula put her range of worth from $531629 to $4520995 with the midpoint at $2526995.

Here’s a look at some selected details from their reports.

Manchin

OpenSecrets ranked Manchin 19th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 67th overall in Congress. OpenSecrets hasn’t yet published its compilation of 2020 filings.

For comparison the richest senator in 2018 was Mark Warner D-Va. worth $214 million. Current Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was worth $1.12 million and current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was worth $34.14 million.

Manchin reported collecting $48282.24 from the state Public Employees Retirement System in 2020.

Members are required to report both their own and their spouse’s assets and liabilities. His wife Gayle Manchin currently co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission holds a savings account worth $500001-$1 million which paid interest ranging from $2501-$5000.

Manchin reported two savings accounts ranging respectively from $100001-$250000 and $50001-$100000. They produced interest ranging from $201-$1000 for the first and less than $201 for the second.

The Joe Manchin III Qualified Blind Trust is worth $500001-$1 million and generated revenue of $5001-$15000.

He owns a storage building in Fairmont worth $50001-$100000 that collected $2501-$5000 in rent. A commercial rental property in Fairmont is worth $250001-$500000 and collected $5001-$15000 in rent and $2382 in “ordinary business income.”

He owns stock in Fairmont-based Enersystems which he founded and is described as providing services and materials for utility plants (according to news reports it supplies coal to Mon Power’s Grant Town plant). The stock is worth $1000001-$5 million and produces $100001-$1 million in dividends plus $491949 in business income.

Manchin holds stock in two Morgantown-based companies. Figure 8 Surgical makes a sternal closure tool. CereDX (now Valtari Bio) is developing a blood test to aid rapid triage in stroke patients. The stock holdings for each is worth $1001 to $15001 and both generate dividends labeled “none” meaning less than $201.

The final asset on Manchin’s list is the house boat that recently made headlines as the site of a gathering of senators from both parties where Sen. Lindsey Graham R-SC subsequently reported testing positive for COVID despite being vaccinated.

Manchin reports the house boat being worth $100001-$250000.

Capito

Open Secrets ranked Capito 46th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 169th overall in Congress.

Capito has a stake in Disney magic. She owns Walt Disney Co. stock worth $15001-$50000.

She and her husband have stock in a number of energy companies: Duke Energy ($1001-$15000) NextEra Energy ($1001-$15000) ExxonMobil ($1001-$15000) Royal Dutch Shell ($1001-$15000) Chevron ($1001-$15000) Phillips 66 ($1001-$15000) Wisconsin Energy ($1001-$15000) and BlackRock ($1001-$15000).

They each have a Wells Fargo bank account each worth $50001-$100000 and they report four separate stock holdings in Wells Fargo. They also have several Citigroup holdings.

Their high-tech stock includes Microsoft Apple AT&T Cisco Verizon and IBM.

Her husband owns stock in Viatris (which closed its Morgantown plant last month) worth $1001-$15000. Their other pharmaceutical holdings include Johnson & Johnson Merck Novartis Pfizer Roche Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

They have three box stores covered with holdings in WalMart Target and Lowe’s.

Other holdings include Nordstrom UPS Ford Colgate-Palmolive Proctor & Gamble #M and Nike.

Reps. David McKinley Carol Miller and Alex Mooney all had reports due in May and all three filed for extensions. Their new deadline was Friday and a story on their filings will follow after their reports are published.

Less than a month after General Motors sued Ford Motor Co. for trademark infringement over the name of Ford's new hands-free driving technology called BlueCruise Ford wants GM's trademark rights to ""Cruise"" and ""Super Cruise"" rescinded said Ford spokesman Mike Levine.

Cruise is the name of GM's subsidiary developing autonomous cars. Super Cruise is GM's hands-free technology.

On Friday evening Ford was to file a request with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office asking it to rescind both of GM’s “Cruise” and “Super Cruise” trademark registrations.

Levine said Ford argues the terms should have never been registered in the first place so it wants the trademarks rescinded to ensure ""that it and the industry as a whole can freely use the word 'cruise' to safely describe their driver assist technologies.""

GM's response to the filing was to reiterate much of what it said when it filed the lawsuit.

""As the industry’s first true hands-free driver assistance system on the market GM’s Super Cruise was first announced in 2012 and has had a well established commercial presence since 2017 with approximately 10M miles driven using the technology to date"" said Darryll Harrison GM spokesman in a statement. ""GM remains committed to vigorously defending our brands and protecting the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market and that won’t change. At this time we have no further comment.""

Ford maintains that GM's trademark infringement lawsuit against it is ""meritless and frivolous"" Levine said adding that the lawsuit left Ford no other choice but to file the request with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

""Drivers for decades have understood what cruise control is every automaker offers it and 'cruise' is common shorthand for the capability"" Levine said. ""Any number of companies use the word 'cruise' in connection with driver assist technology.""

Ford chose BlueCruise in relation to the Blue Oval's next evolution of Ford’s Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control which incorporates hands-free ""Blue Zones"" and other advanced cruise control features he said.

GM filed the trademark infringement lawsuit against Ford July 24 in U.S. District Court in northern California after having several weeks of mediated discussions with Ford trying to reach an agreement on the use of the word ""cruise.""

GM's majority-owned self-driving subsidiary Cruise has been in business since 2013.

GM is seeking monetary damages and filed a preliminary injunction asking that Ford be ordered to stop using the name.

Ford's response to GM's preliminary injunction late Friday argues ""cruise"" is a common term used across the industry Levine said noting that GM has no issue with Predictive Cruise used by Mack Trucks Robocruise used as RoboCars' trademark Hyundai's Smart Cruise Control and BMW's Active Cruise Control.

The legal fight between the two Detroit automakers turns on whether ""cruise"" is a generic term for technology that allows the car to take over some share of driving tasks from a human motorist.

The clash underscores the intensity of competition among established automakers to be seen as leaders in automated driving technology competitive with Silicon Valley rivals Tesla Inc Alphabet Inc 's Waymo unit and others.

GM filed a federal suit against Ford on July 24 accusing Ford of violating GM trademarks by using the name ""Blue Cruise"" for a system that enables hands-free driving.

GM had previously trademarked ""Super Cruise"" for its hands-free partially automated driving technology. It also has trademarked ""Cruise"" the name of its robo-taxi unit in San Francisco.

Ford reiterated on Friday its position that GM's suit is frivolous. The effort to nullify GM's trademarks for the use of the word ""cruise"" takes the fight to a new level.

""To defend itself Ford has no choice but to ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to rescind both of GM's ""Cruise"" and ""Super Cruise"" trademark registrations that should have never been registered in the first place"" Ford said. ""Any number of companies use the word 'cruise' in connection with driver assist technology.""

Among the examples Ford cited: ""Predictive Cruise"" marketed by Mack Trucks; ""Smart Cruise Control"" marketed by Hyundai Motor Co and Autocruise used by auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG.

GM said Friday that Super Cruise ""has had a well established commercial presence since 2017"" and added in a statement that the company ""remains committed to vigorously defending our brands and protecting the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market and that won't change.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ibG9nLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE0L2p1bmt5YXJkLWdlbS0yMDAxLWNoZXZyb2xldC12ZW50dXJlLXdhcm5lci1icm90aGVycy1lZGl0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Junkyard Gem: 2001 Chevrolet Venture Warner Brothers Edition,"During the late 1990s minivan manufacturers began installing airliner-style flip-down video displays in their vehicles theoretically allowing the grownups in the front seats to sedate the kids with video entertainment on long road trips. This idea now seems quaint in today's era of tablets and smartphones but this stuff was cutting-edge a couple of decades back. General Motors already doing business with Warner Brothers by putting Wile E. Coyote in a Pontiac Grand Prix decided to go ahead and offer a special Warner Brothers-branded Chevy Venture minivan for the 1999 model year. Sales of the WB Edition Venture continued through 2003 and I've managed to find one of these super-rare machines in a Denver-area self-service yard.

I spent years looking for one of these vans then found two in the course of a single week: today's '01 and an '02 a dozen miles to the north. When it rains Warner Brothers Ventures it pours.

Someone pried off the Bugs Bunny badges on this one but the badge shape is unmistakable.

Another indicator of the WB Edition Venture is the flip-down flat-screen with a special Bugs sticker. It's just 7"" diagonally but still fairly advanced for 2001.

Not so advanced for the time was the in-dash VHS videocassette player. The DVD format had been out for five years by 2001 and VHS was about as relevant at that time as 8-track tapes were in 1985 but WB Edition Venture buyers could choose between VHS and DVD. The original purchaser of this van opted for good old VHS.

You could plug in other sources of video including gaming consoles. Because the Venture came with four sets of wireless headphones for back-seaters the front-seat occupants could still listen to their music or just enjoy blissful silence as the kids carjacked drivers of Cartel Cruisers and Stallions in back. If you think the VHS rig and screen from this van would make for an excellent car-parts boombox we're on the same channel.

Just as was the case with the earlier Olds Silhouette and contemporary Pontiac Aztek Venture buyers could get a built-in air compressor for inflatable pool toys and basketballs.

The Warner Brothers Edition came with Looney Tunes tapes or discs kids' pajamas beach towels a 35mm film camera with photo album and membership in the VentureTainment Club (whatever that was).

I was well into high school when the first Detroit minivans appeared so I never experienced a serious minivan childhood (my family had a full-sized Chevy Sportvan Beauville with so much road noise that even the loudest kid sounds were drowned out before reaching the front-seaters). This rig must have been pretty good for long road trips back in 2001 though.

Even without the video screen the Venture enabled the addition of extra distance between adults and ankle-biters.

Stress? None at all (some suspension of disbelief required).

Rwandan President Paul Kagame noted in his inspiring speech “the Corporate Council on Africa has been the voice of private sector engagement between the United States and Africa for a quarter century.”

In addition to African Heads of States a host of African Ministers of Trade Energy Agriculture Investment Information Communications and Technology and Infrastructure from more than ten countries across the continent also participated in various Summit sessions.

Policy speeches delivered at the Summit also came from U.S. Cabinet officials – Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas Greenfield. They were joined by other senior officials in the new Biden-Harris Administration representing nearly a dozen U.S. government agencies that play a role in implementing U.S. policies and initiatives impacting the U.S. economic relationship with African nations.

GPN,Global Payments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGNvbXBsaWFuY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE1L3NvdXRoLWFmcmljYS1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLW9mLXBheW1lbnQtc2VydmljZXMtZm9yLWNhcmQtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zMDIwODIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Africa: Regulation of payment services for card transactions,"In brief

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has recently issued a directive concerning issuing and acquiring domestic card transactions. The Directive introduces regulations for all card issuers card acquirers and domestic merchants regarding card issuing acquiring and acceptance services for domestic card transactions. The Directive aims to ensure that the provision of domestic card payment services does not endanger the National Payment System  and for this reason the SARB requires domestic card issuers to be domestic clearing system participants and requires that domestic merchants use local card acquirers.

Who needs to comply with Directive 1 of 2020?

Directive 1 of 2020 (Directive for conduct within the national payment system in respect of domestic card transactions) made under the National Payment System Act 1998 (NPS Act) requires that all card issuing acquiring and acceptance services relating to a domestic card transaction must be performed in compliance with South African legislation Payment Clearing House agreements clearing and settlement rules. A ‘domestic card transaction’ is a transaction to effect payment withdraw cash or transfer funds using a domestic card within South Africa.

No foreign card issuer may issue a domestic card used for domestic card transactions unless it is a domestic clearing system participant. Domestic card means a card payment instrument that is issued to a cardholder by a card issuer to perform card transactions within South Africa although this card may be enabled to perform cross-border/international transactions.

Further the Directive prohibits the use of a foreign acquirer to acquire domestic card transactions or to provide acquiring services to domestic merchants.

All participants that issue and acquire domestic cards are required to comply with this Directive. Any infringement of this Directive is an offence in terms of section 12 of the NPS Act.

The directive aims to address transactions occurring within South Africa between domestic parties where such transactions are processed as if they were cross-border transactions as a result of the involvement of a foreign card issuer or card acquirer. When a foreign issuer or a foreign card acquirer is involved the processing of the payment is likely to take place outside of South Africa and would not be subject to South African payment system laws and regulations. Thus the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) wishes to ensure that transactions between domestic customers and domestic merchants are subject to supervision and regulation in South Africa.

Are there any requirements (outside the Directive) for international payments acquirers to localize and obtain local acquiring licenses to operate in this context?

There is currently no legislation requiring that international payment acquirers need to be licensed within this context.

Directive 1 of 2007 (Directive for Conduct within the National Payment System in respect of Payments to Third Persons) governs the facilitation of third-party payments where a service provider receives payments from third parties on behalf of a customer or makes payments on behalf of a customer to third parties. It seems this Directive does not include card acquiring because the acquirer processes the transaction but does not actually make and receive the payment. In addition it would not apply outside of South Africa to a foreign card acquirer.

From an exchange control perspective the Guidelines for Individuals issued by the Financial Surveillance Department of the SARB under the Currency and Exchanges Act 1933 state that “Individuals with locally issued credit and/or debit cards are permitted to make foreign currency payments for small transactions (e.g. imports over the Internet) utilizing such credit and/or debit cards.”

Are there specific criteria to comply with such localization requirements if any?

Currently there are no localization requirements under the payment system regulations. We expect that further changes to the payment system regulation may be introduced in the future by the SARB.

How does the Directive/these requirements impact card payments to international companies?

Some issuing banks charge a cross-border fee or an additional foreign exchange charge to customers.

The Directive prohibits South African merchants from using a foreign card acquirer to acquire domestic card transactions.

Currently there is no requirement for cross-border transactions with South African consumers to be processed within South Africa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlZm9ydW0ub3JnL2FnZW5kYS8yMDIxLzA4L2dlbmRlci1nYXAtcmlzay13b3JrLWpvYnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What risk and overconfidence can tell us about the gender pay gap,"New research looks at behavioural traits to understand some of the pay disparity between men and women.

The study showed that men were more willing to hold out for higher-paying first jobs after graduation.

Of alumni accepting an offer women on average accepted jobs almost a month earlier than men.

Gendered differences in men’s and women’s behavioral traits — namely risk preferences and overconfidence — generate differences in job search behavior and may explain as much as 25 percent of the difference between men’s and women’s earnings in their first jobs according to survey data on job search behavior analyzed by Patricia Cortés Jessica Pan Laura Pilossoph and Basit Zafar in Gender Differences in Job Search and the Earnings Gap: Evidence from Business Majors (NBER Working Paper 28820).

Gender gap in acceptances of job offers Image: NBER

The researchers surveyed alumni who graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Boston University’s Questrom School of Business from 2013 through 2019. About 1000 20 percent of those contacted responded. Men and women had similar employment outcomes but men self-reported greater willingness to take risks and generally were more optimistic about their future wages. Optimism makes graduates less likely to accept a job offer at any point in time. Risk-tolerant individuals are more likely to accept jobs later than risk-averse job seekers. Since more-optimistic and risk-tolerant individuals have higher reservation earnings this likely generates a positive relationship between risk tolerance (as well as optimism) and earnings and contributes to gender disparities in earnings.

Of those alumni accepting an offer women on average accepted jobs almost a month earlier than men. At graduation 60 percent of women had a job compared to 52 percent of men and 92 percent of women accepted jobs within six months of graduation compared to 86 percent of men. Women were also more likely to start searching for jobs earlier a factor that partially explains the gender gap in the timing of job acceptance. Both genders averaged about 1.7 offers per person and they were equally likely to have rejected at least one offer. Men were more likely to rely on referrals in their job search. Women were more likely to rely on the university career center.

In 2017 dollars women’s earnings in their first post-graduation year averaged $6719 less than men’s a difference of about 10 percent. Adjustment for individual-level differences in academic and socioeconomic backgrounds reduced this gap by almost 30 percent to $4542 or about 7.4 percent of mean earnings. Most of the individual-level adjustment was driven by men being more likely to choose finance and other higher-paying course concentrations. Women were more likely to select less lucrative concentrations like advertising and marketing. Inclusion of the survey measure of risk preferences further reduces the gender earnings gap to $3687 implying that gender differences in risk preferences can explain about 20 percent of the residual gender gap in accepted offers.

Students who expected to graduate between 2018 and 2021 completed an in-class survey asking “What would the lowest annual total compensation (including base pay signing bonus and bonus pay) have to be for you to accept a job offer?” After controlling for individual-level background variables the average lowest wage women would accept was about $2000 less than that for men. Students were also asked about expected earnings in their first job; about 54 percent overestimated their actual subsequent wage. Of the graduates 41 percent of women and 52 percent of men reported having regrets about their job search. Although men were slower to revise their earnings expectations downward if they did not receive job offers the researchers conclude that on average men benefited in terms of higher earnings relative to women from overestimating their future offers. However at the individual level a lot more men were worse off because of their greater overoptimism and experienced larger welfare losses from their biased beliefs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbWRhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4L2ZpbnRlY2gtcG9pc2VkLWNvbnNvbGlkYXRpb24tbWlkZGxlLWVhc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fintech is poised for consolidation in the Middle East,"Mahmoud Hamouda is a strategy and operations consultant at Dell Technologies. He is also the head of Dell for Entrepreneurs in Egypt. In his first oped for Wamda Hamouda examines the life cycle journey of the Middle East’s fintech industry and what lies next for the sector.

Every new industry goes through reinvention cycles that typically start with unfulfilled needs—startups and corporates turn to innovation to fill that gap increasing industry fragmentation. As the industry matures the need for efficiency and scale increases pushing the sector through consolidation.

In each stage in an industry's life cycle there are risks and rewards for investors. In the early stages the stakes are high. Still investors who pick the winners realise superior gains - as startups move through the stages and start consolidating - market consolidators such as private equity firms step in leveraging synergies and economies of scale with less risk to realise significant gains.

The fintech industry started attracting attention in 2014. Since then the industry has seen steady growth worldwide except in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) where regulatory compliance has been burdensome and e-commerce adoption was low. However the disruption caused by the Covid-19 crisis pushed all industries to transform and embrace the digital age. Fintech became a fundamental element for all businesses creating an excellent opportunity for startups in Mena to satisfy the unfulfilled demand in local markets.

Today startups in the Middle East are rushing to create innovations across fintech segments increasing the number of players in the market with no clear winner in sight. As the number of players increases the market becomes more fragmented and hence less concentrated.

It is typical for new industries to be fragmented and consolidate as they mature. Graeme K. Deans Fritz Kroeger and Stefan Zeisel came up with the concept of the consolidation curve which shows an industry's consolidation lifecycle.

According to the research they conducted almost a decade ago an industry moves along four stages of consolidation and on average it takes 25 years to progress through the four stages. They also predicted that in the future that cycle would move quicker.

In the first half of 2021 the fintech sector in Mena saw more than 50 deals and more than $300 million in funding accounting for 31 per cent of the total deals. These investments essentially decrease market concentration and increase market fragmentation. But not all fintech subsectors move at the same speed some are in front while others are behind.

The pandemic accelerated the demand for fintech services putting fintech funding in the Mena in the first half of 2021 at double the total funding in 2020. Deals also increased. The number of deals in the first half of 2021 exceeds all the deals in 2020. The result is a more expensive investment with the average value per deal more than doubling in 2021 compared to 2020.

The fundamental question then becomes will it take the fintech industry in Mena 25 years to go into consolidation mode?

To answer that question let us look at the payments sub-industry. Standard & Poor’s Global divides the fintech sector into nine subsectors. Payment processing is the most mature subsector in Mena’s fintech market today. More local players are getting into the market every day driving market concentration down and positioning the subsegment well into the opening stage.

But payment processing was one of the first fintech subsectors with several global vendors that captured a significant chunk of the worldwide payment processing industry. Some might argue that the processing industry might have started consolidation globally with Visa buying Plaid and Intuit buying Credit Karma globally fintech M&A is on the rise.

On the other hand the impact of the global players on the Mena market is limited primarily due to the lower contribution of international players in the local markets.

With valuations skyrocketing it is becoming very desirable for startups but less to investors pushing investors to look deeper for differentiation driving startups to run more efficiently and moving the payment processing sub-industry quicker through the stages toward consolidation.

The deal follows a historic four-year contract the women signed in 2017 in which they battled USA Hockey for equitable treatment and threatened to sit out the 2017 IIHF World Championships.

The players who are represented by the law firm Ballard Spahr once again had intense negotiations with USA Hockey over the past several months over a new deal sources told ESPN. Ultimately the sides agreed to a one-year contract to wait out the coronavirus pandemic and see what the economic picture looks like next summer. The deal which will also cover the women for the 2022 Olympics in Beijing expires on Aug. 31 2022.

According to sources the players felt motivated to sign a deal because they didn't want to miss any more hockey than they already have. When the world championships begin Friday in Calgary Alberta it will have been 859 days since the last major international tournament -- the 2019 world championships which were held in Finland.

According to documents obtained by ESPN players on the women's national team can earn up to $126750 over the next year should they win gold at both the 2021 world championships and the 2022 Beijing Olympics. If the team wins a silver medal at both events each player will receive $105500. That money is made up of stipends and bonuses paid out by both USA Hockey and the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee.

According to the documents each player on the national team will receive a $25500 training stipend from USA Hockey and a $8250 housing stipend from USA Hockey. The players also will receive a $28000 direct-athlete stipend from the USOPC.

The USOPC will also pay the players a $7500 bonus if they win gold at the world championships. USA Hockey doesn't give out a bonus for world championship results.

The USOPC will pay the players $37500 for an Olympic gold bonus while USA Hockey will pay the players $20000 should they win gold in Beijing.

It's been a challenging two years for the players on the women's national team; they have seen two world championships get canceled because of COVID-19 and had their coach Bob Corkum abruptly resign in April because of personal reasons. Joel Johnson formerly an assistant coach was promoted to lead the team for the 2021 world championships and the 2022 Olympics.

According to sources women's national team players gave 15% of their salaries back to USA Hockey for three months during the pandemic as a sign of good faith.

The new contract keeps the same numbers for per diem ($50 a day) and child care ($1000 per child per month).

The American women are looking to win their sixth straight gold medal at the world championships this year. The team has also won a medal in every Olympic Games since women's hockey was introduced in 1998.

However the U.S. has experienced some turnover since its last major international l tournament. Several stalwarts from the 2018 Olympic gold-medal-winning team have retired in the past year: captain Meghan Duggan defenseman Kacey Bellamy and twins Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson (who scored the game-winning goal in the gold-medal game) and Monique Lamoureux-Morando (game-tying goal in the gold-medal game).

In the new contract the players made some concessions: They will no longer receive game incentives during their Olympic tour. However some perks were added in the new deal. The players will be provided a meal after training during their residency leading up to the Olympics something that was not provided for previously. USA Hockey also made staffing improvements including giving the director of women's national team programs Katie Million an assistant and adding to the medical staff.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2Jsb2NrY2hhaW4vYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1pcy1iZWluZy11c2VkLWluLXZhcmlvdXMtc2VjdG9ycy1vZi1vdXItbGlmZdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FtcC9zdG9yeS9ibG9ja2NoYWluL2Jsb2NrY2hhaW4taXMtYmVpbmctdXNlZC1pbi12YXJpb3VzLXNlY3RvcnMtb2Ytb3VyLWxpZmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blockchain is Being Used in Various Sectors of Our Life,A blockchain is a digital database often known as a ledger that is used to collaboratively record information and transactions.

ARLINGTON Texas — Saturday night was a night that many Texas Rangers fans can treasure forever.

No it's not because of what the team did on the field. The Rangers gave up five home runs and lost by a score of 8-3 to the Oakland Athletics.

No over 31000 fans showed up to Globe Life Field tonight to witness the induction of Chuck Morgan and Adrián Beltré into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame.

The ceremony began an hour and 20 minutes before the scheduled first pitch. Morgan and Beltré were joined by members of their families along with several members of the Rangers Hall of Fame including Richard Greene Tom Grieve Toby Harrah Ferguson Jenkins Eric Nadel Iván 'Pudge' Rodríguez Jeff Russell Tom Schieffer Jim Sundberg and Michael Young.

Morgan was inducted by Texas Rangers executive vice president and chief financial officer Kellie Fischer while Beltré was inducted by his Rangers teammate of two seasons Michael Young.

Before either one gave their acceptance speeches they sat through tribute videos and many congratulations from several names of significance including Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott former Rangers greats Will Clark and Nolan Ryan actor Matthew McConaughey and Dallas Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki.

The only unexpected absence was former Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus. He had to leave for Oakland after Friday night's game between the Rangers and A's for the birth of his third child. Beltré spoke at length about his relationship with Andrus when he met with the media earlier this week. And before Elvis flew back to Oakland he took some time to return the favor.

Neither Morgan or Beltré prefer the spotlight and it goes to show the true content of their character. Chuck Morgan has spent 38 of the past 39 years as the public address announcer in three Rangers ballparks never taking a game off. He announced his 3000th consecutive game in September last year. He also puts his heart and soul into every single game with the intention that fans have the ultimate ballpark experience.

It was only natural for him to spend a large portion of his speech on others and especially thanking the fans.

""We grow up with baseball. We grow old with it"" Morgan said. ""I see and hear that every night up in my new PA booth. It's the best part of my work day — visiting with Ranger fans in my booth before and after games. Moms and Dads bring their kids by telling me about when they were kids and they saw Clemens against Ryan on a perfect Sunday afternoon at Arlington Stadium. Or at The Ballpark they saw a rookie strike out a Yankees slugger for the Rangers first pennant.

""But my all-time favorite thing is how y'all responded to me. When I would say 'No. 22 Steve Buechele. Or No. 17 Nelson Cruz. Or No. 17 Shin-Soo Choo.' Ladies and gentlemen each time you did that thank you for giving me the highest compliment you could give a guy like me. And thanks for making me feel at home in Texas.""

Beltré came to Texas seeking a World Series ring. While the team was unable to achieve that goal the bond between Beltré and the fan base grew as the five-time Gold Glove winner elevated his stance in baseball grandeur.

Beltré was praised throughout his playing career for being an elite competitor and a consummate professional. But he also put others before himself. He fought through injuries in key situations. And he turned himself into a first ballot Hall of Famer while donning a Rangers uniform.

""First of all what an honor to be inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. This is unreal"" Beltré said. ""I want to thank you fans for the support over the years always being there for our team and knowing we always wanted to give you the best show we can. For that I will always be grateful.""

You would be hard pressed to find a duo that exemplifies Rangers baseball better than Chuck Morgan or Adrián Beltré. They made their careers by constantly putting others before themselves. And now they're enshrined forever because of it.

But now I admit we can learn a lot from our dogs,"Drew Snider is a writer pastor and recovering broadcaster living in Victoria.

I must confess I’ve been a cat man all my life. Ever since a little basket arrived for my fourth birthday party containing a Siamese kitten I’ve been hooked on cats. There was a cartoon many years ago in which a man is covered with cats and explains to a friend “One day someone handed me a cat – just a small one – and I tried it. It was nice – quite pleasant really – so I had another and another ...”

That could have been me.

My wife and I had five cats at one time in our two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver’s West End. When two of them died of old age she started talking about getting a dog. One day we were visiting friends on Vancouver Island who had a border terrier. Amelia remarked “Jessie is such a nice dog and great with kids and the cat. Maybe we should consider a border terrier.”

Before I could say anything our friends said “Well one of our neighbors is a breeder and she’s just had a litter.”

Over my protestations we went to the breeder’s place “just to have a look.” After coffee home-made strudel and a third-degree interrogation to see if we were suitable four puppies were released to meet us. One ran straight to me and started chewing on my shoe. I picked her up and she burrowed into my neck practically ignoring Amelia: Even at that tender age she knew whom she had to work on. Twenty-four hours later we were the proud owners of Millicent K. PupDog.

The American humourist Robert Benchley once wrote that “a dog teaches a boy fidelity perseverance and to turn around three times before lying down.” Millie has taught me about fidelity and unconditional love and I had never before experienced a situation where an animal would step up to protect and care for me. She saw me crash on my bicycle one summer and was absolutely frantic. While Amelia and a kind passerby reset the chain and checked out the bike Millie spent her time licking my road rash. Sometimes if another dog (especially one bigger than she is) comes a little too close to me for Millie’s comfort she will take a “repel boarders” stance positioning herself at my feet and darting out to chase the other dog away.

But the biggest lesson Millie has been teaching me has been a refresher course in play. She loves to run: Seeing her race around the field at the dog-park hair flowing in the breeze reminds me of helmet-less Guy Lafleur speeding down the ice. But if she races other dogs that are slower than she is she’ll drop to three-quarters or half-speed looking over her shoulder as she runs. She’d rather canter than out-run another dog all for the sake of play.

It’s the same thing when she and I play. When I throw a ball she’ll chase it grab it and run back with it -- but not give it back. I have to chase her and try to get it away from her. She knows I’m not as fast as she is so rather than out-run me she’ll bounce sideways while I do the “basketball shuffle” to try to corral her. Indoors she has a variety of toys (one day some of our dog-park friends came over with their dogs for tea and Millie gradually brought out every one of her toys for the dogs to play with) and when she wants to play with me she’ll bring one over and dare me to take it away.

The ensuing tug-o-war could go on for hours – although it ends when my arm gets tired. But I keep wondering what is the purpose? She knows the stuffed teddy bear isn’t an actual animal. What is so important about a piece of knotted rope that it becomes a life-or-death struggle to keep me from having it? To what end is all this?

For Millie play is an end in itself. There is no competition no desire to win. She and another “dog friend” would spend all their time wrestling -- not to harm each other but because it’s fun to grapple. When she runs with other speed merchants you can’t tell who’s chasing whom.

About a decade ago ParticipACTION launched a campaign called “Bring Back Play.” Canadian Tire tells us “We All Play For Canada.” Play for the sake of play is something humans seem to lose sight of and at an earlier age than we used to. Little League ballplayers and peewee hockey players are looked at as potential major-league material and the resulting favouritism and competitiveness is probably a big factor in driving less “gifted” kids away from play before their time.

But dogs don’t compete. Dogs don’t keep score. Dogs don’t trash-talk one another. Dogs play.

We can learn a lot from our dogs.

In front of a crowd of nearly 25000 at Globe Life Field they beat their division rival Oakland Athletics. The final score was 7-4. With this win the Rangers took two out of three from Oakland over this particularly hot weekend in Arlington. With their record currently sitting at 42-76 the Rangers will take any sort of consolation prize at this point. Hopefully this win will provide some momentum in their series against the Seattle Mariners next week. Here is a recap of Sunday’s matinee.

Early Scoring

The Rangers got things started right away in the top of the first inning. Yonny Hernandez scored on an Isiah Kiner-Falefa double to centerfield. This put them ahead 1-0. Two batters later DJ Peters drove in Kiner-Falefa with his second home run of the season. That made it 3-0. Fans were getting excited at this point. In the top of the second Athletics’ third baseman Matt Chapman homered off Rangers’ starter Kolby Allard making it 3-1. However the Rangers answered right back in the bottom of the second. Charlie Culberson crossed home on a double by Hernandez.

Homer Happy

The Rangers scored their next two runs in the bottom of the third inning. This happened when Adolis Garcia hit his 26th home run of the year. The score would stay 6-1 until the bottom of the fifth. DJ Peters homered again to give the Rangers a six-run lead. Then in the top of the sixth Oakland responded in kind. Mark Canha hit his twelfth round-tripper of the year cutting the lead to five runs. The Athletics’ next run came on a Tony Kemp single in the top of the seventh. That brought in Chapman. Then in the top of the eighth Sean Murphy doubled bringing in Matt Olson.

Quality Start Streak

Rangers lefty Kolby Allard pitched well on Sunday. He gave up three earned runs on seven hits. Two of those hits were home runs. He struck out two and didn’t allow any walks. In fact Sunday marked Allard’s third consecutive quality start in which he hasn’t allowed a walk. That doesn’t happen often. He got the win bringing his record to 3-10. Joe Barlow got the save his second on the year. Sean Manaea took the loss for Oakland. His record is now 8-6.

The four-time All-Star and five-time Gold Glove-winning third baseman who retired in 2018 after 21 big league seasons was inducted into the Texas Rangers Baseball Hall of Fame on Saturday night when Rangers fans got to hear from Beltre.

While not speaking long Beltre spoke from the heart without a prepared script. With AJ (Adrian Jr) and his family on the field with him Beltre thanked countless people by name after an impressive highlight reel of big hits and standout defensive plays.

Beltre and Chuck Morgan in his 38th season as the public address announcer for the Rangers spanning three different stadiums were the 23rd and 24th inductees in the team’s Hall of Fame since the first class in 2003.

Morgan went from the pregame ceremony directly back to the PA booth and worked his 3059th consecutive regular season game.

The night was almost certainly a precursor for Beltre and a spot in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His first time on the ballot for Cooperstown will be for the Class of 2024.

Beltre went to his only World Series in 2011 his first season in Texas and joined MLB's 3000-hit club in a Rangers home game in 2017. His 3166 career hits are 17th in baseball history while he hitting .286 with 477 home runs. His 2759 games at third base are second only to Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson.

Texas retired Beltre’s No. 29 jersey two years ago in its last season at Globe Life Park. The Rangers' first hall induction in two-year-old Globe Life Field the stadium across the street with a retractable roof came before a game against Oakland.

Elvis Andrus now with the A's after the past 12 seasons as the Rangers starting shortstop that included Beltre's entire time in Texas missed the ceremony. Andrus left after the series opener Friday night to be with his wife for the birth of their third child but recorded a video message for Beltre.

The 42-year-old Beltre's time is now centered around his family in California: wife Sandra AJ (who turns 15 next month) and their two daughters (ages 10 and 17). His big league career began at age 19 in Los Angeles playing 6 1/2 seasons with the Dodgers then five years in Seattle and one in Boston.

AJ was 4 when his father signed in free agency with the Rangers and had his own locker in the clubhouse. He spent many hours in the outfield hitting balls thrown by his father or taking grounders — they were doing just that in the empty stadium on the morning of his final home game with the Rangers on Sept. 23 2018. Now Beltre is a fulltime baseball dad and still figuring out how much instructive detail to share with AJ at certain times — and didn't try to tweak the kid's swing until maybe two years ago.

“I've always pitched to him but I always wanted him to get his own identity because he learns a lot he watches a lot” Beltre said. “I’m learning how to being a coach giving information to fix stuff that he needs to fix and being a dad supportive of not being too hard on him because he’s hard enough on himself.”

Morgan was a country music disc jockey in Nashville before joining the Rangers for the 1983 season opener at old Arlington Stadium. He hasn't missed a game since including the 2002 season he spent with the Kansas City Royals.

A half-hour before riding onto the field in the back of a pickup truck Saturday night accompanied by four of his grandsons Morgan was introducing the starting lineups.

Among those wishing Morgan congratulations in a video were Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan and “Wheel of Fortune” host Pat Sajak. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott and former Dallas Mavericks great Dirk Nowitzki each had their own take of Morgan's signature line “It's Baseball Time In Texas!”

The microphone from Morgan's 3000th consecutive game last September was sent to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Morgan had described it as a big ""Oh Wow!"" to go into the Rangers hall with a player expected to be in Cooperstown.

“He’s everything that baseball is all about. A great player great hitter great fielder had a good time when he was playing"" Morgan said.

When catcher Ivan “Pudge” Rodriguez was inducted into Cooperstown on May 30 2017 Morgan was instead in the booth for a Rangers home game — the day Beltre got his 3000th career hit.

“I had told everybody that that was going to happen on the day that Pudge was going into the Hall of Fame and I was going to stay behind and make sure that happened” Morgan said. “ It was a great moment.”

GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE0L2hvdy1jb21wYW5pZXMtZXhwbG9pdC13b2tlLXZhbHVlcy10by1wdXJzdWUtcHJvZml0LWFuZC1wb3dlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Goldman Sachs exploits 'woke values' to pursue its own profit and power,"In my favorite episode of “South Park” two sleazy salesmen sell shoddy condos in the glitzy ski town of “Asspen” to the lower middle-class residents of South Park. Their pitch is intoxicatingly simple: “Try saying it. ‘I’ve got a nice little place in Asspen.’ Rolls off the tongue nicely doesn’t it?” Eventually the residents open up their checkbooks and buy the scam.

This is exactly what happened when recruiters from Goldman Sachs showed up at Harvard in 2006. As a 20-year-old I fell for the trick: I joined Goldman that summer as an intern. By July I had learned many of the firm’s unspoken traditions like how instead of wearing Rolexes the managing directors sported cheap digital watches with black rubber wrist straps prominently juxtaposed against their expensive tailor-made dress shirts.

The hallmark event at Goldman that summer wasn’t a poker tournament on a lavish boat cruise followed by a debauched night of clubbing as it had been at Amaranth the more edgy firm where I’d worked the prior year. Rather it was “service day” — a day that involved dressing up in a T-shirt and shorts and then serving the community. Back in 2006 that involved planting trees in a garden in Harlem. The co-head of my group was supposed to lead the way.

When we showed up at the park in Harlem very few of my colleagues seemed interested in . . . well planting trees. The full-time analysts shared office gossip with the interns. The vice presidents one-upped each other with war stories about investment deals. And the head of the group was nowhere to be found.

After an hour I noticed that very little service had actually been performed. As if on cue the co-head of the group showed up an hour late —wearing a slim-fit suit and a pair of Gucci boots . . . and of course a cheap digital watch. The chatter amongst the rest of the team died down as we awaited what he had to say.

7 Vivek Ramaswamy was attending Harvard when he was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 2006.

“All right guys” he said somberly as though he were going to discipline the team. A moment of tension hung in the air. And then he broke the ice: “Let’s take some pictures and get out of here!” The entire group burst into laughter. Within minutes we had vacated the premises. No trees had been planted. Soon the entire group was seated comfortably at a nearby bar — pitchers of beer ready on the tables and all.

I turned to one of the younger associates sitting next to me. I quipped that if we wanted to have a “social day” then we should’ve just called it that instead of “service day.”

He laughed and demurred: “Look just do what the boss says.” Then he quipped back: “You ever heard of the Golden Rule?”

“Treat others like you want to be treated?” I asked.

“Wrong” he said. “He who has the gold makes the rules.”

They want to make sure any IPO they bring to market has a brown or black person on the board but are okay with ripping off millions of Malaysians by engineering a slush fund for an oil tycoon’s private jet. A critic blasting Goldman Sachs’ double standards quoted in “Woke Inc.”

I called it “the Goldman Rule.” I learned something valuable that summer after all.

Over a decade later the Goldman Rule had only grown in importance. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last year Goldman CEO David Solomon declared that it would refuse to take companies public unless they had at least one “diverse” member on their board.

Put the “diversity” debate to one side: The bigger problem is that Goldman’s edict wasn’t about diversity at all. It was about corporate opportunism: seizing an already popular social value and prominently emblazoning it with the Goldman Sachs logo. It was like planting trees in Harlem all over again.

The timing of Goldman’s announcement was revealing. In the prior year approximately half the open board seats at S&P 500 companies went to women. In July 2019 the last remaining all-male board in the S&P 500 appointed a woman. In other words every single company in the S&P 500 was already abiding by Goldman’s diversity standard long before Goldman issued its own proclamation. Goldman’s announcement was an ideal way to attract praise without taking any real risk: another great risk-adjusted return for Goldman Sachs.

Goldman’s timing was also impeccable in another way. Its diversity quota proclamation stole the headlines from a much less flattering event: Goldman had just agreed to pay $5 billion in fines to governments around the world for its role in a scheme stealing billions from the Malaysian people. Goldman reportedly turned a willfully blind eye as corrupt Malaysian officials immediately turned the fund into their own private piggy bank. Ironically some of that money literally ended up funding Martin Scorsese’s 2013 movie “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

As one Redditor on the now-infamous forum WallStreetBets observed “They want to make sure that any IPO they bring to market has a brown or black person on the board of the company they are IPOing but are perfectly okay with ripping off millions of Malaysians by engineering a slush fund for an oil tycoon’s jewelry collection and private jet.” Well yes. Welcome to the woke-industrial complex.

Woke capitalism is really just crony capitalism 2.0. Here’s how it works: Big business uses progressive-friendly values to deflect attention from their own monolithic pursuit of profit and power.

Crony capitalism 1.0 was simple by comparison: Banks simply had to make campaign contributions and hire lobbyists. In return they get favorable regulations that codify their status as gatekeepers who enjoy oligopoly status in taking companies public. Championship-level players of this game like Goldman Sachs often top it off with a flourish by lending their executives to serve as US treasury secretaries — Steve Mnuchin under President Donald Trump Hank Paulson under President George W. Bush and so on. And it pays off in the end: Winners like Goldman Sachs get bailouts in tough times like 2008 while less adroit competitors like Lehman Brothers get hung out to dry by the likes of Hank Paulson. That much is straightforward.

7 Woke Inc will be published on Tuesday.

But crony capitalism 2.0 is far trickier. Goldman’s diversity edict at Davos last year came at a time when Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren two of the biggest critics of the US government’s 2008 bailout of Goldman Sachs were presidential front-runners. Having supplicated to business-friendly Republicans and centrist Democrats for decades the moment had arrived for Goldman Sachs to begin placating the identity-politics-obsessed Far Left just as that wing of the Democratic Party had begun to accrue greater political power. Their new CEO is woker than woke and he’s a DJ on the side too. That’s how the 2020 edition of crony capitalism looks: Hank Paulson is outmoded by comparison.

Once the American public becomes “woke” to this new trend of self-interest masquerading as morality our citizenry can see through the charade of corporate virtue-signaling. When Amazon issues a public challenge to Walmart to pay workers $15 per hour we can simply chuckle to ourselves that Jeff Bezos is just doing what he does best: undermining his competitors when they’re most vulnerable.

Most importantly we can return the power to implement our social values back to American democracy where it belongs rather than to corporate chieftains who use it to make an extra buck. As a society we should allow and even embrace the corporate pursuit of financial self-interest above all. The only thing we should ask in return is this: Keep it naked instead of dressing it up as altruism. America might just be better off in the end if Goldman Sachs executives wear their Rolexes to work instead of preaching about diversity and pretending to plant trees.

Here are a few ways GPT-3 can go wrong

Advocates of algorithmic justice have begun to see their proverbial “days in court” with legal investigations of enterprises like UHG and Apple Card. The Apple Card case is a strong example of how current anti-discrimination laws fall short of the fast pace of scientific research in the emerging field of quantifiable fairness.

While it may be true that Apple and their underwriters were found innocent of fair lending violations the ruling came with clear caveats that should be a warning sign to enterprises using machine learning within any regulated space. Unless executives begin to take algorithmic fairness more seriously their days ahead will be full of legal challenges and reputational damage.

What happened with Apple Card?

In late 2019 startup leader and social media celebrity David Heinemeier Hansson raised an important issue on Twitter to much fanfare and applause. With almost 50000 likes and retweets he asked Apple and their underwriting partner Goldman Sachs to explain why he and his wife who share the same financial ability would be granted different credit limits. To many in the field of algorithmic fairness it was a watershed moment to see the issues we advocate go mainstream culminating in an inquiry from the NY Department of Financial Services (DFS).

At first glance it may seem heartening to credit underwriters that the DFS concluded in March that Goldman’s underwriting algorithm did not violate the strict rules of financial access created in 1974 to protect women and minorities from lending discrimination. While disappointing to activists this result was not surprising to those of us working closely with data teams in finance.

There are some algorithmic applications for financial institutions where the risks of experimentation far outweigh any benefit and credit underwriting is one of them. We could have predicted that Goldman would be found innocent because the laws for fairness in lending (if outdated) are clear and strictly enforced.

And yet there is no doubt in my mind that the Goldman/Apple algorithm discriminates along with every other credit scoring and underwriting algorithm on the market today. Nor do I doubt that these algorithms would fall apart if researchers were ever granted access to the models and data we would need to validate this claim. I know this because the NY DFS partially released its methodology for vetting the Goldman algorithm and as you might expect their audit fell far short of the standards held by modern algorithm auditors today.

How did DFS (under current law) assess the fairness of Apple Card?

In order to prove the Apple algorithm was “fair” DFS considered first whether Goldman had used “prohibited characteristics” of potential applicants like gender or marital status. This one was easy for Goldman to pass — they don’t include race gender or marital status as an input to the model. However we’ve known for years now that some model features can act as “proxies” for protected classes.

The DFS methodology based on 50 years of legal precedent failed to mention whether they considered this question but we can guess that they did not. Because if they had they’d have quickly found that credit score is so tightly correlated to race that some states are considering banning its use for casualty insurance. Proxy features have only stepped into the research spotlight recently giving us our first example of how science has outpaced regulation.

In the absence of protected features DFS then looked for credit profiles that were similar in content but belonged to people of different protected classes. In a certain imprecise sense they sought to find out what would happen to the credit decision were we to “flip” the gender on the application. Would a female version of the male applicant receive the same treatment?

Intuitively this seems like one way to define “fair.” And it is — in the field of machine learning fairness there is a concept called a “flip test” and it is one of many measures of a concept called “individual fairness” which is exactly what it sounds like. I asked Patrick Hall principal scientist at bnh.ai a leading boutique AI law firm about the analysis most common in investigating fair lending cases. Referring to the methods DFS used to audit Apple Card he called it basic regression or “a 1970s version of the flip test” bringing us example number two of our insufficient laws.

A new vocabulary for algorithmic fairness

Ever since Solon Barocas’ seminal paper “Big Data’s Disparate Impact” in 2016 researchers have been hard at work to define core philosophical concepts into mathematical terms. Several conferences have sprung into existence with new fairness tracks emerging at the most notable AI events. The field is in a period of hypergrowth where the law has as of yet failed to keep pace. But just like what happened to the cybersecurity industry this legal reprieve won’t last forever.

Perhaps we can forgive DFS for its softball audit given that the laws governing fair lending are born of the civil rights movement and have not evolved much in the 50-plus years since inception. The legal precedents were set long before machine learning fairness research really took off. If DFS had been appropriately equipped to deal with the challenge of evaluating the fairness of the Apple Card they would have used the robust vocabulary for algorithmic assessment that’s blossomed over the last five years.

The DFS report for instance makes no mention of measuring “equalized odds” a notorious line of inquiry first made famous in 2018 by Joy Buolamwini Timnit Gebru and Deb Raji. Their “Gender Shades” paper proved that facial recognition algorithms guess wrong on dark female faces more often than they do on subjects with lighter skin and this reasoning holds true for many applications of prediction beyond computer vision alone.

Equalized odds would ask of Apple’s algorithm: Just how often does it predict creditworthiness correctly? How often does it guess wrong? Are there disparities in these error rates among people of different genders races or disability status? According to Hall these measurements are important but simply too new to have been fully codified into the legal system.

If it turns out that Goldman regularly underestimates female applicants in the real world or assigns interest rates that are higher than Black applicants truly deserve it’s easy to see how this would harm these underserved populations at national scale.

Financial services’ Catch-22

Modern auditors know that the methods dictated by legal precedent fail to catch nuances in fairness for intersectional combinations within minority categories — a problem that’s exacerbated by the complexity of machine learning models. If you’re Black a woman and pregnant for instance your likelihood of obtaining credit may be lower than the average of the outcomes among each overarching protected category.

These underrepresented groups may never benefit from a holistic audit of the system without special attention paid to their uniqueness given that the sample size of minorities is by definition a smaller number in the set. This is why modern auditors prefer “fairness through awareness” approaches that allow us to measure results with explicit knowledge of the demographics of the individuals in each group.

But there’s a Catch-22. In financial services and other highly regulated fields auditors often can’t use “fairness through awareness” because they may be prevented from collecting sensitive information from the start. The goal of this legal constraint was to prevent lenders from discrimination. In a cruel twist of fate this gives cover to algorithmic discrimination giving us our third example of legal insufficiency.

The fact that we can’t collect this information hamstrings our ability to find out how models treat underserved groups. Without it we might never prove what we know to be true in practice — full-time moms for instance will reliably have thinner credit files because they don’t execute every credit-based purchase under both spousal names. Minority groups may be far more likely to be gig workers tipped employees or participate in cash-based industries leading to commonalities among their income profiles that prove less common for the majority.

Importantly these differences on the applicants’ credit files do not necessarily translate to true financial responsibility or creditworthiness. If it’s your goal to predict creditworthiness accurately you’d want to know where the method (e.g. a credit score) breaks down.

What this means for businesses using AI

In Apple’s example it’s worth mentioning a hopeful epilogue to the story where Apple made a consequential update to their credit policy to combat the discrimination that is protected by our antiquated laws. In Apple CEO Tim Cook’s announcement he was quick to highlight a “lack of fairness in the way the industry [calculates] credit scores.”

Their new policy allows spouses or parents to combine credit files such that the weaker credit file can benefit from the stronger. It’s a great example of a company thinking ahead to steps that may actually reduce the discrimination that exists structurally in our world. In updating their policies Apple got ahead of the regulation that may come as a result of this inquiry.

This is a strategic advantage for Apple because NY DFS made exhaustive mention of the insufficiency of current laws governing this space meaning updates to regulation may be nearer than many think. To quote Superintendent of Financial Services Linda A. Lacewell: “The use of credit scoring in its current form and laws and regulations barring discrimination in lending are in need of strengthening and modernization.” In my own experience working with regulators this is something today’s authorities are very keen to explore.

I have no doubt that American regulators are working to improve the laws that govern AI taking advantage of this robust vocabulary for equality in automation and math. The Federal Reserve OCC CFPB FTC and Congress are all eager to address algorithmic discrimination even if their pace is slow.

In the meantime we have every reason to believe that algorithmic discrimination is rampant largely because the industry has also been slow to adopt the language of academia that the last few years have brought. Little excuse remains for enterprises failing to take advantage of this new field of fairness and to root out the predictive discrimination that is in some ways guaranteed. And the EU agrees with draft laws that apply specifically to AI that are set to be adopted some time in the next two years.

The field of machine learning fairness has matured quickly with new techniques discovered every year and myriad tools to help. The field is only now reaching a point where this can be prescribed with some degree of automation. Standards bodies have stepped in to provide guidance to lower the frequency and severity of these issues even if American law is slow to adopt.

Because whether discrimination by algorithm is intentional it is illegal. So anyone using advanced analytics for applications relating to healthcare housing hiring financial services education or government are likely breaking these laws without knowing it.

Until clearer regulatory guidance becomes available for the myriad applications of AI in sensitive situations the industry is on its own to figure out which definitions of fairness are best.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFua2luZy1hbmQtZmluYW5jZS9nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLXNldC10by1zY29yZS1mcm9tLXNwYWluLXMtZm9vdGJhbGwtd29lcy0yMDIxMDgxMy1wNThpZDcuaHRtbNIBfmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFua2luZy1hbmQtZmluYW5jZS9nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLXNldC10by1zY29yZS1mcm9tLXNwYWluLXMtZm9vdGJhbGwtd29lcy0yMDIxMDgxMy1wNThpZDcuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs set to score from Spain’s football woes,"With Spain’s top soccer clubs battling to raise much-needed new financing one clear winner is already emerging: Goldman Sachs.

Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs split over future course of Korean chipmakers



By Park Jae-hyuk



Last week two of the top U.S.-based investment banks ― Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs ― published reports showing rather contrasting views for the global semiconductor industry.



Titled ""Memory ― Winter is Coming"" Morgan Stanley cut its target on Samsung Electronics ordinary shares (ORDs) to 89000 won ($76) from 98000 won as the report warned of a rather tough chip-pricing environment heading into next year.



Despite Samsung Electronics' repeated confidence over the continued tight supply of memory chips the Morgan Stanley report directly hit investor sentiment as ORDs at Samsung and SK hynix plummeted. It hugely cut its target on SK hynix to 80000 won from 156000 won.



Morgan Stanley's abrupt skepticism contradicted its previous week's report that recommended investors stay ""overweight"" leading foreign investors to massively unload their holdings in the world's top two memory chipmakers throughout last week.



But unlike Morgan Stanley's stance which triggered massive unloading of the world's No. 3 memory chipmaker ― Micron Technology ― Goldman Sachs maintained its optimistic targets on Samsung Electronics at 107000 won and SK hynix at 177000 won with expectations of a limited decline in global DRAM prices next year.



Their contrasting reports harken back to similar events in 2017.



Industry experts said Sunday that the reports reflect a similar situation four years ago.



In November 2017 Morgan Stanley lowered its target on Samsung Electronics ORDs claiming prices for NAND-type flash memory chips would go down and the electronics company would not see gains the following year. After the report Samsung Electronics shares fell 5 percent in a single trading day knocking off 18 trillion won in market capitalization.



At the time Goldman Sachs analyst Daiki Takayama refuted Morgan Stanley's view.



""Excessive concerns over the cycle of memory chips in the semiconductor industry were affecting the stock price"" he said in a report. ""We see the current price as an attractive opportunity to buy shares. We have found no factors to make a change in our positive recommendation on Samsung Electronics.""



In 2018 both Samsung Electronics and SK hynix posted record-high earnings as Goldman Sachs expected.



Industry experts also regard the recent concern as inaccurate given that the Korean chipmakers have already signed large-scale contracts to supply memory chips to their clients until the end of the year. This means the long-term fixed prices of DRAMs will remain stable for a while.



""Samsung Electronics SK hynix Micron and other major memory producers have limited inventories and production bottlenecks are deepening"" Yuanta Securities analyst Lee Jae-yun said in a report. ""The chances are slim for memory chip prices to drop sharply.""



While increased chip price volatility has been cited as one variable factor inventory levels for Samsung and SK remain tight said company officials. Plus demand for premium chips for use in corporate servers and high-end mobile devices will rise until next year offsetting the effects of the decline in conventional PC DRAM chips.

Among Schafer's most extraordinary initiatives was his Wolf Project an annual ""participants-only collaborative experiential week of chant music theatre and camping in the wilderness of Haliburton Forest.""

Composer Jennifer Butler has been a participant in Schafer's Wolf Project since 2000. CBC Music reached out to her to reflect on that experience in particular and Schafer's legacy in general.

Written by Jennifer Butler

I feel so indebted to Murray Schafer. His music and ideas have profoundly inspired me since the first time I encountered them as a young composer but it's the almost 20 years I have spent as a part of his Wolf Project community for which I feel most grateful.

The Wolf Project or And Wolf Shall Inherit the Moon as it is formally titled is the epilogue to Schafer's immense cycle of 12 theatrical works called Patria. Each August anywhere from 40 to 70 participants gather in Haliburton Forest and Wildlife Reserve on the edge of Ontario's famous Algonquin Park for an immersive week of theatre and music ritual and silence togetherness and isolation. This project began more than 30 years ago and since that time more than 200 people have participated in it.

Poets dancers musicians storytellers composers and many others all add their expertise to the experience. However we are all encouraged to step out of our comfort zone too. - Jennifer Butler

There is no audience except ourselves. Schafer felt that ""something profoundly unhealthy had happened to art during our time"" and the Wolf Project began as his attempt to do something radically different. ""First exaltation"" he writes ""Let us speak of that. The change that occurs when we are lifted out of the tight little cages of our daily realities. To be hurled beyond our limits into the cosmos of magnificent forces.""

The Halliburton Forest is a rich wilderness home to loons deer moose beavers bats wolves owls coyotes and black bears. We camp in tents and returning to this wild place year after year with a slowly evolving group of humans has allowed for the creation of a unique set of rituals and stories that are directly attached to the land.

Schafer's script is centred around the complex mythology developed throughout Patria and focuses on reuniting the main characters of And Wolf Shall Inherit the Moon and The Princess of the Stars. Over the decades Schafer has invited many creative voices to add to the script calling it a ""co-opera."" During the week participants are encouraged to bring their own contributions to the forest encounters and to the nightly campfires. Poets dancers musicians storytellers composers and many others all add their expertise to the experience. However we are all encouraged to step out of our comfort zone too. Everyone sings even if they don't know the notes. Composers become poets teachers become actors poets become camp directors and clarinetists collect drinking water from a canoe in the middle of the lake.

Nature and the natural soundscape was incredibly important to Murray. Throughout the week despite a busy schedule of rehearsals and camp duties we collectively gather and pause every day to acknowledge both the sunrise and sunset. In this setting nature often has the final say in how events will unravel. Over the years we have performed the two-hour long operatic finale to the project in pouring rain under blue skies with light drizzle in strong winds under cloudy skies and enveloped in punishing heat. One year there was even the threat of tornados in the forecast but we voted to go on with the show.

And in the end we are changed. As we pack up our tents and bring down our tarps as we load the canoes again and begin our journey homeward we feel the hold that this place and this experience has on us and saying goodbye is difficult.

Murray continued to attend Wolf week well into his 70s but at some point was only able to come for the final day of performances and celebration. Eventually his health prevented him from making the canoe journey across Wildcat Lake at all but he still welcomed us at base camp. This is where I last saw him in the summer of 2016. His memory was noticeably diminished yet when a group of us began to sing a favourite chant he joined in and led us with all of his usual vigour and command.

Thinking of Murray today my mind returns to the final night of the Wolf Project. On this night we gather for a special campfire filled with humour and parody. Many skits feature ""the man in the purple pants"" as Murray is affectionately called because of his brightly coloured rain pants or ""Murky Schemer"" another nickname given to us by AutoCorrect. Some of these performances are the best of the week and I will always remember the deep vitality in Murray's laughter when he appeared at the centre of a joke.

Gradually the energy of the campfire dies down and we move to the edge of a high cliff overlooking the lake. Out of the silence we hear the first undulating tones of the Princess's aria for soprano voice. She is singing from a canoe on the water. Her voice echoes majestically off the surrounding hills. The music is at once intimate and distant. As the canoe is slowly paddled to the far shores of the lake we become very still straining to listen. The echoes are now louder than her voice. In the end we cannot tell when the piece is over because the music remains in our ears long after it has stopped.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This $50 ...,"In the 1990s the Martin Luther King Apartments in Hartford’s Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood blended into the area’s deteriorating bleak landscape.

Two decades later the low and moderate income rentals stand out in a neighborhood transformed by the revitalization of the once-decaying Colt manufacturing plant the Capewell Horse Nail Co. factory the Dutch Point public housing complex Dillon Stadium and the Sport and Medical Sciences Academy a magnet middle and high school.

A $50 million plan to raze and rebuild the MLK Apartments on Van Block Avenue is the final major piece of a redevelopment puzzle envisioned in the 1990s to strengthen Sheldon/Charter Oak just a short walk from downtown.

A rendering shows plans for the new $50 million Martin Luther King Apartments in Hartford’s Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood. A 1960s public housing complex will be razed to make way for a more pedestrian-friendly development.

The project however won’t come without major disruptions for the tenants some of them living in the apartments for decades. The tenants will first need to pack up and be temporarily relocated elsewhere either in the city or the surrounding area. Their moves will be paid for and tenants could qualify for rent subsidies if their temporary rents are higher than at the MLK Apartments.

The move will affect households in the complex’s 64 units and is expected to begin early next year in late winter. Once that is complete construction on 161 mixed-income units will start after demolition with the project anticipated to unfold over 18 months.

Tenant Greta Green admits she’s anxious about all the changes and where she will live in the meantime. Green said she doesn’t want to be relocated far from her customer service job downtown. And Green who just turned 50 definitely wants to return to the only place she’s ever called home.

She does have a good shot because current tenants are being given first preference at the new apartments.

The Martin Luther King Apartments in Hartford won architectural accolades when it was built in 1969. But owner Sheldon Oak Central said renovations weren’t worth it. The complex’s design isolated rather than connected it to the surrounding neighborhood and its townhouse design with bathrooms only on the second floor made it difficult for older tenants.

“It’s bittersweet but you know what it’s time it’s time” Green said. “I see other places are getting renovated torn down so I think it’s time. It’s bittersweet but I’m OK with that.”

About a year ago Green walked out of her apartment and noticed that the letter “F” marking her area of the complex on the ground.

“It was so tired that my letter just fell off” Green said.

A place with potential

Neighborhood leaders in the Sheldon/Charter Oak see the redevelopment as a milestone — even capstone — to two decades of efforts to revitalize the neighborhood mixing market-rate apartments with affordable units and attracting investment in development projects.

“People no longer look at this as a place to be avoided but as a place that has potential” said Chris McArdle treasurer of the Coalition to Strengthen the Sheldon/Charter Oak Neighborhood a neighborhood revitalization zone organization.

The North Armory is one of the latest buildings on the former Colt Firearms manufacturing complex to be converted to apartment. The Colt complex is a short walk from the Martin Luther King Apartments.

Owner and developer Sheldon Oak Central a Hartford-based housing nonprofit plans both market-rate and affordable apartments. The affordable apartments include some with “Section 8? rental subsidies not currently offered at the MLK Apartments. That the nonprofit said will ensure the new development will offer a broad range of affordability.

The mixing of incomes in housing developments seeks to avoid the dense concentration of lower-income households which was the standard in the late 1960s when the MLK Apartments were built.

“What Sheldon Oak is doing is really transforming MLK from a sort of backwater of people who are living on the edge of poverty to a place where it is going to be a mix of the population” McArdle said. “Hopefully that will mean more of the workforce will continue to move into this neighborhood.”

The former Capewell Horse Nail Co. factory in Hartford’s Sheldon-Charter Oak neighborhood stood vacant boarded up and an eyesore for years. In late 2016 a $27 million conversion into 72 mixed-income rentals was completed with the help of public funding.

Emily Wolfe executive director of Sheldon Oak said the seven acres encompassed by the MLK Apartments also are isolated from the rest of the neighborhood because the complex lacks streets running through it.

“It looks a little forbidding so the important thing is that we want to integrate it back into the neighborhood” Wolfe said. “We’re doing that with a pedestrian design a pedestrian boulevard going through now there are just cul-de-sacs.”

The design Wolfe said will connect the MLK Apartments to Stonington Acres another development rehabbed by Sheldon Oak and Dutch Point a mix of apartments and townhouses as well as the surrounding community close to Colt Park and the riverfront.

“They will be one community not separate” Wolfe said. “The way they were designed they were separate housing projects which is a very public housing way of looking at it.”

Looking to the future

When the MLK Apartments were built in 1969 the project won architectural accolades for its innovative design appearing from the air in the shape of a chevron.

But in achieving that shape the complex took on secluded atmosphere that invited crime and created apartments that were small with sharp angles.

A site plan for the rebuilt Martin Luther King Apartments in Hartford’s Sheldon Charter Oak neighborhood is intended to be more pedestrian friendly than the existing complex. At top right is a larger building that will include flats and an elevator catering to older tenants and those who physical disabilities.

The complex also was originally twice as large with 124 units. Sheldon Oak purchased the complex in 1996 from the nearby Church of the Good Shepherd under the leadership of former executive director Daniel Merida. Sheldon Oak demolished half of the units cutting back on low-income density that was then viewed as fostering urban crime. The remaining apartments were then renovated.

Sheldon Oak considered another renovation in recent years but it would have cost millions. A renovation would not have solved fundamental problems of all the units being townhouses with bathrooms exclusively on the second floor a hardship as tenants age Wolfe said. There also are no one-bedroom apartments which are sought after in the Hartford market she said.

Historic Colt factory worker housing on Huyshope and Van Block avenues was the inspiration for the new Martin Luther King Apartments which will be built nearby.

Looking to the future Sheldon Oak and its partner Vesta Corp. of Simsbury an owner and developer of affordable housing plan a project that will borrow from the look of the historic former Colt worker houses across Van Block Avenue.

The apartments will be a combination of flats and townhouses with one two and three bedrooms ranging in size from 774 square feet to 1683 square feet.

The design includes one large L-shaped central building with flats and an elevator with older tenants and the physically disabled in mind. There will be 14 smaller building with six or seven apartments.

Dillon Stadium which fell into decay was renovated in a $14 million project in 2019. The stadium is now home to Hartford Athletic of the United Soccer League.

Greta Green’s next door neighbor Mamie McGriff has lived at the MLK Apartments for decades just about as long as Green. But at 78 McGriff is finding it tougher to climb the stairs to the bathroom and would like an apartment on one floor.

“I had to buy one of those potty chairs from Walgreens so I could have it in the hallway” McGriff said. “I can’t be hitting those stairs too many times.”

Monthly rents now range from $1050 to $1225 for two- and three-bedroom units. Projected rents will rise ranging from $1200 for one-bedroom apartments to $1800 for three-bedroom units.

Wolfe of Sheldon Oak said the nonprofit has applied to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development — with the city’s support — to designate 40 apartments or 30% of the project’s rentals for Section 8 subsidies. The subsidies mean tenants would only have to pay 30% of their income in monthly rent.

Plans call for buildings to be arranged around a central green with a gazebo and playscape. All ground floor apartments will have front porches to open to the street.

An existing mural mounted on a building depicting landmarks in Sheldon/Charter Oak will be saved and displayed at a new entrance.

The city has approved the master plan for the project. Financing is nearing completion and is expected to include a mortgage from the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority and federal low-income housing tax credits.

Worries about gentrification

Linda Nelson moved to the MLK Apartments 20 years ago and has since retired from a job as an operations manager at UConn Health.

Nelson said she wants to return to the redeveloped complex. But she worries about gentrification and being able to afford to move back.

“We’re used to being in this area — not saying that we don’t want improvement in our city — but give us a chance to live in it” Nelson said in the living room of her apartment.

“We see all these buildings going up and it’s like they are cornered off from us” Nelson said. “It’s going on all-around us and everybody is living the luxury life.”

Nelson said she took a tour of the rentals in the converted Capewell factory. She loved the apartments but bottom-line she couldn’t afford to live there.

“It’s really frightening for an older person like myself” Nelson said. ‘I don’t work so I’m basically low income. I’m on Social Security but the thing that is scary not only for myself but a lot of us we see these buildings — if our Social Security were up to par or keeping up with the cost of living we could probably get one of these apartments — but we’re stuck.”

This mural depicting landmarks in Hartford’s Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood is mounted on one building in Hartford’s Martin Luther King Apartment complex. The mural was created in 2005 by teenagers who lived in the neighborhood in collaboration with Hartford artist Chet Kempczynski. The mural will be displayed in the rebuilt complex.

Wolfe said the primary goal as the property’s owner is to not displace any tenants.

“So that’s a first-order goal” Wolfe said. “A lot of people have lived here for a very long time and it’s always been naturally affordable. We’re very conscious as neighborhoods change we don’t want to displace the original residents.”

By Christine Stuart CTNewsJunkie.com

U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday shows that Connecticut has not only grown more diverse over the last decade but it also has added 31847 more residents.

Most of that population growth was in Fairfield County which gained 40590 people. Hartford and New Haven counties also saw increases in population but the other five counties lost people.

West Hartford gained 815 residents and the town’s total population is now 64083 according to census data.

Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said she was encouraged by the data.

“In my role as chair of Connecticut’s Complete Count Committee I was committed to overseeing the most comprehensive and exhaustive census outreach effort in Connecticut history” Bysiewicz said. “Today’s data shows the fruits of our labor. Connecticut’s count was a national leader: our 99.9% overall response rate exceeded the national average and our 70.6% self-response rate exceeded Connecticut’s 2010’s self-response rate of 69.5%.”

The population growth is enough to prevent the state from losing a congressional seat.

Once a decade a bipartisan group of lawmakers is required to adjust the lines of congressional and legislative voting districts to reflect the results of the U.S. Census survey and ensure voters in each district get equal representation. They now have a Sept. 15 deadline to meet and they will need to make some adjustments for areas with bigger population growth.

“A change of a thousand people in a particular area of Stamford makes a big difference to the House district lines in a community like that” Rep. Gregg Haddad D-Mansfield has said. “The challenge gets greater as the districts get smaller.”

The redistricting committee will also be the first to implement a new law adopted this year which requires incarcerated people to be counted as members of the voting districts where they lived before they were imprisoned. In the past they have been counted in the district which houses the correctional facility where they are incarcerated.

Connecticut’s population also became more diverse.

Data released by the Census showed that Connecticut’s white population dropped from 77.6% in 2010 to 66.4% in 2020 while the Hispanic or Latino population grew from 13.4% to 17.3%. The Black population grew from 10.1% to 10.8% and the Asian population grew from 3.8% to 4.8%.

Fairfield County is the most diverse of the state’s eight counties with a white population of 61%. It’s followed closely by Hartford County with a 61% white population and New Haven County with 62.9%.

Cheri Quickmire of Common Cause in Connecticut said that the changes also will impact redistricting.

“While this process has historically been conducted behind closed doors with minimal public input in the way of local public hearings 2021 is our year to flip the script and ensure that the voices of our communities particularly those of Black Indigenous Latino Asian Pacific Islander and other communities of color are at the center of the conversation” she said.

In terms of rankings by town Bridgeport remained the largest city in the state. Stamford jumped from fourth to second largest growing by 12827 people or 10% surpassing both New Haven and Hartford. In dropping to fourth the state’s capitol city lost 3721 residents over 10 years. The rest of the top 10 cities by population remained the same with Waterbury in fifth followed by Norwalk Danbury New Britain West Hartford and Greenwich.

In the meantime check in with a few action stars from the '80s who disappeared.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNC9idXNpbmVzcy9zaGVpbi1jaGluYS1mYXN0LWZhc2hpb24taW50bC1obmsvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDgvMTQvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2hlaW4tY2hpbmEtZmFzdC1mYXNoaW9uLWludGwtaG5r?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The mysterious Chinese fashion app that's as popular as Amazon,"Every night before bed Anushka Sachan whips out her phone to log into an app.

“It kind of becomes a habit” said the 20-year-old Hong Kong University student. “Before sleeping I’m just like ‘Okay check in.’”

The platform Sachan is using belongs to a Chinese brand called Shein — pronounced “She In” — which has rapidly attracted a global army of teen fans on TikTok.

The company is a mysterious online shopping upstart that has made headlines recently for surpassing Amazon (AMZN) in app downloads in the United States and creating a cult following for its fast fashion apparel sold all over the world. Some experts even say it’s beating stalwarts like Zara and H&M at their own game by making items more quickly and being more digitally savvy with customers.

“They’re making fast fashion look slow” said Erin Schmidt a senior analyst at Coresight Research a global advisory and research firm specializing in retail and technology. “They’ve changed the model.”

Sachan checks the Shein app daily for the same reason many others do: to get points. The more you get the more you can save on purchases. Shein awards them to customers for everything from opening the app to watching live streams and entering outfit design contests.

“It is pretty addictive” said Sachan describing the experience as similar to playing a mobile game.

Shein’s ability to lure users to its platform is one of its main ingredients for success along with its hyper-fast production process bargain basement pricing and data-driven product offerings.

“I just stopped buying from H&M when I started using Shein” said Sachan who often scours the site for new accessories and once scored a necklace for 9 Hong Kong dollars ($1.20).

“Because I was getting the same things that I saw at H&M but like for cheaper.”

A rising star

Shein was born under a different name — ZZKKO — in China where it was started in 2008 by Chris Xu. The experience he gained as a marketing and search engine optimization consultant would later prove instrumental in creating the site’s powerful algorithm according to Coresight Research.

At first the company only sold wedding dresses said Schmidt. It later branched out to general womenswear adopting the name “Sheinside.” In 2015 the company rebranded again saying it wanted a name that was easier to remember and search for online.

Fast forward to the pandemic which has helped Shein generate explosive growth and become one of the few Chinese consumer brands to win global acclaim. As of last October it was the world’s largest online-only fashion company as measured by sales of goods under the company’s own brand according to Euromonitor International. The research firm declined to provide further information saying that the finding was part of a proprietary project.

Shein competes with Zara and H&M for customers who want the latest trends for less and all three companies sell their own branded goods. But the two longtime heavyweights also run brick-and-mortar stores cater to a wider customer base and sell at slightly higher prices.

Shein’s more direct competition comes from the likes of British fast fashion retailers Boohoo and ASOS which concentrate most of their firepower online target young female shoppers and tend to offer more affordable items.

In the first half of this year alone Shein’s app racked up more than 81 million downloads around the world. In mid-May it overtook Amazon as the most installed shopping app in the United States across the App Store and Google Play combined according to analytics firms App Annie and Sensor Tower.

Amazon has regained its crown although “daily installs between the two apps since then have largely remained close” said Craig Chapple a mobile insights strategist of Europe the Middle East and Africa for Sensor Tower.

In recent months Shein “has really exploded onto the scene” said Schmidt. “Everybody wants [to know] everything that they possibly can about Shein.”

They may be disappointed. For all its success the company is notoriously reclusive with little known about its inner workings despite its stature as one of China’s most valuable privately-held businesses. As of last August Shein had a valuation of $15 billion according to PitchBook. By this summer that had doubled to as much as $30 billion with annual revenue reaching $10 billion Bloomberg reported in June citing unidentified sources.

Backers of the firm include marquee investors such as Sequoia Capital China and Tiger Global. Shein declined requests for an interview and did not respond to a request for comment on specific details for this story. Sequoia and Tiger Global declined requests for an interview.

A tight spot

Shein positions itself firmly as a global business with an emphasis on distribution: It ships to more than 220 countries or territories. Its website has no mention of its backstory or even where it’s based stating only that it is “an international” firm. In recent months that has led to some suggestions that the retailer deliberately downplays its Chinese roots amid rising biases and political controversy.

“Given the current climate of geopolitical tensions it can … make sense for Chinese entities to lay low” said Matthew Brennan who writes about Chinese mobile technology and is the founder of research firm China Channel. “They just want to do business. This is something that they don’t want to have to deal with. And so I don’t think we can blame Shein for taking that option.”

The murkiness however can be off-putting. Some customers such as Sachan have expressed concerns over the firm’s lack of transparency around how it produces its goods — and sells them at a low cost — as well as where it sources its materials.

Experts note that the company’s approach also makes it difficult to verify its reportedly impressive numbers though they say that other metrics such as app downloads are often solid indicators of a brand’s reach if not sales.

Lightning-fast fashion

Shein has made a name for itself by blitzing social media users with its affordable and trendy clothing catering to young women including $6 crop tops and $9 minidresses. Similar to Boohoo and ASOS the company relies heavily on influencer marketing teaming up with internet stars and celebrities like Katy Perry and Nick Jonas to expand its reach.

The brand is especially popular with Gen Z shoppers on TikTok where it has become a trend for users to post $1000 Shein “hauls” or large purchases. That kind of buzz comes on top of Shein’s affiliate marketing programs which reward influencers handsomely for spreading the word about its products.

Instagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public.

The company is also savvy about keeping users on its platform. Last September it held a virtual fashion show exclusively on its app which likely helped it pick up more users noted Lexi Sydow head of marketing insights at App Annie. Grammy-nominated singer Ellie Goulding was among the performers.

“They’re just so far ahead in terms of user experience” said Brennan. “They mix together media and entertainment into the experience and user-generated content and reviews.”

One of its key differentiators however is a concept that analysts are calling “real-time retail.”

They say that Shein has come up with an in-house algorithm that trawls the web — including its own massive customer database — to find out what fashion items are trending on search and what people are responding to on competitors’ websites.

That data is then used by the design team to develop new items according to experts. Even in the whirlwind of fast fashion Shein is prolific: It drops as many as 500 fashion products a day while Boohoo releases that many over a week.

Shein has also managed to take advantage of China’s manufacturing prowess allowing it to cut down on lead times significantly. Researchers estimate its production schedule is as short as three to seven days compared to the average span of three weeks disclosed by players like Zara.

That’s because Shein’s suppliers use the company’s back-end software allowing them to get immediate information on user clicks and orders according to experts.

“They’ve integrated their systems with their factory” said Schmidt. “Based off of what is trending like what clicks what sells what starts to trend … the algorithm goes to the factory and says: ‘Start ordering material start producing.’ So they’ve essentially cut out all of the middlemen.”

Other Chinese players have also invested heavily in smart manufacturing. Last year for example Alibaba (BABA) rolled out an AI-powered processing system to help small businesses streamline the apparel production process.

Shein is also careful to hedge its bets only making small batches of each item until demand is proven.

“If a design sells out quickly Shein places a large order of the product” according to a Coresight Research report. “If it does not sell out quickly Shein sells the remaining pieces and abandons the design.”

There are sustainability concerns. Like other fast fashion retailers Shein is eschewed by some customers who worry about the environmental impact of its production processes while others say the prices are too good to pass up. Sachan for her part cited considerations about waste and overconsumption as one reason she now tries to shop less on the app even as she feels compelled to log in each day.

Changing the game

There’s one huge market Shein doesn’t have a major presence in: mainland China.

The company hardly markets itself in its home country for various reasons starting with the headache of having to compete with Alibaba the longtime industry leader.

“It’s not lucrative for them to sell in China” said Schmidt. “[And] these products that would seem cheap to us are not as cheap to [consumers] in their home country.”

Instead Shein concentrates on exports naming Europe the United States Australia and the Middle East as key markets. Shein does not publicly break down what its top markets are.

It has recently also seen momentum in Latin America with app downloads in Brazil skyrocketing 988% in the 12 months to June compared to the previous year according to App Annie.

The brand also remains a fan favorite in India although its platform was booted out of the country last summer amid a crackdown on dozens of apps. Last month it returned to India through Amazon’s Prime Day shopping festival leading to excitement among customers.

In some ways Shein’s rise could be compared to that of TikTok according to Brennan who authored the book “Attention Factory: The Story of TikTok and China’s ByteDance.”

“I see so many similarities” he said reflecting on how the short video app was regarded before it became a global sensation.

“It was viewed as something that was just for Gen Z. It was sort of viewed as frivolous entertainment … I think the competitors were looking at it similarly and not taking it as seriously as they should have. And I’m sure that platforms like YouTube and Instagram much regret that now.”

Playmobil The A-Team

For its next licensed set Playmobil has dug deep into the nostalgia barrel of iconic ‘80s properties and decided to turn The A-Team into its next playset targeted at adult collectors. (Cue the music!) Available on October 25 for a yet-to-be-revealed price (which will probably be much cheaper than Playmobil’s upcoming Star Trek playset) the set includes Hannibal B.A. Baracus Face and Murdock (with sock puppet) figures but also another iconic vehicle following Playmobil’s Back to the Future and Ghostbusters sets: the black and red A-Team van. It’s got a full finished interior with opening doors a removable roof and all the accessories four ex-elite soldiers sent to prison for a crime they didn’t commit could ever need.

Hasbro Transformers Studio Series 86-12 Leader The Transformers: The Movie Coronation Starscream

Is there a more tragic figure to come out of an ‘80s toy line and animated series than Starscream? Although the character had ambitions of leading the Decepticons he was always relegated to serving at Megatron’s side. Even when he had his chance to take the throne in The Transformers: The Movie Megatron still spoiled his aspirations by returning as the upgraded Galvatron. If there’s any happily ever after for this character it’s Hasbro’s new Studio Series 86-12 Leader Class Coronation Starscream which goes from robot to jet mode in 29 transformation steps and includes not only a crown and cape but a regal throne as well. Availability isn’t expected until early 2022 but it’s available on HasbroPulse right now for $75.

Mezco 1:12 Superman: Man of Steel Edition

Meczo’s latest 6″ scaled take on the Man of Steel is called appropriately the Man of Steel edition. Inspired by the hero’s classic comics appearances the figure itself is a pretty neat rendition of the iconic Superman design but it really shines in its comics-themed accessories. Aside from all the usual alternate hands and heads (one neutral one smiling and three in various states of anger as well as a special light-up head for attaching heat vision effects to) Superman comes with FX pieces like enhanced punch blasts and bullet ricochets to place on his hands and chest respectively.

Beyond that there’s also a kryptonite trophy display a phantom zone projector and two attachable creatures: a small Starro to grip Superman’s face as he possesses him and a Black Mercy creature to replicate the iconic comic storyline “For the Man Who Has Everything” when the plantlike being possesses Superman and forces him to dream of a reality where Krypton was never destroyed. Set to release in summer 2022 for $170 the figure is available to preorder now. [Toyark]"

Since being acquired by the giant for-profit hospital chain HCA Healthcare Mission Health and its Mission Hospital flagship have become the most expensive hospital system in North Carolina for many procedures with prices often double the state average according to a class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday against HCA Healthcare and its Mission Health subsidiary in Asheville.

The 87-page lawsuit filed in Superior Court in Buncombe County by a group of local residents alleges that Nashville-based HCA illegally used its effective monopoly market power in the region to raise prices while reducing the quality of care at the six hospitals and multiple clinics it operates in Western North Carolina harming doctors and consumers.

“Once we have been served with the lawsuit we will respond appropriately through the legal process” Nancy Lindell division director for public and media relations for HCA Healthcare North Carolina Division and Mission Health said in a statement. “Mission Health is committed to the health and well-being of every person who comes to us for care and we are proud of our dedicated hospital teams that are facing the many challenges of this pandemic and the exceptional care they have provided to our patients.”

Many of the allegations against HCA and Mission Health were first reported by Asheville Watchdog.

The plaintiffs in the class-action suit include Katherine Button Faith Cook and Will Overfelt of Asheville Richard Nash of Candler William Davis of Clyde and Jonathan Powell of Morganton. The complaint was prepared by the law firms Wallace & Graham of Salisbury N.C. and Fairmark Partners of Washington D.C.

Google Cloud is one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the market and despite some stalled growth in early 2020 they are poised for tremendous growth in the next several years.

The Google Cloud division now has about 37000 employees and Q2 2021 revenue of $4.63 billion making it one of the largest divisions within the Alphabet family.

CEO Thomas Kurian has steadily grown Google Cloud’s market share since joining the company in 2018. Much of this growth is attributed to shoring up the sales team with experienced executives who can deliver on customer requests and expectations moving past Google Cloud’s traditional approach of hiring primarily product and engineering professionals.

Google Cloud use cases

Enterprises across industries have relied on Google to manage their data and applications and also help them develop mission-critical platforms. Here’s how a couple of major organizations have leveraged Google Cloud’s products and resources to solve their specific needs:

“In the beginning of the outbreak it was apparent there was no national portal in the U.S. that offered a nationwide perspective into the scope and spread of COVID-19. There were — and still are — so many unanswered questions about this virus. We knew we needed to create a central repository of reliable information to help researchers and healthcare providers move closer to overcoming the pandemic … Rapid reliable access to data is critical. We needed to improve how people could capture and share data which was proving to be a challenge. We decided to build a centralized data portal called the National Response Portal (NRP) for healthcare providers … This project required deep knowledge of AI and consumer-facing platforms as well as healthcare. Google brought together the ideal combination of product people and partners. Google Cloud’s healthcare-specific products along with SADA’s expertise in the healthcare IT space made this partnership the perfect choice to move quickly and intelligently.” -Dr. Edmund Jackson chief data officer HCA Healthcare

“The fundamental goal is fan engagement — to bring baseball to millions of fans and introduce new technology that allows for personalized recommendations and a social viewing experience where when something happens on the field and you get excited about it you can share it with other fans. These are the things that really motivate us and Google Cloud has been a great partner in building products that embody those values … We’re excited to consolidate MLB infrastructure on Google Cloud and incorporate Google’s world-class machine learning technology to provide personalized and immersive fan experiences. We couldn’t have picked a better technology partner across ad delivery streaming cloud computing and machine learning.” -Jason Gaedtke former CTO MLB

User reviews of Google Cloud

Google Cloud offerings consistently receive high marks from customer reviewers:

GCP overall: 4.5/5 (Gartner Peer Insights) 4.7/5 (Capterra)

Anthos: 4.5/5 (Capterra) 4.5/5 (G2)

Google Cloud in the market

Google Cloud is ranked among the top three cloud providers in the market though it falls much farther behind No. 1 (AWS) and No. 2 (Microsoft Azure).

Google Cloud’s revenue was down for a few quarters in2020 but since then Google Cloud has upped its revenue to $4.36 billion in Q2 of 2021. This performance makes it one of the top divisions in the Alphabet family and shows signs of significant growth.

While AWS’s revenue and market share have remained dominant they have mostly remained steady while Microsoft and Google have quickly gained ground over recent quarters.

The areas where Google particularly shines are in AI/ML innovation analytics capabilities with growing hybrid and multicloud options and mature data and security management. To improve its revenue model Google has also adopted some traditional sales methods such as software packaging to increase brand loyalty.

There are also some reports that Google Cloud will take on federal government and military digital transformation initiatives in the near future according to Bloomberg. Hinging on whatever their next steps may be Google appears primed to find more major enterprise opportunities and clients to close the gap with AWS and Microsoft in the coming years.

For example it’s unfortunate if you crash into another person’s car but if you leave your details so that they can contact you and your insurer that’s generally considered the best course of action.

However one driver took a less orthodox approach after they heavily damaged a woman’s vehicle.

Yes they left a note and apologised but rather than offer to cover the cost of repairs they tried to sweeten her up instead.

The ordeal was shared on TikTok alongside the presumably sarcastic caption: “What a nice person.”

In the clip the woman explains that she returned to her car after a trip to Walmart only to find a massive dent running the whole length of one side.

On her windscreen she found a scrap of paper reading: “Sorry for the damage on your car I can’t afford to fix it but here’s chocolate instead :).”

It was accompanied by two Hershey’s bars.

Two chocolate bars doesn’t really cut the mustard @isanaguy/TikTok

The clip racked up more than 4.7 million views and 6000 comments in a matter of days as fellow TikTokers shared their bafflement at the gesture.

One suggested she’d need a “sack of chocolates” to make up for the damage while another said they’d “rather eat body filler than Hershey’s chocolate”.

“They could have at least left good chocolate” a third agreed.

A fourth viewer seemed determined to help find the culprit writing: “You can find the doer since his fingerprints are on the chocolate bar and the note.”

Meanwhile others joked that “chocolate fixes everything” and so the woman was “amply compensated”.

Hong Kong’s largest chocolate maker started making the seasonal product as a contract manufacturer only two years ago starting with 200000 pieces. This year the company has ramped up production fivefold because of demand from mainland Chinese consumers for the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival pastry in recognition of the city’s reputation and fame in the industry.

Multizen Asia which produces chocolates for Mars and Hershey has found unlikely success in a Chinese delicacy: mooncakes.

Mooncakes produced in the company’s 20000 sq ft factory in Tsuen Wan carry the “Product of Hong Kong” label lending them prestige Lee said. He expects demand from mainland customers to continue to grow over the next few years lifting its exports to the market to 80 per cent of production from 50 per cent at present.

Mooncakes have long been tied to the Chinese tradition of giving gifts to the elderly relatives friends and clients. While the Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 21 this year the traditional cakes have been available in many shops since last month.

A little over 100 million pieces of mooncakes worth some HK$5 billion (US$642 million) are sold annually in Hong Kong according to the company’s estimates making Multizen a small player against seasoned producers. Maxim’s and Wing Wah are among the most popular mooncake brands in Hong Kong with the latter’s products sold in more than 100 countries.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic mooncake sales in the city touched HK$2 billion according to Yeung Wai-sing chairman of the Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management.

“We’re primarily a chocolate company but as we have a Hong Kong manufacturing plant and mooncakes are such an important tradition this time of the year we started making them” Lee said.

The company typically makes the chewy pastry distinctly known for their egg yolks and bean paste for some 90 days from June to August. To achieve this year’s target of 1 million mooncakes the company churns out about 11100 pieces a day.

Given the changing preference of young Chinese consumers the company’s research and development department continues to innovate and invent new flavours.

“Young people don’t like the traditional mooncakes so now we’re making chocolate coffee and custard lava mooncakes” Lee said.

The company founded in 1994 with a starting capital of US$20000 now has a manufacturing plant each in Hong Kong the US and mainland China producing 10000 tonnes of chocolates. Multizen is a contract manufacturer for the likes of US brands Mars Hershey and the Belgian chocolate brand Godiva in mainland China.

The Hong Kong company also counts Disneyland supermarket chains Wellcome City’s Super and Yata and biscuit and cupcake retailer Mrs. Fields Cookies among its clients.

Multizen is also looking at expanding its chocolate business. The company is keen on acquiring a facility in Japan that can produce confectionery for the Japanese market but current travel restrictions have made it difficult to conduct on-site inspections Lee said.

The company was open to raising capital via an initial public offering but that would depend on available acquisition opportunities he said.

A DRIVER crashed into a parked car and left a note along with CHOCOLATE bars because they ""couldn't afford to fix it.""

In video posted on TikTok the furious driver showed the huge bodywork damage running the entire length of the passenger door of the red vehicle.

2 The culprit drove off after causing the damage and just left the chocolate bars and a note

2 The red car had been completely ruined across the side

The woman from the US was left enraged after she nipped into a branch of Walmart and found her car completely wrecked.

And instead of leaving their details the driver at fault left a note under the windscreen wiper of the damaged car.

The note read: ""Sorry for the damage on your car I can't afford to fix it but here's chocolate instead :) ""along with two Hershey's chocolate bars.

With nearly 5 million views on the app many people were outraged with the way the woman had been treated by the driver.

One person wrote: ""I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A DENT OR A SCRATCH.""

Another said: ""Leaving a note without information is more offensive than just running.""

A third replied: ""Thousands of dollars of damage and they left two chocolate bars.""

Another person wrote: ""Bro the chocolate probably melted by the time you got out there. That just adds insult to injury.""

Someone else added: ""That's like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound."""

Lujo Hotel Bodrum doesn’t allow men without women

Long story short there are dozens of hotels in Turkey that won’t allow men to check into a hotel room without women. More specifically these hotels don’t allow solo male travelers to stay at the hotel and also don’t allow two men to stay in a room. I’ve collectively spent thousands of nights in hotels in 100+ countries yet somehow this is the first time I’ve heard of a policy like this.

This was brought to my attention by reader Denis who had booked the Lujo Hotel in Bodrum for two clients. This is a pricey all-inclusive property in the (usually pretty liberal) Turkish resort town of Bodrum. During the booking process there’s a message stating the following:

“Reserving a room for an individual male guest is not possible. In case of reservation the hotel reserves the right to cancel unconditionally.”

The reader was looking to book a stay for two men in one room and he was informed in communications with the hotel that this wasn’t allowed either. When Denis asked about the reason for the policy he was told that it’s because men allegedly party too hard and cause problems.

This hotel sure is sending mixed signals to guests. Looking at the hotel’s website:

It’s stated that after clubbing you can “continue partying at your own terrace and bathtub”

There are pictures of poles and then it states “what happens in Indigo stays in Indigo”

It’s stated that “you still have a lot to discover” after the party is over and “the Tantra Sofa at your rooms enables you to try sensual positions to take your love life to a whole new level”

The hotel doesn’t want guests to party too much but does want people to try new sensual positions on their in-room tantra sofa?

I wanted to verify this policy firsthand so I emailed the hotel noting that I saw the website stated single men couldn’t check into the hotel but what about a couple? Here’s the answer:

Warm greetings from Lujo. Thank you for your interest in Lujo Hotel Bodrum. We would love the opportunity to welcome you to your personal journey into the world of art & joy. Lujo offers an exclusive a la carte ultra all inclusive concept to make your holiday an unforgettable experience. Accommodations have been designed to meet your every need and offer you comfort and value during your stay. Lujo stands for unparalleled vacations surrounded by beautiful nature with contemporary design and exceptional luxury business and lifestyle services. Unfortunately we don’t accept two men staying in the same room. Stay safe and take care!

Well there goes my “personal journey into the world of art & joy.” I guess I’ll be staying safe and taking care elsewhere.

This isn’t the only hotel with such a policy

You might think that this is just an isolated policy but that doesn’t seem to be the case. Denis found a list being updated by a travel agency targeted at Russians that keeps tabs on all the hotels that don’t allow rooms to be occupied by just men.

There are dozens and dozens of hotels on the list including some belonging to major global hotel groups. Two Hilton properties stand out:

DoubleTree by Hilton Kemer

DoubleTree by Hilton Bodrum Işıl Club Resort

Denis called both hotels and they both stated that they wouldn’t allow one or two men to check into a hotel room alone. I can’t imagine that’s within Hilton’s corporate policy so I’ll flag that with the hotel group.

Another issue is the lack of disclosure of this on hotel websites. In many cases they don’t even list these policies online so how often do people show up at check-in only to be turned away?

Is this policy anti-party anti-gay or both?

One certainly has to wonder what the true motivation here is:

Are single men banned because they’re more likely to party harder? Are they causing problems with women?

Are two men banned from the same room because it’s assumed that there will be twice as much partying or is there an element of homophobia there?

Regardless of what the motivation is in my opinion this policy crosses the line. Now for the independent hotels on the list I suppose that they have the right to have their policies and we can take our business elsewhere. However I do think it’s worth objecting to this policy for properties belonging to Hilton — the brand promotes how it’s “diverse by nature and inclusive by choice” and this doesn’t really fit into that.

Bottom line

There are a significant number of hotels in Turkey that won’t allow a room to be occupied if there isn’t a woman staying in it. Like I said I’ve stayed in hotels in a lot of countries and I’ve never heard of anything like this before. Perhaps most surprising is that some hotels engaging in this practice belong to major global hotel groups.

Is this a common practice in any other countries? What do you make of this policy?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGljazJob3VzdG9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjEvMDgvMTQvbGlzdC10aGVzZS1ob3VzdG9uLWFyZWEtaG90ZWxzLWFyZS1yYW5rZWQtYW1vbmctdGhlLXRvcC0xMDAtYmVzdC1wbGFjZXMtdG8tc3RheS1pbi10ZXhhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LIST: These Houston-area hotels are ranked among the top 100 best places to stay in Texas,"Multiple Houston-area hotels were ranked among the best places to stay in Texas.

Hilton won two of the three categories: sets in the Scottish Irish and Breton disciplines. He won the Irish set and the Bteton set.

This year the competition saw pre-recorded performances from four pipers – Scott Wallace (Ireland) Xavier Bouderiou (Brittany) Ross Ainslie (Scotland) and Lincoln Hilton (Australia) – judged by a secret panel of international judges. A large global audience watched online.

Fear an tighe Gary West Vice Chairman of the Gordon Duncan Memorial Trust (GDMT) announced Hilton as the winner.

West went on to announce that the Trust has now made an astonishing £103000 in awards to various good causes in piping.

The charity founded in 2006 after the death of one of piping’s outstanding talents reached the milestone last month with a donation to Bobby Allen a young piper who has Asperger syndrome and who has been accepted onto the degree course run jointly by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and the NPC. The donation is to help fund his piping lessons.

Prior to the results being announced the youngster from Chryston in North Lanarkshire entertained the audience with a set of tunes – including tunes composed by himself and some by Gordon Duncan including Thunderstruck.

Gary West said: “Over the last couple of years we saw the need to help out musicians who had lost their main source of income during the pandemic and established a strand of funding we called Performance Awards. Successful applicants simply had to video record themselves playing a short set which included a Gordon Duncan composition. We made many such awards and the resulting archive of performances can be seen on the Trust’s website. We were delighted with the response for that but reaching the overall milestone of having given out awards totally more than £100000 is something we’re very proud of.”

The GDMT was founded by the virtuoso piper and composer’s family and friends with the aim of preserving and building on Duncan’s legacy by funding and supporting young traditional musicians. The idea was the brainchild of folk musician Martin Hughes a friend of Gordon. For over 15 years it has supported young pipers and pipe bands and other traditional music groups in accessing quality tuition and developing their compositions.

There were also performance awards for hard up musicians during lockdown.

A full list of sponsorships and awards made can be found on the Trust’s website.

Front row: Chris Duncan Ian Duncan and Ian Green. Gordon Duncan Jnr. a talented musician in his own right is also one of the trustees..

Gordon Duncan died on December 14 2005. He was recognised widely as the most innovative and influential piper of his generation someone whose playing and composing inspired a generation to take up piping. His musical approach was to quote his obituary in The Scotsman “gleefully irreverent.” He lived just outside Pitlochry in Perthshire for most of his life.

The competition was sponsored by McCallum Bagpipes.

Early in my professional career I started paying a housekeeper to come and returning home after they’d cleaned was a great feeling.

Staying at a hotel is wonderful when you get to return to your room and experience this every day . That is at least where daily housekeeping was offered. That’s something that disappeared at most hotels during the pandemic and big chains want to save on labor costs and eliminate it for good (Hilton for instance wants it to be ‘on request’ only at full service hotels.)

Checking into a hotel recently I was told there was no housekeeping available during my stay – they only cleaned rooms between guests. The Hyatt app gave me the choice to opt into housekeeping as an elite member but the front desk explained that they do not honor this.

“If you need more towels come down and ask us” they said. Hotels for years have been trying to get guests to re-use towels too. Now they have an almost fool-proof way of saving laundry cost too.

I asked what I should do about trash in my room? Many rooms have just small waste baskets. I’ll often bring food back to my room. I don’t want the smell after I’m done. “Just put the trash in the hall” they said.

Here’s a glimpse into our housekeeping-less future from the TownePlace Suites Outer Banks Kill Devil Hills:

Hotel service is one of the primary things that sets a Hilton Marriott Hyatt or IHG property apart from Airbnb. Marriott’s CEO wants guests to have sympathy for the REITs and trusts that own their hotels paying higher room rates and demanding less so that owners incur fewer costs. That even extends to eliminating the clocks in rooms and offering cheaper breakfast at brands where it’s included for all guests.

Many guests will show their sympathy by not demanding services from these hotels and booking elsewhere instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcG1pZGRsZWVhc3QuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzL3Jha3MtbWFyamFuLWlzbGFuZC10by1ob3N0LXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LWhhbXB0b24tYnktaGlsdG9uLWhvdGVs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RAK's Marjan Island To Host World's Largest Hampton By Hilton Hotel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.mepmiddleeast.com/projects/raks-marjan-island-to-host-worlds-largest-hampton-by-hilton-hotel on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcG1pZGRsZWVhc3QuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzL3Jha3MtbWFyamFuLWlzbGFuZC10by1ob3N0LXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LWhhbXB0b24tYnktaGlsdG9uLWhvdGVs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

What is more challenging is developing and funding programs that provide extra support to teenagers who need a boost to stay on track in high school and make the most of college.

One large donor decided to put more money and resources into a mentoring program after seeing how the pandemic with its switch to online learning disproportionately affected poor children. While mentoring programs already exist — a major one is the Boys & Girls Clubs — Arthur Blank one of the co-founders of Home Depot and the owner of the Atlanta Falcons had a particular vision for one.

“There isn’t anyone in America or the world that hasn’t been affected in a very negative way by this pandemic” Mr. Blank 78 said in an interview. “For these young men and women they don’t always have the tools to deal with what’s happened to them in the pandemic.

It’s those qualities that made him such an inspirational figure and beloved part of our city” she said.

In 1997 then-President Bill Clinton nominated Hormel to become U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg. Conservative Senate Republicans blocked the nomination. But two years later Clinton used executive privilege to appoint him during the Congressional recess.

“The process was very long and strenuous arduous insulting full of misleading statements full of lies full of deceit full of antagonism” Hormel said during a West Hollywood California bookshop visit in 2012 to promote his memoir “Fit to Serve.”

He never received confirmation through a Senate floor vote but “ultimately a great deal was achieved” he told the audience. “Ultimately regulations were changed in the State Department. Ultimately other openly gay individuals were appointed without the rancor that went into my case.”

U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg who is openly gay has said that as a teenager he was inspired by Hormel’s confirmation fight.

“I can remember watching the news” he said after his nomination by President Joe Biden. “And I learned something about some of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong. But just as important I saw how those limits could be challenged.”

Hormel held the ambassadorship from June 1999 through 2000.

Clinton and his wife former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said they were deeply saddened by Hormel’s death.

“Jim devoted his life to advancing the rights and dignity of all people and in his trailblazing service in the diplomatic corps he represented the United States with honor and brought us closer to living out the meaning of a more perfect union” the Clintons said in a statement.

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who officiated at Hormel’s wedding to his husband said Hormel “made it his mission to fight for dignity and equality for all” and noted his philanthropic contributions to health artistic and educational organizations.

“When the AIDS epidemic descended upon San Francisco he called on our conscience and rallied the city to help our neighbors suffering from the ferocious disease” Pelosi said in a statement. “His work served as a model for national policy to defeat HIV/AIDS and improve the lives of all affected.”

Hormel was an heir to the Hormel Foods fortune. Born in Austin Minnesota Hormel married his college sweetheart Alice McElroy Parker and had five children before divorcing in 1965. He moved to San Francisco in 1977.

He was a former dean of students at the University of Chicago law school where he received a degree.

Hormel co-founded the Human Rights Campaign and helped fund many activities geared to arts education and human rights including a gay and lesbian center at the San Francisco Public Library; the National AIDS Memorial Grove; the American Foundation for AIDS Research; and the American Conservatory Theater.

In addition to his husband Hormel is survived by five children 14 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdnByZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NsaW5lL2phbWVzLWhvcm1lbC1hbWVyaWNhLXMtZmlyc3Qtb3Blbmx5LWdheS1hbWJhc3NhZG9yLWRpZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9kNmY4NTkzZS1mZDZjLTExZWItOTIyMi05Nzk4NDRmNDRhODEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Hormel America's first openly gay ambassador dies,"Thank you for reading!

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

MegaRexx leaves the interior cabin stock for the MegaRaptor — Ford already does an excellent job with truck interiors. And they don’t modify the powertrain which is the already prodigious 6.7-liter Power Stroke turbodiesel which puts out 475 hp and 1050 lb-ft of torque.

The company plows its effort into a far more aggressive MegaRaptor exterior. That starts with massive 46-inch XZL tires mounted to MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected) wheels rated for 10000 pounds each. The hyper-aggressive Smasher front bumper comes standard. Megarexx offers varying body widths and an array of options — including the ever-necessary locomotive horn — to allow you to build out your unique dream truck.

The Megaraptor does make a few nods to practicality. It’s designed to make use of the 6.7-liter engine’s towing capability. And MegaRexx makes a lot of space for the wheels with modifications to the fenders and firewall allowing for a relatively modest 2.5-inch suspension lift and a lower center of gravity.

MegaRexx doesn’t offer pricing for a MegaRaptor build on the website. But don’t expect it to run cheap. The base F-250 Super Duty Platinum with the 6.7-liter turbodiesel will already cost in the $80000 range before you begin modifying it. And MegaRexx will only do full rebuilds. Buyers can reserve a place in line with a $5000 deposit. Builds take 2-3 months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpdGF2YWRhLmNvbS9FbmN5Yy8yMDIxLzgvMTQvTS1NLU5ncC1hdC1mb3JlZnJvbnQtb2YtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1yb2xscy1vdXQtb3Zlci0xLW1uLXRyYWN0b3JzLXRpbGwtZGF0ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M&M Ngp at forefront of manufacturing; rolls out over 1 mn tractors till date,"M&M Ngp at forefront of manufacturing; rolls out over 1 mn tractors till date





By Ravi Chandpurkar

Although the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has dented the production for tractors the tractor industry is highly optimistic that when normalcy will be restored the production will bounce back.

“It is expected that after removal of restrictions the production for tractors would scale up. The Government too spending on infrastructure projects including irrigation and incentive schemes like Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) giving impetus to the tractor industry” said Shrikant R Dube Senior General Manager and Plant Head of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Ltd Farm Equipment Sector MIDC-Hingna in an exclusive interview with The Hitavada.

The demand for tractors is cyclical in nature tending to rise and fall with fluctuations inline with the economic conditions Dube conveyed.

Highlighting a major achievement he said that the M&M tractor plant at Nagpur has completed 50 years of successful operations.

The plant was established in 1970 on a sprawling area of 45 acres at Hingna MIDC. This plant comprises an Industrial Estate as a farm equipment and implement producer. At that time the site was chosen due to its strategic location being centrally located in the country. This is one of the oldest facilities he said.

The company started tractor production in 1996 to strengthen its presence in the growing market. As of now M&M Nagpur employs a highly trained workforce of more than 3000 people.

Apart from this the plant has touched a milestone of producing 10 lakh tractors in 2020. “This is just one of the major achievements we are proud of” Dube said. The Nagpur tractor plant produced over 75000 units last year. The Nagpur plant has an installed capacity of 90000 units. The engine transmission hydraulics assembly machine shop and sheet metal paintshop are major aggregates within the plant he said.

The Swaraj tractor brand is also a part of the M&M Group. M&M tractors along with Swaraj tractors command a lion’s share of over 40 per cent in the domestic tractor market. “Our tractors are sold across the country majorly UP MP Telangana & Maharashtra” he said.

On the export front he said the Nagpur plant exports to more than 25 countries including US and Europe. M&M tractors are popular between the 20 HP and 90 HP segment in US and European countries.

Mahindra has five tractor plants and Nagpur is one of

the five tractor plants in

the country. Mahindra Nagpur is taking all possible precautions and following safety operating procedures (SOPs) at the plant to protect its employees and contain the spread of COVID-19. All workers above the age of 45 have already been vaccinated. Currently the vaccination process is underway at the plant and remaining workers will be vaccinated soon he said.

“Apart from this pre-pandemic our customers mainly farmers visited Nagpur plant and delivery of tractors directly from plant was also being done” he pointed out.

Furthermore the Nagpur Plant is instrumental in introducing a new range of tractor SP+.

“We have the Mahindra Excellence Centre at Nagpur plant used for capability building of channel partners and own employees in tractor and farm machinery. Nagpur plant actively contributes to society under CSR activities under ‘Prerna’ initiative for women farmers as well as supporting self health groups” he further said.

The company’s agriculture centric solutions will help farmers gain access to knowledge and latest farming techniques enabling them to improve

yields reduce cost of cultivation and increase profitability

""Sick invite"" Ko Kieft tweeted.

Kieft you see technically isn't an offensive lineman and therefore Morgan didn't invite him on the recent trip to Baldy's BBQ in Lake­ville. Kieft is a 6-5 265-pound tight end whose main job is to forcibly relocate defensive players so running backs like Mohamed Ibrahim can romp freely. After all Gophers tight ends as a group had only seven receptions in 2020 but they helped Ibrahim average 153.7 rushing yards per game the second-best average in the nation.

Maybe that pass-catching role will evolve a bit this season.

Gophers offensive coordinator Mike Sanford Jr. is seeking more productivity throughout his offense and Kieft a redshirt senior and Brevyn Spann-Ford a 6-7 270-pound redshirt junior offer Morgan a pair of large targets at tight end.

""They've been improving daily and continued improvement is going to be needed"" Sanford said Thursday. ""That tight end group has experience.""

Later Thursday the top Gophers wide receiver Chris Autman-Bell suffered a right leg injury and was helped off the field during the team's open practice at Huntington Bank Stadium. The Gophers haven't given a status update on Autman-Bell whose 78 career catches are 63 more than any teammate. Coach P.J. Fleck is next scheduled to speak with the media on Monday.

If Autman-Bell misses significant time increased productivity from the tight ends could help fill any gaps.

""We're going to do our job whatever play's called"" Kieft said at the start of training camp. ""That's our focus. If more pass plays get called for us we're going to make more plays. If we're told we've got to block that's all we're focused on.""

Kieft got in on the receiving action early last year scoring the Gophers' first touchdown in the season opener against Michigan on a 14-yard pass from Morgan. He also had a 15-yard reception against the Wolverines but didn't have another reception during a season in which he missed three games because of injury. Spann-Ford had one catch last season a 4-yard TD grab against Nebraska but also battled injuries.

""Ko Kieft is a leader he's a tone-setter. He's not just a one-trick pony"" Sanford said. ""He's a fantastic athlete and can run well. … What I'm probably even more excited about is Brevyn's health. Last year he was in and out of practice. Certain games you'd see him certain games you wouldn't. He's healthy. He worked his tail off to put himself in a position of health.""

Though the Gophers won't have Bryce Witham back for a seventh season after he medically retired Sanford called youngsters Austin Henderson Jameson Geers and Nick Kallerup as tight ends who could contribute.

The leader of the group is Kieft who is underrated in Morgan's eyes.

""Everyone knows how he's a bruiser of a blocker for us but he's got great hands"" the quarterback said. ""Every time he's gotten an opportunity he's made plays.""

Kieft and Morgan are good friends and they will exchange friendly razzing from time to time.

""I love Tanner to death and I'd do anything for that guy"" Kieft said. ""It's kind of how I show affection in a sick twisted way. If I'm making fun of you I like you.""

The offensive linemen also get in on the banter especially when it comes to Kieft's long red hair.

""He has that terrific burnt red"" guard Conner Olson said during the team's media day. ""He's got a terrific mullet. He's already rocking his [training] camp regalia which is a cutoff flannel — with the mullet it goes really well. I'm convincing him to go with jorts too but that might be too much.""

Kieft a Sioux Center Iowa native is working on his master's degree in sport and exercise science with the goal of becoming a strength and conditioning coach at the college level. He took advantage of the NCAA not charging players a year of eligibility in the coronavirus-impacted 2020 season.

""I'm nothing but excited"" he said. ""I'm kind of on borrowed time with the extra COVID year and I'm just really thankful for that.

""I'm able to be around my teammates more and my coaches. I get to play for the state of Minnesota one more year.''",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL2luc2lkZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9CdXNpbmVzcy1NYXR0ZXJzLUxvdWllLXMtTGVhdGhlcndvcmtzLUxvdWllLTE2Mzg0NjQ5LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business Matters: Louie's Leatherworks Louie Domerese,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ourmidland.com/insider/article/Business-Matters-Louie-s-Leatherworks-Louie-16384649.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL2luc2lkZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9CdXNpbmVzcy1NYXR0ZXJzLUxvdWllLXMtTGVhdGhlcndvcmtzLUxvdWllLTE2Mzg0NjQ5LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Bush was commissioned in January 2009.

Here's What You Need to Know: The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is unquestionably a symbol of American might and power projection abroad.

At 1092 feet the Nimitz-class supercarriers are more than three times the length of a football field and with a crew of 3200 sailors and 2480 airmen these are essentially floating cities. The lead ship of the class USS Nimitz—nicknamed ""Old Salt""—was commissioned in May 1975 was named after Adm. Chester Nimitz who led the U.S. Navy through World War II.

The ship was first deployed to the Indian Ocean during the Iran Hostage Crisis and has since logged untold miles providing security at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games and later service in the Persian Gulf after Operation Desert Storm. Most recently USS Nimitz was deployed against ISIS in Iraq and Syria where her F/A-18s took part in the Battle of Afar in 2017.

A total of 10 Nimitz-class carriers have been built and the last of the class USS George H.W. Bush was commissioned in January 2009. These nuclear-powered carriers which have two reactors and four shafts for propulsion with a top speed of 30+ knots (34.5mph) were the largest warships in the world until the USS Gerald R. Ford the lead ship of her class of carriers entered service in 2017. Each of the Nimitz-class has an expected 50-year service life with one mid-life refueling. These warships which have a displacement of 102000 tons were all built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding (now Northrop Grumman Ship Systems) based in Virginia at a unit cost of approximately $8.5 billion (constant year FY 12 dollars).

Each carrier has approximately 60 aircraft onboard and this includes a variety of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft with up to 90 of various types. Typical aircraft on a Nimitz-class carrier include 12 F/A-18E/F Hornets 36 F/A-18 Hornets four E-2C Hawkeyes and four EA-6B Prowlers fixed-wing and helicopters including four SH-60F and two HH-60H Seahawks. In addition the carriers could also deploy the S-3B Viking before these were phased out and replaced the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The flight deck which measures 1092 feet by 252 feet is equipped with four lifts four steam-driven catapults and four arrester wires. The carriers are capable of launching one air every 20 seconds.

The air wings of the carriers are customized according to the nature of operations with the usual air wings replaced with 50 army helicopters on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower for its operations in Haiti in 1994. Similar considerations can be made when a carrier is used for disaster response and humanitarian assistance.

In addition to the aircraft the most recently built Nimitz-class carriers are now armed with three Raytheon GMLS mk29 eight-cell launchers for NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles which has semi-radar terminal guidance. There are also four Raytheon/General Dynamics 20mm Phalanx six-barreled Mk15 close-in weapons systems that have a 3000rpm rate of fire.

While the last of the Nimitz-class carriers have been commissioned and the class will eventually be replaced by the Gerald R. Ford-class these ten carriers will still strike fear into potential U.S. adversaries for many years to come.

This week marked the 40th anniversary of the IBM 5150. A revolutionary invention it brought personal computers into the home.



On August 12 1981 Don Esteridge who was unknown at the time announced the release of the new personal computer created by his company. The head of development at IBM Entry Level Systems presented the 5150 or IBM PC a concept that would revolutionize the computer industry forever.



For many it was difficult to imagine the impact of this new machine. Not least because in essence there was nothing innovative about it. In the 1970s Apple Atari and Commodore were already producing computer models. But the strength of the IBM PC lay mainly in its ability to outsource the production of its components to other companies. As soon as it was released the company decided to publish the design and software code of the model allowing other players in the sector to design compatible products. In the IBM PC the processor was an Intel 8088 the floppy drive was from Tandon and the operating system was Microsoft's QDOS. IBM on the other hand supplied only the monitor keyboard and system unit.



Little by little the personal computer became more commonplace in homes whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance. And in 1983 Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.



Backlash to the rapid success

But the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry without much verification afterwards. Meanwhile Bill Gates's Microsoft a newcomer to the operating system market had set about establishing a dominant position. Other companies such as Compaq Dell or HP were also starting to manufacture personal computers more or less legally with respect to IBM. Within a short time competitors took over the PC market. In 2005 IBM sold its PC production business to Lenovo for $1.3 billion. At the end of the 2000's IBM group managers were even predicting the end of the PC...",https://news.google.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_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM and University of Liverpool Researchers Introduce An AI Algorithm That Saves 500000 CPU hours On Simulation And Quickly Identifies New Materials For Gas Storage,"Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 Shares

IBM has created an algorithm that can intelligently tell the computer which simulations are worth running and focus resources on them. The hope is to make it easier for scientists to do materials discovery by making computationally intensive simulation runs more efficient.

A team of researchers from IBM and the University of Liverpool teamed up to create an algorithm that cuts CPU hours (CPUh) by over 500000 on expensive simulation campaigns. This allowed them to identify new materials for gas storage quickly. The team describes their work in a research paper “Accelerating Computational Discovery of Porous Solids Through Improved Navigation of Energy Structure Function Maps” published in Science Advances. This research is part of a family of algorithms called Bayesian optimization which has been applied in various scenarios.

IBM researchers have developed a simple service called IBM Bayesian Optimization (IBO) that allows users to easily get the value from using these algorithms without themselves having to become experts in optimization.

The application of Bayesian optimization to materials discovery is maturing as it forms a key part in IBM’s Accelerated Discovery strategy. The method provides computational savings and allows for the user to either do something they could not afford before or do more with their present budget than ever before.

https://research.ibm.com/blog/ai-for-materials-screening

To apply this technique to a real materials discovery problem the research team asked their algorithm to simultaneously hunt for materials with good gas storage properties that are easy enough to observe in the lab.

In this research paper the team demonstrates how they achieved success by extending their algorithm called Batch Generalized Thompson Sampling. They developed it to deal with multiple objectives (in this case gas storage property score and lattice energy) which is why they show that it can be applied to accelerate a new technique known as Energy Structure Function (ESF) Maps. These ESF maps are powerful for computational materials design but expensive enough not to try for routine use.

Despite all of its progress the IBM research team still faces some obstacles. For example it’s difficult to work with a variety of constraints and objectives without passing that complexity onto the user. Another obstacle is taking into account this data from multiple sources during an optimization process.

There are different ways to keep yourself up to date whether by attending conferences following data science leaders on Twitter reading blogs and research papers or following data science channels on YouTube. One way that helped me stay on track is by listening to data science podcasts. I find myself tuning in when I am in the gym hiking or in the car. In this article I will list the 4 podcasts that I listen to most and I highly recommend you check them out for yourself. Before I start I would like to remind you to check out my article from last week where I talk about the 5 YouTubers I follow and help me break into the industry. Check out the link below:

1.) Towards Data Science

The Towards Data Science podcast is on top of my list. I really enjoy Jeremie Harris who is the host of the show. His guests are quality and you really learn tons from the episodes. What I like a lot about Jeremie is the fact that he explains certain terms or concepts in the middle of a show that many people aren’t familiar with so that you can follow the discussion easier. In addition to that you can also watch the episodes on YouTube. Jeremie is the Co-Founder of SharpestMinds and he definitely got me hooked to the podcast. My favorite episodes are where he discusses AI ethics. See below the link for one of the latest episodes on YouTube and check it out for yourself.

In addition to that I have also provided the apple podcast link so you can have a look at the topics of all the different episodes.

2.) IBM Making Data Simple

Second on my list is the podcast called Making Data Simple from IBM. Al Martin the host is currently the Global VP Expert Labs Development Services Cloud and Cognitive Software at IBM. Before that he was the VP of Data and A.I. Development at IBM. Al discusses the latest ideas on big data & A.I in his shows and he is super knowledgeable. I really like Al because he really digs in deep to get the right information from the questions he asks his guests. If you are interested check out the link below to learn more about the podcasts.

3.) Data Skeptic

Another podcast that I highly encourage you all to look into is called Data Skeptic. It is a weekly podcast covering various topics in data science statistics machine learning and A.I. The host of this show is Kyle Polich who is very knowledgeable. He also does a great job of asking the right questions and does really well simply explaining the concepts. I also like the variety of topics that are being discussed in his shows. If you are interested in learning more about his podcast check out the link below.

4.) The TWIML AI Podcast

The TWIML AI podcast started in 2016 and is by now one of the big players in the field. Sam Charrington the host is an expert in business and consumer application of machine learning and AI. In addition to that he focuses on bringing AI-powered products to market. This is also a weekly podcast and the majority of the episodes are about Machine Learning & AI. This podcast has been around for a long time and it has released 500+ episodes. In addition to that it has a big community so I definitely recommend you checking them out. Like the Towards Data Science podcast you also have the option to watch the episodes on YouTube.

Final Words:

When I started listening to data science podcasts I was only aware of the Towards Data Science podcast. Thanks to my colleagues I got introduced to many different shows and I have to say that the 4 that I have listed above are definitely the ones I have learned most from. The hosts make a big difference and each one of them is very good in their own ways making it enjoyable to switch the shows around from time to time. I try to tune in at least once a week. It really helps me stay up to date with the latest in the field and you definitely learn a lot. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article there are various ways of keeping yourself updated. Listening to the above-mentioned podcasts is definitely one way you can’t go wrong with it.

If you enjoyed this article I’d be very grateful if you would share it on any social media platforms. If you listen to any other data science podcasts that I haven’t listed feel free to write them in the comment section. I would love to get introduced to different podcasts.

As the family’s longtime home Chicago has a unique connection to the Obamas as does the Art Institute. Michelle Obama recalls visiting frequently with her family when she was growing up on the South Side and the museum was also the site of the couple’s first date.

Not only do the portraits feature history-making subjects but they were made by groundbreaking artists. Wiley and Sherald are the first African Americans to be commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to create official portraits of a president or first lady. Wiley placed a seated President Obama against a backdrop of flowers with special significance including chrysanthemums the official flower of Chicago. Sherald captured the former first lady against light-blue ground sitting and gazing directly at the viewer.

The Art Institute is thrilled to provide our visitors—from Chicago and around the world—the opportunity to experience the power and beauty of these celebrated works in our galleries. After the Art Institute presentation the portraits will travel on to the Brooklyn Museum Los Angeles County Museum of Art High Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts Houston.

Acer sent me a sample of their Nitro 5 AN515-57 the code name for the 2021 model built on Intel Tiger Lake 11th gen Core i7 and i5 hardware. It’s an early sample but runs on the latest software available as of early August 2021 so I feel confident to share my findings with you in this article with the reserve that some aspects might still change with future BIOS updates.

Our test configuration is the Intel Core i7-11800H processor paired with an RTX 3070 Laptop dGPU and 16 GB of memory in dual channel (but single rank sticks) pretty much the top specs you will be able to buy on this Nitro 5 sub-lineup. So let’s see what this is all about.

The specs sheet as previewed– Acer Nitro 5 AN515-57

Acer offers the 2021 Nitro 5 series in a multitude of configurations and in either 15 to 17-inch screen sizes.

As far as the Nitro 5 AN515-57 sub-family goes I’d expect your best bang for the buck in either the affordable 6Core i5-11400H + RTX 3050Ti configuration or the mid-tier variant based on the 8Core i7-11800H + RTX 3060. Both should be very competitive in their price segments and you should follow this link for more details on the configurations available in your region at the time you’re reading this article.

Update: In the meantime Acer offer updated models in this segment with the Acer Nitro 16 and Nitro 17 series.

Design and exterior

Design-wise the Nitro 5 series has been fairly consistent over the years just cleaner in branding and red accents with each update. As a result this 2021 generation is entirely black with muted black Acer branding elements on the lid and under the screen and just a little bit of red on the back edge.

Plastic is used for the entire construction. The interior and lid have a smooth soft feel and this sort of finishing that resembles dark sand with some sparkly elements integrated into the plastic. They look fine but show smudges easily. The underside is a rougher kind of plastic.

The whole thing is averagely compact and lightweight but not as small as other laptops in this class as you can tell from the bezels around the screen. It’s also fairly well made with still some flex in the lid and the keyboard deck but not the kind that should bother you with daily use or pose any reliability issues while lugging this around in your backpack.

As far as the practicality of using this Nitro every day I don’t like the pointy corners and sharp lips that Acer still implement on this notebook and I’m not a big fan of having the status LEDs under the screen either. Those aside though no complaints.

The rubber feet offer excellent grip on the desk the hinges are strong and still allow single-hand adjustments and the screen goes back to about 160 degrees on the back so almost flat.

The IO is lined on the sides with the exception of the power plug which is conveniently tucked away behind the screen on the back edge. The video outs and the single USB-C port are on the right side so connecting an external monitor might clutter your mouse area.

As a novelty for this Intel-based Nitro 5 AN515-57 series there’s HDMI 2.1 support (hooked into the Nvidia GPU) and the USB-C port supports Thunderbolt 4 and video output via DP; the previous Nitro 5s offered data-only via USB-C and HDMI 2.0b. There’s still no USB-C charging though and no card-reader or any kind of biometrics.

Keyboard and trackpad

Acer still offers the Nitro 5 series with either a red or a 4-zone RGB keyboard and we have this latter variant here.

The LEDs get bright enough and there’s a Caps-Lock indicator unlike on most other Acer laptops but I still don’t like that you need to press a key to reactivate the lighting once it switches off (you can also disable the time off in Nitro Sense if you want to). You also get the option to configure the lighting from the Nitro Sense app.

Overall this is a standard Acer keyboard the kind they put on most of their Nitro and Predator models. It’s a full layout with a smaller NumPad section at the right and full-sized but squeezed in arrow keys.

Layout aside this is a very good typer with quiet and precise strokes and just the right feedback for my typing style the right balance of stiffness and mushiness. No complaints here.

The clickpad works fine with swipes gestures taps and everyday use. The physical clicks are smooth and not that clunky either. However this is only average in size by today’s standards and it’s a plastic surface and while it’s smooth enough for the finger to easily glide over it it doesn’t feel as nice as the glass inputs available in higher-tier laptops.

It’s also slightly shifted to the left side of the laptop and centered under the Space key which might take some time to get used to especially if you’re coming from a centered layout without a NumPad.

As for biometrics there aren’t any on this laptop.

Screen

Acer offers a couple of different screen options for the 2021 Nitro 5 series with several FHD 144Hz options and a QHD 165Hz panel for the higher-tier configurations.

What we have here on this sample is the base-level 144Hz panel made by AU Optronics which is a fairly poor panel choice but in line with what the competition offers in this segment on the base specs: 60% sRGB color coverage 250-nits of brightness and slow response times despite the 144 Hz refresh rate.

Here’s what we got in our tests with an X-Rite i1 Display Pro sensor:

Panel HardwareID: AU Optronics AUOAF90 (B156HAN08.4);

Coverage: 59.1% sRGB 41.1% AdobeRGB 42.2% DCI P3;

Measured gamma: 2.16;

Max brightness in the middle of the screen: 237.75 cd/m2 on power;

Min brightness in the middle of the screen: 18.90 cd/m2 on power;

Contrast at max brightness: 1267:1;

White point: 7000 K;

Black on max brightness: 0.18 cd/m2;

PWM: No.

Response: ~36 ms GtG (via NBC).

The panel is fairly well calibrated out of the box though and the uniformity blacks and contrast levels are solid at this level. I also haven’t noticed any light bleeding on our sample.

Nonetheless I’d look for a configuration with the higher-quality BOE panel (300+ nits 100% sRGB faster response) that we’ve tested on the previous Nitro 5 2021 model it’s a much nicer screen overall and better suited for fast-paced games thanks to the improved response times.

Hardware and performance

Our test model is a mixed-specced configuration of the Acer Nitro 5 in the 2021 AN515-57 model with an Intel Tiger Lake Core i7-11800H processor 16 GB of DDR4 3200 MHz RAM in dual channel (2x single rank chips) 1 TB of storage (WD SN530 included drive) and dual graphics: the Nvidia RTX 3070 Laptop dGPU and the Iris Xe iGPU within the Intel platform with Optimus. There’s no MUX switch here and the display is hooked up through the Intel iGPU.

Before we proceed keep in mind that this is an early-review model with the software available as of early August 2021 (BIOS v1.05 Nitro Sense 3.01.3024 GeForce Game Ready 471.41 drivers). Some aspects might change with future software updates.

Spec-wise this 2021 Acer Nitro 5 variant is built on the latest Intel 11th gen Tiger Lake Core H platform with an option for the 8Core i7-11800H that we have here or a 6Core i5-11400H on lesser configurations. Both are fast processors with a design TDP of 45W but the ability to run at higher power in this chassis in sustained loads.

The GPU is an Nvidia RTX 3070 Laptop running at around 80W in our tests as of right now. However with Dynamic Boost 2.0 this should ramp it up to 85-90W on the retail models based on our experience with other Nitro models and that might impact some of our findings. We’ll explain below. The 3060 variant should run at similar power levels while the 3050Ti is a 60-80W variant. If interested here’s a comparison of the 3050Ti 3060 and 3070 graphics chips at similar power levels.

The RAM on our configuration is a kit of 2x 8GB single-rank sticks running in dual-channel. This being an Intel configuration the impact of single-rank memory is smaller than on the AMD models but you might still get improved performance if you decide to upgrade for a kit of dual-rank DDR4 3200 MHz memory. We’ll further test this in a following article.

As for the storage Acer puts a WD SN530 on this Nitro 5 a mid-range PCIe SSD. PCIe gen4 SSDs are also supported by the Intel 11th gen platform if you’re looking to upgrade to faster storage although this included one is plenty fast for daily use.

For what is worth the Nitro 5 series is among the last laptops to still allow space inside for a 2.5″ storage drive (and the connector is included in the box). However that does mean there’s only room for a smaller battery on this series.

Getting inside to the components is a simple job on this laptop you just have to pop up the back panel hold in place by a couple of Philips screws. Inside you’ll find the RAM and storage slots the wifi chip the thermal module the 58 Wh battery and the tiny set of speakers.

Specs aside this Nitro is controllable through the included Nitro Sense application which allows access to power profiles battery keyboard and audio settings. There’s also an Acer Care app that handles updates as well as a handful of other software that comes preinstalled. Acer laptops still get a fair bit of bloatware these days which I’d recommend getting rid of (or reinstall a clean Windows variant).

The power profiles are Power Saver Balance and High-Performance with an impact on the fans’ behaviors and CPU/GPU power limits.

For daily use I’d keep the laptop on Balance or even Power Saver which is the quietest of the three profiles and still provides a snappy experience. The fans are still always active but spinning at sub 35 dB with daily chores so only noticeable in a quiet room. Here’s what to expect in terms of performance and temperatures with everyday multitasking browsing and video.

On to more demanding loads we start by testing the CPU’s performance by running the Cinebench R15 test for 15+ times in a loop with 1-2 seconds delay between each run.

The Intel i7 processor stabilizes at ~65W of sustained power on the High-Performance setting which translates in frequencies of 3.6+ GHz temperatures in the mid-90s C scores of ~1800 points and the fans spinning at around 44-45 dB at head-level. The performance is thermally limited and drops by around 10-15% from the first runs as the heat builds up.

Lifting up the back of the laptop in order to allow for fresh air to more easily get into the fans has a positive impact on the temperatures and thus the performance.

Switching over to the Balance profile quiets down the fans to around 40-41 dB with a slight drop in TDP clocks and scores but still high temperatures.

On Power Saver the processor is more severely capped with quieter fans at sub 37 dB.

Finally the CPU runs at 25 W of power on battery on the High-Performance profile with scores of 1000- points. Details below.

To put these findings in perspective the Intel Core i7-11800H in this Nitro 5 fares similarly to the same i7 implemented by Acer in their Predator Helios 300 but runs at lower power and higher temperatures here. The same i7-11800H can perform faster in designs that allow for even higher-power allocations while the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor tends to outperform the i7 at even lower power in various designs including the AMD-based version of the Nitro 5.

We also ran the 3DMark CPU profile test where the Intel i7-11800H in this Nitro came about 10-15% behind other higher-power i7-11800H models we’ve tested which is on par with the results above.

We then went ahead and further verified our findings with the more taxing Cinebench R23 loop test and the gruesome Prime 95 on the Turbo profile. The CPU stabilizes at 58+ W in High-Performance on Cinebench R23 with the laptop sitting on the desk and fans on Auto or 65W if you switch the fans on Max. Once more thermals are the limiting factor in both these taxing loads especially with the laptop sitting on the desk.

We also ran our combined CPU+GPU stress tests on this notebook. 3DMark stress runs the same test for 20 times in a loop and looks for performance variation and degradation over time and this unit passed it which suggests there are no significant performance losses that might be caused by thermal throttling on this laptop.

Next we ran the entire suite of tests and benchmarks on the stock High-Performance profile in Nitro Sense.

These are very good results for a laptop in this class especially on the GPU side where this more power-limited RTX 3070 comes close to the higher power 3070 we’ve tested in the Asus TUF A15. And don’t forget that the 3070 in this Nitro is not overclocked by default on the High-Performance profile.

We did overclock it with MSI Afterburner ending up stable at +150 MHz Core and +300 MHz Memory and that resulted in a slight bump in GPU scores but also a drop in CPU and Combined scores.

All in all there is still only an 80-85W 3070 in this Nitro 5 so proper higher-power implementations will outmatch it in performance. And the same can be said about the 3060 configurations although those are more likely better value for your money in this chassis with their more affordable pricing.

The CPU scores are OK as well at within 80-90% of what the i7-11800H platform would be capable of in an ideal design. This is once more in line with our other findings that suggest a slight CPU limitation for this Nitro 5 platform in comparison to other products out there so if you’re looking for a more competent CPU I’d advise opting for the AMD-based configuration of the Nitro 5 instead at the AMD Ryzen 7 delivers superior performance in a more efficient package.

However don’t forget that most of the laptops in this class ship with single-rank memory and that’s going to quite significantly impact the performance of those AMD configurations especially in some combined workloads and games.

With these out of the way let’s look at some games.

We ran a couple of DX11 DX12 and Vulkan titles on the stock High-Performance and the High-Performance OC (with the overclocked GPU) profiles on FHD (internal and external screen) and QHD (external monitor) resolutions.

These are excellent results for an RTX 3070 80-85W Max-Q chip within 5-10% of what an RTX 3070 80-100W delivers in a superior chassis such as the ROG Zephyrus M16 and 10-15% better than what we got in the higher-power RTX 3070 80-90W configuration of the Predator Helios 300. I might add this sample did surprisingly well here and I wouldn’t be surprised if Acer decides to nerf the hardware with future BIOS updates in order to keep the thermals a little lower.

In this sample the GPU runs at around 80 degrees Celsius on the stock High-Performance profile but the CPU averages temperatures in the 90s and both are higher than what we tested on other recent Nitro 5s which tend to favor lower temperatures. We’ll see what Acer decide to do about this with their future software updates.

These kinds of temperatures don’t leave a lot of room for overclocking the GPU on our sample which combined with the limited TGP translates in little gains on the overclocked profiles.

You do get the ability to manually adjust the fans. On Auto they spin at around 45-46 dB at head-level but you can push them up to their max which results in noise levels of 50+ dB and a noticeable impact on the internal temperatures.

I wouldn’t do that but instead just lift up the laptop from the desk. This alone improves the airflow of fresh air into the fans and lowers the temperatures by 3-5 degrees and if you’re looking for even lower temperatures you can consider using one of those active cooling pads with this Nitro configuration.

Finally you can also game on an external monitor if you’re looking to benefit from a better screen and eliminate the small performance toll taken by Optimus here. You can also game with the lid closed and the laptop placed in a vertical stand with even better temperatures than when keeping the laptop on a desk.

All in all this i7+RTX 3070 configuration of the Nitro 5 AN515-57 is an excellent performer in games even if it doesn’t offer a MUX and the display is connected via the iGPU. The impact of Optimus or the fact that Acer puts dual-channel SR memory on this series seems to be considerably more reduced here than on the AMD variants something to keep in mind if gaming sits high at the top of your priorities’ list. I would advise straying away from this AU Optronics panel though and try to find a configuration with the superior BOE FHD 144hz panel instead.

Noise Heat Connectivity speakers and others

The thermal design is simple yet efficient here with two fans and a few thick heatpipes that connect to the components and VRMs through thick metal plates.

Air is sucked in through the open cuts on the underbelly and expelled through the back out the way. As mentioned already because Acer put slim rubber feet on this laptop the intakes are slightly choked up while this sits on a desk that’s why slightly raising it up or placing it in a vertical stand has such a significant impact on the temperatures.

On a desk the internal temperatures raise up quite a bit in combined loads and games with averagely noisy fans at 45-46 dB on the High-Performance profile. These findings are a lot different than what we got on the AMD versions of the 2021 Nitro 5 but the performance is also much better here.

The outer shell temperatures are pretty good though with only some hotspots around the components. No complaints here.

With daily use the fan noise (on the Balance and Power Saver modes) is limited and only audible in a quiet room especially when using the laptop unplugged. The two fans are always active though so never go idle.

*Daily Use – streaming Netflix in EDGE for 30 minutes Balance Profile fans at <37 dB

*Gaming – High Performance – Auto fans – playing Far Cry 5 for 30 minutes fans at 45-46 dB

For connectivity there’s Gigabit Lan and Wireless 6 + Bluetooth through Realtek/Intel chips on this unit. This Intel configuration of the Nitro 5 seems to get a higher-quality WiFi module but we haven’t noticed any differences during our use of any of the 2021 nItro 5 models that we’ve tested nor near the router and at 30+ feet away with obstacles in between.

The speakers fire through cuts on the underbelly and are among the weakest aspects of this Nitro 5 series. We measured volumes of only around 73-75 dB at head-level and experienced average sound quality with little at the lower end (on the Music profile in Nitro Sense). You’ll most likely want to hook up some headphones with this if you care about the audio quality.

Finally the camera is placed on top of the screen flanked by microphones. It’s OK for occasional calls and I might argue slightly better quality than what you’ll normally get on mid-range laptops these days.

Battery life

There’s still only a 58Wh battery inside the Acer Nitro 5 series as the rest of the space is occupied by the 2.5″ storage drive. This is smaller than what the competition offers these days.

Here’s what we got on our review unit with the screen’s brightness set at around 120 nits (~70 brightness).

17 W (~3+ h of use) – text editing in Google Drive Power Saver Mode screen at 70% Wi-Fi ON;

– text editing in Google Drive Power Saver Mode screen at 70% Wi-Fi ON; 16.5 W (~3-4 h of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Power Saver Mode screen at 70% Wi-Fi ON;

– 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Power Saver Mode screen at 70% Wi-Fi ON; 14 W (~4-5 h of use) – Netflix fullscreen in Edge Power Saver Mode screen at 70% Wi-Fi ON;

– Netflix fullscreen in Edge Power Saver Mode screen at 70% Wi-Fi ON; 18 W (~3+ h of use) – browsing in Edge Balance Mode screen at 70% Wi-Fi ON.

As expected the Intel platform is not as efficient as the AMD models tested earlier and when paired with the small battery the runtimes end up this short. The fact that the screen runs at 144 Hz on battery and does not switch to 60 Hz takes a toll as well so you might want to manually switch it over to further increase the runtimes. All in all don’t expect more than 2-4 hours of daily use on a charge on this Nitro 5 model.

This configuration comes with a compact 180W power brick with long cables. The battery fills up in about 2 hours and USB-C charging is not supported.

Price and availability– Acer Nitro 5 AN515-57

At this point this Intel-based version of the 2021 Acer Nitro 5 AN515-57 is not yet widely available in stores but you should follow this link for the latest updated prices and configurations available in your region at the time you’re reading this article.

The base-level configuration built on the Intel i5 processor and RTX 3050Ti are sporadically listed at around 900-1000 USD/EUR/GBP with some even cheaper configurations with older GTX 1650 graphics.

Your best bet is in the RTX 3060 models available from 1200 EUR in Germany and 1100 GBP in the UK but make sure you’re getting the better-quality FHD screen or even the QHD option if possible. That base FHD panel is just not good enough for this day and age at these price points.

The RTX 3070 configurations would demand 200-300 USD/EUR extra over the 3060s for a roughly ~20% gain in GPU performance. Normally I wouldn’t recommend a 3070 in this sort of chassis but our test unit performed really well and even outmatched the 3070 Predator Helios 300 so unless Acer somehow limit the retail models with future BIOS updates the 3070 configurations might not be a bad deal here. Just beware of those internal temperatures.

We’ll update once we know more and in the meantime follow this link for the latest updated prices and configurations available in your region.

Final thoughts– Acer Nitro 5 AN515-57

All in all this Intel-based variant of the 2021 Nitro 5 is quite a lot different than the AMD model we’ve tested before. However we did test them several months apart and with different software so in the meantime the AMD variant might also be a lot closer to this Intel model. At that time though we found the AMD model a lesser performer than this Intel variant but also a more efficient product that ran at lower temperatures and with quieter fans.

Both are very competitive multi-purpose laptops with the 3050Ti configurations at around the 1000 USD/EUR mark and the 3060s as the superior performers at around 1200-1400. They do have to face tough competition from the likes of the Lenovo Legion 5 (also reviewed here in a different variant) HP Omen 15 or the Asus TUF Gaming A15/F15 series but based on local availability and pricing these Nitros could be the best options among these in some regions. Follow this link for a more detailed looked at the best gaming laptops of the moment at various price ranges and classes.

As for whether to go Intel or AMD on the 2021 Nitro 5 I’d go with the Intel configurations if I’d be primarily looking for a gaming machine or work laptop for applications that are favored by the Intel platform such as content creation in the Adobe suite. However I’d stay away from the base-level FHD 144Hz screen that we had on our test unit and try to get the better quality 144Hz BOE panel instead or even reach out for the sharper QHD option.

As for the AMD model that’s going to last longer on a charge run more efficiently and most likely offer superior CPU sustained performance; at the same time though the combined and gaming experience would be more aggressively impacted by Optimus and the fact that these laptops ship with single-rank memory. So if you opt for an AMD variant and plan to game on it consider upgrading the RAM as well.

Still given the AMD AN515-45 Nitro 5 has been available in stores for a while now you might find it for less than a matching AN515-57 configuration which would leave you enough to upgrade the RAM within the same total cost.

That wraps up our review of the Acer Nitro 5 AN515-57 but I’d love to hear your thoughts on it so get in touch down below.

ASUS's ROG STRIX LC II AIO Liquid Coolers Feature LGA 1700 Support Bracket For Intel Alder Lake Desktop CPU Compatibility

Website Xfastest provided pictures of the updated packaging that shows that the kit is relabeled to show the Intel compatibility.

In addition to the original LGA 115X 1200 and AM4 fasteners the internal accessories of the radiator also provide the back plate support screws and mounting brackets used by the LGA 1700. This set of fasteners supports sizes of 78 x 78 and 75 x 75 ; This means that in addition to the LGA 1700 support for this set of buckles the next generation of pins seems to also support it. — user lin.sinchen of Xfastest.com

Asetek utilizes the same kit and because their coolers are used for other brands it makes sense that they would be compatible with the Intel chipset. Secondly the fasteners for the kit appear to be adjustable between 75mm to 78mm. Intel has rumored to possibly changing the size of the LGA 1700 sockets in the future which means more compatibility. So even though AMD is releasing its new LGA 1718 socket for its AM4 platform this specific kit will apparently not be utilized by that.

2 of 9

It is reported that the soon-to-be-released ASUS ROG Maximus XIV motherboards utilize the Intel Z690 series chip architecture which is expected to launch by the end of 2021. This will appear before the B660 and H670 chip series.

Because the kit is a new addition to the ASUS ROG STRIX II cooler line it is possible that some consumers will not have the kit in their product packaging. ASUS is expected to alleviate this problem by providing a way for customers to request or apply for the additional kit should they not receive it. Do note that other manufacturers such as MSI have also announced full support for LGA 1700 Socket CPUs on their AIO liquid coolers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9hbGxlZ2VkLWludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrLXNob3dzLXVwLWluLWJhc2VtYXJrLWJlbmNobWFyay1kYXRhYmFzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alleged Intel Core i9-12900K shows up in BaseMark benchmark database,"Please note that this post is tagged as a rumor .

Intel Core i9-12900K on Windows 11 OS appears with 12 cores in BaseMark leak

Since not all benchmarks are yet fully compatible with Intel’s heterogeneous technology it is impossible to confirm whether the results are fake or just showing wrong data.

Intel Core i9-12900K has now appeared in the BaseMark database with 12 cores and a CPU speed of 3200 MHz. As we have already learned from previous leaks this CPU is to feature 16 cores in total and 24 threads. The full core count includes 8 high-performance (big) cores as well as 8 high-efficiency (small) cores. This is why BaseMark might be showing the wrong data simply dividing the thread count (24) by two or possibly somebody is just having fun with sharing invalid data.

Assuming that the leak is true though it may also be important to note is that the platform for this alleged Alder Lake CPU is Acer Z69H6-AM. This product name has not been seen in any leak yet but it does appear to refer to the Z690 platform. Thus this could potentially be Acer’s own motherboard with an LGA1700 socket. The manufacturer already offers its own desktop gaming systems including the Predator series offering high-end parts such as Intel 11th Gen Rocket Lake CPUs. Naturally a successor with the 12th Gen Core series is also to be expected.

The alleged Core i9-12900K processor was tested with the Windows 22000.132 build which is actually the latest beta of Windows 11.

Alleged Intel Core i9-12900K Source: BaseMark

In the BaseMark High DirectX 12 GPU profile test the system scored 17744 points which is more or less in line with existing RTX 3080 scores in the BaseMark Powerboard.

The 12th Gen Core series should now be available as qualification samples to Intel board partners and OEMs who are currently validating the performance and optimizing their platforms for the upcoming launch now rumored to be in October.

The new Alder Lake-S flagship processor has 12 cores and a CPU clock of 3.2GHz on the BaseMark database but we've been hearing it'll be a 16-core 24-thread CPU. This will see 8 high-performance cores (with HT) and 8 high-efficiency cores for 24 threads in total on the Core i9-12900K processor.

Intel's Core i9-12900K processor was reportedly run on an ""Acer Z69H6-AM"" which going by the Z69 part of the product name could mean a new Acer Z690 motherboard which would be capable of taking a new 12th Gen Core ""Alder Lake"" CPU.

Acer also makes desktop gaming PCs so it could be a next-gen Acer desktop gaming PC with the flagship Intel Core i9-12900K processor. I'm sure it'll be baked into a new Acer Predator gaming PC something we'll see unveiled after October 2021 when Alder Lake is expected to drop... or maybe at CES 2022 in January.

Indeed its emergence as a dominant economic and political actor might be the most important development in Africa since the end of the Cold War. This paper analyses China's economic and political relations with Africa beginning in the 1990s. It argues that the concern is not that China has expanded its economic and political presence in the African continent; rather that the other stakeholders have ignored it for long.

Introduction

China’s relations with the African continent[a] date back to the 15th century. In the Ming Imperial Tomb in Beijing is a wall painting of a giraffe—it was the famous Chinese admiral and seafarer Zheng He who brought it to the court in Nanjing during one of several expeditions to the Arab world and the east coast of Africa between 1413 and 1419.

In modern times official relations were established with South Africa after Sun Yat-sen was elected Provisional President of the Young Republic of China in 1911. As the communist leadership consolidated its hold on power in the early 1950s China launched a more active policy of establishing contacts in Africa. Under the shadow of the Cold War 29 leaders from political movements in Africa and Asia assembled in Bandung Indonesia in April 1955. They discussed peace economic development and decolonisation and agreed to increase cooperation between the peoples of the “third world” a term coined by China’s then leader Mao Zedong.

Although China at the time was relatively underdeveloped it provided extensive assistance to emerging African countries. A well-known example from the early 1970s is the Tanzam railway project which connected the copper belts in Zambia with the port of Dar Es Salaam. This enabled Zambia to export copper without having to pass through South Africa or Rhodesia.

This analysis focuses on the period beginning in the 1990s when China first pondered a “grander strategy” for Africa. The paper makes an assessment of the implications of increased economic political and military exchanges between China and Africa.

To be sure there is no dearth in literature on China’s activities in Africa. Some authors are critical and use the term “neo-colonialism” to describe the relationship. Dan Blumenthal a US-based expert on China for instance has written: ”The Chinese Communist Party’s long-term strategic objective is to displace the United States as the world’s most powerful country and create a new world order favorable to China’s authoritarian brand of politics or its “socialist market economy.”[1] Others argue that loans and aid from China have an underlying agenda: to make African states dependent on China and make them more compliant in international contexts where China is dependent on the voices of these states such as within the UN or in issues such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. A third group sees China’s operations in Africa as rather favourable with infrastructure being expanded and modernised.

The rest of the paper attempts to answer the question of whether China-Africa relations have further strategic objectives and in particular if China views its economic relations with Africa as a means for pursuing wider political purposes. The paper outlines the political and normative differences between the West’s[b] and China’s relations with Africa and gives an account of China’s military and strategic initiatives on the continent. Finally it asks: How should African states and the wider international community respond to China’s increased presence in Africa?

China’s Economic Relations with Africa

Until the late 1970s the People’s Republic of China’s economic relations with Africa were driven by ideological imperatives. Today China’s political leadership view economic relations with the continent as a means to achieve the country’s development goals. Within a few decades China has emerged as Africa’s biggest bilateral trading partner Africa’s biggest bilateral lender as well as one of the biggest foreign investors in the continent.[c]

Chinese companies have entered almost all African markets. Today there are more than 1000 of them operating in Africa; some one million people of Chinese descent reside in the continent.[2] Many of these Chinese companies in Africa are privately owned while others are wholly or partly state-owned. Within this framework Chinese companies have great degrees of freedom to operate in Africa on market terms in addition to being backed by Chinese investment capital on favourable terms.

Trade in goods and services

China’s trade with Africa was limited in the 1990s and began increasing substantially around 2005 (see Figure 1). Chinese exports to Africa[3] amounted to USD 113 billion in 2019 while imports from Africa[4] reached USD 78 billion; the volumes have been steadily increasing for the past 16 years. To be sure weak commodity prices in the period 2014-2017 had a massive impact on the value of African exports to China even while Chinese exports to Africa remained steady. With a total trade of USD 200 billion in 2019 China is Africa’s biggest bilateral trade partner.

Figure 1. China’s trade in goods and services with Africa (1992-2019 in USD billion current prices)

In 2019 Chinese exports to North Africa (Algeria Egypt Libya Morocco and Tunisia) amounted to USD 27 billion or 23.8 percent of the total to the entire continent while imports from North Africa reached USD 7 billion. More than two-thirds of Chinese trade with Africa thus takes place with the countries located in Sub-Saharan Africa.

China trades with almost all 53 countries in Africa. Table 1 shows however that China’s six biggest export destinations absorb over half of its total exports to the continent. South Africa is China’s principal export market followed by Nigeria and Egypt.

Table 1. China’s largest export markets in Africa (2019)

Table 2 shows similar geographical patterns in Chinese imports. Six countries make up 68 percent of total exports with Angola accounting for almost one-third. From Angola and Libya China mainly imports oil; from Gabon come oil and manganese. The Republic of Congo mainly provides oil and minerals and the DRC cobalt and copper. South Africa mostly exports chemical products platinum iron and steel to China.

Table 2. China’s key import destinations in Africa (2019)

Figure 2 shows that while China´s trade with Africa has increased substantially in absolute numbers it still amounts to only around four percent of Chinese foreign trade across the globe.

Figure 2. Chinese trade with Africa as percent of China’s foreign trade (2000-2018)

Figure 3. Share in African exports of goods (2019)

Figure 4. Share in total African imports (2019)

Comparing figures 3 and 4 with figure 2 one can see that from an African perspective trade with China represents a much higher share of Africa’s foreign trade. Figure 3 shows that China absorbs around 11 percent of Africa’s global export of goods. As a trading bloc the European Union (EU) is Africa’s biggest export market making up 31 percent of total African exports; India is the destination for 8 percent of all African exports the US 5 percent and UAE 4 percent.

Figure 4 shows a similar geographical pattern regarding African imports of goods. While India’s trade with Africa does not match that of China India has nevertheless established itself as one of Africa’s main bilateral trading partners. For some African countries trade with China is a cornerstone of the economy. For example exports to China amount to over 60 percent of total exports for Angola the Republic of Congo and Zambia.

Africa accounts for 3 percent of global GDP and global trade. Within the EU France is Africa’s biggest trading partner. In comparison with China France’s trade with Africa amounts to 2.5 percent of its global foreign trade and in the case of UK the share is 2 percent. While China’s trade with Africa make up a larger share of its total foreign trade than the share for France and UK these differences are marginal.

Chinese investments in Africa

In 2019 total Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Africa amounted to USD 44 billion which corresponded to 2 percent of global Chinese FDI. Total FDI from the US to Africa was USD 78 billion making it the top investor in the continent. American FDI to Africa however amounted to only 0.7 percent of its total outward FDI. The UK was the second largest investor to Africa with USD 65 billion followed by France with USD 53 billion. For the UK and France FDI to Africa account for 3 percent of their global investment. Therefore while Chinese investments have increased over a few years the totality cannot be said to be extraordinary.

Table 3 shows that in addition to being China’s biggest African trading partner South Africa is the top destination for Chinese investments followed by the DRC Angola and Zambia. Ethiopia – while potentially rich in geothermal energy and with recent developments in hydropower – is the only country listed in the table that cannot be said to be rich in raw materials. Chinese ventures in Ethiopia are mainly in infrastructure and light manufacturing. Around 30 percent of Chinese FDI in Africa is channelled to infrastructure and construction while 25 percent goes to mining and extraction of raw materials.

While Chinese FDI to Africa may not seem unusually large it is worth mentioning that Chinese contract revenues in Africa are substantial. According to data provided by Johns Hopkins University approximately 30 percent of Chinese overseas construction contract revenue derives from African markets.[11]

In 2019 the gross annual revenues of Chinese companies’ engineering and construction projects in Africa totalled USD 46 billion dropping by six percent from 2018. About 20 percent is covered by loans from Chinese financiers.[12] 2018 was however the fourth consecutive year that gross annual revenues of Chinese companies’ construction projects in Africa declined.

Analysis

One can identify three more or less explicitly stated Chinese goals when it comes to economic relations with Africa:[13] access to the continent’s natural resources; export markets for Chinese manufactured goods; and sufficient economic and political stability for China to safeguard its citizens and pursue its economic and commercial interests.

As shown earlier while China has become Africa’s biggest trade partner its trade with Africa as a share of total foreign trade is not remarkably bigger than those of other big trade partners with Africa such as France or UK. It is hardly surprising that China has emerged as Africa´s biggest bilateral trade partner as it is today the biggest bilateral trade partner for many countries. China’s economic growth has increased its need for raw materials particularly industrial metals and fuels. Africa has vast natural resources and owing to low levels of industrialisation a huge export potential. China’s economic growth has made it the global industrial hub and this has been fuelled largely by exports of low-cost manufactured goods. Demand for such products has surged across Africa over the last decades.

China trades with almost all countries in Africa and does not discriminate between regions. On the surface it might seem that China’s economic relations with Africa follow an opportunistic market-based logic. It is partly true and Chinese corporations operating in Africa are guided by commercial opportunities. However such an observation does not provide a complete picture. Chinese political decision-makers consider economic relations with Africa as means to satisfy goals for its own economy and they also facilitate the country’s wider geopolitical aims. This means that commercial relations with some big countries that are rich in raw materials or have other assets that China considers vital—such as Angola and its oil Zambia and copper or DRC and cobalt—are buttressed by close political relations that China has ambitiously pursued.

One relevant question is whether Chinese exports and investments grow to the detriment of others. There is little empirical research on this so far but the data in Figure 5 provides some indications. China surpassed the US as Africa’s top trade partner in 2008. As a trading bloc EU is a bigger trade partner to Africa than China or the US. Indeed the trends for American Chinese and EU-trade with Africa display certain similarities. When Chinese trade with Africa increases so does African trade with the US or EU. It thus need not be the case that higher levels of Chinese trade with Africa automatically translates to lower levels for the US or EU; it could very well be the reverse. It is not clear from this data whether any substitution occurs.[e]

Figure 5. Africa’s trade with the US China and the EU (2002-2019 in USD billion current prices)

One can identify a number of benefits of increased trade with China for Africa. The emergence of China as an additional trade partner was a key factor behind the high economic growth rates in Africa from the late 1990s to 2014. Higher Chinese demand for African exports improved terms of trade in the continent providing the countries with additional financial revenues. With China as a new important trading partner African countries were provided with an additional market for exports and imports. It enabled African nations to diversify foreign trade and become less dependent on trade with the US or EU. Growing trade with China increased Africa’s overall global trade implying that trade creation outpaced trade diversion.

Both gain when China provides African countries with capital goods and cheap consumer goods and African countries supply China with the commodities required to fuel its economic expansion. Moreover when African consumers are given choices in for instance mobile phones they are empowered.

The other side to trade

At the same time international trade comes with indirect impacts that provide challenges to African countries that are more difficult to quantify. For example if Chinese demand for raw materials rises too steeply that it triggers an increase in world market prices it may bring harm to African nations such as Morocco or Ethiopia that are net importers of raw materials.

Furthermore imports of Chinese manufactured goods can displace local workers and enterprises. In the long run—and this area requires more empirical research—Chinese penetration of African markets could hinder the emergence of a nascent African manufacturing sector. Already some recent findings indicate that Chinese exports to Africa may be crowding out exports from the more industrialised economies of Africa notably South Africa.[14] These are however still relative declines; the absolute values of South African exports to the continent continues to increase despite market penetration by China.

It is not surprising that a lot of Chinese investment capital is allocated to infrastructure and extraction of African raw materials. These are areas where Africa has a lot of undercapitalised assets.

African nations have huge investment needs that cannot be met by their small domestic capital markets. Chinese investments provide African nations with modern know-how and technology. Chinese investments in African infrastructure—such as airports railways ports roads and sewage—increase the overall productive capacity of African economies. At the same time this may create dependencies with strategic implications.

Chinese FDI in Africa tends to differ from those coming from Europe Japan or the US. FDI from these countries is usually carried out by independent profit-maximising private companies; meanwhile FDI from China is mostly carried out by companies that are dependent on the Chinese state and backed up by cheap Chinese investment capital. This makes it possible for them to have longer time horizons. Furthermore companies from the West must take into consideration domestic pressure to ensure sustainability ESG[f] and related factors when they venture abroad. Chinese investors do consider such factors but find less pressure implementing them. This might give them an “advantage” if that term maybe used in this context.

One challenge with foreign direct investments allocated to large-scale extractive ventures is that they are capital-intensive but seldom create a lot of jobs for less skilled domestic labour. At the same time they provide substantial tax revenues. As a result of such dynamics African elites have generally welcomed Chinese trade and investment while ordinary Africans sometimes perceive Chinese investments as less benefiting to them.

Focus on Lending

In addition to trade and FDI loans comprise an increasingly important component of China’s economic relations with Africa.

A decade of rock-bottom interest rates has triggered a global search for yield yet not enough private capital has been flowing to Africa. African countries often cannot afford to build the infrastructure they need to support their growing populations. Moreover many of them lack access to international capital markets and banks. In this vacuum China has emerged as Africa’s largest bilateral lender. Indeed the Chinese government and its state-owned banks have lent record amounts to governments in low- and middle-income countries since the early 2000s making China the world’s largest official creditor.

It is estimated that 62 percent of African bilateral debt is owed to Chinese creditors.[15] Research by scholars at the University of Sussex shows that since 2015 China has accounted for 13 percent of bilateral lending to Africa; the next biggest creditor is the US at a much lower 4 percent.[16] According to estimates provided by the SAIS China Africa Research Initiative Chinese credits to Africa amounted to USD 148 billion in 2019. Of this USD 44 billion (29.7 percent) is allocated to investments in infrastructure USD 36 billion to energy and USD 18 billion to mining and extraction.

Chinese loans to Africa have helped finance large-scale investments with potentially significant positive effects for growth. At the same time large lending flows have resulted in the build-up of debt-service burdens. In all Chinese lending to Africa has covered over 1000 projects. Figure 6 shows that most of this has accrued to a limited number of countries in the continent with Angola being by far the biggest debtor. If one looks at the debt burden to China as percent of GDP[17] Djibouti ranks first with 100 percent of GDP followed by the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) (28 percent) Niger (23 percent) Zambia (20 percent) Ethiopia and Zimbabwe (13 percent each) and Angola (12 percent).

Figure 6. Biggest African debtors to China (in USD billion total stock as per 2019)

While China’s dominant footprint in African trade is well documented its lending to Africa is less understood.[18] Analysts point out that unlike other major economies almost all of China’s external lending and portfolio investments are official meaning that they are undertaken by the Chinese government state-owned companies or state-owned banks. [19] Two banks dominated Chinese overseas lending: the Chinese Export-Import Bank and the China Development Bank (CDB). The same study further underlines that China does not fully disclose its official international lending and there is limited standardised data on Chinese overseas stocks and flows.[20] Adding to such paucity commercial providers such as Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters do not keep track of China’s overseas loans. It is therefore difficult to obtain precise information about not only the magnitude of Chinese lending to Africa but also the rates of interest and terms of maturity and the kind of collaterals involved. The situation is thus such that most of China’s bilateral lending is carried out by so-called policy banks and state-owned commercial banks which may be controlled by the Chinese state but operate as legally independent entities not as sovereign lenders.

A 2021 research paper by Anna Gelpern professor of Law at Georgetown University has analysed the structure of Chinese loans to Africa and other developing nations.[21] The authors find that overall China is a muscular and commercially-savvy lender to developing countries. Chinese contracts contain more elaborate repayment safeguards than their peers in the official credit market alongside elements that give Chinese lenders an advantage over other creditors. At the same time many of the terms and conditions the authors of this present paper reviewed exhibit a difference in degree not in kind from commercial and other official bilateral lenders.

According to Gelpern Chinese contracts contain confidentiality clauses that bar borrowers from revealing the terms or even the existence of the debt. Second Chinese lenders seek advantage over other creditors by using collateral arrangements such as lender-controlled revenue accounts and committing to keep the debt out of collective restructuring (“no Paris Club” clauses[g]). Third cancellation acceleration and stabilisation clauses in Chinese contracts potentially allow the lenders to influence debtors’ domestic and foreign policies.

Unlike the members of the Paris Club of the biggest sovereign creditors Chinese loans often require collateral for development loans. Since Chinese loans are backed by collateral they often enjoy a high degree of seniority. If an African country wants to apply for debt relief its Chinese creditors can claim the rights to assets held in escrow. This is another possible inroad for China to claim assets in African countries often mentioned by critics that claim that the country has “neo-colonial” ambitions and methods.

When a country’s debt service burden is not transparent debt sustainability analyses are hampered. For private investors this makes asset pricing difficult. Furthermore a lack of transparency may be an obstacle to crisis resolution since information on the size and composition of a country’s debt is essential to assure fair burden sharing and orderly crisis management. Chinese banks often tend to renegotiate sovereign loans bilaterally and without transparency.

This is among the reasons why Chinese lending to Africa has been the subject of debate and controversy. Some have suggested that Beijing is deliberately pursuing “debt trap diplomacy” imposing harsh terms on its government counterparties and writing contracts that allow it to seize strategic assets when debtor countries run into financial problems. Others argue meanwhile for the benefits of China’s lending and suggest that concerns about harsh terms and a loss of sovereignty are greatly exaggerated. Still others suggest that the debate is largely based on conjecture as neither policymakers nor scholars know if Chinese loan contracts would help or hobble borrowers as few independent observers have seen them. They argue that existing research and policy debate rests upon anecdotal accounts in media reports cherry-picked cases and isolated excerpts from a small number of contracts.[22]

If there is anything that is more certain it is that Chinese lenders are willing to extend loans to poor African countries without demanding much in terms of governance reforms and anti-corruption measures. The result has been projects that are bound by draconian lending conditions are expensive to operate and unlikely ever to produce decent returns.

Over the years China has embarked on a massive lending spree to developing countries mainly as a way of promoting its flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI however has faced growing criticism for flaws such as lending to low-income countries with unstable finances lack of transparency and not considering social and environmental impact studies on the projects they are financing. Bearing in mind that many developing nations in Africa and in other parts of the world have become heavily indebted because of the Covid-19 pandemic China as creditor may have to confront a situation where several of its foreign borrowers will have difficulties living up to contractual undertakings. This could lead to a situation where future Chinese international lending will be more risk-averse and restrictive.

Chinese foreign lending to developing countries already seems to have been reduced in the last few years. From a record figure of USD 75 billion in 2016 Chinese lending in 2019 shrunk to USD 4 billion.[23] Such a massive decline cannot be explained only by a general global economic downturn; it is most certain that this is due to specifically Chinese circumstances.

Future Chinese investments abroad will likely apply far more stringent criteria on the commercial viability of projects. In the past a substantial proportion of Chinese foreign investment had been more about using financial resources to extend the country’s political influence. Putting its reputation on the line for the BRI China will likely put more emphasis on commercial gains from its future investments. It is reasonable to assume that in the future China will no longer be as big of a lender to Africa. As African nations will continue to have substantial needs for foreign capital reduced Chinese lending could open possibilities for others such as the European Union and India.

Over the past decade many African nations have accumulated higher debt-burdens. Each country profile is unique and a lot of this began before China became a big lender. Debt relief for African countries is becoming an important topic on the international agenda. Being a large creditor China will have a significant role in the process. While China does not participate in the Paris Club—used by Western governments to negotiate sovereign debt relief—Chinese creditors have restructured loans in the past and appear willing to renegotiate arrangements and allow borrowers to defer payments. Chinese creditors however prefer such negotiations to take place on a strictly bilateral basis.

China as a Political Factor in Africa

The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held its first ministerial conference in Beijing in October 2000. The forum’s objectives include the promotion of political cooperation and creating a favourable environment for China-Africa business and trade. Other commitments from China are providing special funds to support well-established Chinese enterprises to invest in African countries to cancel debts send extra medical teams and develop student exchanges.[24]

However the literature on China’s political activities in Africa often mention other goals which are considered to guide the Chinese government.[25] One such example is to diplomatically isolate the democratic Republic of China (Taiwan) by persuading African countries to sever diplomatic relations with this nation. Another is to influence attitudes towards Hong Kong. These are examples of China’s underlying goals in cooperating with African countries which would aim to achieve compliance with China’s further geopolitical aspirations.

The question has been raised as to whether China as part of its efforts to achieve these official and unofficial goals wants to export a specific Chinese model for development which can be replicated in other countries in this case those in Africa. Current research points in different directions here and many believe that this should be studied primarily in relation to the African political elites who are regularly invited to China and courted by Chinese diplomats and businesses.[26]

A well-known Chinese political scientist Zhang Weiwei has argued that the specific developments that have taken place in China over the past 40 years are not transferable to other countries. In the book The China Wave: Rise of a Civilizational State published in 2011 Weiwei highlights eight different factors that contribute to China being a unique civilisational state. The first are the four “superfactors”: a super-large population; a super-large territory; a super-long tradition; and a super-rich culture. Then follow the four “unique factors”: a unique language; unique politics; a unique society; and a unique economy.

This interpretation of China’s uniqueness undoubtedly displays a level of pride and self-confidence in relation to one’s own culture. It is not unlike imperialist Europe during the latter part of the 19th century with its self-image of being the most developed part of the world and carrying the responsibility to civilise the rest.

About the Communist Party Weiwei says:

The Chinese Communist Party (CPC) is not a party as the term “party” is understood in the West. At its core the CPC continues a long tradition of a unifying Confucian ruling entity which represents or seeks to represent the interests of the whole of society rather than a Western political party that openly represents certain group interests. [27]

To the extent that this view is shared among the leading political classes in China it could explain why the country today unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War does not actively incite revolutionary movements that aim to install Marxism-Leninism in “third world” countries. Such activism would also not be in line with Chinese business interests as these operate predominantly within the Western capitalist logic and the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It would also run counter to China’s official policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries.

On the other hand China seems to have a clear will to influence political leaders in Africa and other developing countries regardless of whether or not it involves copying its own development model. The authoritarian interpretation of the CPC has also gained ground since Xi Jinping in 2018 received a de facto indefinite mandate as president.

China’s principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries has met with some criticism as it can be argued that it risks weakening the principle of “Responsibility to Protect” or R2P adopted by the United Nations (UN) in 2005—with the support of China. The purpose of R2P was to give the international community a greater opportunity to intervene to protect civilian populations from genocide ethnic cleansing war crimes and other crimes against humanity. This principle is seen as a tool to prevent these abuses from being committed and also to provide a basis for a mandate to intervene if the preventive work fails.

Arthur Waldron professor of International Relations at the University of Pennsylvania believes that the notion of a Chinese policy in Africa based on non-interference in the affairs of other countries needs to be dissected and argues that the Chinese have had few qualms about interfering if judged to be in their own interest.[28] According to Waldron China’s interpretation of the non-interference policy is that foreign policy should not be enslaved by abstract principles but rather guided by pragmatic considerations.

Such policy seems to have the support of Africa’s elites. From the West’s viewpoint it has been argued that this gives China an advantage in business relations with African countries as the political elites there prefer loans aid and business agreements from a great power that does not demand certain liberal rights corruption-free governance sustainability transparency nor democracy. Others argue that these trends are exaggerated mainly because there is no single model for development that China seeks to promote.[29] Still others claim that engagement with China tends to lead countries in a less democratic direction.[30] At the same time the West has in several occasions favoured non-democratic regimes as long as they have worked for other normative goals that were in line with the West’s development agenda—such as poverty reduction and improved healthcare and education.[31] Moreover it has been done when the West saw a need for access to crucial raw materials or a “buffer” vis-à-vis political enemies or possible military bases.

Normative similarities and differences

The political scientist Stein Ringen has characterised China as a “sophisticated dictatorship” one that stands between the authoritarian model and the totalitarian one—or a “controlocracy”.[32] There are mock trials and sudden disappearances of which the entrepreneur Jack Ma is one of the latest high-profile people to have been affected just like in Stalin’s Soviet Union or Hitler’s Germany.

Ringen discusses what motivates the dictatorial power of the Chinese Communist Party or its raison d´être. He considers the constant rise in the material standard of living and the eradication of poverty as the main legitimising factor after Deng Xiaoping’s takeover. At the end of 2020 China declared that it had completely eradicated extreme poverty in the country over an eight-year period.[33] President Xi Jinping emphasised at an official ceremony in Beijing in February 2021 that this “miracle is a complete victory that will go down in history.”[34]

At the same time this shows that China has achieved goals 1 and 2 of the UN Agenda 2030—i.e. no poverty or hunger—for a massive one-fifth of the world’s population. This together with the continued and accelerating economic exchange between the West and China means that in terms of material goals such as prosperity and poverty reduction standards between West and China are running in parallel. Furthermore these material objectives are in line with officially stated development and poverty reduction policies in most African countries.

There may be another factor that motivates the power of the Communist Party. China experts point out that there are “three ghosts” chasing China’s political leadership: the century of humiliation of 1842 – 1949 when foreign powers ruled the “Middle Kingdom”; the destructive excesses of violence during the Mao Zedong era; and the fall of the Soviet Union. Another way of expressing this is the fear of weakening or undermining the peace-making Leviathan the central power. Unfortunately this also tends to favour authoritarian leadership and the incumbent regime. At the same time peace and stability remain fundamental values.

As discussed briefly earlier China in Africa often acts bilaterally. Although there is a common forum for contacts with Africa through the FOCAC and other arenas agreements are mostly bilateral. When China acts in African countries it often does so outside the various platforms for development established by other donors where common normative requirements for issues like procurement and sustainability are monitored. China often abstains from such cooperation.

In the tourism sector for example there are Chinese entrepreneurs that act outside the organisations that exist for ecotourism and for sustainability requirements—this despite China’s high-profile assurances at world summits as being “protectors” of climate agreements and sustainability goals. Thus in terms of common demands for sustainable development anti-corruption and common social rights requirements within donor organisations there is no normative agreement between the West and China in Africa.

Meritocracy is a traditionally strong value in China.[35] The administrative apparatus has historically been built on a Confucian basis. From the 17th century it included a rigorous countrywide system for screening prospective civil servants every three years which remained in various forms until 1962.[36] After the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and Deng Xiaoping’s return to power one of the first steps he took was to reintroduce national examinations as a basis for admission to higher education.

Meritocracy in this sense is largely in line with norms in the West but not insofar as it provides a basis for recruitment to political leadership within the Communist Party. It is hardly possible to claim that recruitment to the political classes in the West or in Africa today takes place on strictly meritocratic grounds. Nevertheless the lack of transparency in China’s political system creates opportunities for corruption which undermines the meritocratic norm.

In China land cannot be owned by private individuals. However there are possession rights that can be valid for up to 70 years. Since 2015 registers for possession rights have been established in municipalities.[37] In addition individuals can own real estate but not the land they stand upon. In Africa Western countries and NGOs have initiated formalisation of property rights in several countries. In this there is no normative agreement with China.

In recent years the Communist Party has further tightened its grip on the educational sector by forcing private schools to hand over ownership to the state without compensation.[38] Together with other recent moves this puts China’s governance system closer to the totalitarian model based upon a Leninist power structure and with the Communist Party and the president as the main players. Thus there is using Ringen’s framework a strong tendency towards “controlocracy”. It is not likely that this will result in the promotion of liberal democracy division of powers and the rule of law as governance models when engaging with African countries.

China’s Diplomatic Offensive

The FOCAC has been active for many years and provides political and diplomatic backing for Chinese companies and investments in the continent.

A 2020 analysis of China’s active diplomacy to influence African leaders military and senior officials observes: [39]

Beijing’s investment in professional training for senior cadres from African countries means that three synergistic goals can be achieved: (1) the dissemination of a Chinese model for development and governance (2) the development of a professional network involving Chinese senior officials politicians and specialists counterparts in various African countries and other developing countries within the BRIC as well as (3) a socialization of African senior officials and politicians into China’s views on Chinese culture Chinese diplomacy and interpretations of history.

Another aspect of China’s “charm offensive” is the so-called Covid vaccine diplomacy. Donations of relatively modest doses of Chinese vaccine make headlines in African newspapers while the West is perceived to be prioritising its own citizens.

An example of Chinese diplomacy in Africa is an official visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to the Seychelles that took place on 31 January 2021. He underlined that China’s diplomacy has always been based on equality between small and large countries. China advocates multilateralism he said and opposes power politics; it supports “democracy in international relations” and supports the UN in its legitimate role in international relations. Large countries should be the first to follow the basic norms that govern international relations Wang Yi emphasised adding that they should also be the first to “follow the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal relations.” They should also be the first to shoulder their international commitments on climate change and sustainable development.[40]

One aspect of the “propaganda war” is China’s growing media presence. From ownership of local radio stations to the establishment of a China Central Television station in Nairobi Kenya China is becoming a major influence in the daily discourses in these countries.[41] According to Afrobarometer survey data in 36 African countries 23 percent believe that China is the most influential foreign power in their country close behind “the former colonial power” (28 percent) and slightly ahead of the US (22 percent).[42]

Cultural factors and attitudes

A report from the Afrobarometer research project in 2016 states that the US development model is preferred by most Africans while a majority view the Chinese presence in Africa favourably.[43]

A drawback is that Chinese business people have been accused of being condescending towards Black Africans. In part this can be attributed to the idea of cultural superiority as suggested by the notion of what Weiwei referred to as the four Chinese “superfactors” and the four “unique” Chinese factors discussed in an earlier section of this paper.

In Kenya a Chinese restaurant owner was arrested in 2015 after denying Black Africans entry.[44] Sometime in the same year a Chinese businessman was expelled after calling a Kenyan employee and the country’s president “baboons”. The 26-year-old employee said he had not encountered outright racism until the incident.[45] The Chinese embassy apologised saying that this did not represent the attitude of the Chinese people.

Zambia has had several incidents of unfair labour practice some involving violence. During a 2010 strike over working conditions in a Chinese-owned coal mine in the south of the country two Chinese managers opened fire and 11 workers were seriously injured. The two were brought to justice but the indictment was later dropped.[46] In 2012 a Chinese foreman was murdered at the same mine.[47]

In 2020 three Chinese supervisors at a textile department store in Lusaka in Zambia were murdered and their corpses burned after they were accused of keeping Black workers locked in a container to avoid being infected by Covid-19 while Chinese customers were allowed to move freely within the premises. The press said that “the waves of racial antagonism went high.”[48] A few weeks earlier a restaurant and a hair salon that had barred Zambians were ordered closed by authorities.[49]

Such tensions have been exploited by the country’s political leaders. In 2007 the then opposition leader Michael Sata issued a statement saying “We want the Chinese to leave the continent and the former colonial powers to return. Of course they also exploited our raw materials but at least they took care of us.”[50] Sata won the 2011 presidential election in a high-profile anti-China campaign. Conversely the government of Edward Lungu (president 2015-2021) leaned heavily towards China which also is the country’s single largest lender.

The Western response

Signs are emerging that the West and its allies such as Japan and India are aiming to counter the economic and diplomatic initiatives from China. One example is the EllaLink a transatlantic optic data cable launched with funding from the European Investment Bank and others. The aim is to be an alternative to the BRI and to boost high-quality projects in middle- and low-income countries including Africa.[51] In 2021 the EU and India launched a global infrastructure partnership although both sides are careful not to brand it as any sort of anti-Beijing alliance.[52] The India Africa Trade Council inaugurated in January 2021 is yet another example: it aims to open 13 trade offices in each of India’s major cities assisting businesses that could be interested in conducting trade with African countries.

China’s Strategic and Military Interests in Africa

Economic globalisation has meant that Chinese business interests also benefit from long-term economic rules and the prevention of conflicts and wars. Thus in 2008 Chinese warships arrived on the coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean to take part in international operations against piracy as those activities have also affected Chinese ships. It was the first time China’s navy operated in these waters since the 15th century.

Soon it was clear however that the Chinese presence was not aimed at only fighting pirate attacks. When piracy subsided around 2012 the Chinese warships remained and China declared that its naval presence is part of an ambition to protect its economic interests in the Middle East North Africa and East Africa. It can also be seen as part of the “Maritime Silk Road” a major infrastructure project proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013 which would primarily involve Chinese investment in ports.[53] The Chinese naval presence was further expanded by a naval base in Djibouti. On 1 August 2017 the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army the base was inaugurated. It is the country’s first naval military base outside China and is leased for ten years for which China pays USD 20 million annually.

China’s military presence in Africa goes back to the 1970s when it supported guerrilla groups such as Unita in Angola and Frelimo in Mozambique with financing weapons and logistics. Today China sells weapons to many countries in the region and offers training for African officer aspirants.[54] There are extensive contacts between China’s military leaders and their African counterparts. For one China is training on-site African armies police forces and soldiers involved in multilateral peacekeeping operations. China also provides financial support to the African Union’s military operations conducts military exercises with African countries and plays an active role in UN peacekeeping operations in the continent.

At the same time the United States like erstwhile colonial powers such as Britain and France have extensive military cooperation in the continent going far back in time. France is estimated to house about 9000 people in its military operations mainly in West Africa and the Sahel. The UK has significantly fewer permanent staff but trains up to 10000 each year in Kenya through a mutual defence cooperation agreement. The United States is considered to hold about 7200 personnel in the continent but this commitment will face cutbacks in the coming years. The Chinese naval force in Djibouti is today estimated to comprise 300 military personnel and 1700 civilians.[55]

Russia has also expanded its presence in Africa in recent years through the training of military personnel and arms exports to some 20 countries. Japan for its part opened a military base in Djibouti in 2011 with the aim of protecting shipping and raw material supplies but also in view of supporting access to African markets and balancing the presence of China.[56] Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have also expanded their military activities in recent years but have no fixed bases.

Since 1989 about 40000 Chinese soldiers have been involved in a total of 24 UN peacekeeping operations in Africa. Today about 2400 Chinese soldiers participate in seven of these operations. In 2019 China contributed USD 7 billion to the UN peacekeeping forces equivalent to 15 percent of the UN budget.[57] Among the permanent members of the Security Council China today contributes the largest contingent of personnel in UN peacekeeping operations.[58]

Over the years China has signed bilateral agreements on arms deliveries to Namibia Botswana Angola Sudan Eritrea Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone among others. Helicopters have been delivered to Ghana Mali and Angola as well as tanks to Zimbabwe. In Sudan and Zimbabwe the Chinese military has had factories to produce small arms.[59]

In 2014 the Chinese People’s Liberation Army conducted its first joint military exercise with an African country in Tanzania. In 2018 units from the Chinese Navy visited naval bases in Cameroon Gabon Ghana and Nigeria and conducted bilateral exercises there.

The Horn of Africa consists of Ethiopia Eritrea Djibouti and Somalia. With the completion of the Suez Canal in 1896 the area became an important transit route for international trade by significantly shortening the transport routes for trade between Asia and Europe. It is through the Horn of Africa that Africa is linked to the Arab world. Djibouti has become something of a commercial hub where ships from all corners of the world reload goods and refuel their ships. Important commercial transit routes run outside the Horn of Africa and the area is close to current conflict areas such as Yemen. Even before the civil war broke out in the region it had undergone extensive militarisation. France Italy Egypt Israel the United States Japan Germany and Spain are a selection of countries with a military presence in the area.

China’s military presence in Djibouti has several purposes. Owing to its military presence there China can take part in military operations to combat terrorism and protect Chinese ships from piracy.

During the conflict in Libya in 2011 the Chinese military evacuated 35000 Chinese citizens stranded in the country. From Djibouti in 2015 the Chinese military was able to evacuate 800 Chinese from the civil war in Yemen. In view of its major economic interests in Africa it is inevitable that China will take an active interest in dealing with the continent’s political emergencies. An important purpose of the military presence is to protect Chinese factories transport routes and personnel in Africa. Another purpose is to use military hardware as a means of projecting Chinese soft power.

Through large-scale economic and personnel engagement in the UN’s military operations China hopes to be seen as a responsible actor for maintaining order in the region. In times when other countries have reduced such support China’s increased involvement has mainly been viewed positively in Africa. Of course the continent also offers an arena where China is given the opportunity to test weapons systems and other military skills. By nurturing ties with military leaders in African countries China seeks to incorporate Africa into the country’s wider geopolitical strategy. China has long been a key political and economic player in Africa; in recent years it has become a significant military player.

Conclusion

How should other stakeholders interpret China’s increased activity in Africa?

First it should be said that this is a matter for the states and people of Africa. Africans rightly react negatively when representatives of world powers mostly regard the continent as an arena for their own strategic or economic interests as was largely the case during the Cold War.

Second there are few obstacles for other countries to go on a diplomatic offensive in Africa should they so decide. The concern is not that China has an increased economic and political presence in Africa but that others have ignored it for long. The surrounding world i.e. the EU and US does not seem to have a strategy for how to face the Chinese offensive or to increase its own presence and confidence in Africa.

Some initiatives are emerging to give alternatives to the Chinese economic offensive involving the EU US Japan and India. It would be wise to consider reducing the bureaucracy and the lists of requirements surrounding such investments to be able to act in a more pragmatic way without giving up the most fundamental values.

Third African countries should be wary of becoming heavily indebted to China. They must consider the involved political risks of dependency.

Fourth the EU US and allies should work more systematically and consistently to incorporate China into common diplomatic commercial and NGO forums in African countries where mutually beneficial norms and practical solutions can be identified.

Although Africa still makes up a small part of the world economy population forecasts by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) show that in 20 years sub-Saharan Africa will have more people of working age than the rest of the world. Over the next 40 years one billion potential consumers and producers will be added to the region. With better institutions and greater investment in human capital Africa can add considerable dynamism to the world and the world economy. The future of this continent may well hold important tipping points for the world’s development including climate change and terrorism.

Geopolitical tensions between China on the one hand and the West and its allies on the other have increased but Africa is hardly the primary arena for this. The world community should be alert to any signs of antagonistic or expansionist ambitions that China may have in the continent. It would be wise for African countries as well as for the West and its allies to prepare for how such developments should be handled.

Photo: AFP

Afghan Interior Minister Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal announced Sunday that Kabul will shift power peacefully to a ""transitional administration."" Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had left the country according to the Associated Press. On the same day a Taliban spokesperson confirmed they had entered Kabul. It seems that the situation in Afghanistan will enter a new chapter.The US has spent 20 years on its ""anti-terror war"" in Afghanistan investing huge amount of resources in the country to support the Afghan government and help train its troops. However just a month or so after the quickened withdrawal of US troops Afghanistan's military collapsed completely under the Taliban's fierce attacks. This was unthinkable for the US and the rest of the West - even beyond their most pessimistic predictions.The drastic change in Afghanistan's situation is undoubtedly a heavy blow to the US. It declared the complete failure of US intent to reshape Afghanistan. In the meantime the US' desperate withdrawal plan shows the unreliability of US commitments to its allies: When its interests require it to abandon allies Washington will not hesitate to find every excuse to do so.A country as powerful as the US could not defeat the Afghan Taliban which received almost no aid from outside even in 20 years. This defeat of the US is a clearer demonstration of US impotence than the Vietnam War - the US is indeed like a ""paper tiger."" From another perspective the US' defeat is even more humiliating than that of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s.The Najibullah government in Kabul held out for more than three years after the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan where the anti-government guerrillas were heavily armed and supported by the US. However the Taliban defeated the US on its own. The Afghan government collapsed even before the US had completed its troop withdrawal.Such a change in Afghanistan will influence the regional geopolitical scene bringing about quite some uncertainties. The Western media have been busy mentioning China when reporting Afghanistan. They even hype that the situation in Afghanistan has taken China to an ""awkward reality."" But such a narrative is nothing but a logically confused attempt to appease their own feelings.The media in the US and the West used to deny the existence of the terrorist group East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) portraying them as an excuse of China to engage in ""oppressive moves"" in its Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Now they have started to hype that the Taliban will support ETIM after it gains power and thus impose a threat to the security of Xinjiang. In their narrative China in particular has reasons to be concerned about the situation in Afghanistan.As a matter of fact China will indeed view the situation in Afghanistan taking into consideration the stability of its Xinjiang region. But the Western media's narrative is unquestionably more than exaggerated. China's People's Liberation Army is heavily deployed around the Wakhan Corridor a key zone for China's counter-terrorism mission that links China and Afghanistan. Secessionists extremists and terrorist groups cannot even enter China from that corridor. Besides after years of arduous governance Xinjiang has uprooted extremism making it harder for foreign forces to infiltrate the region.In reality the main source of terrorist activities that were rampant in Xinjiang a few years ago was the US and the West. The US and the West defended terrorists in Xinjiang in the name of ""human rights"" beautified their terror acts as ""resistance against the Chinese regime"" and instigated the ""Three Evils"" within Xinjiang ideologically. The West even turned a blind eye when international terror forces targeted China. The West's double standards are the biggest challenge to China's counter-terrorism efforts.Therefore China will rationally face the changing situation in Afghanistan - it will prevent the situation there from having a negative impact on Xinjiang and at the same time evaluate the situation objectively. China will never jump into the trap Western opinion set up especially for China. The US' anti-terror war has failed. It is the US and the West that should bear the biggest challenge of the changing situation in Afghanistan.China is in a relatively favorable position. China has no will to fill the vacuum the US has left behind in Afghanistan. The principle of not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is always guiding China's foreign policy. China will play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan achieve peace and engage in reconstruction. China's strategic kindness and policy stability will ensure that China always holds the initiative in the Afghan situation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzc4MTEyNzIxMDA0MjI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Variability in soil physical–chemical properties along the root-explored profile in deep Oxisols of commercial eucalypt ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112721004229 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzc4MTEyNzIxMDA0MjI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Companies that want to retain talent are looking for ways to reduce burnout which can lead to reduced productivity and higher turnover. One strategy they’ve embraced is encouraging — or in some cases forcing — employees to take vacation.

In the past year firms including the networking company LinkedIn the dating app company Bumble and the financial software provider Intuit have introduced weeklong companywide shutdowns so employees can fully disconnect.

The True Costs That Singapore Investors Need To Consider Before Investing In Them,"A decade ago investors looking for diversified exposure to the market would have turned to unit trusts purchasing them through their banks financial advisors or other middlemen. Today unit trusts (also known as mutual funds) are fast losing their appeal especially when compared to the more affordable and accessible exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Investors are certainly making their preferences known. Global net inflows into ETFs for the first six months of 2021 totalled US$659 billion compared with US$767 billion for all of 2020 according to research and consultancy firm ETFGI.

Globally ETF assets under management hit a record US$8.66 trillion at the end of June just a hair’s breadth away from those in mutual funds. The gap between ETFs and mutual funds has been rapidly narrowing since 2016 a key indicator of the surging popularity of ETFs and their function as a low-cost investment vehicle.

Understanding ETFs and unit trusts / mutual funds

Both ETFs and unit trusts offer diversification benefits by holding a basket of stocks bonds or other assets. While ETFs can be bought and sold on a stock exchange just like any other stock investors will have to take the unit trust’s listed price at the end of the trading day whenever they buy or sell units.

Another difference between the fund types is the investment strategy used. ETFs tend to be passively managed. In other words they are designed to closely replicate the performance of the index they track and generally hold the same proportion of securities as its index.

Unit trusts are typically actively managed. This means the fund manager aims to outperform an index benchmark by actively buying or selling securities. Success of the fund depends on whether or not the portfolio manager can consistently pick “winners”. As it turns out that’s hardly the case.

Studies have shown over and over again that actively managed funds almost always underperform passive investments in the long run. According to the SPIVA US Scorecard for 2020 83% of all active fund managers have underperformed their benchmarks over the past 10 years.

Before we delve deeper into the cost differences between ETFs and unit trusts here’s a quick overview of the overall costs involved in an equity ETF portfolio and a comparable unit trust portfolio holding index mutual funds. While most unit trusts are actively managed there are some that track indices passively. (Take note that actively managed mutual funds will typically have higher expense ratios compared to their index counterparts.)

All return figures are as of 30 June 2021

The expense ratios for funds assumes them to be index funds. Active mutual funds can have expense ratios 2 – 3 times the expense ratio indicated above

*Transaction and hedging costs are estimated to be 0.5% on average based on Lumint data.

**Mutual fund bid-offer spread estimated to be approximately 0.10% based on data from National Bank Financial

^Dividend withholding tax taken as 30% for US ETFs and 15% for Irish domiciled UCIT ETF/funds. Syfe’s Equity100 dividend yield is 1.25% compared to ~1.85% estimated for a comparable 100% equity portfolio using funds

^^Syfe’s FX conversion fee is 0.09%. Funds may pay higher FX costs through banks

Expense ratio: Why it matters

Due to their passive management ETFs often have lower expenses and costs compared to unit trusts.

High fees eat into your returns over time. An important figure to look out for when evaluating fees is a fund’s expense ratio which can be found on the fund’s prospectus or factsheet. Investing in unit trusts typically costs more than ETFs as part of the expenses go towards the salaries of the portfolio managers and research analysts who support them.

ETFs usually have expense ratios below 0.5% while an actively managed unit trust’s expense ratio can range from 1.5% to 2% per year. A 1% difference in fees may seem minimal but it adds up over time. If you had invested $100000 at a 7% annual return 20 years ago you would have ended up with roughly $350000 today assuming yearly investment fees of 0.5%.

But with fees of 1.5% each year your total sum falls to around $290000. That’s $60000 forfeited in extra fees more than enough for a university semester – or two – abroad!

Expense ratio alone doesn’t capture all investing costs

The expense ratio tells you a great deal about your ETF or unit trust but it doesn’t show the full costs you’ll pay. Transaction costs and other fees such as brokerage commissions or sales charges are not included in a fund’s expense ratio.

Transaction costs

Transaction costs for actively managed unit trusts tend to be much higher compared to ETFs. Traditional open-ended unit trusts buy and sell securities based on cash flows from shareholder activity selling portfolio holdings to raise cash to fund redemptions and buying securities using the cash received from in-flows.

ETFs on the other hand are traded on the exchange where sellers of ETF shares meet with buyers of ETF shares. ETFs thus typically engage in portfolio transactions only when needed such as to track changes in the composition of the underlying index. As such annual turnover for ETFs is usually lower translating to lower transaction costs.

Bid-ask spread

Bid-ask spread is a common cost for ETFs which trade like single stocks. It’s simply the difference between the price someone is willing to pay for a security (the bid) and the price someone is willing to sell that asset (the ask).

The key takeaway is that the tighter the spread the less expensive it is to trade that ETF. From SPDR S&P 500 ETF to Invesco QQQ many of the popular ETFs that Singapore investors have heard of tend to be highly liquid with large trading volumes. As such the average bid-ask spread for these ETFs is usually less than 0.01%.

At Syfe we use ETFs as the building blocks of our portfolios to keep investing costs as low as possible for our customers. This is also why we only select ETFs that are highly liquid and have negligible bid-ask spread. Additionally we’ve optimised our trading process to buy or sell ETFs near their closing prices. This further minimises the impact of bid-ask spread on our ETF portfolios.

With unit trusts the common assumption is that there’s no bid-ask spread because investors buy and sell their units at net asset value which gets reported daily after market close. What investors don’t realise is that each time units are created or redeemed the portfolio manager has to buy and sell the fund’s underlying securities and pay the bid-ask spread for those transactions. If these securities are thinly traded the large spread could even negatively impact fund performance.

Additionally the spread is a shared cost incurred by all unitholders on a daily basis. This is unlike the spread for ETFs which is a one-time cost that kicks in only when the ETF is bought or sold. According to analyst estimates the bid-ask spread for large-cap mutual funds is between 0.04% to 0.10% and between 0.20% to 0.50% for small-cap mutual funds.

Dividend withholding tax

One aspect of investing in foreign shares is the withholding tax on dividends that Singapore investors need to pay. How much this withholding tax is varies according to the country the stock is listed in.

Image: Financial Horse

Singapore does not have a tax treaty with the US. As a result Singapore investors are taxed a 30% withholding tax on dividends from US-listed securities (including ETFs and unit trusts). This applies whether you buy these securities through a broker fund platform or robo-advisor.

One way to get around this is to invest in UCITs products that are domiciled in European markets such as Ireland. This structure benefits from the US-Ireland tax treaty which means your dividends will be taxed at only 15%.

However do note that UCITs investment vehicles are only beneficial for US-listed stocks. As the above analysis from Financial Horse shows investing in UK stocks via Irish domiciled UCITs products might actually backfire as you’d end up paying more withholding tax without the US-UK tax treaty.

At Syfe we have weighed the pros and cons of UCITs ETFs / unit trusts carefully and will use them only when they benefit clients. Their tax advantages notwithstanding most UCITs ETFs / unit trusts typically have higher expense ratios lower liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads compared to US-listed ETFs.

Let’s illustrate this with the Invesco QQQ and its UCITs alternative the Invesco EQQQ. With a 30% withholding tax your final QQQ dividend yield is 0.46%. With EQQQ’s lower withholding tax you get to keep a higher yield of 0.49%. However this additional yield is offset by EQQQ’s higher expenses.

The same logic applies when comparing US-listed ETFs and UCITs unit trusts. Although the former may have a higher tax implication the higher TER and other trading costs associated with unit trusts outweigh any tax savings.

A final point to note is that the impact of dividend withholding tax very much depends on the dividend yield of the investment. Most investors invest in US-listed assets for capital gains not dividends. And remember Singaporeans are not taxed on US capital gains.

One example is the Syfe Core range of portfolios. Our Core portfolios are designed to focus on generating consistent risk-adjusted total returns for clients. Dividends form a very small percentage of total returns and thus the impact of dividend withholding tax is quite minimal. For investors seeking dividend income they would be better served with dividend stocks or REITs from the Singapore market where dividends are tax exempt.

FX charges

Just as securities listed on our Singapore Exchange are denominated in SGD securities listed on foreign exchanges will be denominated in foreign currencies. For Singapore investors who buy US-listed ETFs and other securities there will be a foreign currency charge for converting SGD to USD.

This applies even if you buy a SGD-hedged unit trust in which case the currency conversion is indirectly incurred when the fund manager buys a foreign stock. To buy Apple stock for example the fund will still need to exchange SGD for USD. This FX fee is not accounted for in the expense ratio and is typically not transparently stated upfront.

Generally retail investors pay between 0.50% to 0.70% in FX fees when they buy ETFs through their broker. Syfe customers pay much less – just 0.09% in FX fees – to access US ETFs.

Currency conversion charges however should not be a reason to avoid investing outside of Singapore. In the long run the performance of a globally diversified portfolio tends to outweigh any currency impact.

Hedging costs

One often overlooked downside of SGD-hedged unit trusts is the cost of hedging your currency exposure. Research has shown that active funds which hedge currency exposure incur significant hedging costs. On average this hedging cost is 0.42% per annum and can result in long-term substantial underperformance when compared to unhedged share classes.

Source: Lumint

While there could be some cases where SGD-hedged share classes result in reduced FX volatility for income-oriented investors investors with such needs might be better off taking direct exposure to locally listed and SGD denominated products such as REITs.

Why ETFs are better than unit trusts

For Singapore investors we find that ETFs are a more cost-effective and efficient investment vehicle. One ETF typically holds shares in hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of listed companies; an ETF can cover a broad range of markets sectors styles geographies and assets.

It’s true that unit trusts can offer similar diversification benefits but why pay an arm and a leg for them? When fees are the most proven predictor of future fund returns it makes sense to minimize them.

Here’s the same table we showed earlier in the article. Notice how despite the comparable exposures there is a significant return differential of 4% which can be traced to the higher costs carried by unit trusts.

All return figures are as of 30 June 2021

The expense ratios for funds assumes them to be index funds. Active mutual funds can have expense ratios 2 – 3 times the expense ratio indicated above

*Transaction and hedging costs are estimated to be 0.5% on average based on Lumint data.

**Mutual fund bid-offer spread estimated to be approximately 0.10% based on data from National Bank Financial

^^Syfe’s FX conversion fee is 0.09%. Funds may pay higher FX costs through banks

At Syfe we believe in low fees. That’s why we use ETFs in our portfolios and charge all-in management fees of 0.35% to 0.65% per year. And by the way this includes all brokerage costs portfolio rebalancing and dividend reinvestment costs.

Women in the bremelanotide group didn’t report having more good sex so relying on those results could have sunk chances of approval. That’s only one of the ways the researchers—all of whom had ties to Palatin or AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc. the company that licensed bremelanotide—failed to adhere to widely accepted guidelines according to Spielmans. (According to a press release Palatin and AMAG mutually terminated their license agreement for Vyleesi in January of last year.)

“The risk you run is that they are simply kind of slicing and dicing through the data until they find something that makes the drug look good” he said.

To prevent that type of cherry picking researchers are supposed to decide on the endpoints at the beginning of the study. To be fair the FDA okayed the change in primary outcome measures based on the updated 2016 guidance. And there’s no evidence that anyone “peeked” at the results before changing the endpoints. Still in its review of the bremelanotide data the FDA notes that because overall women in the study didn’t report more sexually satisfying events the negative findings for that measure may have been obvious even before analyzing the data to find out who got the drug and who got a placebo.

The research team’s rebuttal published in the Journal of Sex Research was indignant. Researchers said that they changed outcome measures with the FDA’s blessing prior to analyzing results. They also accused Spielmans who has no research or clinical expertise in sexual medicine of being out of his depth. (I contacted several of the researchers all of whom either did not respond to my request for an interview or declined to talk to me.) Spielmans answered in the same journal that he was “disappointed” because the research team “failed to engage with the most pressing concerns raised in my re-analysis.”

Its tricky business gauging a woman’s sexual desire. The bremelanotide trials asked women to tally sexually satisfying events (that includes masturbation and fun sexual activities with a partner) each month but wound up prioritizing more subjective measures. For example one of the primary endpoints on the bremelanotide trials is based on women’s answers to two questions about their sexual desire over the last month from a 19-item survey:

Over the past four weeks how often did you feel sexual desire or interest? [Almost always or always; Most times (more than half the time); Sometimes (about half the time); A few times (less than half the time); or Almost never or never.]

did you feel sexual desire or interest? [Almost always or always; Most times (more than half the time); Sometimes (about half the time); A few times (less than half the time); or Almost never or never.] Over the past four weeks how would you rate your level (degree) of sexual desire or interest? [Very high; High; Moderate; Low; Very Low or None at all.]

At the risk of oversharing I have no idea how to answer those questions. Feeling sexual desire “less than half the time” results in a lower score. But what can I say? I work. We’re in a pandemic. My long-time husband (whom I love dearly) and I have been locked in pretty much 24-7 for a year and a half. Sparks don’t fly every time we pass in the kitchen.

To score high you need to desire sex all or nearly all the time said Adriane Fugh-Berman M.D. a professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. “I show that slide in talks because I can usually get laugh from the audience by saying I don’t think this is consistent with having a job or being a full-time student” she said. “Sexual desire all of the time? Like really?”

Even the FDA is somewhat incredulous of the ratings scale stating in the 2016 guidance to drugmakers: “it’s unclear whether women experiencing sexual desire all or most of the time would identify this as a benefit or whether this could represent a different concern to women.”

Still the agency approved bremelanotide based in part on study results showing that women who injected themselves with the drug scored an average of 0.3 points higher on a 6-point scale of desire than the placebo group. The treatment group also scored about 0.3 points better on a 4-point scale measuring how bothered they were by low sexual desire.

“The so-called epidemic of female dysfunction is a lie.”

The way we attempt to measure sexual dysfunction is heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry said Fugh-Berman who is an outspoken critic of pharmaceutical marketing practices and medication overuse. So too is our notion of the prevalence of the problem she said. For example the source of an oft-cited statistic that nearly half of American women are beset by some form of sexual dysfunction is a survey from 1999. As Undark reported in 2016 two of the three researchers were linked to drug companies and other scientists have questioned the methodology. “The so-called epidemic of female sexual dysfunction is a lie” said Fugh-Berman.

Maureen Whelihan a gynecologist in Greenacres Florida who specializes in sexual medicine also doesn’t take much stock in the questionnaires used in clinical trials. In practice she may use short screeners to check for anxiety depression and how satisfied a woman is with her sex life. Then she dives into a conversation with patients about how to address their concerns. Sexual dysfunction is a complex problem that is often intertwined with mood disorders but along with diet exercise and counseling female-libido drugs can also play a role in treatment she told me: “I’m always a believer of an approach that really includes all parts.”

If women do have a vast unmet need to boost libido the available medications apparently aren’t filling it. Shortly after the FDA approved flibanserin Valeant Pharmaceuticals (now Bausch Health Companies) bought Sprout for $1 billion. After two years of dismal flibanserin sales and facing a lawsuit Valeant sold the company to a group of former Sprout shareholders in exchange for a small royalty on future sales.

Sales have since increased with doctors writing more than 27000 prescriptions for the drug so far this year compared to only about 6000 prescriptions in 2018 according to the health analytics company IQVIA. Still that would treat only a fraction of the women Sprout claims suffer from low desire. “In fact there was not this groundswell of women clamoring for this drug” said Fugh-Berman. “That was a public relations fiction.”

In the third quarter of 2021 Palatin reported netting only about $89000 from sales of Vyleesi.

Whelihan routinely prescribes flibanserin she said although most patients don’t wind up taking it long term. She has offered to prescribe bremelanotide but when women hear that it’s a shot that frequently causes nausea most want no part of it she said: “It went across sort of like a lead balloon.”

As for Tiefer she’s still looking for ways to “make noise” about female libido drugs through journal articles and editorials as well as talking to journalists like me. At this point she’s not expecting to have much impact on the FDA’s decision making. “The goal is to raise the public’s awareness that these drugs are promoted by interested profit-oriented parties” she said “and that the consumer the patient needs to be smart and not duped.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
IRM,Iron Mountain,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cHJlc3MubmV0L3Nwb3J0cy9sb2NhbC1zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wOC9jaG9pLWxlYWRzLXVwZ2EtbWlkd2F5LWJ5LTEtc3Ryb2tlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Choi leads UPGA midway by 1 stroke | News Sports Jobs,"ESCANABA — Jon Ellis had the ideal response Friday when he was asked about shooting 13 strokes beneath his opening-day score in the 107th Upper Peninsula Golf Association men’s tournament.

“That’s golf” Ellis said after posting a sizzling 2-under-par 69 at challenging Escanaba Country Club. “Some days are better than others. This was a whole new day.”

His 69 was two strokes better than three golfers who matched par topped by Jiseung Choi of Houghton Portage Lake who is a stroke ahead of the field at 139.

Choi who was born in South Korea and played golf at Houghton High School said “I did not putt as good as yesterday but I’m in a good spot. I’m happy with where I’m at for the weekend.”

Choi shot 38-33 the opposite of Thursday’s round with birdies on three of the opening four holes on the back nine.

He plans “to be a little more aggressive going for the pin” today. But he grinned and added “I will be a little more smart about it.”

Ellis an Iron Mountain Pine Grove Country Club member and 2009 UPGA titleist used consecutive birdies on holes 15 and 16 to set up a strong finish that sent him ahead of the field of 93 golfers at the midway point.

He will be in the first flight when the tournament resumes this morning but could still win a second title with two excellent rounds.

His birdie on No. 15 was special. “I was just trying not to putt it off the green” he said with a chuckle. “I hit it softly. The putt on 15 was a little bit unexpected.”

The pin locations on holes 14 and 15 drew the ire of many players Friday with 15 on the downward left side slope. It was one of several tough pin placements that contributed to exceedingly slow torturous rounds.

Ellis who did not three-putt on the slick greens also had birdies on Nos. 1 and 5. He bogeyed Nos. 7 and 13. He said 13 which required a 180-yard tee shot into a stiff wind with a pond on the right and out-of-bounds on the left “was a sporty hole. I was happy to get a bogey (4).”

“I had a little better feel on the greens today” he conceded. “The greens were awesome they ran really true and they were fast.”

He tried to stay beneath the pin on his approach shots knowing downhill putts had little chance of dropping into the cup and were likely to slide well past.

A stroke back of Choi is incoming North Central High School senior Bryson Mercier who had par 71 Friday.

“I’m going to sleep with my putter tonight” said Mercier. “I definitely kept myself in it with my putter. My short game overall was stellar.”

He said the 10-20 mph west wind “played a lot tougher (than Thursday) because of the wind. It is part of this course. Every 15 minutes it seemed to switch.

“It was very tough to judge. You had to stay focused and stay patient.”

After bogeys on 13 and 14 Mercier said he “made a good par putt on 15 and I got a birdie (4) on 16.

He plans to play his “usual aggressive style today” but is fully aware “there are a lot of areas here where things can get interesting. I’ll be aggressive on some shots and careful on others.”

Mercier is at 140 four strokes ahead of Ben Strong of Ontonagon. Two-time former champion Mark Clements skied to a 77 Friday and is at 145 with Johnny Kositzky of ECC. Kositzky hit 73 Friday.

Scott Prunick of Marquette the 2020 runner-up is at 146 after hitting 73 Friday. Also at 146 is Chad Tirschel of Pine Grove after posting 71.

Scott Lancour of ECC shot 75 and is at 148.

Defending champion Matt Argall of Gladstone Terrace Bluff also matched par and is at 149.

At 150 are Mark Ray of Highland and Dom Benetti and Dylan Gauthier of ECC. Ray will not play today because he will attend his brother’s birthday party in Green Bay.

Tirschel who missed an eagle-2 on No. 18 by two inches Thursday said he played steady.

“My tee shots were a lot better today” he said. “I kept it in play and kept it around the greens and around the pins.”

He plans to use the same plan today.

“I’ll try to shoot for the top 10” Tirschel said. “I’ll just try to hang around and take what the course gives me.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

J.B. Hunt celebrates 60th anniversary

The supply chain solutions provider J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. celebrated its 60th anniversary on Tuesday with a virtual Facebook event and small in-person celebration at the company’s headquarters.

The virtual event kicked off with a personal message from co-founder Johnelle Hunt who thanked employees and employees’ loved ones for dedicating themselves to the company’s commitment to success.

Mrs. Johnelle Hunt – leader supporter and legacy builder for 60 years and counting. Thank you! #JBHunt60Years pic.twitter.com/Bw6eZ4VPdR — J.B. Hunt Drivers (@JBHuntDrivers) August 11 2021

“I know what it’s like to live as the wife of a truck driver” said Hunt. “I know the sacrifices they make and I want to say thank you to the families of all those drivers that have come through this company and are still with this company. You make a sacrifice everyday because it is a tough job to have out there.”

Near Little Rock Arkansas in 1961 Hunt and her late husband Johnnie Bryan Hunt founded the company as a rice hull operation recycling the protective covering of rice to be used for applications such as building material fertilizer and fuel. Later in 1969 Johnnie Hunt bought five trucks and seven trailers to begin his trucking business which would eventually grow to the $10 billion full-service logistics company it is today.

J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT) has created various content to celebrate its anniversary including blogs showcasing employees with decades of experience servicing the company’s customers.

“It’s hard to narrow down a favorite memory after 33 years” said a senior director of Driver Personnel in a recent company blog. “I would say that those times when J.B. Hunt himself would walk through and pat everyone on the back were definitely very special memories!”





She also described the innovation she has seen from the company during her tenure.

“I would say one of the biggest changes I’ve seen over the years is transitioning away from taking students to only hiring experienced drivers. This was considered an extremely bold move within the industry and we were told we would fail. Obviously they didn’t realize that when we set our minds to doing something it gets accomplished. The other major transformation I’ve seen would have to be moving from being an over-the-road driving company to a company that provides a wide array of transportation solutions.”

J.B Hunt’s chief commercial officer and executive vice president of people and human resources Shelley Simpson has been at the forefront of a lot of that change including the introduction of J.B. Hunt 360 its digital freight matching tool.

During the event Simpson pointed out that while the company has seen positive change and innovation one thing has remained the same: the J.B. Hunt logo.

“There’s nothing more powerful than seeing that scroll. Anytime somebody sees that they see our drivers they see our commitment” said Simpson. “Our customers are constantly saying ‘Can you do more?’ It reminds me of what Mr. Hunt said – ‘Is it big yet?’ Our customers are saying that to us as well and that’s exciting.”

To observe the anniversary J.B. Hunt has created custom-wrapped trailers that will be driven by the company’s more tenured drivers. Hunt will continue to post content on its website’s anniversary page throughout the year.

XPO celebrates graduates of its LTL development program

As part of the company’s focus on diversity and inclusion the transportation services company XPO Logistics launched its internal eLearning platform XPO University in 2020.





With classes tailored to various elements of transportation including truckload less-than-truckload and technology it aims to create an accessible development program for employees.

Recently XPO (NYSE:XPO) celebrated 48 individuals who completed its LTL Freight Leadership Certification which included over 20 hours of online learning focused on operations technology and best leadership practices for moving LTL shipments.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Jack Henry Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Vance Sherard: Thank you Alan. Good morning and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson President and COO. After my opening remarks I will turn the call over to Dave for his comments on our business and the industry. After Dave concludes his comments Greg will discuss our recent strategic benchmark survey recent success metrics for multiple solutions our strategic focus on AI plus other key initiatives. Mimi will then provide commentary around the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website.

Concluding our prepared remarks Dave will add some closing comments. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder this call includes certain forward-looking statements including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations events objectives strategies trends or results. Like any statement about the future these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information please refer to yesterday’s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements.

On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday’s press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave.

David Foss: Thank you Vance. Good morning everyone. I’d like to begin today’s call by remembering Jack Henry Board member Laura Kelly who passed away unexpectedly on March 15. Laura served on our Board for over a decade and was a cherished colleague and friend to all who had the privilege of working with her. With over 30 years of experience in senior leadership roles she brought invaluable insights wisdom and financial expertise to our organization. Beyond her remarkable professional achievements Laura was known for her kindness generosity and unwavering dedication to making a positive impact. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to John and Jake and the rest of Laura’s family during this incredibly difficult time.

Let’s now transition to our quarterly results. We’re very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and overall business performance. As always I’d like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024 total revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 3% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a strong quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

We also had a solid quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release this was our best third quarter ever for sales bookings. During the quarter we inked 11 competitive core takeaways with one of them being a multibillion-dollar institution. For the year we’ve now signed six multibillion-dollar institutions topping last year’s full-year total of five. Additionally we signed seven deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We are seeing strong interest in our new Financial Crimes Defender solution with 11 new contracts in Q3. Additionally we signed 45 new contracts for our new Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for the Zelle FedNow and RTP payments networks that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time.

We continue to see success with our card processing solution signing 14 new card processing clients this quarter. Our Banno digital banking platform remains very popular with 69 new signings in Q3 including 37 contracts for Banno business. We now have over 11.6 million users live on Banno and we’re continuing to add approximately 200000 users per month. Even with our strong sales success in Q3 we continued to replenish our sales pipeline and keep it near an all-time high. As we look towards the end of our fiscal year we remain very optimistic about the industry the demand for our solutions our ability to deliver outstanding service and our long-term prospects for success. With that I’ll turn it over to Greg for more detail on our solutions and businesses.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you Dave. As some of you have seen we recently released the 2024 results from our Annual Strategy Benchmark survey. This survey offers insight into concerns opportunities and technology priorities from bank and credit union CEOs. The survey indicated that 80% of bank and credit union CEOs plan to increase technology spending over the next two years. Of those the largest segment 35% plan to increase investments between 6% and 10%. We also inquired where they plan to invest over the next two years. The top four areas for planned investment were fraud detection digital banking data analytics and automation all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions through our technology modernization strategy.

As previously announced we recently launched our cloud-native AI-powered Financial Crimes Defender fraud detection platform. We now have 16 clients live and another 175 clients in the implementation queue. In addition we announced in March the Financial Crimes Defender was named the best fraud prevention platform by fintech breakthrough an independent market intelligent organization. Dave mentioned earlier that we have more than 11.6 million registered users on our cloud-native Banno digital banking platform. We continue to see strong interest in our recently launched Banno business solution that provides a modern banking experience for small and medium-sized businesses. As of March 31st we had 124 clients live and about 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation.

In terms of data analytics we continue to make progress on our data broker and executive dashboard solutions. Both are part of the cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. Data broker which is currently in beta will eventually provide access to all of a client’s Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution we are developing an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help executives at our financial institutions make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize. Related to automation technology one new Jack Henry platform offering we haven’t spoken much about yet is our cloud-native online deposit and loan account opening solution.

This integrated solution will provide a seamless digital account opening experience for our clients that enables them to streamline processes automate workflows and better serve both retail and commercial loan clients. We plan to begin the beta phase with clients in early calendar year 2025. The survey also found that 96% of our clients plan to add payment services over the next two years. We continue to offer a full range of payment solutions in our pay center application as well as other areas of our payment groups. As of March 31st we had 312 clients using Zelle 275 clients using RTP the real-time payments network which represents 48% of the live RTP clients and 190 clients using FedNow representing 29% of the live FedNow clients. One final point on the survey findings.

They were consistent with what we heard from our clients at our Annual Strategic Initiative Symposium in late April. While financial institutions are concerned about the increasing cost of deposits and impact to interest margins there is a general feeling of optimism and less concerned about an economic slowdown this year versus what we heard a year ago. One topic we spent a lot of time discussing that the strategic initiative Symposium is artificial intelligence. We presented in detail Jack Henry’s framework for building the necessary guardrails education training use of acceptable tools et cetera. We continue to actively identify opportunities to leverage AI aiming to enhance client solutions and optimize internal process and work streams.

Incorporating AI into select client solutions like financial crimes defender data broker executive dashboard and Banno conversations is part of that strategy. We are approaching AI deployment thoughtfully ensuring it benefits our clients and associates and aligns with our commitment to data privacy protection and security. Our strategy ensures we are responsibly bold and balanced. It’s been about 18 months since our corporate rebranding initiative to retire the Symitar ProfitStars and Jack Henry banking brands as we now simply go-to-market as Jack Henry. As we said at that time uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry’s role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice one Jack Henry.

We recently received results from an independent brand study that showed that Jack Henry’s brand equity has increased by nine points in just 18 months. We specifically saw significant improvement with large regional financial institutions and millennials. This is important as we continue to execute on our strategy to provide innovative technology solutions to larger financial institutions beyond what we already provide today through both our payment and complementary groups. And millennials are a critical audience because they are taking on larger leadership roles at these financial institutions and having more influence and technology buyer decisions. Speaking of brand equity hopefully you all have seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 29th.

We believe the 2024 report is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we’ve been working on over the past year. This year’s report details how we are we’re supporting local communities with a focus on financial wellness through both our investments and innovative technology in a variety of philanthropic efforts. We also continue to further our commitment to valuing people with disabilities with the launch of a new associate-led business innovation group focused on awareness of visible and invisible disabilities. The report also highlights some of the public Best Places to Work recognition we received from organizations like Newsweek Computer World and USA Today. As part of our planned organizational changes we recently announced the promotion of Shannon McLaughlin who is currently President of Jack Henry Credit Union Solutions to Chief Operating Officer effective July 1st.

Shannon has been with Jack Henry for nine years but has close to 30 years working with both banks and credit unions and senior technology and operational roles. Shannon is a strategic visionary leader who has significantly contributed to our company’s overall success and we’ll continue to do so as the next Chief Operating Officer. I want to close by recognizing Dave for the exceptional job he has done as CEO over the past eight years. Under Dave’s leadership Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions. I also want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance. He has prepared me well as I step into the CEO role on July 1st and I’m honored to continue leading our company with an unwavering focus on our associates clients and shareholders.

With that I will turn it over to Mimi for more details on the numbers.

Mimi Carsley: Thank you Greg and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I’ll start with the details driving our third quarter and year-to-date results then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Q3 GAAP revenue increased 6% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7% a continuation of consistently solid performance and keeping us on track for a strong fiscal 2024. Year-to-date growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and stronger on non-GAAP at 8%. Deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 which we pre-released last week was down approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients.

Year-to-date deconversion revenue is $9.9 million $7.2 million less than the prior period. Now let’s look more closely at the details. GAAP services and support revenue increased 4% while non-GAAP increased a more robust 6%. Year-to-date the increase was 6% for GAAP and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Service and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for the year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has long been a key to double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue which is 43% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model.

We saw positive performance with 8% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date delivered 9% for both. Consistent with recent results drivers include positive demand for our digital solutions card processing other payment processing and other processing revenues. In closing out revenue commentary I would like to highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue which increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees. Next R&D increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter.

The increase is primarily due to cloud consumption costs net of capitalization. For the year-to-date R&D increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly on a GAAP basis SG&A rose 7% for the quarter and 8% on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to higher personnel costs. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased 23% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The primary GAAP differences are the $16.4 million in onetime related costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program. [indiscernible] in Q1 and prior period $7.4 million gain on asset sales. For non-GAAP the difference is primarily due to the higher personnel costs and absence of gain on sale of assets. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 30 basis points of increased non-GAAP margin which was 20.8%.

Non-GAAP margin benefited from focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce while retaining key talent. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.19 up 7%. Separating results into the 3 operating segments we’re pleased to see across the board positive performance. Our core segment revenue increased 8% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 216 basis points. We continue to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 124 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 121 basis points.

This was due to continuing growth in our EPS business and moderate card growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends and a slightly tough comp combined with the focused cost management. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 103 basis points of margin expansion. And finally complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 33 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 8% with 28 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date reflects digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Segment quarterly margins were impacted by moderate headwinds from direct support costs and license and fees. Let’s now turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation.

Year-to-date operating cash flow was $336 million $129 million increase over prior period. Excluding proceeds from the sale of assets free cash flow was $172 million significantly more than the $54 million last year. Our base case entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximately $29 million overpayment last fiscal year as well as improved cash tax outlook this fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to share value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 19%. Additionally I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year-to-date period including $20 million in share repurchase offsetting annual dilution $25 million in debt reduction and $116 million in dividends.

With three quarters of the year complete we’re nearing the conclusion of our fiscal year and therefore I’ll conclude with guidance changes. As you’re aware yesterday’s press release included updated fiscal 2024 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP metrics. As a reminder we filed an 8-K on August 3rd that described how starting in the current fiscal year we’re using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. While we reported third quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 we are reiterating our full year deconversion guidance of $16 million. We are reiterating both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth and expect non-GAAP growth to potentially have a bias towards the lower end of our 7.4% to 8.0% growth range.

Due to the continued positive operational results and a focus on cost management we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 45 to 50 basis points compared to the 35 to 40 basis points previously provided. The full-year tax rate estimate remains at 23.5%. Incorporating the noted positive update full-year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $5.15 to $5.19 per share from the previous guidance of $5.09 to $5.13 per share. As a reminder the guidance or deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue VEDIP severance-related costs and nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2024. Due to the better than initially anticipated cash tax payments improved margins and contributions from favorable net interest our full year guidance for free cash flow conversion has increased to 70% to 75% from the previous commentary of 60%.

In conclusion Q3 results reflected continued momentum of the strong execution we’ve seen thus far this year and we expect a solid finish for the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our diligent and dedicated associates that drove these strong results in Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. Before I turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. While I haven’t had the pleasure of working with Dave as long as others I cherished our time together. I want to thank Dave for giving me the opportunity to work for this amazing company for being so incredibly generous with his wisdom and support for so many small and meaningful pieces of guidance over the past two years.

He is a role model of service leadership and doing the right thing. We are fortunate to have him lead the Jack Henry Board and I look forward to this continued journey together. Dave?

David Foss: Well thank you Mimi. As you are all undoubtedly aware this marks my final earnings call as CEO before my transition to Executive Board Chair on July 1st. Reflecting on my career at Jack Henry this has been an incredibly humbling journey for me both personally and professionally. And I’m beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to lead this great company for the past eight years. As we move forward I have the utmost confidence in Greg and the rest of our exceptional team to sustain our reputation for great technology and service as well as our strong financial performance. I’ve cherished the opportunity to get to know all of you over the years and appreciate your insightful questions and thorough analysis.

I thank our investors for their trust in Jack Henry and our clients for allowing us to serve their needs. And lastly I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to our associates. It is their dedication and unwavering commitment to supporting our clients and each other that drives our success and makes this company special. With that we’ll open up the floor for questions. Alan if you would please open the line.

Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.

Kartik Mehta: Well Dave it’s been good talking to all these calls. We’ll miss speaking with you in the future at least on the calls anyways.

David Foss: Thank you Kartik.

Kartik Mehta: Dave I wanted to get your perspective on maybe just the backlog. I know Mimi you said as you’re expecting maybe the lower end of the non-GAAP revenue for fiscal ’24 and maybe backlog is a wrong word to use. But just your perspective on based on what the sales pipeline looks like and how good you feel about as we move forward the ability to predict revenue and maybe why the lower end of the guidance.

David Foss: So I’ll give you my perspective and then I’ll ask Mimi to comment. So first off I mentioned in the release and in my comments that this was a — the best sales quarter we’ve ever — best third quarter sales quarter we’ve ever had. And I also highlighted the fact that the sales pipeline has been replenished almost to that same record level that it was at last quarter. So as I see what’s going on in the sales pipeline but even more importantly as I see what’s happening here in the quarter that we’re in right now which of course we’re not here to announce I feel really bullish about the future opportunity as far as sales at Jack Henry and our ability to continue to deliver. So that’s a sales perspective. I’ll ask Mimi to go — oh did you want to say something.

Gregory Adelson: Well let me just add this. So I think the other thing is that we’ve had unbelievable sales success this year. But as we’ve highlighted many times the deals that we’re selling this year for the most part don’t actually become revenue opportunities until future years and future quarters. So I think part of this is yes there are some things that are in an implementation queue and we’re working through all those as we always do. But there isn’t really anything that is signaling anything other than hopefully future success based on what we’ve seen. So I just want to make sure that you understand that all of the sales success we’re seeing right now will be in future quarters.

Mimi Carsley: Yes. The only thing I would add Kartik is that we feel really good about all three operating segments revenue. The total revenue is still very much in line with our long-term algorithm and what we thought about at the beginning of the year. There is a part of our business that does relate to economic factors in U.S. [indiscernible] that’s the card business. So I think as we look out for the year we feel really confident about our ability to hit that range.

Kartik Mehta: Perfect. And then Greg just you talked about AI and maybe the opportunities in there. But I’m wondering for Jack Henry is there an opportunity for you to use it internally and could that lower cost? And if so is there an upfront cost that you’re dealing with in an effort to implement that?

Gregory Adelson: Yes it’s a great question Kartik. So the short answer is we are spending a lot of time on internal operational efficiency opportunities throughout our entire organization. In fact we most recently had a corporate leadership team meeting where each of the individual business units and nonoperating business units all presented their ideas for utilization of AI and specifically generative AI. And so we’re going through prioritization. We’ve done a really good job of spending time making sure that we’re focused on building the efficiencies first. Getting the learnings and all the other stuff. We’ve just approved a couple of utilizations for the Microsoft copilot for internal use and the GitHub codeveloper stuff for the developers — or copilot sorry.

And we’re actually in the process of going through all of those things and looking for ways that we can continue to build efficiency and effectiveness first as we’re actually doing some other things within some of our products that I announced as well.

Mimi Carsley: The only thing I would add on there as Greg said responsibly bold and balance is our approach and that covers both the usage as well as the investment. And so we’re using the internal existing policies and processes to prioritize to develop business cases to think about the benefits not — this isn’t just a curiosity. There has to be business cases. And so all of that will still sit within our planned budget and R&D and internal expense policies.

Kartik Mehta: Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi. Please go ahead.

Andrew Schmidt: Hi Dave Greg Mimi. Thanks for taking my questions. And Dave congrats again on the transition.

David Foss: Thank you.

Andrew Schmidt: Want to start on the margin front. Good performance here. Mimi maybe you could put a finer point on this. I know that there were some — you mentioned some operational efficiencies that drove this maybe some mix factors as well. But maybe a finer point on that. And then as we think about the go-forward margin trajectory it seems like you’re above this year kind of what you’ve outlined for the longer term. So how does this — this year’s margin performance kind of inform the view on the longer-term margin progression? Thanks a lot.

Mimi Carsley: You’re welcome. So Andrew I would say for this year it came down to strong execution operational focus it’s a bit of product mix as well but we’re being very diligent around headcount around spending for the year. There’s also some timing around products and how that amortization impacts us as well which is also something that we’re just going to be thoughtful about for next year. It’s really early still in our budget planning. Our teams are getting together and thinking about the prioritization I would say at this point still thinking about that long-term range we’ve given versus an elevated state but we’re always trying to deliver shareholder value. And so that’s going to always be a focus for us.

Andrew Schmidt: Perfect. And then maybe just digging into the average contract size of recent cohorts. I know the attach rates have gone up over the past few years but maybe you can put just a finer point in terms of what you’re seeing in terms of just a complementary product adoption and just average contract sizes perhaps recent periods versus maybe a year or two years ago. Thank you very much.

David Foss: Andrew it’s Dave. So one of the challenges in this whenever we have a conversation like this is there is no such thing as average when it comes to our contracts. You’re correct. The attach rates tend to be high with our core clients. But remember we sell a lot of solutions that are outside the core base and the variety of solutions that we sell roughly 300 different solutions. They range from very small ticket price to very large ticket price. Most of the solutions — almost everything we sell today is hosted. So it’s rare for us to sell a licensed version of a solution. Well then in the hosted contract or are they going to be hosted for three years or 10 years or so they’re trying to talk about average is pretty challenging.

The best indicator because we have used the same measurement approach for sales quota attainment for many years now the best measure is the fact that as I just mentioned Q3 was the best Q3 we’ve ever had. That’s the most significant indicator of sales success is the fact that — we’ve used the same way of measuring contracts for many years. And so it’s a good relative performance indicator for our sales organization. and sales overall are up. So I know it’s frustrating to not be able to talk about averages but it’s just really not a practical thing to try and do in our world.

Andrew Schmidt: No it makes sense yes. A lot of different shapes and sizes that they’re [indiscernible]. Congrats again Dave. Thank you very much.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you.

David Foss: Thank you.

Operator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Darrin Peller: Thanks. And Dave I want to — also my congrats as well. [indiscernible] so always appreciate the help. Guys maybe just start off on a free cash discussion. If we could just revisit it obviously has gone through its periods of strength above 80% and below 60%. Now you’re saying back to 70%-plus. Maybe just give us a sense a little more on what the driving factors are and the sustainability of it now and — maybe just help us understand if we’re back to 80% going forward in the next couple of years?

Mimi Carsley: Darrin it has been a bit of a roller coaster ride. And in part that was due to the lack of clarity from a legislative front. As we said on last quarter’s call we were hopeful the progress on Congress addressing the Section 174 R&D-related impact on cash taxes would go through — we were optimistic but not betting on that. But even in the absence of that the clarity that the treasury to IRS our outside consultants our incredible tax team here Jack Henry have had has really helped us from being able to discover savings from a cash tax perspective that impacted effectively last year a benefit so that would mean less cash tax paid this year. And so even if that legislation does not get fully addressed I think we’re in an improved position versus where we thought earlier in the year.

We’re still hopeful that it will be addressed. But that’s the biggest driver that represents over $29 million in last year’s impact alone let alone some additional for this year. So that’s a biggest impact for the free cash flow. And I think that’s a sustainable for the Dave board.

Darrin Peller: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks. Greg maybe just on your side if you just talk about what you’re seeing in the market more specifically around demand for core commercial use order. Obviously the cloud discussion we’ve had for some time now. Again just inflections you’re seeing for specific products or offerings or maybe vice versa anything that’s weaker? Any more color would be great. Thanks.

Gregory Adelson: Yes sure. So I think a couple of things as part of our survey and even just obviously with our regular conferences and conversations with our clients deposit growth continues to be a big driver. Operational efficiency continues to be. And that’s why we really highlighted some of those key products that we’re already focused on and fraud being a big one things that we’re already focused on and driving out in the market set and we’re continuing to see some nice pickup in all of those. So those continue to be big ones. I think related to the tech modernization and what we’re doing with our modules. We’re continuing to have a lot of success on the execution side of that. We’ll continue to talk more about that in future calls.

But right now we’re really excited about what we’ve done with data broker and executive dashboard. We think those are some products that really are not out there in the space today and we’ll continue to create an opportunity for us to show the advancement of what we’re doing in our cloud native technology and utilization of generative AI as part of that. So all of those will kind of tie in to what the demand has been around deposits fraud opportunities operational efficiency as the three big things.

Darrin Peller: Great. Thanks guys.

Operator: Our next question comes from Vasu Govil of KBW.

Vasundhara Govil: Hi thanks for taking my questions. I guess first quick one for Mimi. I know it’s a little too early to talk about the ’25 outlook but just based on the new sales momentum that you’ve had this year it seems like you’re setting up for stable if not accelerating revenue growth into next year. Any reason to think that may not be the case? And then Mimi if you could also specifically comment on the payment segment trending slightly softer than we would have thought just how it performed relative to internal expectations and what you’re expecting for the go-forward trend line there?

Mimi Carsley: So Vasu I wish I could tell you with more precision the next year targets but it’s just a little too early. We’re still during the budget process. But there’s no reason to have any other expectation than grow the algorithm at a high level. There are some things that present challenges each year from a grow-over perspective that even though we’re having tremendous success with the sales pipeline there’s lower convert merge that impacted this year. You just never know from a grow-over perspective. But I think the growth algorithm is a pretty good framework to think about for next year. As it relates to this year and the payments question I would say that that really — to categorize it we saw slower transaction growth broadly slower growth in debit."

Other hawks occur here in August but red-tailed hawks are the most numerous and the easiest to recognize. They are birds of open country. At this time of the year they are conspicuous on utility poles and exposed branches. It’s not uncommon to encounter two or more red-tailed hawks in a short drive. Often they are spaced a pole or two apart. Likely these are young-of-the-year siblings. Having emerged from the nests they are honing their hunting skills.

Young red-tailed hawks tend to be paler than adults but they are readily recognized by the reddish tail feathers that give the species its name. The red tail is especially obvious when the birds are in flight and seeing the tail clinches the identification.

RELATED STORIES:

Mike Jacobs: Tuesday brought a rush hour for birds My sense is that black-and-white warblers are not common here and the Grand Forks County checklist supports this notion. It calls the species “fairly common” in spring and fall migration but “rare” in summer.



Jacobs: Seldom seen bird species show up in the Red River Valley Trumpeter swans occurred here probably in fairly large numbers until the late 1800s when people swarmed over the landscape.



Jacobs: Noise betrays the great-crested flycatcher Unlike most other flycatcher species the great-crested flycatcher is a cavity nester often using holes initially chiseled by woodpeckers.



The red-tailed hawk is a member of a group of broad-winged soaring hawks collectively known as buteos. The specific name for the red-tailed hawk is Buteo jamaicencis a reference to the locale where the bird was first described. This hawk is widespread however occurring almost everywhere in North America except the High Arctic. In our area it is mostly a summer bird although in some years red-tailed hawks linger into the winter. In any case they don’t go far. Red-tailed hawks winter in southern Minnesota and South Dakota.

Red-tailed hawks are what is called an “edge species” one that seeks open areas bounded by trees. The pattern of fields and shelterbelts that characterizes the Red River Valley offers ideal habitat for the red-tailed hawks and utility poles and fence posts provide what might be called hunting stands for the red-tails. They are opportunistic perch-and-pounce predators. Whatever passes by might become a meal from insects to rodents to snakes.

It would be a mistake to mark down every open-country hawk as a red-tailed hawk however. Three other closely related hawks occur in the area. Perhaps the most often encountered is Swainson’s hawk another large buteo. Others are broad-winged ferruginous and rough-legged hawks.

Swainson’s hawks become increasingly common farther west. In much of central and western North Dakota they outnumber red-tailed hawks. While the species are superficially alike because they are open-country soaring hawks a second glance will reveal telling differences. Swainson’s hawks are brick red on the upper chest or bib while red-tailed hawks are white on the chest and upper belly though somewhat streaked across the belly itself. Another key difference is that in flight the leading edge of the Swainson’s wing is light. In red-tailed hawks the leading edge of the wing is dark.

Broad-winged hawks are smaller than red-tailed hawks and have a distinctly boxlike look in flight. Although there are nesting records most broad-winged hawks seen here are migrants. They are especially numerous in spring.

The ferruginous hawk might be called “the great hawk of the Great Plains.” It is a large pale buteo. Two marks to look for are the legs which appear dark against the white breast and areas of light plumage in the wings which appear also like windows.

The list of buteo species runs out with the rough-legged hawk an Arctic species that spends part of each winter here. Rough-legged hawks are especially common in November and I’ve dubbed the species “November hawk.” Rough-legged hawks are striking birds displaying contrasting – and variable – plumage of black and white. Uniquely among the buteos rough-legged hawks hover like some falcons do.

Of course the buteos do not exhaust the list of “hawk” species in the area since the word is widely used to mean any daytime predator including falcons harriers and even eagles.

Nor does August end the run of opportunities to see and enjoy red-tailed hawks. They often form large flocks for long-distance flights. These are called “kettles” and they occur on sunny days when heat rises from dark fields providing thermals that the hawks exploit.

Swainson’s hawks do this too and they are renowned for forming very large flocks. I’ve seen several hundred Swainson’s hawks in such situations. Swainson’s hawks spend the northern winters in the Southern Hemisphere where they are iconic birds of the Argentine pampas.

The Italian won his country the second gold of the night in one of the best Olympic campaigns of the Azzurri to date.

Jacobs joined high jump winner Gianmarco Tamberi who shared the gold medal with Qatar’s Mutaz Essa Barshim in bringing glory to Italy that night. However as the sport goes track athletes have to keep proving themselves in other competitions. The next major one in sign is the Prefontaine Classic which will take place next month.

While top competitors such as Fred Kerley Trayvon Bromell and Andre de Grasse will be present in the men’s 100m race the Italian press announced that Lamont Marcell Jacobs will not be participating.

This came as a shock given that he had just established himself as the fastest man on earth. However USA Olympic legend Michael Johnson felt that for Jacobs it was more of a way to preserve his position.

“His (Jacobs’) title is deserved but a bit tenuous due to no track record of consistent world-beating performances” Johnson wrote in a tweet. “If he goes on the Diamond League circuit and gets beaten badly in his first races as Olympic champ it further diminishes his title. Risky when he can stay home and be celebrated.”

Lamont Marcell Jacobs showed up at the perfect time in Tokyo

Lamont Marcell Jacobs was unheard of when it came to the track competition this year. Trayvon Bromell the favorite in the race crashed out in the semi-finals while Fred Kerley took silver for the USA backed by Ande de Grasse’s bronze for Canada. Jacobs however had a motivating run in the heats and ran on that heat to post a career-best timing of 9.80 seconds to win the gold.

Fred Kerley and Ande de Grasse also ran personal bests of 9.84 seconds and 9.89 seconds respectively. Jacobs showed up at the right time and delivered when needed the most. By staying out of the Prefontaine Classic he will hold on to his newly won title but the opportunity will pass on to other men.

The Alabama product landed at No. 68 on The Top 100 Players of 2021 a list that is being unveiled Sunday on NFL Network.

Rankings were determined by a vote of the league’s players.

Jacobs finished at No. 72 last year then finished in the top 10 in rushing yards and top five in carries and rushing touchdowns.

The 23-year-old has topped 1000 yards in each of his two seasons with the Raiders.

Jacobs who was drafted in the first round in 2019 is the only Raiders player unveiled so far with the top 45 still to be unveiled.

Johnson found that out in heartbreaking fashion on Wednesday in the Class 4A state championship match at Duluth High School.

The Knights fell 2-0 to Westminster in a rematch of the 2023 title match snapping several impressive streaks in the process. They had their 14 straight postseason game win streak going back to 2021 snapped; saw their 15 match win streak in 2024 come to end; and had their state title run end at two as they were looking to defend their Class 4A state title.

“It’s soccer. You win some you lose some” Johnson coach Frank Zamora said in a rainy interview afterwards. “This is still a young group. They now see what it’s like to lose at this stage and I'm sure they’ll learn from this and come back stronger and motivated next year.”

The Wildcats (17-4-2) dominated much of the first half against the defending champions. They produced a solid scoring chance just two minutes in and Benjamin Villatoro was forced to make a diving save on another shot in the 9th minute.

The Knights' usually consistent ball-control offense sputtered for the first 19 minutes with six midfield turnovers. As a result the Wildcats were able to generate 7 shots many within 20 yards.

Johnson’s 6th turnover would contribute mightily. The Wildcats would take advantage as Will Stewart found himself alone on the left side for a 10-yard blast. Villatoro was able to make a diving save but that left Aditya Kaul wide open for an easy goal on the rebound for a 1-0 lead with 21:16 left in the first half.

The Knights (18-2-1) would get a huge break two minutes later however as Westminsters’s Tristen Lewis received a red card when he upended Vazquez who was on a breakaway just outside of the box.

Johnson turned that into their first two shots of the game moments later but Andres Galacia’s blast from 20-yards sailed wide left.

From there the Johnson offense awakened. They created three corners and outshot the Wildcats 4-1 over the final 20 minutes. But it would still go to the half 1-0 Westminster despite two huge opportunities for the Knights in the final two minutes..

A 15-yard blast by Vazquez after a beautiful long ball into the box sailed just over the crossbar in the 38th minute. Another Galacia shot from 22-yards out sailed just wide of the left crossbar in the final 30 seconds.

Westminster outshot the Knights 9-4 in the opening 40 minutes but generated just one shot after the red card to Lewis.

Johnson took the man-advantage into the second half but it was quickly erased on a questionable call against Jalil Chavez who got a red card of his own in the 42nd minute.

With the match back to even strength the Knights were able to generate a 6-2 shot advantage midway into the second half. But they could not cash in for the equalizer.

The Wildcats added a huge insurance goal with 14 minutes left to essentially seal it on a header from Alex Na off a corner in the 66th minute.

“Westminster came out with a lot of intensity and we did not match it” Zamora said. “We definitely picked it up when we had the man advantage but we missed some really good opportunities that would have changed the momentum. Then we got the red card and changed the momentum back a little bit.

“We had chances. We just couldn’t finish and find the net. But I think there were a lot of people that did not think we could get back to this point and the younger guys showed that they can play. I’m very proud of the season they had.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9lbWlseS1tYXluYXJkLWpvaG5zb24tc2hhcmVzLWFkb3JhYmxlLXBob3RvLW9mLWhlci1zb25zLWdpYnNvbi1hbmQtam9uZXMtODY0NDA2MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emily Maynard Johnson Shares Adorable Photo of Sons Gibson and Jones Wearing Matching Pink Messi Jerseys,"Emily Maynard Johnson's sons are proving they're Leo Messi's most adorable fans.

The former prime minister was initially told by polling station staff he would not be allowed to vote in the police and crime commissioner election in South Oxfordshire without proving his identity.

The misstep was embarrassing for Johnson because the requirement to bring photo ID is a stipulation of the Elections Act he introduced in 2022 while in Downing Street.

The Electoral Commission has warned that hundreds of thousands of people could be excluded from voting because of the law which it said could have a disproportionate effect on some groups.

A source close to Johnson confirmed he had forgotten the photo ID but did later vote. “Mr Johnson voted Conservative” a spokesperson added. Earlier on Thursday he had posted on X: “The polls are now open. Vote Conservative!”

It came after the veterans minister apologised to former military personnel who were prevented from using their veterans ID to vote in the local elections in England.

Downing Street said it would “look into” changing the controversial rules which require photo ID in order to vote to allow veterans’ ID cards on to the list of valid identification.

The minister Johnny Mercer was responding to a complaint from a veteran who said he had been turned away at a polling station. “I am sorry about this. The legislation on acceptable forms of ID came out before the veterans ID cards started coming out in January this year. I will do all I can to change it before the next one” Mercer tweeted.

A government spokesperson said it was the intention to add the veterans’ card to the list of accepted ID and that defence identity cards for serving armed forces members were already accepted. “We are already consulting on this” they said.

Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said earlier that Downing Street had no concerns about voter ID more generally adding: “We don’t want to see anyone turned away from polling stations we want everyone to be able to vote. Experience from the last local elections was that 99.75% of people were able to cast their vote successfully.”

Ministers have faced significant criticism over the limited number of acceptable forms of ID particularly the decision to allow documents such as the older person’s bus pass but almost none issued to younger ones such as other travel passes and student documents.

The Electoral Commission warned last year that it was difficult to assess the consequences of requiring photo ID before voting.

It said the laws could have a disproportionate effect on poorer people those with disabilities and people from minority ethnic backgrounds and that the disfranchising effect of the law was very likely to be proportionately greater in a general election.

Among people who did not vote in May last year 4% said this was because of voter ID. If this figure went up to 5% it could mean about 800000 people staying away from the polls at a general election.

A Tory MP was among those caught out by the voter ID requirement as polls opened for the local elections in England and Wales. The Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said his dyspraxia was the reason he had lost his documents.

Hunt sent a message to his local Conservative WhatsApp group stating: “Bit of drama. Turns out I have no appropriate ID to vote tomorrow. There is an emergency proxy option if you lose your ID … who would like the honours?”

But Hunt said it was inappropriate for Labour and social media users to mock him for misplacing his documents given his developmental coordination disorder.

“I don’t want to blame everything on my dyspraxia but it’s a factor in my life I have to deal with” he told the Evening Standard. “It’s all well and good people saying we need to have more neurodiverse members of parliament but having a massive pile-on on them I don’t think it’s going to encourage more people.”

The Electoral Commission said “most voters” were able to cast their ballots despite the ID requirements.

“Our initial assessment of the elections is that they were well run and millions of voters were able to exercise their democratic rights” a spokesperson said. “This is a testament to the efforts of electoral administrators who work tirelessly to ensure the smooth delivery and integrity of polls.”"

Jon Kendle / Special to The Canton Repository

This past week was filled with incredible moments as the Pro Football Hall of Fame carried out its Mission to Honor the Heroes of the Game Preserve its History Promote its Values and Celebrate Excellence EVERYWHERE during Enshrinement Week Powered by Johnson Controls.

For the first time Archie Manning the second overall pick in 1971 NFL Draft by the New Orleans Saints visited Canton and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The Mannings – father Archie and sons Peyton and Eli – have set themselves apart when it comes to the family business of playing professional football.

Each drafted in the first round the three quarterbacks combined for 48 years of NFL experience 338 regular-season wins 20 Pro Bowls five league MVPs two Walter Peyton NFL Man of the Year Awards four Super Bowl victories and three Super Bowl MVP honors.

“In my youth in New Orleans and in Newman School football carved out a place for my favorite quarterback my hero my role model my dad Archie Manning to pass on something he loved to me” Peyton Manning explained during his Enshrinement speech last Sunday.

Peyton put up some of the most impressive passing statistics of any NFL quarterback in League history during his 18-year career.

It began in 1998 during Peyton’s rookie season. While the Indianapolis Colts struggled as a team Manning showed flashes of brilliance. The first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft he set rookie records for completions (326) attempts (575) yards (3739) and touchdowns (26).

Two years later on Oct. 22 2000 Peyton threw for 268 yards and three touchdowns while completing 16 of 20 passes against the New England Patriots. He finished the game with a perfect passer rating.

A “perfect game” is credited to any player who hits the top of the passer rating chart. A player cannot achieve higher than a 158.3 rating according to the system. No quarterback with a minimum of 20 pass attempts in a game has achieved as many “perfect games” as Manning (four) since the passer rating system was implemented in 1973.

Following 13 seasons with the Colts Manning sat out a season as he recovered from a devastating neck injury. Uncertain if he would play another snap in the NFL he signed with the Denver Broncos and closed out his Hall of Fame career with four more seasons of outstanding play and a Super Bowl 50 victory.

He also continued his assault on the NFL’s record books. During the NFL’s opening night kickoff game of the 2013 season Manning connected on a league-tying single-game record seven touchdown passes as he led the Broncos over the defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens 49-27.

The five-time NFL Most Valuable Player became the first quarterback in the post-merger era to throw for seven touchdowns in a game. He joined Hall of Famer Y.A. Tittle (and later Nick Foles) as the only quarterbacks to accomplish this feat without throwing an interception. Manning finished the game completing 27 of 42 passes for 462 yards.

Later that season Manning broke the NFL single-season record for touchdown passes and became the first player to record 50 TD passes and throw for 5000 yards in the same season.

With his final pass of the 2013 NFL season Peyton connected with receiver Demaryius Thomas for a five-yard TD. The play not only added six points to the scoreboard but it also set two NFL marks for Manning: 55 TD passes for the season and a single-season passing record of 5477 yards.

Manning would retire after the 2015 season as the NFL’s leader for career passing yards (71940) career passing touchdowns (539) total wins including playoffs (201) 4000-plus-yard passing seasons (14) and consecutive seasons with at least 25 passing touchdowns (13).

The Pro Football Hall of Fame as it does for ever player who played the game at the professional level followed along every step of the way to make sure Manning’s legacy is preserved forever in Canton.

Because as Manning so eloquently stated during his speech on Sunday night: “The future of this game is ours to shape. We just need to take tomorrow on our shoulders as readily as we donned our pads before each game. Let this moment become a cherished memory and then remember: A legacy is only worthwhile when there is a future to fuel.”

With the trio of Tyron Smith Zack Martin and La’el Collins all suffering injuries players such as offensive guard Connor McGovern had to step up in their place.

McGovern was undoubtedly disappointed with not winning a starting job out of training camp but what was once going to be a sophomore season playing behind multiple Pro Bowlers eventually realized the Penn State products dream. The Cowboys selected McGovern in the third round of the 2019 NFL draft and after missing the 2019 season due to a torn pectoral muscle he became an eight-game starter in 2020.

During the season McGovern gained valuable experience that has to have instilled some confidence in him for offensive line coach Joe Philbin and head coach Mike McCarthy. As the two shuffle pieces around during training camp and the start of the preseason McGovern is keeping himself in the running for a key role in 2021.

Our player profile countdown series continues with No. 66 Connor McGovern.

Player Profile

McGovern is in an intriguing spot for 2021. Throughout training camp and preseason he's seen reps with the first team while the Cowboys experiment with left guard Connor Williams playing center. Following McGovern's experience in 2020 this isn't too much of a surprise to see him garnering playing time but will he be a starter in 2021? Last year was an opportunity that came because of injury and now McGovern's experience could keep him in the door if there are any additional ones. Williams is seen as the starter at left guard while Tyler Biadisz will be at center. McGovern has experience at every spot on the interior offensive line and it will come in handy if he needs to move into a spot on the fly. There could even be more to McGovern's story in 2021. There could be a chance Williams' time playing center has as much to do with him seeing a role there as it could be about seeing McGovern as a member of the starting 5. Every starter on the offensive line went down in 2020 except for Williams and McGovern could be more than just a serviceable backup in 2021.

Rem Koolhaas is a Pritzker Architecture Prize winner the founder of OMA Design Group and is seen by many as one of the most significant architects and urbanists of his generation. Koolhaas’ most notable pupils include the great Zaha Hadid. After discussing various options AMEX and Koolhaas quickly chose the architect’s Boompjes project for the Rem Koolhaas x Centurion Art Card. The project was created as a high-profile commission to redevelop a district in Rotterdam Netherlands which was decimated by bombings during the second world war. The silk-screen drawings for the project embodied a “vision for better living” and paid homage to OMA which was founded in Rotterdam in 1980 besides the unbuilt Boompjes plot. The unfinished project has now found closure on the new Centurion card. “This was a groundbreaking project for myself and for OMA and it was exciting to dive back into it and capture its dynamics in the new design for the Centurion Card” Koolhaas commented.

Kehinde Wiley is an American portrait painter based out of New York City who was chosen to paint the official portrait of former U.S president Barack Obama. The Kehinde Wiley x Centurion Art Card incorporates botanical motifs from the artist’s painting of Princess Victoire of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha which is part of his famous An Economy of Grace series dedicated to celebrating African-American women. The portraits feature custom-made couture gowns designed by Riccardo Tisci who was with Givenchy at the time. “An important part of my work is the decorative organic background of the person being portrayed. The design on the Centurion Card stems from my interest in botanical elements and is a reference to my signature style” explains Wiley.

The final option includes unisex Prada Centurion wrist wear. The leather piece is made of scratch-resistant black saffiàno leather and includes a hidden payment chip.

The pandemic has brought European soccer clubs to their knees hit by a sudden drop in revenues while still paying players hefty salaries. Barcelona shocked the sports world last week when its most-famous player Lionel Messi left the Catalan club because it could no longer keep him financially.

The parlous state of soccer finances meanwhile is offering investment banks the opportunity to earn fees by bringing in new investors to plug an urgent hole. Goldman Sachs’s involvement follows a failed attempt to sell a stake in Italy’s top league - for which the bank had lined up financing - and JPMorgan Chase’s ill-fated backing of the breakaway European Super League."

4 Major Coca-Cola Brand Changes…

Recently Coca-Cola's been making some major shifts perhaps most notably in the form of discontinuations. In the spring the Coca-Cola Company announced the discontinuation of Coke Energy. This had been preceded by last fall's news that for the first time since 1963 Coca-Cola will no longer make Tab; nor are they continuing production of Odwalla juices and smoothies or Zico coconut water.

It's been reported that the shuttering of Coca-Cola's quieter-performing brands is due in large part to James Quincey the Coca-Cola Company's CEO since 2016 and chairman of the board since 2019 and his desire for aggressive investment in business development strategies and progressive corporate social responsibility initiatives like recycling.

A 2016 study by PwC states that 90% of sales in Africa's major economies come through informal channels -- markets and kiosks.

This presents a large market ripe for digitization and over the past five years African startups have risen to the challenge raising millions of dollars in the process. Today Omnibiz a Lagos-based startup joins the fray and has raised a seed round of $3 million to expand into new markets.

Omnibiz is a B2B e-commerce platform that connects fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) manufacturers to retailers by digitizing the supply chain stakeholders.

The platform offers a mobile app WhatsApp channel and a phone number that retailers can use to stock their shops. Omnibiz says in a statement that retailers ""can place orders at their convenience and have goods delivered to their doorstep at no cost.""

Omnibiz was launched in 2019 by Deepankar Rustagi. The Indian founder and CEO who has stayed in Nigeria for over two decades started his first startup VConnect in 2011 as an online marketplace and search engine to find local professionals for service needs.

The platform connected individuals with more than 100 services and over 500000 listed businesses across the country before shutting down in 2017 Rustagi claims.

Post-VConnect Rustagi consulted for multiple FMCG brands. He figured a need existed for manufacturers and retailers of goods to digitize their processes leading to the launch of Omnibiz in late 2019.

Omnibiz operates an asset-light retail distribution model. When a retailer makes an order on the Omnibiz platform it is requested from partner distributors who store goods on behalf of manufacturers and are traditionally known to help out with warehousing and transportation.

With Omnibiz these distributors can focus solely on warehousing and pass on the responsibility of transporting goods to Omnibiz's third-party logistics providers. The drivers of these logistics providers use Omnibiz to efficiently distribute the orders to the retailers within 24 hours.

""We work with manufacturers to provide visibility. Then buy goods from them and keep them in partner hubs that act as warehouses and distributors. Then use the services of drivers that work with third-party logistics drivers who get paid on every delivery made"" Rustagi told TechCrunch.

Digitizing this value chain helps retailers save working capital while Omnibiz connects them with more than 20 brands including Coca-Cola Nestlé Kellogg's Unilever Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark.

The B2B e-commerce retail company is currently in four cities across Nigeria -- Lagos Abuja Port Harcourt and Kaduna. The company will add two more cities Ibadan and Kano before the end of August Rustagi adds.

By Rustagi's account Omnibiz will feed off his experience at VConnect his prior business that struggled to monetize and scale despite the huge traction it got as a popular local marketplace.

""We knew about small businesses and what sort of technology they like. That was our specialization but our business model didn't work. But in this case [Omnibiz] the monetization happens on our platform and there's money to be made for the small business. We've been growing 30% month-on-month for the last 12 months"" he said.

The B2B informal e-commerce market has seen a resurgence in the last couple of years. Kenya's Sokowatch and Twiga Nigeria's TradeDepot and Egypt's MaxAB have longed vied for market-leader positions in their respective markets.

The pandemic spiked more interest in their activities as all the aforementioned startups have raised money this past year including newcomers Kenya's MarketForce and now Omnibiz.

Some operate asset-light models while others take up the responsibility of managing the end-to-end digitization process. Rustagi believes the former is perfect for the company because it helps distributors expand their reach rather than eliminate them.

""I think scaling in one city with assets is not that difficult. But if you have to scale in 20 24 cities in a country like Nigeria or Ghana or Ivory Coast or East Africa the investment required will be very high."" Rustagi continued. ""So we think without significant investment in assets we will be able to scale much faster. And since we took the tech-first approach we have good control over the business. I believe we're in the right space and the right time with the right model.""

Omnibiz's seed round was led by V&R Africa Timon Capital and Tangerine Insurance. The round also included Lofty Inc. Musha Ventures Sunu Capital Launch Africa and Rising Tide Africa. It takes the company's total investment to $4 million. Rustagi also disclosed that the company also got funding from Seedstars and will participate in the accelerator's growth program.

""I think Omnibiz will be the role model for B2B retail in Africa and can scale well into other emerging markets. We are excited and happy to be supporting Omnibiz in all ways beyond just providing capital"" Raj Kulasingam and Vishal Agarwal of V&R Africa said in a statement.

Over the next few months Omnibiz will use the investment to expand in other West African cities outside Nigeria -- Abidjan Takoradi Kumasi and Accra. Food non-alcoholic beverages personal care and baby care products are the top categories on the Omnibiz platform. The company is planning to expand into new categories like alcoholic beverages and OTC pharmaceutical products.

Omnibiz will also use the investment to create new tech products that will enhance value for the retailers. The company will work with partners to increase the working capital availability for the retailers and digital tools to manage their business more efficiently.

""One of the key things we intend to do is to bring on medium-scale manufacturers who find it difficult to get the last-mile delivery to reach customers. We want to scale them so they can reach a large number of retailers. That's something we are rolling out so we can onboard more and more manufacturers"" said the CEO on Omnibiz's next plans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmRlcXVpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoZS1wZW9wbGUtcmVwb3J0L3NhdXJhYmgtbmF0aC1iaWRzLWFkaWV1LXRvLW9sYS84NTMyMTc3NdIBc2h0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmRlcXVpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy90aGUtcGVvcGxlLXJlcG9ydC9zYXVyYWJoLW5hdGgtYmlkcy1hZGlldS10by1vbGEvODUzMjE3NzU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saurabh Nath bids adieu to Ola,Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.,,,,,,,,,

COOLIDGE Ariz. — Two people have died and one woman was injured in a reported explosion near Coolidge.

Coolidge's city manager said the explosion near SR 87 and E. Randolph Road involved a Kinder Morgan major gas line. Officials believe the explosion was related to a gas line break.

A woman identified as Rosalina Alvarez from a rural farmhouse near the explosion was seriously burned. A Pinal County Sheriff's Office deputy found Alvarez walking on a dirt road.

Rosalina Alvarez told police that two people were unaccounted for. The remains of Luis Alvarez and the couple's 14-year-old daughter Valeria Alvarez were believed to have been found.

The Pinal County Medical Examiner will confirm the identities.

PCSO said at least one home caught on fire in the area.

Kinder Morgan one of the largest infrastructure companies in the country said in a statement that its El Paso Natural Gas Company experienced a pipeline failure around 5:30 a.m. The fire at the site has since been extinguished and all employees have been accounted for.

Previous reports from officials suggested there was a gas line worker unaccounted for.

Kinder Morgan went on to say in the statement:

""The company has deployed employees to the area and has isolated the impacted pipeline segment. The company is coordinating with local first responders and relevant state and federal agencies and an investigation into the cause of the failure will be conducted.""

Around 5:45 a.m. officials said multiple residents called in about the loud explosion.

Fire from the explosion closed the north and southbound lanes of State Route 87 for a short time however lanes are now reopened. Coolidge police is advising people to avoid the area.

Nearby gas lines were shut off which may affect customers in the area. There are no reported power outages related to the incident.

Animal control from Pinal County was also called out to the area for injured livestock.

There is no known cause of the explosion and officials may not determine one for a while.

By Colm Fulton and Supantha Mukherjee / Reuters STOCKHOLM





As Klarna Bank AB’s billionaire founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski prepares to stage one of the biggest-ever European fintech company listings a feast of capitalism he credits an unlikely backer for his runaway success: the Swedish welfare state.

In particular the 39-year-old pinpoints a late-1990s government policy to put a computer in every home.

“Computers were inaccessible for low-income families such as mine but when the reform came into play my mother bought us a computer the very next day” he said.

Klarna Bank AB chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski poses in the company’s office in Stockholm on Aug. 25 last year. Photo: Reuters

Siemiatkowski began coding on that computer when he was 16. Fast-forward more than two decades and his payments firm Klarna is valued at US$46 billion and plans to go public. It has not given details although many bankers expect it to list in New York early next year.

Sweden’s home computer drive and concurrent early investment in Internet connectivity help explain why its capital Stockholm has become such rich soil for start-ups birthing and incubating the likes of Spotify Skype and Klarna even though it has some of the highest tax rates in the world.

That is the view of Siemiatkowski and several tech chief executives and venture capitalists interviewed by Reuters.

In the three years the scheme ran 1998 to 2001 850000 home computers were purchased through it reaching almost one-quarter of the country’s then-4 million households who did not have to pay for the machines and thus included many people who were otherwise unable to afford them.

In 2005 when Klarna was founded there were 28 broadband subscriptions per 100 people in Sweden compared with 17 in the US — where dial-up was still far more common — and a global average of 3.7 World Bank data showed.

Spotify enabled users to stream music when Apple’s iTunes was still download-based which gave the Swedish company the upper hand when streaming became the norm around the world.

“That could only happen in a country where broadband was the standard much earlier while in other markets the connection was too slow” Siemiatkowski said. “That allowed our society to be a couple of years ahead.”

Some executives and campaigners say the Scandinavian nation demonstrates that a deep social safety net often viewed as counter to entrepreneurial spirit can foster innovation. It is an outcome that might not have been envisaged by the architects of Sweden’s welfare state in the 1950s.

Childcare is for the most part free. A range of income insurance funds can protect you if your business fails or you lose your job guaranteeing up to 80 percent of your previous salary for the first 300 days of unemployment.

“The social safety net we have in Sweden allows us to be less vulnerable to taking risks” said Gohar Avagyan the 31-year-old cofounder of Vaam a video messaging service used for sales pitches and customer communication.

Although overall investments are larger in the bigger European economies of the UK and France and their longstanding finance hubs Sweden punches above its weight in some regards.

It has the third highest start-up rate in the world behind Turkey and Spain with 20 start-ups per 1000 employees and the highest three-year survival rate for start-ups anywhere at 74 percent a 2018 study by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economists found.

Stockholm is second only to Silicon Valley in terms of unicorns — start-ups valued at above US$1 billion — per capita at about 0.8 per 100000 inhabitants said Sarah Guemouri a senior associate at venture capital firm Atomico.

Silicon Valley — San Francisco and the Bay Area — boasts 1.4 unicorns per 100000 said Guemouri coauthor of a report released last year on European tech companies.

However no one can say for sure if the boom will last in a country where capital gains are taxed at 30 percent and income tax can be as high as 60 percent.

In 2016 Spotify said that it was considering moving its headquarters out of the country as high taxes made it difficult to attract overseas talent although it has not yet done so.

Yusuf Ozdalga partner at venture capital firm QED Investors said access to funding and administrative or legal tasks connected with founding a company could also prove tough to navigate for non-Swedish speakers.

He contrasted that to Amsterdam capital of the Netherlands where the government adopted English as an official language in April to make life easier for international companies.

Jeppe Zink a partner at London-based venture capital firm Northzone said a third of all the exit value from fintech companies in Europe — the amount received by investors when they cash out — came from Sweden alone.

Government policy had contributed to this trend he added.

“Its an interesting dilemma for us venture capitalists as we’re not used to regulation creating markets in fact we are inherently nervous about regulation” Zink said.

Swedish Minister for Digital Development Anders Ygeman said that social regulation could make it “possible to fail” and then “be up and running again” for innovators.

Peter Carlsson chief executive of start-up Northvolt AB which makes lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and is valued at US$11.75 billion said that ultimately success bred success.

“You’re really creating ripple effects when you’re seeing the success of somebody else and I think that’s perhaps the most important thing in order to create local ecosystems” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier this year for example Google announced that Google Maps would support pickup service functionality across the United States and now the company has joined forces with Kroger for such features in a total of 225 stores in the country.Customers in Ohio Kentucky and Indiana will benefit from the integration with Google Maps letting them add order information and then get a reminder when it’s time to leave to the store for grocery pickup.The integration goes even further by providing information to the store directly so by adding the order to Google Maps the staff can know exactly when customers are supposed to arrive. The ETA is shared with the store directly from Google Maps so overall the pickup is much more seamless.Needless to say the whole navigation to the store is powered by Google Maps as well so at the end of the day the new integration is supposed to provide customers with a more straightforward way to pick up their groceries from one end to the other.Google and Kroger are already planning to expand their collaboration to more stores across the United States but additional information in this regard would be shared at a later time.In the meantime Google is also improving Google Maps on multiple fronts. As far as the navigation is concerned Google wants Google Maps to become an eco-friendly driving companion  so in addition to the fastest route the app would also show the most fuel-efficient alternative.To do this Google Maps will analyze data like road incline and traffic to determine the carbon footprint of your car until you reach the destination therefore being able to provide a more eco-friendly route as an alternative to the fastest one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvc2hvcHBpbmcvMjAyMS8wOC8xNC93YWxtYXJ0LWN1cmJzaWRlLXBpY2t1cC10YXJnZXQtZGVsdGEtdmFyaWFudC1ncm9jZXJ5LXNob3BwaW5nLXNhdmluZ3MvNTU0MTQ3MDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Curbside pickup: How to save on Walmart Target online grocery orders,"Mere months after my family started making more in-person trips to the grocery store we're returning to curbside pickup as COVID-19 cases surge in our state Florida and across the country.

The Boeing 787 FFS and FTD will be delivered to LAT’s Training Centre in Frankfurt by the second half of 2022. The two new L3Harris devices will support their pilot and cadet training on this new model. L3Harris has also developed and delivered two advanced A320 FTDs and an A350 FFS to LAT.

FTDs enable airlines and training operators to reduce their training costs while maintaining pilot training effectiveness while addressing the changing European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. Recent amendments to both EASA and FAA regulations provide the flexibility and clarity for an increased proportion of simulator training hours to be flown on FTDs. This mixed training device approach reduces reliance on higher-cost full flight simulators for type rating and some elements of recurrent training. It also addresses the importance of providing improved flexibility and cost-effectiveness in the wake of the pandemic whilst maintaining world class pilot training standards.

“We are investing in and leveraging our expertise of manufacturing flight training devices to develop fixed base devices. This is offering trainers a wider variety of high-fidelity devices giving them more versatility to tailor their programs to specific aircraft and airline requirements” said Alan Crawford President Commercial Aviation L3Harris. “We are excited to launch this new device for our customer.”

“We already have a good working relationship with L3Harris as a manufacturer. Two of our FTD training devices which we operate in Vienna and Zurich as well as our A350 full flight simulator in Munich were purchased from L3Harris said Matthias Spohr Managing Director of Lufthansa Aviation Training GmbH. “All training devices are convincing in daily training operations – not only for us but also for our customers. The newly ordered FFS and FTD of the Boeing 787 type therefore not only complement the existing L3Harris family at LAT but also significantly expand our training portfolio for the needs of Lufthansa Airlines in the course of the introduction of the new aircraft type as well as for external market customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVzcGVjL25hbWUvZWlsZWVuLXBhbG1lci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD00MDA4MzYwMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eileen Palmer Obituary (1954 - 2021) - Hamilton ON - The Hamilton Spectator,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/ca/obituaries/thespec/name/eileen-palmer-obituary?id=40083600 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVzcGVjL25hbWUvZWlsZWVuLXBhbG1lci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD00MDA4MzYwMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

I'm thinking along the lines of severance pay health benefits guarantee of jobs etc. I will most likely use this kind of info to decide where I spend my money when I get back to Vegas. From what I heard about TI early on I will not be spending any time or money there. Now that we're near the end I'm sure there's a better overall picture of how employees were treated.

A:

We got ""no comment"" responses from Wynn Resorts and Boyd Gaming. At least Boyd was polite about it and we expected more from the Wynn since they were very good to their employees.

The Culinary Union sent back four paragraphs of self-congratulations for the passage of the “right to return” law that gives displaced casino workers first dibs on their old jobs.

Las Vegas Sands was altogether more helpful. “At the insistence of [Sheldon] Adelson the company conducted no furloughs or layoffs” wrote spokesman Ron Reese. “We continued paying and providing benefits for team members throughout shutdowns and slowdowns.” Reese was being too modest. Las Vegas Sands also paid the wages including averaged tips to workers at its restaurants that weren't actual employees of the company. We'd say that per your criteria Venetian/Palazzo should be at or at least near the top of your list.

Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli recently tracked workforce changes at MGM Resorts International and found that 40 percent of its nationwide employee base had been pink-slipped of whom only a fourth or a fifth would be returning to their jobs. At present the company has gone from 70000 to 42000 employees. Speaking generically he wrote “We would note that at present we think Strip labor costs are down 40%-50% versus 2019 levels.” Part of the reason for that is a scenario at Caesars Entertainment that's similar to MGM Resorts'.)

Still to give you an idea of what happened in Las Vegas we’ve constructed the following timeline of employee relations during the Great Shutdown (culled mostly from our own coverage of the issue in Vegas News):

March 17: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas closes but keeps all of its employees on payroll.

April 2: Wynn Resorts discloses that it is cutting executive pay from 30% to 100% to help underwrite 30 days of pay and benefits for its employees later extended to 60 days.

Ribbon-cutting ceremony officially opens Allegiant Stadium

After sitting complete for 379 days Raiders owner Mark Davis carried out the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Allegiant Stadium on Saturday officially opening the $2 billion facility to Raider Nation.

ribbon cutting

With the Raiders playing their inaugural season last year without fans the team’s first preseason game of the year has as much hype as any game not in the regular season.

Davis himself hasn’t been to an event at the stadium after vowing to fans that if they couldn’t attend he wouldn’t either.

“It feels like it’s been 60 years” Davis said of the year-long wait. “Finally we get to go home.”

Among the invited guests who took part in the ribbon cutting were Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and former Mayor Oscar Goodman U.S. Rep. Dina Titus D-Nev. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo and entertainer Carlos Santana.

Fans already began congregating around the stadium as the Raider faithful began carrying out the first official tailgate parties in the organization’s history here. Tailgating was a staple when the team was in Oakland and early on it is evident that tradition translated over to Southern Nevada.

Two of the most prominent live music venues on the Las Vegas Strip the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay and Brooklyn Bowl at the Linq Promenade are expected to require ticket-holders to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test beginning October 4. Concert giant Live Nation adjusted its policy on Friday and will require the same of all artists crew and attendees at its festivals and venues across the country.

In Las Vegas Live Nation is one of the largest concert and live entertainment event promoters operating those two popular theaters and partnering with Caesars Entertainment to run residency shows at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood as well as with MGM Resorts for events at Park Theater among other shows on and off the Strip. Casino-owned and operated venues like those big residency rooms fall outside of Live Nation’s policies but the company said it has developed best practices for artists to request the policies at third party venues.

Live Nation previously announced it would be up to its artists to enforce the mandates but instituted the stricter guidelines for shows this fall where permitted by law due to the continued spread of the Delta variant. Its recent Lollapalooza festival in Chicago where attendees were required to show proof of vaccination or negative test was considered successful in avoiding superspreader status and a Live Nation spokesperson told Rolling Stone 12% of fans said the festival was the reason they were vaccinated.

Other entertainment companies and Las Vegas events and venues recently announced similar policies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy9nZXQtdmF4ZWQtb3ItZ2V0LXRlc3RlZC1zZWF0dGxlLW11c2ljLWFuZC1uaWdodGxpZmVzLW5ldy1zdGFuZGFyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seattle music venues' new standard: Get vaxxed (or tested) if you want to get in,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Offensive missile systems with maturing sophistication from rogue states pose a growing threat to the U.S. Helping the U.S. counter these threats is the Command Control Battle Management & Communications system the integrating element of the U.S. Missile Defense System.

To strengthen C2BMC’s capability the Missile Defense Agency awarded Lockheed Martin a $157 million contract to augment C2BMC’S engagement support capability for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system that protects the U.S. from long-range ballistic missile attacks. The GMD system includes silo-based interceptors connections to sensors on land and sea distributed fire control and launch support systems.

Currently the GMD system engages a threat using the best single source data from multiple radars. The next upgrade to C2BMC called Spiral 8.2-7 will provide GMD with a single real-time composite picture of threat system tracks by correlating and fusing data from a broader set of sensors including satellites ground- and ship-based radars. Once the spiral upgrade is complete the GMD system will see the same battlespace picture currently seen by combatant commanders. Additionally Spiral 8.2-7 will also enable C2BMC to report hypersonic threat activity onto the Link 16 military tactical data link network and display to the operators.

“C2BMC is a 21st century battle management system with a global infrastructure capable of supporting many different types of missions” said Mark Johnson director of Missile Defense Solutions for Lockheed Martin. “As customers look for innovations to advance joint all-domain operations they can look to C2BMC.”

Fielded in 2004 C2BMC is one of the first operationally deployed Multi-Domain Systems integrating systems and sensors operating in space on land and at sea. This network operates 24/7 to support real-world operations at more than 30 locations around the world including U.S. Strategic Northern European Indo-Pacific Space and Central Commands.

The July 2 demonstration in southern California was described as a step closer to autonomous systems that can ""support Manned-UnManned Teaming (MUM-T) in joint all-domain operations.""

Air-to-air tracking and following targets by an aircraft – even a drone – is a pretty standard procedure but usually relies on radar to locate and lock onto the quarry. This is extremely effective but radar isn't always available. It may be necessary to fly without radar for stealth purposes hostile forces might be using radar jamming systems or there may be too much radio interference or background clutter for radar to operate properly.

To overcome this Lockheed Martin developed its Legion Pod which has already flown with the F-16 and F-15C fighter aircraft. The 98.5-inch-long (2.5-m) and 16-in-wide (41-cm) pod replaces active radar with a passive IRST21 sensor that features advanced onboard data processing to track and follow targets by detecting infrared radiation.

Legion Pod infographic Lockheed Martin

Because the Legion Pod is designed to use common interfaces and doesn't require extensive modification of the aircraft it was possible to install the pod and its software into the Avenger Mission Management System (MMS) in less than three months. It was able to communicate with the Avenger’s autonomy engine using the Open Mission Systems (OMS) message standards which made installation faster and less expensive.

During the recent tests the Avenger used the pod to detect several fast-moving aircraft in the area and sent tracking data to the drone's avionics system so it could carry out the necessary maneuvers in order to engage the targets.

“This flight demonstrates a critical sensor capability that enables unmanned combat air vehicles like the Avenger to operate autonomously in Joint All-Domain Operations” says Dave Belvin vice president of Sensors and Global Sustainment at Lockheed Martin. “We designed Legion Pod to passively detect and track targets for tactical fighter pilots in radar-denied environments. This capability provides the data necessary to enable unmanned vehicles to track and engage hostile airborne targets without human intervention.”

The Japanese Air Defence Force’s (JADF) F-15J upgrade program was first included in the fiscal year 2019 as a strategic deterrent against military assertiveness by China in the region.

AGM-158C missile is a long-range precision-guided anti-ship missile designed to meet the needs of the US Navy and Air Force.

The Lockheed Martin LRASM has a 1000-pound penetrator and blast-fragmentation warhead multi-mode sensor weapon data link and enhanced digital anti-jam global positioning system to detect and destroy selected surface targets within groups of ships.

A report by Military Aerospace and Electronics notes that Lockheed Martin has been developing LRASM for over a decade now primarily under the watchful eye of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

The missile is expected to replace the Harpoon anti-ship missile which is nearing the end of its operational utility.

Lockheed Martin is responsible for the overall development of the anti-ship missile while the BAE Systems Electronic Systems is carrying out R&D for the missiles onboard sensor systems.

The missile has the capability to be guided towards enemy ships from ranges as far as 200 nautical miles by its launch aircraft. It flies towards the target at medium altitude then drops down to lower altitudes for a sea-skimming approach to counter the target ship’s anti-missile systems.

Despite scrapping the contract the Japanese defense ministry said it would continue to work on its program for the 70 F-15s. Open-source information also indicates that Japan is considering the installation of indigenous standoff missiles on its F-2 fighter jets.

Why Was Lockheed Martin Dropped?

The decision to drop Lockheed Martin has been the result of a surge in overall expenditure since the inception of the contract. The LRASM upgrade exceeded the initial cost presented by the American defense and aerospace giant from its initial proposal of about $7.2 billion to around $2.2 billion.

One of the compounding factors which resulted in the ballooning of costs has been the supply shortage of essential electrical components.

This move has been perceived to be a major setback for the American firm which stands to lose out on a hefty defense deal.

The Japanese Defense Ministry had aimed to arm 68 F-15s of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force LRASM as a defense against ships and landing forces. The LRASM was chosen for being a stealthy air-launched anti-ship cruise missile. Officials from Japan’s Defense Ministry organized a press briefing where they formally highlighted their reasons for not going ahead with the missile contract.

The costs following the initial appraisal after parts of the project were revised led to this reconsideration.

The plan to replace and integrate the missile systems to meet Japan’s technical specifications was a key factor in the price surge. It is pertinent to note that an equivalent of $354.9 million which was earmarked for the project in 2020 had not been spent.

The ministry decided not to allocate further $193.8 million for the project in this year’s budget and instead opted to continue price negotiations with the United States.

Ministry officials told the media that upon reviewing the program and further negotiations with the United States Air Force (USAF) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries it deemed it fit to scrap the plans for the anti-ship missiles. According to Japanese Defense Ministry officials the approximate cost of the F-15J upgrades would be around $3.6 million.

The F-15J Upgrade Plan

JADF’s F-15s will instead be armed with joint air-to-surface standoff missiles (JASSMs). Additional areas which are being looked into are methods to enhance the jet’s payload capacity from four missiles to eight. Efforts to improve the F-15’s electronic warfare capabilities are also being explored.

As compared to the LRSAM the JASSM’s operational capabilities are lower in terms of its effective range and stealth factor. “Although the cost has increased since the Medium-Term Defense Program was established the role of F-15s as a missile carrier by utilizing high missile-loading capability is important” read a written brief provided to journalists at the press conference.

A new budget request for the project is also being chalked up by the ministry for the next fiscal year. Furthermore the ministry expects that the upgrade of 20 jets to be completed by March 2028.

The Japanese government reportedly stands to save tens of billions of yen by letting go of the Lockheed missile. “It is still a potent upgrade. The only missing element is long-range munitions at standoff ranges. Japanese F-15s will continue to be air defense fighters” said a military aviation analyst.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvYy0xMzBqLXN1cGVyLWhlcmN1bGVzLWxvb2tzLWxpa2UtYS1jYW1vdWZsYWdlZC1tZXRhbC1iaXJkLW92ZXItYWxhc2thLTE2NzAwNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,C-130J Super Hercules Looks Like a Camouflaged Metal Bird Over Alaska,"Last week an incredible image of a C-130J Super Hercules flying in the skies over Alaska hit our screens with amazing shades of blue and white. For all intents and purposes it was one of the coolest pics we’ve hosted in our Photo of the Day section in a long time. But now here’s an even cooler one.

You’re looking at (presumably) the same C-130J Super Hercules  only captured from another angle as it dragged its massive body over the water near the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska in mid-July.Like most other photos of military aircraft coming our way courtesy of the men and women of the U.S. Air Force this one too shows the plane deployed with the 815th Airlift Squadron as it conducts a training exercise. One meant according to the military branch to test “the aircraft and pilot capabilities in a new environment” completely different from the one the plane is used to from its home Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi.The Super Hercules is one of those many massive transport planes we’re used to seeing in our skies for some time now. It entered service about a quarter of a century ago being made by Lockheed Martin as one of the many variants (about 11) of the C-130.This particular family of planes of which over 400 are in service around the world has roughly 1.7 million flight hours to its name since coming into being. The thing is flown so extensively because it not only acts as a military transport aircraft but can fulfill a variety of other roles from humanitarian assistance to firefighting.Four Rolls-Royce engines two on each wing power it along providing it with a cruising speed of 400 mph (644 kph) and a service ceiling of 28000 ft (8500 m) when carrying a 42000 lb (19051 kg) payload.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvaWYtZi0yMi1yYXB0b3Itc28tZ29vZC13aHktZGlkLWFtZXJpY2EtYnVpbGQtc28tZmV3LTE5MTgyN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If the F-22 Raptor Is So Good Why Did America Build So Few?,"Here's What You Need to Remember: In a sense the Air Force now has the worst of both worlds. The F-22 wasn’t completely stricken off the roster but the procurement program was gutted to such a degree that the Air Force’s remaining F-22s are simply incapable of fully addressing America’s high-end airpower needs. At a time of growing great-power competition and intensifying regional threats that may prove to be a costly mistake.

The F-22 stealth fighter program is long dead but the debate over its legacy rages on.

Introduced in 2005 Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor was—and remains—one of the world’s best air superiority fighters. But despite the Raptor’s inarguably impressive performance the F-22 program encountered no shortage of controversy during its lifespan.

In its earliest days the program was met with consistent political resistance. The complaints ran along two interrelated fronts: onerous costs and limited usability concerns. Part of the problem is that there is no universally agreed-upon way to calculate the F-22’s price. The most popular metric is the fighter’s “flyaway cost”—namely the production cost of a single additional model. Those estimates have ranged anywhere from $110 to $180 million during the 2000s. For a sense of scale the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin have recently negotiated a flyaway cost of $80 million per unit for the F-35 fifth generation fighter. The F-22’s critics prefer to cite the total per-aircraft cost which encompasses both research and development (R&D) as well as production outlays; that tally comes out to a less flattering $350-380 million.

Then there is the use-case problem: with the end of the Cold War skeptics argued that the F-22’s air superiority role is seemingly wasted on asymmetrical adversaries who lack sophisticated airpower capabilities. As previously covered by The National Interest these simmering concerns erupted in the late 2000’s with a public spat between the Air Force and the Pentagon. Then- Defense Secretary Robert Gates argued that the F-22 had no meaningful role to play in the ongoing Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts—in a blow to the F-22 program Gates fired senior Air Force officials who continued to insist on additional F-22 procurements. The Raptor’s fate was sealed when with President Obama’s support the Senate voted in 2009 to stop further F-22 production.

The Raptor likely isn’t coming back but the government’s decision to axe the program has had its fair share of detractors. A sizable subset of defense commentators and some government officials have argued that the procurement cancellation was shortsighted. “We don’t have enough F-22s” said Gen. Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle. “That’s a fact of life. We didn’t buy enough.” “You’re going to need the Raptors” for a high-end fight he added. “So you’re still going to have to do that and we’re going to do it with the 180 or so F-22s we have.”

As noted by Defense Writer Tyler Rogoway the final tally of 187 F-22’s—of which only about 125 units sit in a deployment-ready state—makes it difficult to fulfill robust rotation commitments across Pacific European and Middle-Eastern theaters. Further still the F-22’s defenders argue that Gates and his allies killed the Raptor program based on a wrongheaded threat assessment. China rolled out its J-20 stealth air superiority fighter markedly sooner than Gates’ mid-late 2020’s estimate and Russia’s Su-57 air superiority fighter is already entering service. The Raptor’s adherents have likewise raised the possibility that F-22 costs would have dropped if the procurement program was allowed to grow and mature.

In a sense the Air Force now has the worst of both worlds. The F-22 wasn’t completely stricken off the roster but the procurement program was gutted to such a degree that the Air Force’s remaining F-22s are simply incapable of fully addressing America’s high-end airpower needs. At a time of growing great-power competition and intensifying regional threats that may prove to be a costly mistake.

Natalie Kostelni wrote about the debut for the Philadelphia Business Journal.

The new 35000-foot Amazon Fresh market replaced a vacated Giant store in the Creekview Center at 389 Easton Road trimming the former footprint by nearly 15000 square feet.

The company did not cite its precise economic impact in terms of new full- and part-time positions. But it did assert its role in creating “hundreds” of local jobs.

Amazon Fresh is positioned in the market as a lower-cost alternative to the company’s Whole Foods brand. Whole Foods does not currently have a Bucks County presence; however nearby locations are in Allentown North Wales and Spring House.

Amazon Fresh Warrington is the chain’s 16th store in the country and the first in Pennsylvania. Its shelves do sell beer and wine although not all locations will carry those items.

An additional site is in the works elsewhere in Bucks County. It will replace a former Kmart in the Brookwood Shopping Center Street Road Bensalem.

More Amazon Fresh stores are planned for:

5th & Spring Garden Streets Philadelphia

2940 Springfield Road Broomall

403 West Chester Pike Havertown

ShopCore Properties owns Creekview Shopping Center which totals 136248 square feet. Other anchor tenants include Target JoAnn Fabrics and Lowes.

Sam Lowes remembered everyone fondly by taking pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix (Bitci Motorrad Grand Prix von Österreich) at the Red Bull Ring on Saturday the 15th of his Moto2 career. In this area he is now on par with Johann zarco on the list of riders with the most poles in Moto2™ behind Tito Rabat (16 pole). On his last five poles Sam Lowes went on to win the race four times: Aragón and Teruel last year and Qatar and Doha this year. Francesco Bagnaia in 2018 was the last driver to win at the Red Bull Ring after qualifying on pole position. That's it for the statistics...

The Elf Marc VDS Racing Team driver is 68 thousandths of a second ahead of the rookie Raul Fernandez (Kalex Red Bull KTM Ajo) who obtains his seventh front row in his first Moto2™ season. Another rookie Ai Ogura (Kalex IDEMITSU Honda Team Asia) author of a convincing start to the weekend will also start from the front row in third position for the second time this season.

Just behind we will find the Spanish driver in fourth place on the grid. Augusto Fernandez (Kalex Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) who thus equals his best qualifying result since the start of the year in Catalonia and will be alongside Remy gardner (Kalex Red Bull KTM Ajo) fifth on the grid his worst qualifying result since seventh in France earlier this year but leader of the world championship. The Australian fell at the end of the session ruining all his chances of improving his time. Second in the Styrian Grand Prix last week Aron Canet (Aspar Team Moto2) the best placed non-Kalex rider set the sixth time in these qualifications ahead of the Thai Somkiat Chantra (Kalex IDEMITSU Honda Team Asia).

The top 10 is completed by Celestine Vietti (Kalex SKY Racing Team VR46) Lorenzo Dalla Porta (Kalex Italtrans Racing Team) and Thomas Lüthi (Kalex Pertamina Mandalika SAG Team). Victim of a fall in the first minutes of qualifying Marco Bezzecchi (Kalex SKY Racing Team VR46) winner of the last two Moto2™ races held at the Red Bull Ring was unable to defend his chances and will start from 16th position to defend his 3rd place in the championship.

Remy gardner missed his start and appeared in 10th position just ahead Marco Bezzecchi who conversely got off to a good start.

At the end of the first round the ranking is the same as in qualifying with Sam Lowes Raul Fernandez Ai Ogura and Augusto Fernández slightly detached in front of the peloton led by Marcel Schrötter.

Raul Fernandez which unlike Sam Lowes has a new softer rear tire takes command the next time you brake.

Ai Ogurconfirmed his good form when seizing second position on the fourth lap.

In the peloton Marco Bezzecchi temporarily takes advantage of Remy gardner and now occupies ninth position while Lorenzo Dalla Porta must give up. Gardner recovers his property following an error by the Italian.

Marcel Schrötter fell on the eighth lap while in fifth position.

On your mind Raúl Fernández is only 3/10 ahead of Ai Ogura and a second on the team duo Marc VDS.

The peloton is now led by Celestino Vietti.

Gradually Sam Lowes lets himself be taken down by his teammate for 3rd place just like Marco Bezzecchi can't keep up with the pace of Remy Gardner in 8th position which gets confused with Aron Canet.

Somkiat Chantra temporarily takes command of the peloton eight laps from the finish to the detriment of Celestino Vietti while the positions seem stabilized for the first four places.

Six laps from the checkered flag Sam Lowes seems to be reaping the benefits of his harder rear tire and is gradually getting closer to his teammate...

In front the rookie Ai Ogura continues to put pressure on the rookie Raul Fernandez but remains 2/10 behind the Red Bull KTM Ajo rider…

But the one who will ride in MotoGP next year in the Tech3 KTM Factory Racing team doesn't give in and even accelerates on the penultimate lap to cross the finish line as the winner for the fourth time this year!

Hats off anyway to Ai Ogura who made no mistakes despite the frenzied pace imposed by Raul Fernandez and thus obtained his first podium in Moto2.

In the championship Remy Gardner now has 206 points 19 points ahead of Raul Fernandez 47 on Marco Bezzecchi and 92 on Sam Lowes.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and recieved the fine.

5 The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgement in history. MBR

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment. The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgement in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

5 The two Katherines went back and forth on Instagram. Instagram

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote. “I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife. “Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

5 Katherine deleted her Instagram account after the woman posted screenshots of their conversation. StringSilly2839/Reddit

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

After the other woman posted the screenshots the newlywed deleted her Instagram account.

The new bride’s in-laws own the Asplundh Tree Expert Co. in Pennsylvania which is the 109th largest private company in America with a revenue of $5.42 billion in 2023 according to Forbes.

Katherine’s new father-in-law Matt Asplundh has been the CEO of the family business since 2021.

It’s unclear when or if Driscoll-Asplundh will return to Instagram.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9haS1jaGlwLXN0YXJ0dXAtZGVlcHgtc2VjdXJlcy04MC01bS1zZXJpZXMtYy1hdC1hLTUyOW0tdmFsdWF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AI chip startup DEEPX secures $80M Series C at a $529M valuation,"DEEPX is a South Korean on-device AI chip (NPU or neural processing unit) startup that makes hardware and software for various AI applications in electronic devices. The company announced this week that it has raised $80 million (KRW 108.5 billion) in a Series C round at a valuation of $529 million (KRW 723 billion) which has surged more than eight times from its Series B funding about $15 million in 2021.

The Series C funding which brings its total raise to around $95 million will go toward mass production of the startup’s inaugural products — DX-V1 DX-V3 DX-M1 and DX-H1 — in late 2024 for global distribution. The startup will also use the new capital to expedite developing and launching its next generation of large language model (LLM) on-device solutions.

DEEPX was founded in 2018 by CEO Lokwon Kim who previously worked at Apple Cisco Systems the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center and Broadcom.

The market size of global edge AI also called on-device AI is projected to reach $107.47 billion by 2029 up from $11.98 billion in 2021 according to a recent report. “The on-device AI market excluding edge servers requires AI capabilities to be implemented bypassing servers or the cloud” Kim told TechCrunch. “The [on-device AI market] is expanding due to computer vision capabilities like facial and voice recognition smart mobility robotics the internet of things and physical security systems.”

Kim said that if its mass production begins this year potential customers such as end-product manufacturers will be able to commercialize their products with DEEPX’s AI chips in 2025.

DEEPX which has around 65 employees is not the only company that has developed AI chip solutions. The Korean outfit competes with Hailo which landed a $120 million funding round last month; SiMa.ai which closed on $70 million also in April; and Axelera a Belgium-based AI chip startup that secured $27 million in 2022.

Kim said that his company’s differentiators include cost efficiency energy consumption efficiency and All-in-4 AI Total Solution a comprehensive solution for various AI applications. Its All-in-4 AI solutions include: DX-V1 and DX-V3 designed for vision systems in home appliances surveillance camera systems robot vision and drones; as well as DX-M1 and DX-H1 which are designed for AI computing boxes AI servers smart factories and AI booster chips. DEEPX now has more than 259 patents pending in the U.S. China and South Korea Kim said.

“Nvidia’s GPGPU-based solutions are the most cost-effective for large language model services like ChatGPT; the total power consumed by GPUs operating has reached levels exceed the electrical energy of an entire country” Kim said. “This collaborative operation technology between server-scale AI and on-device large AI models are expected to reduce energy consumption and costs a lot compared to relying solely on data centers.”

The startup does not have customers yet but is collaborating with more than 100 potential clients and strategic partners such as Hyundai Kia Motors Robotics Lab and Korean IT company POSCO DX to test DEEPX’s AI chip capabilities.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9lc3BuL2JldHRpbmcvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC80MDEwMjE2Ni9taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1wYXJsYXktdGlja2V0LWJldHRvci1va2xhaG9tYS1jaXR5LXRodW5kZXItdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticket of dreams? One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The 33-year-old who just released her first single in two years with none other than Cardi B  said she never had ""the luxury of hiding behind anything"" as a plus-size woman.

""I feel like fat is the worst thing people can say about me at this point"" the ""Rumors"" singer shared. ""This is the biggest insecurity. It's like 'How dare a pop star be fat?' I had to own that.""

She also stated that mainstream culture prizes thin bodies and explained what constitutes a socially acceptable pop star: ""I feel like other people who were put on that pedestal or who become pop stars probably have other insecurities or have other flaws but they can hide it behind a veneer of being sexy and being marketable.""

REVIEW:

“This is a rough area of Indianapolis for gas stations. There’s a Phillips 66 at Washington and Arlington I frequent. The clientele is often rough. The crew who works there does a good job but what can they control. Just down the road is Circle K . It’s an old facility and there’s a rental motel next door. We need them but Thornton’s is the best near 465 on Washington on the east side. Better people better experience. Skip issues and stop here. I’d love to lie and paint the area better. Bad side of Irvington. But I’ve had no ill experience at Thornton’s. I’ve got a ton to say on that but it’s on a soap box.” – Nathan G.

""I feel like fat is the worst thing people can say about me at this point"" the ""Rumors"" singer shared. ""This is the biggest insecurity. It's like 'How dare a pop star be fat?' I had to own that.""

She also stated that mainstream culture prizes thin bodies and explained what constitutes a socially acceptable pop star: ""I feel like other people who were put on that pedestal or who become pop stars probably have other insecurities or have other flaws but they can hide it behind a veneer of being sexy and being marketable.""

And when it comes to the influence of her lyricism she didn't expect it to bolster a body-positive movement. ""I was watching a commercial and it was these big girls in it and it had nothing to do with being big. And I was like 'Did I do that?'""

But Lizzo explained that there's still a divide between mainstream culture and the societal structures that uphold narrow beauty standards that prioritize thinness and whiteness: ""The infrastructure has not changed as much.""

""There's still so many people who suffer from being marginalized systemically"" she said. ""Meanwhile there's a plus-size Black girl at the Grammys. But plus-size Black women are still not getting the treatment they deserve in hospitals and from doctors and at work.""

Racism in the healthcare industry particularly against Black women runs rampant. From false narratives to neglectful care Black women are statistically less likely to be taken seriously and given adequate attention. As a result — among other disparities — Black women are three times more likely to die after childbirth than white women. Cbs Photo Archive / CBS via Getty Images

Simply put Lizzo added ""We got a long way to go.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8va2V2c2Jlc3QuY29tL3BldHJvbC1zdGF0aW9ucy1pbi1pbmRpYW5hcG9saXMtaW5kaWFuYS_SAT1odHRwczovL2tldnNiZXN0LmNvbS9wZXRyb2wtc3RhdGlvbnMtaW4taW5kaWFuYXBvbGlzLWluZGlhbmEv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Best Petrol Stations in Indianapolis Indiana,"Below is a list of the top and leading Petrol Stations in Indianapolis.

REVIEW:

“This is a rough area of Indianapolis for gas stations. There’s a Phillips 66 at Washington and Arlington I frequent. The clientele is often rough. The crew who works there does a good job but what can they control. Just down the road is Circle K . It’s an old facility and there’s a rental motel next door. We need them but Thornton’s is the best near 465 on Washington on the east side. Better people better experience. Skip issues and stop here. I’d love to lie and paint the area better. Bad side of Irvington. But I’ve had no ill experience at Thornton’s. I’ve got a ton to say on that but it’s on a soap box.” – Nathan G.

“Outside of being in a super busy spot on Keystone GetGo is a huge upgrade for this BP/Rickers gas station. You can order food online for pickup or use their kiosk to order from their kitchen. They’re currently running a $4.99 7″ sub deal which was perfect for the Contractors at my house! If you enroll in their rewards program you can save .10c / gal for a limited time.

REVIEW:

“There’s not a whole lot to say about a Speedway Gas Station. This is a typical one. Not a fancy schmancy one with a Cafe in it. Those are my favorites but this one is in Beech Grove and is usually cheaper than the ones in Indy. We filled up due to the crazy frozen tundra expected on Monday.” – Karen P.",,,,,,,,,

This information comes courtesy of Yelp the crowd-sourced review website we’ve all turned to for recommendations at one point or another.

Yelp mined its data to determine which Lone Star State hotels were most associated with vacations and getaways then ranked the accommodations based on the total volume and ratings of reviews among other factors. The final product -- a handy list of the 100 top Texas hotels perfect for a staycation weekend getaway or summer sojourn.

At No. 5 on the list downtown Houston’s Marriott Marquis Houston is the area’s highest ranked hotel. Close behind at No. 6 Hotel ZaZa Memorial City is the second-highest ranked hotel on the list.

Other Houston-area businesses that appear among the top 25 include The Post Oak Hotel at Uptown Houston (No.17) Hilton Americas-Houston (No.19) and Hotel ZaZa Museum District (No.22).

“Whether you’re looking for your next great beach vacation a weekend staycation in your city or an off-the-grid campout under the stars there’s something for everyone on this year’s list” Brenae Leary Yelp’s Senior Communications Manager said in a statement.

His St. Regis Residences project at 120 Old Post Road in Rye has been welcoming its first residents with Marriott International Inc. owner of the St Regis brand starting to manage the luxury property.

Buyers had moved into the first dozen units as of the beginning of August.

“We”™ve completed the first two parts of the five-part project” Weissman told the Business Journal. “The amenity space is now 100% complete and one of our residential buildings is also completely finished at this point and the next three buildings will be finished over the next couple of months so we”™re really at the end of the project.”

The St. Regis Residences complex will have 92 condominium units ranging from one- to four-bedrooms. It is designed to fill a need for all of the comforts conveniences and luxuries a resident could wish for as reflected in the St. Regis brand that has been nurtured since John Jacob Astor IV opened The St. Regis hotel in New York in 1903 which he had built while being a part owner of the Waldorf-Astoria.

The St. Regis brand is owned by Marriott International Inc. which has 30 brands including Ritz-Carlton Le MÃ©ridien and Sheraton. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of 2020 it had 2149 company-owned properties and 5493 franchised and licensed properties worldwide.

The company”™s operations were affected by Covid and for 2020 its revenues were $10.57 billion compared with $20.97 billion the year before.

The Bethesda Maryland-based company has been active in the branded residences field working with real estate developers such as Weissman to create projects in localities reflecting the quality of its brand names and then managing those properties. St. Regis Residences Rye will have a project cost of more than $100 million according to Weissman.

“When the pandemic first hit we were very concerned but to our great surprise the sales…have been amazing. We”™ve achieved some of the highest sales per square foot prices in the market and we”™re currently at 80% sold and we haven”™t even finished the construction so these are all pre-sales and it”™s absolutely spectacular in terms of our sales on the project” Weissman said.

Weissman said that just as Covid-19 affected virtually all businesses so too did it affect the St. Regis project.

“Timing is always an issue in construction but with material shortages labor shortages and other things and of course the pandemic itself there have been some delays in the project but we”™ve pushed through and we”™re managing” Weissman said.

“In the next couple of months we”™ll be 100% complete. Most of that 80% that have purchased here bought off the plans. They bought in a sales center first a sales center on-site and then a sales center in the city of Rye downtown Rye.”

Weissman expressed special pride in the St. Regis project noting that the Harrison-based company Alfred Weissman Real Estate LLC founded by his father some 50 years ago has been involved in a variety of projects in what he termed “different food groups of real estate” including hotels office buildings retail space and residences.

“It is the first standalone St. Regis in the world that is not connected to a hotel. All the others before this going back to John Jacob Astor in New York City with the St. Regis have always been connected to a hotel” Weissman said. “So this is really unusual and we really kind of invented the whole concept here in Rye for the St. Regis brand and I know the upper levels of Marriott are very excited about what we”™re doing here.”

Weissman observed that there”™s a market for a wide variety of housing types in Westchester whether it”™s affordable housing middle-income or luxury projects.

“This is a luxury project. It is not affordable to most people. It”™s a very very high-end project” Weissman said. “What makes it kind of important for the community is that a lot of the people who are living here are business leaders community leaders who otherwise would leave the area and go other places.

“Now they have time to give back to the community. They”™re involved in their local charities in their religious institutions and things like that. They”™re downsizing from their homes beautiful homes in the immediate area in Westchester Fairfield County but usually they”™d move to New York City move to Florida and really aren”™t basing themselves here anymore and what the project kind of lets them do…is stay here and age in place which really hasn”™t been that much of an option prior to this project.”

Weissman forecast a continuation in Westchester of the trend to convert office buildings for other uses noting that the St. Regis site had been the Dictaphone office building when the Weissman company bought it two decades ago.

“I do think that post-pandemic there is going to be less of a reliance on offices. I do think people are working remote going other places and I just don”™t see the need for as much office space as there was prior (to the pandemic) and even then there was a huge vacancy factor in Westchester” Weissman said.

In the future he said the company will be looking at doing projects similar to the St. Regis Residences possibly in Westchester New England and on Long Island and is considering the acquisition of a large group of hotels in the Midwest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL3JpdHotY2FybHRvbi1sYWd1bmEtbmlndWVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel: A stunning beachfront resort that falls short on luxury,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel is a five-star luxury resort in Dana Point California. Perched on a 150-foot bluff the resort boasts incredible views of the Pacific Ocean and is just steps away from Salt Creek Beach. The resort reopened in March 2021 after extensive renovations that include refreshed rooms.

Room rates regularly top $1000 per night making this a popular option for those looking to get maximum value out of their Marriott points. But is it worth it? Here's a detailed look at The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel.

Booking

The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel is a Category 7 Marriott property requiring 50000 to 70000 points per night. Room rates regularly go over $1000 making this a great use of points. If you happen to find availability at the 50000-point level it might be worthwhile to use an annual free night award from the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card at hotels participating in the Marriott Bonvoy program (certain hotels have resort fees).

When I stayed at this property in June the nightly rate was $780 per night while award rates were 70000 points. I did have to pay a daily $50 resort fee but I got well 1.1 cents in value out of each point. So I still came out ahead.

Location

The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel is in Dana Point an oceanfront community in Orange County. The resort is about a 35-minute drive from John Wayne Airport (SNA) and an hour from Los Angeles International (LAX) assuming traffic isn't worse than usual.

The resort takes up 18 acres of prime beachfront real estate and the views throughout the property are pretty stunning.

If you ever get tired of roaming through its impressive grounds you can walk off the property and head to a small shopping center across the street where you'll find a Beach Hut Deli and Moulin bakery. Moulin is a great spot for breakfast if you don't want to shell out $60+ per person at the Ritz-Carlton (where frankly the breakfast wasn't that great).

If you want to venture out further to go shopping and explore the area you may want to get a rental car. When I stayed at this resort in June getting an Uber or Lyft was impossible. In fact I never once found a ride through Uber but I did get lucky and snag a couple of Lyft rides at 3x the normal rate. The driver informed me ""I'm the only rideshare driver working around here. I don't get a break.""

He picked me up and dropped me off when I had lunch with friends at the nearby Coastal Kitchen. He also handed me his card and said to call him to prearrange a ride. He would make sure to make himself available so I could get to where I needed to go (which would have been near-impossible otherwise). Long story short: Get a rental car.

Check-in

We arrived at the hotel around 11:15 a.m. -- 15 minutes past check-out -- it was packed! This resort is a popular wedding venue and there were several wedding parties checking out. I've never seen so many people in a hotel lobby.

Check-in wasn't until 4 p.m. but we landed that morning and had nothing else to do so we figured we'd drop our luggage off have lunch at the hotel and I'd get a head start photographing the grounds.

The front desk agent was very apologetic about not having a room ready explaining that a large number of guests had checked out late that morning and housekeeping was short-staffed. Still he was happy to store our bags and put us in the queue for a room once it became ready.

My room was booked under an Ambassador member's account and while that status was acknowledged the benefits were not explained to me. It's worth pointing out that Marriott Platinum and Titanium elite members do not get free breakfast at Ritz-Carlton hotels. Instead they receive 1000 points per stay.

The agent informed me that I'd been upgraded to ""a lovely ocean-view room"" and that he would try to get me a key in the next two hours. Since check-in wasn't until 4 p.m. I was perfectly happy with anything they could do for us. He confirmed my phone number and said he would call me when it was ready.

We had lunch at 180Blu walked around the grounds left the resort to go shopping and then returned for afternoon tea at Raya. A waiter we had chatted with at 180Blu earlier came by and asked how our room was. I told him we were still waiting and he was pretty shocked.

It was past 4 p.m. at this point so I went to the front desk to check on things. The agent apologized profusely checked with housekeeping and confirmed they were just too backed up. He asked if we'd had lunch and when I confirmed we did he offered to comp the bill to make up for the long wait.

About a half-hour later I got a text that the room was ready. I picked up the keys and was told our luggage would be on the way. When I walked down the halls there were housekeepers still cleaning rooms.

The pandemic has lead to staffing shortages in the hospitality industry but it had never really impacted one of my hotel stays beyond being told that it wouldn't be a daily service. Seeing the housekeeping staff work so hard to turn rooms around well past 5 p.m. was shocking especially at a resort like this. There's always room for grace but nowhere else had I seen the extent to which hotels were struggling with staffing.

Room

A standard award at The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel gets you into a ""Garden View"" room but I was upgraded to a ""Coastline View"" room. I loved the location on the west side of the resort because it was quiet and the view was beautiful. To get to the room we took the elevator down one floor. The elevator opened up to a window offering stunning ocean views – a preview of what was to come.

The walk to the room was pretty long but it helped me hit my step goals every day so it was fine.

View aside the room itself was pretty underwhelming resembling a Sheraton more than a Ritz-Carlton. There were two full beds facing a desk and TV. The furniture looked rather cheap and the mattress was a bit springy and uncomfortable. The pillows weren't fluffed which is a minor detail and can be probably be attributed to the housekeeping shortage.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

There were two power outlets by the beds along with a pair by the desk and a row underneath the TV.

The room also had a closet by the door which offered plenty of storage space and a bathrobe safe shoe polish and umbrella.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

There was another closet unit next to the bed on the far end of the room. Inside was a Nespresso machine with plenty of coffee pods sugar and tea provisions. Below that was an empty fridge where we kept the five water bottles that were stocked in the room and replenished upon request.

About 10 minutes after we arrived our bags were dropped off by a lovely staffer named Jeremy. He asked if we had stayed here before and whether we needed activity recommendations. It's always nice to get recommendations from staff who know the area so this was appreciated.

I began inspecting the room more closely and was disappointed at what I found. The back of the vase on the nightstand was covered in dust and so was the nightstand itself. It was clear only the front side was cleaned for appearance's sake.

The door handles leading to the balcony were also dusty and there were crumbs on the balcony floor.

(Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy)

The patio furniture wasn't clean either. After checking out of the room we realized my dad had left his AirPods on the balcony. The iCloud tracker seemed to indicate they were on the balcony. Despite several calls to the hotel they weren't able to locate them and my guess is because they didn't check (or clean) the balcony after we left.

There was no hand sanitizer in the room either which is disappointing because even at lower-end Hyatt and Hilton hotels I've stayed at there were hand-sanitizing wipes and even extra masks left out for guests.

That being said the highlight of the room was definitely the view. It was incredibly peaceful and the loud roar of the ocean at night was totally eliminated with the door closed.

The bathroom

The all-marble bathroom was clean though there was only one set of towels. Luckily the housekeeping cart was down the hall so I was able to get two extra sets pretty easily.

The bathroom was outfitted with a glass-enclosed shower and tub.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

A robe hung on the door with a pair of slippers. Upon closer inspection the slippers (despite being wrapped in plastic) had little bits of dirt on them like they'd been worn before.

The shower and sink were stocked with Asprey amenities and a small jar on the left sink contained cotton swabs alongside a tissue box.

The toilet was separated by a door past the shower. It's always nice when hotels separate spaces like this. It's a nice change from the sink-in-the-room class-door-separating-the-bathroom design you see in trendier hotels.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

My only issue with the bathroom was that only one sink had a power outlet for the hairdryer. All the women reading this will find it particularly annoying.

Despite being told that housekeeping would be limited we got a knock on the door at 3:40 p.m. asking if we needed a room refresh. It just happened this one time and we turned it down since we had assumed the room had just been cleaned before our arrival.

Food and beverage

The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel has four on-site restaurants and a bar. Additionally you can walk off-site and grab breakfast or lunch at one of the casual dining spots right outside the resort gates.

Raya

Raya is the resort's main restaurant serving breakfast lunch and dinner not to mention incredible ocean views. The menu highlights ""Latin American flavors"" but that's a bit of a stretch. The only thing vaguely resembling Latin flavors are items like ceviche ahi tortas and tacos.

I had breakfast and dessert at Raya and stopped by for dessert. The dessert was great and we managed to snag a table by the window. There was a 30-minute wait and the hostess ended up seating us at a table that hadn't been cleaned yet. When I pointed this out a staff member came over and wiped it down.

Other than this little hiccup the service was quick and attentive. The server promptly brought out water and my iced coffee was delivered five minutes later. I'm #teamicedcoffee year-round and the mark of a good iced coffee is when it's so smooth that you don't even need to add creamer. This one definitely fit the bill.

Next came the pana cotta topped with vanilla ice cream. It was so delicious I finished it in about three seconds flat. Sitting there at that window taking in the gorgeous scenery while enjoying my favorite dessert and iced coffee? It doesn't get better than that.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

The following morning we had breakfast at Raya. Now this experience was a bit underwhelming. There was no QR code at the table so we had to wait on that for a while.

I ordered the eggs Benedict while my parents had eggs with turkey bacon (major kudos on that since most hotel restaurants do not offer turkey bacon). We also ordered juice and a bowl of shared fruit. The total came to around $150. I charged it to my room and used the annual up to $300 statement credit for eligible purchases at hotels participating in the Marriott Bonvoy program from the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant American Express Card to cover it.

The presentation wasn't the greatest. Between the plates and overflowing ketchup bowls I got greasy diner vibes more than upscale resort. The table also didn't have salt or pepper and when I requested it the server brought me a plastic cup with salt and pepper packets. It's a small thing but presentation matters.

Beyond the appearance the food was also cold. With breakfast being so underwhelming and overpriced we followed a recommendation from Instagram and had breakfast at nearby Moulin the next morning. It was a much better experience and about a third of the price.

180Blu

180Blu is an outdoor dining restaurant with a large patio overlooking the beach. The restaurant gets its name from the fact that it offers 180 degrees of breathtaking ocean views. It's absolutely stunning and you'll see lots of guests strolling in just to take selfies. The menu is almost identical to Raya's with small plates and drinks served from 3 to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends.

(Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy)

We went to 180Blu for lunch on the first day and it was pretty packed. Despite only one waiter serving about a dozen tables. Despite this we were seated pretty quickly and the waiter did his best to be attentive and friendly.

Our drinks were served about 15 minutes after ordering and our food arrived about 40 minutes later. Service was definitely slow but totally understandable in this scenario. Our waiter still rushed around making sure that drinks were refilled and guests had what they needed.

(Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy)

We ordered the burger steak tacos and salmon dip with tortilla chips. Everything tasted just fine -- nothing exceptional. The highlight of 180Blu is definitely the view and not so much the food.

Amenities

The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel offers lots of amenities including two pools a tennis court a golf course and a gym with an unbeatable view. In exchange for all these amenities guests have to pay a daily $50 resort fee. Here's a closer look at what that gets you:

Gym

The hotel gym was located on the first floor across from the spa. There was never anyone working when I visited but plenty of folks would snap photos grab an apple from the complimentary bowl and then leave. With views like this who can blame them?

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

There was all the usual workout equipment – treadmills stationary bikes elliptical weights – along with yoga mats.

The gym was spotless and there was a hand sanitizer dispenser at the entrance. Overall I felt the place was clean and well-equipped for a workout.

Pool

The resort has two pools: one kids' pool closer to the lobby and a main pool located on the west side of the resort. The main pool is inside a courtyard of sorts surrounded by palm trees and countless lounge chairs.

Early in the morning the place was foggy and swarming with crows though the pool chairs filled up in the afternoons. I stayed here during a busy period and I didn't get the sense that you needed to leave a towel on a chair in order to reserve a place. There were plenty of loungers for everyone.

There were two pool lifts for wheelchair users which is one more than you typically see at most resorts.

The pool area also has a cafe that's open Thursday to Sunday between 11:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. and serves up drinks and casual fare. Guests can also order food and drinks for poolside delivery Monday through Wednesday during the same operating hours by using a QR code to place an order.

Next to the cafe was a jacuzzi that featured both a ramp and lift for wheelchair users.

Kids pool

The kids' pool was in a courtyard in the Monarch wing which is the east side of the property. It's easily accessible from the lobby straight past the front desk and down the staircase to the right. Alternately you can take the elevator in the Monarch wing down to the first floor and make a left into the courtyard. This is the best option for guests utilizing wheelchairs or those conveniently staying in the Monarch wing.

(Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy)

The kids' pool was fairly large and featured a pool lift and about three dozen lounge chairs. If you're traveling with a family and plan on making use of this pool quite a lot I would recommend asking for a room in the Monarch wing preferably on the first floor for the easiest access.

The beach

The beach is probably the best amenity offered by this resort. You can easily get to it by walking down designated pathways or by requesting a ride on one of the resort's golf carts.

(Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy)

Whether you want to catch a wave or a tan the resort has a little shack set up that can help you arrange any beach activities. It's located on the path from the back of the resort down to the beach. You can set up a surfing lesson grab a beach chair or anything else to make the most of your day at the beach.

At the end of the day you can trek back up to the resort and rinse your feet off at a conveniently located faucet.

Resort grounds

It might be odd to category the resort's grounds as an amenity but it's definitely a highlight of staying here. The grounds are absolutely stunning and a huge incentive to get your steps in every day.

There are beautiful places to just lounge and relax like the fire pit and lounge chairs offering incredible ocean views. You might even encounter a wedding or two depending on when you're staying here. The lawn areas are often decorated with chairs for wedding ceremonies. We dodged a massive wedding weekend and missed the action but it's something worth noting if you're partial to (or want to avoid) the pomp and circumstance of an outdoor wedding.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy) 0 1

If you're a more active traveler you'll enjoy the walking paths throughout the resort leading all the way up to the beachfront golf course. It's incredibly scenic and you can even stop to try and observe the sea life through binoculars conveniently located along the path.

Wi-Fi

Good Wi-Fi is important if you're working during your travels and The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel definitely has that covered. I had my phone and laptop hooked up to the resort's Wi-Fi and it worked well both in the room and in public areas like the firepit.

Service

The service at The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel was good overall though not always proactive. This isn't the type of resort where you'll run into staff on the grounds and get a friendly ""hello.""

When my dad realized he'd left his Airpods in the room it took repeated calls to get someone to look into it and my last call asking them to double-check the balcony went unanswered.

Again there's a pandemic happening and hotel stays are not going to be perfect.

I also did my usual security test where I pretended I lost my room key to see if the front desk would check my ID. To my disappointment they did not.

Note on accessibility

The resort offers wheelchair-accessible rooms and public spaces. The entrance to the lobby meeting spaces spa pool business center and gym are all wheelchair accessible. You'll also notice wheelchair lifts at the pool and jacuzzi as well as ramps winding down the back of the resort toward the beach.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Ariana Arghandewal/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

The resort also allows offers accessible guest rooms with 32-inch doors roll-in showers and tubs. During the booking process you can choose a room type and specify which of these features you're looking for. The hotel will assign you a room that fits your needs within the category you choose.

Unfortunately not all room types are accessible. Based on the hotel website only the Garden View Club Garden View Ocean View Executive Suite offer accessibility features.

Overall impression

Overall I enjoyed my stay at The Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel though there is definitely room for improvement. Whether you're paying for the room or just stopping by for a meal you're definitely paying more for the location than the service or amenities. The resort grounds are absolutely stunning and reminded me I don't need to fly to Hawaii for an incredible beachfront resort but the room wasn't in the best shape.

It's important to acknowledge that the hotel was short-staffed which might explain some of the shortcomings when it came to housekeeping dining and service. Hopefully that's addressed in the future because this is a unique property worth checking out if you want to put your Marriott points to good use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS93aGF0LWhhcHBlbnMtd2hlbi1ob3RlbHMtZWxpbWluYXRlLWRhaWx5LWhvdXNla2VlcGluZy1pbi1vbmUtcGhvdG8vY29tbWVudC1wYWdlLTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Happens When Hotels Eliminate Daily Housekeeping In One Photo,"There’s a wonderful feeling returning home to a clean house. Early in my professional career I started paying a housekeeper to come and returning home after they’d cleaned was a great feeling.

Staying at a hotel is wonderful when you get to return to your room and experience this every day . That is at least where daily housekeeping was offered. That’s something that disappeared at most hotels during the pandemic and big chains want to save on labor costs and eliminate it for good (Hilton for instance wants it to be ‘on request’ only at full service hotels.)

Checking into a hotel recently I was told there was no housekeeping available during my stay – they only cleaned rooms between guests. The Hyatt app gave me the choice to opt into housekeeping as an elite member but the front desk explained that they do not honor this.

“If you need more towels come down and ask us” they said. Hotels for years have been trying to get guests to re-use towels too. Now they have an almost fool-proof way of saving laundry cost too.

I asked what I should do about trash in my room? Many rooms have just small waste baskets. I’ll often bring food back to my room. I don’t want the smell after I’m done. “Just put the trash in the hall” they said.

Here’s a glimpse into our housekeeping-less future from the TownePlace Suites Outer Banks Kill Devil Hills:

Hotel service is one of the primary things that sets a Hilton Marriott Hyatt or IHG property apart from Airbnb. Marriott’s CEO wants guests to have sympathy for the REITs and trusts that own their hotels paying higher room rates and demanding less so that owners incur fewer costs. That even extends to eliminating the clocks in rooms and offering cheaper breakfast at brands where it’s included for all guests.

Many guests will show their sympathy by not demanding services from these hotels and booking elsewhere instead."

Wim Hof is a Dutch extreme athlete who is well-known for extraordinary feats of endurance such as running to an altitude of 23000 feet on Mount Everest in shorts and setting the world record for swimming the furthest under ice — which has earned him the nickname The Iceman. His feats have been viewed over 7 million times on YouTube and he has over 1 million followers on Instagram.

He has developed a simple approach to reducing stress in everyday life known as the Wim Hof Method. This method has become increasingly popular as a way of staying healthy during this time of COVID-19. BRINK spoke to Wim Hof and asked him to explain what is meant by the Wim Hof Method.

HOF: The Wim Hof Method consists of three pillars: breathing techniques cold exposure and mindsets. Breathing techniques have been around for thousands of years and of course we all breathe every day every minute. So what we are doing is manipulating our biochemistry through deep breathing.

Cold Showers Can Reduce Stress

Then the cold exposure is a way to train your cardiovascular system which has been shown to be very effective in university studies. The body contains approximately 70000 miles of blood vessels. A simple procedure like a cold shower every day will stimulate the tiny muscles within your arteries and veins; and with a regular habit of cold showers you’ll find that the heart rate can go down by 20 to 30 beats a minute. That helps to reduce stress. And it helps the blood transportation of the vascular system get toned. Getting oxygen nutrients and vitamins to the cells gives you more energy. In short it produces less stress and more energy.

The third aspect is mindset. The goal is to use the power of our intention to effectively combat physical stress. People in business live in a competitive environment which creates stress. This simple method shows you how to battle stress and to use it for your benefit. That is in short the Wim Hof Method.

Boosting Your Immune System

BRINK: Have you noticed this approach has any particular benefits as a way of coping with COVID-19?

HOF: Yes a lot. The dangerous factor of COVID-19 is inflammation. And we proved in medical research published in 2014 that these techniques can help to bring down inflammatory markers. In the study they injected us with E. coli bacteria as an experiment which normally makes people ill. But of the people who did these breathing exercises almost no one became sick and they were able to bring down the inflammation caused by the E. coli bacteria. As well as encouraging the use of face masks and social distancing at the moment doctors should also talk about ways of boosting your immune system.

Improving Your Mood

And then finally through doing these breathing techniques you can learn to regulate your mood. Regulating our emotions and our moods improves our work our concentration and our performance. It seems that the breathing exercises effectively tap into the stress mechanisms of the brain which helps to give us a sense of control over our mood. In the time of COVID-19 anxiety and inflammation are problems and this method can be effective at combating both of them.

BRINK: Can you describe the cold treatment in more detail?

HOF: In winter time when people get flus and colds and they have to stay home you can stay fit through cold shower practice. You become stronger. You get more energy. But to be clear we are talking about gradual cold exposure not going immediately into freezing water.

We begin with 30 seconds of a cold shower after you’ve had your warm one. This is very accessible and we have a free app on our website with diagrams and timers to guide the person through it.

Improving Performance

BRINK: If I’m an employer it may not be very practical to recommend cold showers to all employees so how do I introduce your methods into the workplace?

HOF: Well you do need to do this in the morning before you go to work. When you take a shower simply spend 30 seconds under cold water at the end. And the breathing techniques you should also do early in the morning on an empty stomach before you have breakfast so as to alter your pH level in the blood which then improves performance.

Related Reading How to Regain a Sense of Control in a Survival Mindset How Businesses Can Improve the Health of Societies Emotional Intelligence Is Key to Strong Leadership. Here’s How to Sharpen Yours.

So it is a matter of personal choice. In companies I hear a lot of CEOs say “By 2 p.m. my mind is really tired and my concentration has gone etc.” When that happens you can do 20 minutes of breathing exercises and you are crisp again.

We have worked with a lot of sports people to improve their performance. The breathing exercises make the pH level more alkaline and if we are able to alter the pH levels within the muscle tissue then performance is prolonged.

And that applies to executives too — those people at the top of their performance they find that they are able to be more productive by learning to alter their pH levels within their muscle tissue. It applies just as much to the mind for the mind is seated in the brain. When you increase alkaline levels within the body it goes through the blood-brain barrier into the brain and it helps you to feel more refreshed. Both physically and mentally it can help you to improve your performance.",,,,,,,,,

Choices are pro-competition and pro-innovation and would lower costs to merchants and ultimately prices to consumers. And isn’t “inconsistent” perhaps another way to say “against the law?”

U.S. PIRG supported the so-called “Durbin amendment” offered by Senator Dick Durbin (IL) to the Dodd Frank Act in 2010. The amendment capped debit card swipe fees imposed on merchants by big banks and required that merchants be given at least two choices to route their debit card transactions through an unaffiliated payment network. Of course we would have preferred that the amendment apply to both debit and credit card fees and rules but it was still a tremendous victory for competition and choice against an entrenched oligopoly Visa and Mastercard which is enabled by the powerful Wall Street mega-banks that issue the vast bulk of all debit and credit cards.

U.S. PIRG’s comment letter in the Debit Card Routing docket is available here. Excerpt from our comment:

“Much of the bank credit union and card network complaining about the Durbin amendment especially during the implementation of Regulation II had focused on its cap on certain debit card swipe fees. Now they defend their defiance of the Durbin amendment’s much more important routing requirements. The Durbin amendment was always about more than stopping excessive rent-seeking. It was also designed to promote the development of a competitive payment network marketplace. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking sends an important signal that conduct inconsistent with the Durbin amendment will not be tolerated.”

The Merchant Payment Coalition’s comment explains further:

“As merchants have adapted to serve their customers during the pandemic there has been a dramatic shift to e-commerce as well as mobile apps and wallets that have made the lack of routing options for merchants a more pressing issue than ever. Economists estimate that the lack of routing costs merchants and their customers billions of dollars each year with payments consulting firm CMSPI placing the amount at $2 to $3 billion annually. The very reason Congress passed the Durbin Amendment is because the U.S. payments market was broken and the largest banks and card networks are trying to keep it that way. It is imperative that the Board move forward and clarify its regulations in order to protect the competition and merchant routing choice that was intended by Congress.”

The FRB staff’s memo supporting the proposed rule points out that since passage of the Durbin amendment and Regulation II innovation by unaffiliated networks including “PINless debit” which is a new technology used in online (card-not-present) transactions has not been enabled by card-issuing banks:

“In the decade since the adoption of Regulation II spurred by the growth in online commerce card-not-present transactions have become an increasingly significant portion of all debit card transactions and technology has evolved to enable multiple networks for these transactions. Despite this two unaffiliated payment card networks are often not available to process card-not-present transactions such as online purchases because some issuers do not enable multiple networks for such transactions. Staff members view such an outcome as inconsistent with Regulation II’s requirement that at least two unaffiliated networks be available to process each debit card transaction.” [Emphasis added.]

Importantly the directors of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureaus of Consumer Protection Competition and Economics have also filed a supportive staff comment to the FRB’s docket. The FTC has authority over payment networks including Visa and Mastercard but not over the card-issuing banks:

“FTC staff applauds the Board’s proposed clarification which addresses some issuers’ failure to fully recognize that card-not-present (“CNP”) transactions are a “type of transaction” under the existing Regulation II. FTC staff submits this comment both to endorse the proposed clarification and to suggest additional revisions that will strengthen the rule. In particular the Board should adopt revisions that ensure that debit card networks do not create incentives for issuers to evade Regulation II’s clear mandate that there be two unaffiliated networks available for each type of debit transaction with each network a commercially reasonable alternative for merchants. We urge the Board to prohibit debit card networks from paying incentives to an issuer based on how electronic debit transactions are routed by merchants using that issuer’s debit cards.”

Most substantive comments are filed at the last minute and are not yet available on the FRB docket comment page. Visa and Visa Inc.’s comment filed 23 July is a notable exception. We comment on it in our PIRG comment:

“Visa’s filed comment in this docket asserts that “among some or all historically PIN-based debit networks the ability to support card-not-present transactions is relatively new and untested in the marketplace. […] Of course the actual claim here is belied by the fact that running a transaction without a PIN is not a new and untested practice. Signature-based debit transactions without a PIN are exactly what Visa does all the time. Visa simply doesn’t want competition from unaffiliated PIN debit networks that have developed competitive PINless transaction technology for online transactions.”

The payment networks pre-date BigTech’s Amazon and Google yet have many similarities as “multi-sided platforms.” Payment networks get revenue from both consumers (interest other fees) and merchants (swipe fees paid by merchants that accept cards are generally a small merchant’s second highest cost). Most of the merchant swipe fees are returned to card-issuing banks which then return most of the money to some cardholders as rewards. In other countries swipe fees are prohibited or strictly regulated. Only in the U.S. are swipe fees rising. That’s due to unchecked anti-competitive market power not innovation.

Although the Fed and FTC are independent agencies both the Fed’s proposed clarification and the FTC’s support of it are important steps to implement President Biden’s recent Executive Order on promoting competition in the economy.

Who said you can only sleep comfortably on a plane by shelling out considerable sums of money? Lufthansa has wonderful news for travelers. It has introduced the Sleeper's Row which will allow people to rest in total comfort even in economy class. A smart response to the many seats left vacant due to Covid-19.

Lufthansa what is Sleeper's Row

In this article:

Important news on Lufthansa flights in relation to certain long-haul routes. From August 2 2021 one will have the opportunity to reserve a Sleeper's Row either during check-in or at the airport gate. It goes without saying that this chance is guaranteed only before the flight. No upgrades to one's fare will be allowed on board.

Approval of the Cards is at the discretion of American Express. The annual free Gold Card and Green Card fees are subject to reaching specific annual spending thresholds.

What however does Sleeper's Row consist of? Applicant passengers will be provided with an entire row of seats. This consists of. three or four adjacent places. An advantage that will last for the entire flight. It will thus be possible to stretch out albeit in a more constricted manner than in other classes. The cabin crew will also offer the following accessories:

comfortable pillow

blanket

Business Class quality mattress cover

The system does not simply involve removing some armrests from the middle part of the row. Indeed it is necessary to provide security for passengers who wish to opt for such a solution. Therefore a special seat belt which can protect travelers ready to rest during long trips. The device remains attached even if the passenger is lying down. Stewards and stewardesses will provide the necessary instructions which can also be found in a special brochure provided on board. Those who choose a Sleeper's Row will also have access to pre-boarding so they can avoid tedious lines at the gate.

On which flights is it available

As indicated above Lufthansa has not introduced this option for all its flights. To take advantage of it one must purchase a ticket for a long-haul route of at least eleven hours or more. The green light has been given as of August 2 and routes to theFar East the west coast of the United States l'Central America and southern and theSouthern Africa.

It should be pointed out how there is a supplement the cost of which is included between 159 and 229 euros per route. As mentioned you can select this option at check-in or at the gate. Under no circumstances will it be possible to make a reservation in advance considering also the limited number of Sleeper's Row. In fact at present Lufthansa offers only three per individual flight.

The carrier tested this innovation on the Frankfurt-Sao Paulo-Frankfurt route. The trial lasted several weeks in late 2020. Feedback has been very positive from passengers who have made numerous requests. This is a very important change that will provide more variety in Economy Class which is set to change its appearance.

This is not the first time such a radical change has been hypothesized. Just think of the Economy Skycouch of Air New Zealand. The idea was to offer the public six reclining beds each with a minimum width of 58 cm. Privacy provided by curtains and more comfort in the cheaper classes. An idea first advanced in 2018. To date it still seems to be in the development phase and it is not possible to know when and if it will actually be implemented on scheduled flights.",,,,,,

Herman Sheer | Elude

Thinking about finally taking that vacation yet all you're sure about is your budget? How about just your preferred activities or that you want to pay for it with loyalty points? There are now travel apps for that — or soon will be. A new ""travel discovery and booking service"" called Elude which launched its mobile app Aug. 5 aims to match open-minded travelers who have a fixed dollar amount in mind with trips that fit both budget and interests. Meanwhile the new Una Travel app from startup firm XOKind curates collaborative itineraries for individual travelers and groups primarily based on interests. Still in the works are Out of Office which debuts in beta on Aug. 19 and will let users browse travel recommendations from trusted sources and then book them via OpenTable and the new TPG App from travel website The Points Guy due out in September and focused on maximizing the power of users' accumulated loyalty rewards points.

Cryptocurrency takes off as way to pay for travel

Affluent American ready to travel again — using vouchers

Amadeus adds fintech from travel app Hopper to offerings Mitchell Stoutin senior director of engineering for The Points Guy said the site wants to stake out a central role in a rapidly evolving travel app landscape. ""Of course there have always been apps to buy flights or book hotels but what we're seeing with the new generation is a revolution around integrations discoverability and utility"" he said. XOKind co-founder and CEO Arjun Bansal said ""the travel planning and booking experience hasn't fundamentally changed in the last 20 to 25 years."" ""Where we see things going with all the improvements in [artificial intelligence] is that in five years I should just be able to turn to my smartphone and say 'Hey Una book me my next vacation.'""

'Where can I travel for $500?'

One of the first next-gen apps out of the gate is Elude. Described by its founders as ""the only booking platform answering the question 'Where can I travel for $500?'"" Elude is built around a ""budget-first"" search engine that offers users instant options for flights departing the nearest airport and accommodations all within their desired price range. Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt president of Atmosphere Research Group in San Francisco said Elude's ""intriguing"" business idea has been a long time coming. ""I've been saying for more than 10 years that travel firms need to offer 'budget-led' shopping"" he said. ""Better late than never I guess."" The iOS version of the Elude app can now be downloaded at the Apple App Store and web booking at Elude.co will be available soon. An Android app is planned for early next year according to a company spokesperson. Elude co-founder Frankie Scerbo said he and co-founder and CEO Alex Simon were avid travelers with corporate jobs who'd become friends in college and liked to get away on several shorter breaks each year rather than just one longer vacation.

Price and trip length for them were the primary concerns. ""For us destination never really mattered"" Scerbo said. ""It was just 'get us wherever our budget could afford to get us.'"" A frustrating experience trying to book a group New Year's trip with friends that met everyone's budget and expectations led Scerbo and Simon to seek out an app to help. Failing to find what they needed they decided to ""just do it ourselves"" Scerbo said. There are three elements to Elude according to Simon the first of which is user onboarding. ""Basically we ask a handful of fun kind of quirky questions to better know the user so [the experience] is more personalized"" he said citing WiFi weather or cuisine preferences as examples.

You're literally seeing everything you can afford to get to instead of … everything you can't afford to get to. Frankie Scerbo co-founder of Elude

Elude will use customer preferences to curate future trip requests. ""It's basically to figure out what you like to do and what type of traveler you are"" said Scerbo. ""Once we have more of that information we can kind of get a little bit better with the A.I. [artificial intelligence] and suggest trips that'll probably be really attractive to you."" Next comes the main search functionality wherein users input their budgets travel dates and point of origin. ""We then showcase all city options that match that person's budget"" Simon said. Users can choose a destination and fully customize their package. ""We have a recommended flight and a recommended hotel but if you want a five-star hotel great you can upgrade"" he noted. ""And let's say you want a 7 p.m. flight versus one at 7 a.m. — you're able to make that change within the app too.""

For now air and hotel are the focus; Elude will add activity and experience content at a later date. ""We're going to keep it very simple in the beginning"" he said. ""We just want to get people out and going."" The third component is direct booking via Elude. ""We are actually the merchant of record; we're not pushing you out to someplace else"" said Simon noting that many search engines present users with price quotes and then link them out to other sites for booking — where the price is often different. ""It's been our biggest hurdle but definitely what we're most excited about."" Sites like Skyscanner.com present users with a range of airfare and destination options but then direct them to supplier or online travel agency (OTA) sites for booking. Traditional OTAs like Expedia Priceline and Travelocity meanwhile are destination- and date-based for initial searches rather than budget-focused that Elude incorporates.

Curation and integration are key

For their part the developers of the Una Travel: Vacation Sidekick & Smart Trip Planner — alumni of Intel specializing in A.I. — wanted to create a virtual ""personal assistant who knows you best"" and crafts bespoke itineraries while also allowing collaborative decision-making in a social network style for group trip planning. Bansal at San Diego-based XOKind said Una available at the Apple and Google Play stores addresses ""the travel planning and booking experience being very fragmented and [people] having to use tools — like docs notes and spreadsheets — to collect all the information and collaborate with their co-travelers."" Una quizzes users on destination preferences presenting product and price options and refining future choices as they're given a literal thumbs up or down. Users can sort and filter options and add them to collaborative trip itineraries if planning group travel as well as share notes web links and other data. The app's A.I. comes up with the best matches for all and also pointedly offers info on free activities at chosen locales noted Bansal. ""Other apps tend to focus only on the bookable portions of the trip but we're trying to provide a more sort of holistic perspective on all the things [travelers] could be doing"" he said adding his development team ""thought of Una as being both concierge and travel agent.""

We're not just engineers and designers who haven't paid heed to the customer support piece. Sarah Harris vice president of product at XOKind

To wit Sarah Harris XOKind's vice president of product noted that streamlined user-friendly Una — which should be equally intelligible to Gen Z and baby boomer users alike — will offer ""more [customer service] support than probably the larger OTAs because we know that's such an important element of the travel experience."" ""We're not just engineers and designers who haven't paid heed to the customer support piece"" she added. At press time Una Travel allowed only hotel booking directly on the app while vacation-rentals and activities booking is imminent according to Bansal. Flight ticketing is planned by year-end. Elude based in Los Angeles can be used to book air and hotel travel anywhere out of available U.S. and international destinations by anyone according to Scerbo although content is only available in English at the moment. (The firm is currently using Covid-restrictions data from TripsGuard.com to filter inaccessible or restricted destinations for given users from trip choices offered.) ""With just a couple clicks — when you want to leave and how much you want to spend — you're literally seeing everything you can afford to get to instead of … everything you can't afford to get to"" said Scerbo adding that a user will likely be surprised at what they can actually afford.

XOKind's Una Travel: Vacation Sidekick & Smart Trip Planner is now available in the Google Play and Apple app stores.

Stoutin at The Points Guy said he envisions the TPG App and competitors as ""far beyond simple tools for buying and booking."" ""Travel apps in the new generation are offering up things to do and experience in a contextual just-in-time way"" he said. ""We're making one of our own: an award explorer that lets you see where your points can take you — and in what style — at the speed of your imagination."" The TPG App will pull together users' various loyalty accounts and offer suggestions to build up point balances and book trips. What's more the app will excel at ""discoverability"" Stoutin added. ""You can now go to a new city and with the scan of a QR code or an AppClip get the local scooter rental restaurant menus or cultural experience reservations"" he said. ""Your phone is your boarding pass your room key and your translator.""

Eyes on the future

Both Silicon Valley and Wall Street are taking notice of this new front in travel apps. Elude has attracted $2.1 million in investor funding from firms such as Mucker Capital Unicorn Ventures Upfront Scout Fund StartupO Grayson Capital and Flight VC. Other backers and advisors include travel industry and social media veterans such as Jeff Hoffman formerly of Priceline.com; former Airmap CEO Ben Marcus; former Instagram CMO Cliff Hopkins; and Snapchat head of international partnerships Juan Borrerro. Several sit on Elude's Influencer Advisory Board helping to shape marketing strategy app design and more. XOKind meanwhile has raised more than $3.25 million from a group of similarly high-profile investors and Out of Office co-founders Janine Seale and Coabi Kastan just closed a $1.6 million pre-seed round of fundraising for team expansion and continued platform development according to a spokesperson. ""We needed to have industry experts to really help us navigate the field"" said Elude's Simon. ""Getting ARC [Airlines Reporting Corporation] and IATA [International Air Transport Association] certified and … a lot of the regulatory hurdles we needed to go through we needed to have guidance … and so we're thrilled to have those individuals on our team especially as we continue to scale.""

Who could possibly be against that? Except the trouble as it always is when it comes to measures like censorship is that the people doing the censoring usually have a very different definition of what an “extremist and hate movement” is than you the reader does. For them it might be someone who talks about “revolution” or “eating the rich” someone who protested against police brutality last year or simply groups and people that fight for the rights of Palestinians. In fact this exact thing has already happened once before with PayPal which has been banning and cancelling the accounts of various groups and individuals over the last few years. In 2018 the company came under fire when alongside its ban of the far-right Proud Boys it also threw in the accounts of several anti-fascist groups for good measure. Just like when Reddit included a host of left-leaning subreddits in its purge of violent and hateful content last year these platforms have a commercial interest in appearing to be equally opposed to extremists on “both sides” even when one of those sides is violent racists like the Proud Boys and the other is people who oppose and confront those racists. But PayPal’s partnership with the ADL threatens to go even further down this worrying road. The ADL which was founded in 1913 as the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith has been on the right side of many issues related to racism and intolerance but it also has a long history of acting as essentially an informal lobbying group for the Israeli government and in the process conflating opposition to Israel’s apartheid policies with actual antisemitism — as well as attacking the Left and skirting dangerously close to bigotry itself.

A Checkered Past This history goes all the way back to the 1960s when the ADL’s then-leader attacked the famed civil rights group the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee over its anti-Zionist stance charging it with “extremism” and ties to “the Chinese-Soviet and now Arab propaganda machines” and putting it in the same league as the Ku Klux Klan. In the words in 1961 of its national director the ADL “for many years has maintained a very important confidential investigative coverage of Arab activities and propaganda” and “an information-gathering operation since 1948” focusing on Arab state organizations and groups. By 1993 a police raid on its California headquarters found this surveillance went much much further encompassing more than six hundred mostly liberal organizations including the NAACP ACLU and the International Indian Treaty Council. But that’s ancient history by now right? Unfortunately not. Under its former president Abe Foxman with whom the ADL was virtually synonymous for years the organization began increasingly embracing Washington’s Islamophobic “war on terror” and subsuming its stated principle of ensuring “a world in which no group or individual suffers from bias discrimination or hate” to the more central goal of defending Israeli apartheid and maintaining the government connections to do so. When the Right freaked out over the intentionally misnamed “Ground Zero mosque” — a classic case of right-wing cancel culture targeting a planned Islamic cultural center with a pool and basketball court that was to be built two blocks away from where the Twin Towers had stood — Foxman sided with them. Just as “survivors of the Holocaust are entitled to feelings that are irrational” he said to widespread condemnation September 11 victims’ families’ “anguish entitles them to positions that others would categorize as irrational or bigoted.” On the ADL’s one-hundred-year anniversary Foxman claimed that Jews had it worse than Muslims and that anti-Muslim hatred “didn’t happen” after September 11 before explaining that Rep. Peter King’s call for more surveillance of Muslims was “a natural response” and blaming “Muslim communities that have been brought in and are not assimilating.” The ADL often set its sights and energies not so much on white supremacists and neo-Nazis but on liberal Jewish organizations critical of Israel and various college campus groups that organized around Palestinian justice. Fittingly the ADL never said a thing about the NYPD’s outrageous spying on Muslim New Yorkers and actually bestowed an award on the man who had overseen it. He was one of the officers who had been trained in the counterterrorism exchange program with Israel that the ADL has sponsored since 2004 educating US police in the tactics used by the country’s abusive security services. For the ADL a commitment to the defense of the Israeli government came to supersede all other considerations as when Foxman opposed a congressional resolution to finally label the Turkish slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians a genocide — a stance the ADL reportedly adopted to protect Israel’s strategic relationship with Turkey. During this period the ADL often set its sights and energies not so much on white supremacists and neo-Nazis but on liberal Jewish organizations critical of Israel and various college campus groups that organized around Palestinian justice. Among its semiregular list of the “Top 10 Anti-Israel Groups in the U.S.” it listed institutions like J Street New Israel Fund Code Pink Jewish Voice for Peace and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights a coalition of 380 organizations opposing Israeli apartheid some of them Jewish charging they were “fixated with delegitimizing Israel” and pushing a “misleading narrative” about the country. It praised a 2010 Education Department decision to use the 1964 Civil Rights Act to “protect” Jewish college students from “anti-Israel and anti-Zionist sentiment that crosses the line into anti-Semitism” compared a talk at Brooklyn College about boycotting Israel to the Ku Klux Klan holding an event about maintaining a white-dominated America and denounced a Harvard conference on the idea of a one-state solution — in which Jews and Palestinians would live together within a single state — as “the elimination of Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish people.” This regular conflation of Israel with all Jews everywhere and the implication that the distinct interests of each were really one and the same somehow coexists with the organization’s practice of lobbing accusations of antisemitism at left-leaning targets over poorly phrased statements that could be interpreted as advancing the racist idea of “dual loyalty.” To wit when former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he would be trying to torpedo Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran by delivering an outrageous speech to Congress as “a representative of the entire Jewish people” the ADL didn’t condemn this clearly antisemitic trope. Instead it criticized J Street for asking Jews to sign a petition saying that Netanyahu “doesn’t speak for me” which Foxman called “inflammatory and repugnant.” Note that at the same time the ADL fixated on criticism of Israeli policies and kept a laser focus on pop culture and obvious satire it was deathly silent about the many many stunningly racist things that actual Israeli officials regularly said out loud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZW1pZXJsZWFndWUuY29tL25ld3MvMjE3MDQ5M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brentford join select group of clubs boasting debut win,"Related Articles

Owen: Brentford can challenge anyone if they play like that

Brentford wrote themselves into Premier League history with Friday's 2-0 win against Arsenal on their debut in the competition.

Goals from Sergi Canos and Christian Norgaard ensured Thomas Frank's side joined an elite group of clubs who have won their first Premier League match.

Since the competition's inaugural season Brentford are the 28th team to earn promotion and take part for the first time and they became only the seventh of those to win their opening match.

The previous team to achieve that feat were Huddersfield Town. Like Brentford the Terriers went straight to the top of the table when they beat Crystal Palace 3-0 at the start of 2017/18.

Before then Blackpool made a real splash when they triumphed 4-0 at Wigan Athletic in 2010/11.

See: How every club have fared on opening weekend

History suggests a winning start is a strong indicator that a debut club will ultimately stay up.

After all of the six previous teams who have won their opener five retained their Premier League status.

However success in that first match certainly isn't everything.

After all Blackpool were relegated despite their impressive debut. And while 18 of the 27 debut clubs have lost their opening match half of those have stayed up regardless.

Brentford's victory against the Gunners could also contribute to a record-breaking weekend in another way.

If Watford and Norwich City add points from their respective matches at home to Aston Villa and Liverpool 2021/22 would be only the second season where the three promoted teams have claimed more than four points combined on the opening weekend.

The only time this has happened was in 1997/98 when Bolton Wanderers and Palace each won to return six points.

But amid COVID-19 induced restrictions 2020 saw accelerated internet adoption. There were 622 million active internet users in 2020 and this number is expected to reach 900 million by 2025 across urban and rural areas according to the IAMAI-Kantar ICUBE report.





Locked indoors many at-home consumers flocked online to shop watch movies and even connect with people on not just social media but also on dating apps.

Surge on dating apps

While many apps including ﻿Tinder﻿ Bumble and TrulyMadly did not reveal their exact user base according to Statista dating apps are projected to be used by 4.3 percent of India’s population by 2025 – up from 3 percent in 2021.

Tinder saw a 19 percent growth in messages exchanged and a 32 percent increase in the conversation duration from 2020 according to data shared by the company.

A small dipstick survey done by YourStory showed that women started using one of the dating apps for the first time or revisited it mostly with an intent to meet new people.

ALSO READ Is Tinder making it difficult for you to find love?

A nationwide survey commissioned by Bumble in June 2021 revealed that 44 percent people who were previously against online dating tried the app “as it became the only way to meet someone”. Also 50 percent of singles in the survey claimed they were no longer ashamed to say they met their partners through a dating app.





This opened up an opportunity for many dating apps to sustain women users who are usually hard to keep.

“We definitely saw our user base go up but it was surprisingly coming from women between 18-24 years which has never happened before” says Able Joseph Founder of Aisle.

Having female users on dating apps is important for app runners. It helps create an environment of trust for both men and women. When there are more women on the apps the number of fake accounts tend to decrease according to Jitesh Bisht Founder of HiHi App.

This is the mantra being followed by new-age apps such as the one-year-old HiHi App which aims to increase their female ratio to 30 percent. While Founder Jitesh did not reveal the current gender ratio on the app according to Statista out of the 31 million Indian dating app users in 2020 67 percent were men.

The missing female users

But in the crowded dating app market sustaining female users is not an easy task. “It is also very expensive” Snehil Khanor Co-founder and CEO of ﻿TrulyMadly﻿ told YourStory in an earlier interaction.





If getting a male user to download the app costs Rs 4 then for a female user it would cost at least Rs 10 according to two industry experts who confirmed this estimate. The prices could only go down if the volumes are higher.





Acquiring female users is also expensive because a fewer number of women use the internet as many families restrict women’s access to mobiles and the internet. In urban areas 43 percent of women spend time online compared to 57 percent of the male population while the ratio is also similar in rural areas with 42 percent females compared to 58 percent of their male counterparts according to the IAMAI-Kantar ICUBE report.





This has led to the gender ratio on dating apps becoming extremely skewed. For the longest time many dating apps had almost 80-90 percent men as told by many industry professionals.





This skewed figure is also the result of many women being apprehensive of signing up in fear of their security and well-being. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky 57 percent of online daters lie to each other while 41 percent have faced some or the other form of fraud on dating apps.

“I got catfished on a dating app and I don’t think I am ever going to use one again” tells a 25-year-old Mumbai-based investment professional who wishes to remain anonymous.

Many women also get unsolicited messages and drop off with a bad experience.





Meanwhile using dating apps still remains a big taboo for women. While a 24-year-old MBA student who wishes to remain anonymous did not have too many bad experiences she deleted all her dating apps as she was moving back to her hometown.





“I did not want anyone to find me on a dating app and then come and report it back to my family” she says.

Bridging the gender gap

Many apps are striving to find a solution to this problem.





Tinder which entered India in 2012 and was taken over by Match Group in 2016 rolled out a Block Contact feature earlier this month. The feature lets users block people from their contact list to avoid “the awkwardness of a familiar face they would rather not see” according to Tinder’s emailed responses to YourStory’s detailed questionnaire.





As the pandemic struck the app was quick to introduce and heavily promote the perks of virtual dating for women as they would not have to meet someone for the first time at a new location or at their homes.





To retain female users on the platform HiHi offers users to fill up an extensive questionnaire when signing up to keep a tab on genuine users.

“We take flagged accounts very seriously especially if a female user has flagged someone. Our team investigates the account and removes them if they are not in line with our guidelines” says Jitesh

Non-serious users also get filtered out quickly. To build trust among women the firm is also focusing on building a female-friendly brand image.

Bumble which is backed by actress Priyanka Chopra has a positive brand image among women as the app enables women to initiate a conversation instead of them receiving unsolicited messages. Though the Whitney Wolfe Herd-run firm could not participate in the story the company earlier this year did introduce the ‘Stand for Safety’ initiative which provides guidelines to help women fight online abuse.





Shalini Singh who founded ﻿Andwemet﻿ in 2019 says the app only allows people aged above 25 and asks them a bunch of questions — such as how comfortable they are with long-distance relationships if people would like to own a pet if they had past relationships among others — before approving their profile.

“Our questions are designed to give a lot of information about the person. So before getting too invested and then finding something that could be a deal-breaker we think it is better to know things beforehand” says Shalini.

Currently around 60 percent of the users on the platform are female. These initiatives indicate that the future of dating apps remains optimistic.





“There is a cultural shift happening in India. The younger generation exercising their independence and choice to find their life partner which is a departure from the traditional approach. The key to cracking this market is to create a safe experience for women online when exploring new relationships which not many dating startups have figured out yet” says Vinod Jose a Philadelphia-based angel investor and founding partner of Konglo Ventures who invested in Aisle in 2021.

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign. Why it matters: Pennsylvania's race between McCormick and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. could determine which party controls the Senate next year — and is a prime opportunity for Republicans to gain a seat.

Driving the news: Keystone Renewal PAC's first ad focuses on McCormick's time at West Point and his earning a Bronze Star while serving in the Gulf War.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why."

It’s been 50 years since the Golden Arches first arrived in Japan making its grand debut on the first floor of the Ginza Mitsukoshi department store in Tokyo’s upmarket Ginza district back in 1971.

Since then the chain has grown and evolved in Japan to include exclusive offerings like Fukubukuro Lucky Bags which are usually sold around New Year’s Day. With this year being the chain’s 50th anniversary McDonald’s has decided to spoil us with an extra lucky bag in the middle of summer dubbed the “Big Smile Bag“ priced at 3000 yen (US$27.14).

We were lucky to come across these bags at our local branch so we decided to pick one up to see if it was worth the relatively high price tag. Upon opening he bag we found:

▼ A handheld French fries fan…

▼ …a zippered pouch…

▼ …a chill towel…

▼ …and free coupons (equivalent to 3160 yen).

With the bag costing 3000 yen the coupon booklet already gave us our money back plus some which meant the goods inside the bag were all free gifts. Plus there was also the tote bag everything came in which was one of our favourite things in the haul due to it having this cute rare character printed on one side.

This cute gent is Speedee the first-ever mascot for the chain which was created way back in 1940 when brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald opened their first burger restaurant in California called the ‘Speedee Service System‘.

▼ Speedee was replaced by Ronald McDonald in 1967 and the ‘Speedee Service System’ was renamed ‘McDonald’s’.

All the items in this 50th anniversary lucky bag had a great retro feel to them including the French fry fan which stole the heart of our boss Yoshio who immediately became hooked on its cooling powers.

▼ “If only it came with the aroma of French fries…”

According to McDonald’s Japan the Big Smile Bag is a limited-edition item that customers could purchase via a lottery system from 23-30 June. We were pretty lucky to stumble across them being sold at the Musashi-Kosugi Tokyu Square branch as our other reporters were unable to find them at their local branches so keep your eyes peeled for them if you’d like to grab one.

And don’t forget to keep an eye out for the retro McDonald’s Graniph tees as well!

man holds the Guinness World Record for most Big Macs eaten in a lifetime. Donald Gorske of Fond du Lac Wisconsin has consumed more than 32340 burgers since 1972.

To stay healthy Gorske skips the side of fries and takes regular six-mile walks.

It all began on May 17 1972 when Donald Gorske got his first car.

""I drove to McDonald's  ordered my first three Big Macs and went out to the car and ate them"" said in a recent Guinness World Records video. ""I said right there that I'm probably gonna eat these the rest of my life.""

He tossed the three containers in his back seat for safekeeping and the rest as they say is history. Nearly 50 years later Gorske is the undisputed record holder for eating the most Big Macs with more than 32340 consumed.

It's hard to be a record-holder without - well - records and Gorske has that covered. Bankers' boxes filled with empty cartons fill his home along with folders full of receipts collated by year representing each burger ordered and eaten.

Oh and he has a calendar too.

""I started out eating nine a day for a while"" he said about the early days of his habit though lately he's on a more regimented two a day.

Local McDonald's franchise owner Dave Rause who has been keeping Gorske well-supplied with special sauce and patties told the Guinness team that at one point Gorske realized his daily trips to pick up Big Macs were costing him more in gas money than in actual food costs.

Now Gorske makes two trips per week - Mondays and Thursdays - to pick up a stash of six or eight burgers to bring home and eat later.

""I'm not the type of person who tries new stuff"" he said. ""When I like something I stick with it all the time.""

""Don Gorske did not tell me about his Big Mac obsession when we met"" his wife Mary Gorske told the Guinness team. ""I didn't realize it would go on forever.""

While Gorske plans to eat Big Macs every day for the rest of his life he said Mary has drawn a line: ""When it comes to where she's gotta put a Big Mac in a blender then she says it's over for me.""

For someone with a daily fast-food habit Gorske is in remarkably fit shape. He attributes that to being disciplined about saying no to a side of fries and taking regular six-mile walks around his neighborhood.

Each Big Mac contains 540 calories and McDonald's says it sells more than a billion Big Macs around the world each year. More than half of those are sold in the US and Japan is also a major Big Mac market."

According to a study of crash data from the United Kingdom commercial truck drivers with diabetes had a three-to-five-fold increase in crashes over those without diabetes. While these statistics are distressing we are encouraged by new technology that should ease the burden that diabetes places on drivers.

In May Ford Motor Co. unveiled two new innovations for on-board diabetes management. First the auto-maker announced a partnership to develop an in-car version of WellDoc’s mobile phone-based DiabetesManager software. DiabetesManager maintains a virtual logbook and provides recommendations to the user based on real-time and historical tracking of user-provided information such as glucose status medications exercise habits and diet information. The in-car version of DiabetesManager will use Ford’s AppLink technology a SYNC feature that allows BlackBerry iPhone and Android phones to use approved applications via steering wheel buttons and voice control. Also exciting is the potential for location-based services such as informing drivers about healthy restaurant choices in the area. As we understand it DiabetesManager is expected to launch for US employers in the second half of 2011 while the car-based version should roll out sometime in late 2012.

Ford also has a new partnership with Medtronic to link continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices to cars. The system would work using Bluetooth with glucose levels and trends available through the in-car sound system and through visual displays. If glucose levels are outside the normal range audible alerts would sound and eye-catching cues would be shown. Encouragingly the applications of the system would go beyond the driver since anyone in the car with a connected glucose device could be monitored (e.g. a sleeping child in the backseat). Ford said it anticipated a two-year launch timeframe though Medtronic has emphasized that the project is still in early-stage research. --AB",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZGlhdHJpYmUub3JnL2RpYWJldGVzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWVkdHJvbmljLWFuZC1hZXRuYS1wYXJ0bmVyLXByb3ZpZGUtcHVtcHMtcGVvcGxlLXR5cGUtMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medtronic and Aetna Partner to Provide Pumps for People with Type 2 | DiaTribe,"On March 4 Medtronic announced the creation of a new pilot program with Aetna to provide an insulin pump to up to 300 fully insured members with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (those with an A1c greater than 8%). Participants in the pilot will receive a MiniMed Revel insulin pump as well as educational support to learn about insulin pump therapy. The companies expect the program to run for two years and will track the success of pumps in helping the wearer with glucose control health outcomes and healthcare costs. Hopefully the information from the program may also benefit providers in identifying type 2s who can benefit the most from going on a pump (this important factor has long been debated and the new data would help in figuring out what patients are best suited for pump therapy).

This is a much-needed initiative as about 50% of type 2 patients are not at their A1c goal and many dislike insulin injections or using needles in public. Currently very few people with type 2 diabetes use pumps – this stems from a variety of factors including the lack of data on the benefits of pump therapy for type 2 healthcare providers’ comfort level with pumps for type 2 and reimbursement challenges. Luckily there are several less expensive easier-to-user insulin delivery devices currently approved or in development. Valeritas manufactures the V-Go Disposable Insulin Delivery Device (basal/bolus) for type 2 patients which is currently available in the US (more information here). J&J/Calibra’s very slim Finesse (bolus-only) has been approved by the FDA and is under further study. CeQur’s PaQ device (basal/bolus) is currently being studied in Europe and is expected to launch there next year. Several other type 2 products are in development from companies like Insulet and Debiotech. –NL/AB",,,,,,,,,

On Monday Gossamer and the Italy-based Chiesi Farmaceutici announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and eventually sell the drug which is called seralutinib. Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known in short as PAH and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.

PAH or pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.

Unlike other treatments Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.

Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial titled “Prosera” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.

While Gossamer remains confident in its drug company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022 when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning they traded at about 75 cents apiece.

Joseph Schwartz an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns according to Schwartz is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.

The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration” the analyst wrote.

Story continues

Per deal terms Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs the former is responsible for financing Prosera.

In the U.S. the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.

Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales. Chiesi has agreed to pay Gossamer $160 million as a development reimbursement and may shell out up to $326 million more provided certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer."

“I wanted to discuss this now so that you can see the future that we’re working towards and how our major initiatives across the company are going to map to that” Zuckerberg said on the call.

“What is the metaverse? It’s a virtual environment where you can be present with people in digital spaces. You can kind of think of this as an embodied internet that you’re inside of rather than just looking at.”

These comments echoed an interview he gave to The Verge last week detailing some of the company’s future goals reports the Tech Crunch.

The metaverse offers Facebook an opportunity to draw a line between its moonshot efforts and its core business building a wide-reaching hub that shines on augmented reality and virtual reality platforms but feels just as friendly on mobile and desktop. Zuckerberg’s definition of metaverse is more broad than some others but comes down to building a version of the web that feels more like an MMO than a collection of web pages.

It’s hard to imagine now but Facebook was late to mobile. A decade ago Facebook’s apps were buggy crash-prone HTML5 experiences even as smooth native mobile apps were quickly becoming the standard for major software makers.

By 2012 Zuckerberg realized that apps were the future — quickly becoming the present — and the Facebook founder scrambled to turn the company’s attention toward mobile at every level. Facebook doesn’t intend to make the same mistake twice. That philosophy first became abundantly clear when the company bought the industry-leading VR hardware maker Oculus in 2014.

“Mobile is the platform of today and now we’re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow” Zuckerberg said around the time of the $2 billion acquisition. “Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever and change the way we work play and communicate.”

Becoming “a metaverse company” is a further evolution of this thinking. For many Roblox has seemed to be the clearest embodiment of the metaverse today — a social world where users can jump between virtual experiences while creating their own experiences inside it.

It’s notably not a virtual reality experience instead thriving largely on mobile and desktop. Roblox’s vision has resonated with investors the now-public company is worth more than $45 billion — a fraction of Facebook’s value but more than almost any other game company in the West.

Facebook has been signaling its continued interest in this space. In June they bought a Roblox-like platform called Crayta for an undisclosed sum and they’ve spent much of the last several years buying up a host of VR-focused game studios.

The company has tried to build its own VR-centric social hub but most have fallen flat. Facebook’s metaverse-like Horizon platform garnered major headlines when it was announced nearly two years ago but the company has had little to say during its exceedingly quiet beta period.

This week Facebook’s Andrew Bosworth detailed that Gaming VP Vivek Sharma would be taking over the effort under a new metaverse-centric product group led by Instagram’s Vishal Shah.

There’s a very particular distinction in Facebook’s choice of rebranding itself as a “metaverse” company as opposed to an AR/VR one. While some might have seen specialized hardware as essential to a spatial internet it’s become increasingly clear that users aren’t clamoring to embrace early headsets even as other new gaming platforms greatly accelerate their growth.

While the company’s Quest 2 headset has sold much better than its previous devices — according to Facebook which has yet to release any hard sales numbers — it’s unclear whether they truly need a world full of users with Facebook glasses and headsets strapped to their faces in order to embrace this metaverse ideal — or whether that would just be the cherry on top.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcnR1bmVpbmRpYS5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9vbGFzLWZpcnN0LWUtc2Nvb3Rlci1hdC1wcmljZS05OTk5OS8xMDU3MzDSAWBodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3J0dW5laW5kaWEuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS90ZWNobm9sb2d5JTJGb2xhcy1maXJzdC1lLXNjb290ZXItYXQtcHJpY2UtOTk5OTklMkYxMDU3MzA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ola’s first e-scooter at price ₹99999,"The scooter is based on the design of Etergo a Dutch EV company Ola Electric acquired last year. Except the design everything else such as batteries motors motor controllers and the software to power the e-scooters have been reengineered. “While the design is similar we have reimagined everything else for the Indian market. We want to build in India for the world. Rather than asking for tax cuts import subsidies etc. this is the right time to invest in India. This is not about the government anymore; entrepreneurs have to do it” Aggarwal says.

The company opened its electric scooter up for pre-booking on July 15 and received 1 lakh reservations within the first 24 hours. The deliveries will start in October. Right now the challenge for Aggarwal is to keep up with the upcoming demand at its ₹2400-crore mega factory in Krishnagiri Tamil Nadu. At its full capacity of 10 million units by next two years Ola’s ‘Future Factory’ will roll out one electric scooter (e-scooter) every two seconds. Once completed the 500-acre factory—the world’s largest two-wheeler plant—will account for 15% of the world’s two-wheeler production.

“We’ll soon reach 2 million production capacity and are already at 1 million” he argues.

Aggarwal is also working to set up an exclusive charging infrastructure for his customers and aims to build 5000 charging stations in 100 cities. When it comes to after-sales service it will be an at-home facility requiring one-third of the maintenance of an ICE vehicle Aggarwal says.

In a highly fragmented EV industry Ola will be competing with legacy players like Bajaj Auto TVS Motor and Hero Electric as well as new-age startups like Ather Energy Okinawa Autotech and Ampere Vehicles. But with a planned production capacity of half the size of India’s entire ICE two-wheeler market Ola wants to take on them all. Today India sells only around 150000 electric two-wheelers a firm. McKinsey forecasts sales of 4.5 million to 5 million units or 25%-30% of the market in FY25. “Why can’t we aim to achieve all of two-wheeler sales to EVs by 2025? Why can’t India become the hub of global EV manufacturing? People have a wrong perception that startups are all about cash burn in my opinion it’s all about speed and innovation” Aggarwal points out.",,,,,,,,,

The jury is still out on New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh but one thing appears certain: he’s a man of his word.

Saleh perhaps personified his “All Gas No Brake” mantra on Saturday as even the relative peace of the pregame is no opportunity to shut down. The Jets’ new boss was captured on video getting in a late workout through jogging up the stairs of MetLife Stadium.

Saleh’s “Rocky” moment comes hours before the Jets open their 2021 preseason slate against the New York Giants (7:30 p.m. ET WNBC).

With Saturday’s temperatures breaking 90 degrees and MetLife decked out in the Giants’ blue shades – Saturday’s game is a designated Big Blue home game – Saleh looks downright defiant as he makes the trek up East Rutherford’s stairs. The seats he jogs by will hold Jets fans for an officially sanctioned game at MetLife Stadium for the first time since December 2019.

Observers on social media could not help but get pumped up about the new head coach’s pregame routine.

The New York Jets won the MetLife Bowl after beating the New York Giants 12-7 on Saturday at MetLife Stadium in the opening preseason game for both teams.

Zach Wilson the former BYU quarterback who the Jets selected No. 2 in the 2021 NFL draft completed six of nine passes for 63 yards in his professional debut.

Jets running back La'Mical Perine scored on a four-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. That proved to be the only touchdown either team scored all game and it gave the Jets a 10-0 lead following the extra point.

The Giants cut the deficit to 10-7 courtesy of Damion Willis' 21-yard touchdown catch with 7:05 remaining in regulation prior to the extra point.

Big Blue had a last-gasp chance to tie or take the lead after getting the ball back with 1:46 remaining in regulation on its own 6-yard line but Hamilcar Rashed and Jonathan Marshall sacked Giants quarterback Clayton Thorson for a safety to effectively seal the game.

Many starters on both teams rested including Giants quarterback Daniel Jones and running back Saquon Barkley.

The Giants offense struggled in defeat amassing just 163 total yards of offense. Quarterbacks Mike Glennon and Thorson combined to complete just eight of 23 passes for 92 yards and they were sacked five times.

The Jets started the three-game preseason with a win and the Giants started their stretch with a loss.

Notable Performances

Jets QB Zach Wilson: 6-of-9 passing 63 yards

Jets RB La'Mical Perine: 12 carries 30 rushing yards 1 TD

Jets WR Denzel Mims: 3 catches 51 receiving yards

Giants QB Clayton Thorson: 5-of-16 72 passing yards 1 TD

Giants WR Damion Willis: 1 catch 21 receiving yards 1 TD

Giants WR David Sills V: 3 catches 49 receiving yards

Wilson Debuts for Gang Green

Wilson enjoyed a respectable showing on Saturday highlighted by an exceptional proficiency on third down.

The 22-year-old had a pair of nine-yard passes to wide receiver Corey Davis on a 12-play 92-yard drive that ended with Chris Naggar's 30-yard field goal. The latter pass led to the Jets getting a first down after facing a 3rd-and-6 on the Giants' 27-yard line:

Wilson later sliced a 16-yard pass to Keelan Cole on a 3rd-and-9 from the Jets' own 20-yard line:

As Pro Football Focus noted Wilson was 2-of-2 on throws of 10-plus yards (25 yards total).

Andy Vasquez of the Bergen Record summed up Wilson's night:

Overall it was a solid showing for Wilson as he learns on the fly en route to leading the Jets this season.

Giants Offense Struggles in Defeat

There's hope that the Giants can rebound from finishing with the second-fewest points in the league last year especially considering the return of running back Saquon Barkley from a season-ending torn ACL and the additions of wideout Kenny Golladay and Kadarius Toney.

None of those players took part in Saturday's action and the same went for Jones who is about to enter his third NFL season.

Therefore the largely second- and third-string Giants took the field Saturday and they largely struggled.

New York was out-gained 316-163. The Giants also possessed the ball for just 20:11 compared to the Jets' 39:49. Gang Green also had 21 first downs to Big Blue's 11. In addition the Giants went just 2-of-12 on third- and fourth-down opportunities.

Quarterbacks Mike Glennon and Thorson combined to complete just eight of 23 passes for 92 yards and two of those passes encompassed 58 of them.

The running game contributed 16 carries for 105 yards with Sandro Platzgummer gaining 48 of them on one carry. But Corey Clement also fumbled away the ball on the Jets' 3-yard line in the second quarter.

Overall it wasn't a banner night for the offense but that should be taken with a grain of salt given the short-handed roster in the preseason.

What's Next?

The Jets will travel to face the Green Bay Packers next Saturday at 4:25 p.m. at Lambeau Field.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvZ2lhbnRzL2dhbWVkYXkvcmlzZXJzLWFuZC1mYWxsZXJzLWZyb20tbmV3LXlvcmstZ2lhbnRzLTIwMjEtcHJlc2Vhc29uLW9wZW5pbmctbG9zc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Risers and Fallers from New York Giants' 2021 Preseason Opening Loss,"Here are a few players who stood out in the Giants' preseason loss to the Jets...and a few who didn't.

EAST RUTHERFORD N.J. --The New York Giants lost their preseason opener to the New York Jets 12-7 but the game wasn't nearly as close as the score indicated.

Not that it mattered mind you as it's only preseason. But what did matter was that the Giants offense which other than for four-fifths of the starting offensive line sat its starters couldn't get anything going.

Still there were a handful of players who when given the opportunity to shine did so and then there were others who struggled. So without further ado here are the risers and fallers from the Giants' preseason opener.

Risers

WR David Sills V - Receiver David Sills V hasn't played in a game since the 2019 preseason when a broken leg ost him last year. But in his first game action since his injury Sills a hee's done in practice made the most of his opportunities.

Sills finished as the Giants leading receiver catching three out of five pass targets for 49 yards including a big 37-yarder just before the two-minute warning in the first half on a drive the ultimately stalled. Those weren't exactly Victor Cruz-like numbers but Sills continues to make a very strong vase to earn one of the final roster spots at receiver.

NT Danny Shelton - Shelton is not only a large human being but also a mobile and somewhat athletic one who came through on a big 4th-and-1 to drop Jets running back Ty Johnson for a loss of one yard on the Jets first series of the second quarter.

The Giants took over on downs on their own 43-yard line but unfortunately what was shaping up to be a promising drive ended on Corey Clement's fumble.

LB Carter Coughlin - Coughlin put his versatility to good use this evening at both inside and outside linebacker. He finished with five tackles (four solos) including one tackle for a loss. He also recorded a sack and forced a third-quarter fumble while delivering solid edge contain.

The performance was simply a continuation of Coughlin's strong summer in which he admirably filled in for starter Blake Martinez when Martinez was on the reserve/COVI-19 list.

WR Matt Cole - With the Giants in search of a pair of solid punt gunners for the season Cole delivered a nice case when he beat a solo block and managed to stop a punt from going into the end zone also doing a nice job of keeping himself from going into the end zone. Cole also had two assisted tackles on special teams--not bad for a guy who was added to the roster after the start of training camp.

Fallers

OL Kenny Wiggins - Never mind that Wiggins who was filling in for Shane Lemieux as the starting left guard suffered an ankle injury. Simply put Wiggins against different competition had his share of struggles.

He allowed a quarterback pressure and a sack on the Giants opening drive and while he did later redeem himself once the Jets put in their second and third-string defense he suffered the ankle injury.

RB Corey Clement - Clement has drawn rave reviews for being a better and more decisive runner than Devontae Booker this summer. Still this week Clement reminded everyone why the Giants gave a bigger contract to Booker who had three carries for 12 yards.

Clement who has fumbled once every 27.1 regular-season carries in his career lost the handle on the ball deep in the red zone a huge stain on an otherwise impressive showing.

Ask any coach what he values most about ball handlers and they'll tell you the number one characteristic they look for: ball security. Based on this game alone Clement probably didn't cost himself a roster spot but he will unless he cleans that up.

CB Rodarius Williams - The sixth-round rookie has impressed in practice but although he finished as the team leader in tackles with eight (six solos) and had that big fumble recovery off of linebacker Tae Crowder's forced fumble he had his share of struggles in some of his coverage assignments which were inconsistent soft and often confused.

He seemed physically overwhelmed by the abilities of the Jets wideouts whether it was starters or backups. He finally made a first half play with a nice solo tackle to keep a receiver in bounds at the end of the half.

Having given up so many completions it wasn’t surprising to see that he tied for the team lead in tackles with eight. And against the run Williams wasn’t much better failing on several contains and avoiding contact.

The good news is that it’s only one night and there is lots to learn from. We’ll see what this young man is made of in the coming weeks.

We got ""no comment"" responses from Wynn Resorts and Boyd Gaming. At least Boyd was polite about it and we expected more from the Wynn since they were very good to their employees.

The Culinary Union sent back four paragraphs of self-congratulations for the passage of the “right to return” law that gives displaced casino workers first dibs on their old jobs.

Las Vegas Sands was altogether more helpful. “At the insistence of [Sheldon] Adelson the company conducted no furloughs or layoffs” wrote spokesman Ron Reese. “We continued paying and providing benefits for team members throughout shutdowns and slowdowns.” Reese was being too modest. Las Vegas Sands also paid the wages including averaged tips to workers at its restaurants that weren't actual employees of the company. We'd say that per your criteria Venetian/Palazzo should be at or at least near the top of your list.

Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli recently tracked workforce changes at MGM Resorts International and found that 40 percent of its nationwide employee base had been pink-slipped of whom only a fourth or a fifth would be returning to their jobs. At present the company has gone from 70000 to 42000 employees. Speaking generically he wrote “We would note that at present we think Strip labor costs are down 40%-50% versus 2019 levels.” Part of the reason for that is a scenario at Caesars Entertainment that's similar to MGM Resorts'.)

Still to give you an idea of what happened in Las Vegas we’ve constructed the following timeline of employee relations during the Great Shutdown (culled mostly from our own coverage of the issue in Vegas News):

March 17: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas closes but keeps all of its employees on payroll.

April 2: Wynn Resorts discloses that it is cutting executive pay from 30% to 100% to help underwrite 30 days of pay and benefits for its employees later extended to 60 days.

April 4: Las Vegas Sands announces that it is paying the salaries of 1200 indirect employees who work in restaurants that are tenants in The Venetian and Palazzo. Hourly and part-time workers are to receive a stipend.

April 7: Cirque du Soleil sacks 4700 workers 95 percent of its total employee base.

April 10: Boyd Gaming lays off most of its nationwide workforce although it extends health-care benefits through June 30.

April 11: Station Casinos extends pay and benefits to furloughed workers through May 15. The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas meanwhile has laid off workers but will carry their health benefits through June 30.

April 27: Caesars Entertainment initiates an employee-assistance program for individuals facing “unusual hardships.” The program is funded by donations from Caesars execs and board members. Caesars also commits to extend pay and benefits through June 30.

May 2: MGM Resorts International is reported to have termed four hotel presidents as the number of furloughed employees at the company reaches 63000.

May 3: South Point lays off its employees for an “indefinite period.” Owner Michael Gaughan tells the workers they will “be better off” applying for unemployment benefits than looking to the casino for assistance. Health benefits are extended through July 31.

May 7: MGM extends health-care subsidies through August 31 but warns that six-month furloughs could become permanent. Wynn Resorts extends pay and benefits for idled workers by an additional 15 days.

May 14: Rampart Casino gives all its employees the boot via a pre-recorded phone message.

May 19: Colorado Belle in Laughlin closes for good throwing 400 workers onto the unemployment rolls.

July 23: A dark day. Wynncore announces additional layoffs although benefits are extended through October 31. Circus Circus owner Phil Ruffin pink-slips 252 workers but Tropicana Las Vegas outdoes him by eliminating 620 positions.

July 28: MGM lays off most of its entertainment staff.

July 30: Las Vegas Sands extends pay and benefits an additional 90 days.

That covers the worst of it. We’ll leave it to you to decide which casinos to patronize or to avoid.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDQ5NzYvbW92ZS1vdmVyLXBhcmlzLTExLXBpY2Fzc28td29ya3Mtd29ydGgtMTA0LW1pbGxpb27SAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbmV3cy10cmVuZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQ0OTc2L21vdmUtb3Zlci1wYXJpcy0xMS1waWNhc3NvLXdvcmtzLXdvcnRoLTEwNC1taWxsaW9u?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Picasso works are being auctioned off in Las Vegas,"The 11 Picasso paintings sculptures and drawings were originally collected by former casino mogul Steve Wynn. He sold his Mirage Resorts business to MGM in 2000 and later exited the casino industry (and his second venture Wynn Resorts) in 2018 following allegations of sexual assault and harassment – which he denies – and has kept a low profile ever since.

One of the most anticipated art sales of the season won’t take place in a fusty Parisian auction house or Manhattan’s Upper East Side – instead MGM Resorts will auction off a collection of Picasso works valued up to US$104 million in a Las Vegas casino.

Sotheby’s one of the world’s largest brokers of fine art  will travel to Las Vegas for the event. The Wall Street Journal reported that this will be the first time Sotheby’s has hosted an auction outside of major art hubs such as London and New York.

MGM told the Journal that the auction is part of the resort’s shift toward contemporary art and works “by women and artists of colour”.

The Picassos originally bought by Wynn are on display in the Bellagio Hotel & Casino’s themed restaurant Picasso where the average meal costs around US$132.

The auction’s most expensive works include a 1938 portrait of Picasso’s mistress called Femme au Béret Rouge-Orange which is expected to bring in at least US$20 million. A six-foot (1.8-metre) portrait titled Homme et Enfant is projected to sell for a similarly high price.

MGM told the Journal that the auction may demonstrate whether collectors are willing to associate themselves with Wynn’s collection. However the resort said it is not intentionally severing itself from Wynn adding that the former exec “played a pivotal role” in curating the resort’s artwork.

MGM Resorts and Wynn Fine Art did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Two of the most prominent live music venues on the Las Vegas Strip the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay and Brooklyn Bowl at the Linq Promenade are expected to require ticket-holders to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test beginning October 4. Concert giant Live Nation adjusted its policy on Friday and will require the same of all artists crew and attendees at its festivals and venues across the country.

In Las Vegas Live Nation is one of the largest concert and live entertainment event promoters operating those two popular theaters and partnering with Caesars Entertainment to run residency shows at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood as well as with MGM Resorts for events at Park Theater among other shows on and off the Strip. Casino-owned and operated venues like those big residency rooms fall outside of Live Nation’s policies but the company said it has developed best practices for artists to request the policies at third party venues.

Live Nation previously announced it would be up to its artists to enforce the mandates but instituted the stricter guidelines for shows this fall where permitted by law due to the continued spread of the Delta variant. Its recent Lollapalooza festival in Chicago where attendees were required to show proof of vaccination or negative test was considered successful in avoiding superspreader status and a Live Nation spokesperson told Rolling Stone 12% of fans said the festival was the reason they were vaccinated.

Other entertainment companies and Las Vegas events and venues recently announced similar policies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hdnMuY29tL2JhcmVhLWNvYWNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J.J. Barea: 'I like coaching. Every time I do it I like it even more' - The Official Home of the Dallas Mavericks,"LAS VEGAS – Walking away from basketball as a player is a difficult moment for any player.

For J.J. Barea though the future is so bright that he can move on to the next part of his career with satisfaction and a smile.

“It is tough but my career was amazing” Barea said Sunday while working at the MGM Resorts Summer League in a yet-to-be-defined role with the Mavericks. “I don’t regret anything. I’m still playing in the pro league in Puerto Rico. But if I got to walk away from playing right now I’ll be super-happy. I don’t regret anything and I’m ready for the next step if you know what I mean. I’m super-happy with what I did and I’m looking forward to coaching in the future.”

Key words there are “in the future.”

Barea has met with Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison and they have agreed Barea will work for the Mavericks.

In what capacity remains to be ironed out. But Barea said his coaching career will be launched with the Mavericks.

“I know I like coaching” he said. “Every time I do it I like it even more. It comes easy comes natural. Especially here in Dallas. And especially with Dallas. It’s my home. The Dallas Mavericks are my team. I feel like I can really help.”

As for what the role will be Barea and the team both are willing to be flexible. For the moment he said the game plan is to be with the team part time spending some time with his family and mixing in coaching scouting and doing whatever else the staff needs of him.

“I’m going to be involved someway somehow” he said. “We’re working on exactly what it is. I’m going to come and go but when I’m in I’m going to be helping players. I’m going to be around the coaches get experience keep learning and help the players as much as I can.

“And then we’re going to figure out if I’ll do a little scouting when I’m away. We’ll work out those details pretty soon. But I had a great meeting with Nico.”

Barea came out to the summer league for the weekend. He wanted to meet with the coaches sit through the meetings and see what that end of the business is like behind closed doors.

He’s seeing all the things that players don’t normally get to take part in.

“It’s good that I came” he said. “You need to know if you really want to spend time doing this. And I like it. It comes naturally.

“I wanted to meet with everyone wanted to be around. I met with the coaches this morning and I like being with them. It’s good for me to be involved but have my time to take a little break too enjoy my kids a little bit and then later in the future get back to it.”

Barea has come away impressed with his early impressions of the Jason Kidd era as the Mavericks’ coach.

While Kidd has been in Europe tending to other Maverick matters his fingerprints and the style of play he wants are evident with the summer-league team.

“I like what we’re doing everything new that we’re doing” Barea said. “So I want to stay involved so they know in the future in a couple years if I want to go into it full time I’ll go into it full time.

“Right now I think the next couple years are going to be more about getting experience staying around the game as much as I can keep learning and when the time is right get back into it full time.”

Barea spent 11 of his 14 seasons with the Mavericks and played last season in Spain an experience which he said was very fulfilling.

But his heart was always with returning to the Mavericks and the feeling was mutual.

“One of the blessings we have with the Mavericks is we have just a great rich tradition of our former players being welcome to come back and be part of what we do” said summer-league coach Greg St. Jean. “Getting J.J. here has obviously been really beneficial for him but I enjoy having him on the bench having another high-level basketball mind to help talk to our players. We got a really good summer-league staff and we just bolstered it.

“We’ve had guys from that 2011 championship team come in and help these young men. So being a Maverick is something that goes far beyond just wearing this logo. You’re here for life so those guys are always welcome to come help us.”

CrossBar Inc. is setting its sights on security with its resistive RAM (ReRAM).

The company will apply its technology for use in hardware security applications in the form of ReRAM-based cryptographic physical unclonable function (PUF) keys that can be generated in secure computing applications. This is a departure from its usual use as non-volatile semiconductor memory said CEO Mark Davis in a telephone interview with EE Times and opens new markets for CrossBar’s technology.

A PUF is a physical object that for a given input and conditions otherwise known as a “challenge” provides a physically defined “digital fingerprint” output that acts as a unique identifier most often for a semiconductor device such as a microprocessor. PUF keys aren’t new but online banking and the emergence of the Internet of the things (IoT) have created opportunities beyond digital security for dedicated electronic devices such as banking cards or payment terminals. The increased need for encryption or a digital signature means an increasing number of ASICs microcontrollers and SoCs are embedding hardware cryptographic accelerators or software cryptographic libraries.

Traditionally PUF keys have employed SRAM but in comparison ReRAM offers many advantages including a higher level of randomness and much lower bit error rate said Davis. It’s also more resistant to invasive attacks and can handle a wide range of environmental variations without needing fuzzy extractors helper data or heavy error correction code. Overall he said it’s more cost effective than SRAM he said. “With our approach it’s very error free.”

In addition to addressing the limitations of PUF implementations said Davis a ReRAM PUF is also ideal for semiconductor applications that require both high security and embedded non-volatile memory (NVM) especially for foundry nodes smaller than 28nm where embedded NVM is not readily available.

Depending on the specific implementation these PUF keys can be implemented using either a single ReRAM cell or a dual ReRAM cell each representing a single PUF bit. When the ReRAM PUF bit is sensed it’s observed as randomly either a “1” or “0” for each PUF bit on each semiconductor. If an IoT chip has fabricated 256 ReRAM PUF bits each individual manufactured part will contain a 256-bit key unique to that specific semiconductor chip.

Davis sees there being strong market for ReRAM PUF keys given there are so many connected autonomous devices today. “The attack surface is so much larger and hardware security is the most robust way of doing things.” The ReRAM will be used for identification encryption/decryption and authentication and each one is unique to each individual semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) leveraging the inherent randomness characteristics of the ReRAM technology he said. “It’s important to have completely random keys that meet industry standard tests for randomness.” The other critical characteristic is that the PUF is unclonable.

There has been an uptick in demand for memory-specific security that’s embedded into the hardware because hackers need only a single vulnerability to access a complex system. It’s not only IoT that’s driving the need for device security but also connected vehicles where security is a contributor to reliability and functional safety.

Despite this trend the PUF market isn’t going to be a huge one. Jim Handy principal analyst with Objective Analysis said it will make CrossBar some money but physically a PUF is usually a relatively small element of something bigger such as an SoC. “It might be worth a nickel on a chip that’s worth $30.” In the near term ReRAM PUFs will find themselves in higher end applications he said but eventually there could be a market for using them in chips for credit cards. “That’s going to take a decade or longer to fall into place if that happens. For now it’s just going to go into more high-end chips where they’ve got a need to do fancy security between chips.”

There are other memory technologies out there that might be able to offer similar security features Handy added such as EEPROM. There is EEPROM available today that can easily encrypt sensitive data such as passwords cloning hashes fingerprint data and other biometric data.

Microchip Technology’s recently announced family of I2C Serial EEPROMs starting with the 24CS512 includes the legacy feature of only allowing locking or unlocking the entire memory array via an external pin but also divides the memory array into 8 different zones and provides the ability to individually write protect any combination of zones via software. A smaller section of critical code such as factory calibration settings manufacturing data MAC addresses or other identifying information programmed and then set to read-only with a new Lockable ID page feature a 128-byte memory space separate from the main array.

Other technologies include IP from companies such as Spansion and Cypress now a part of Infineon. Infineon’s Semper Secure is a NOR Flash option that serves as a hardware root-of-trust while also performing diagnostics and data correction for functional safety. It provides up to eight memory regions that can be provisioned for secured or non-secured access with one configurable to have different sizes its own access level and associated keys with multiple access.

PUFs do have challenges too noted Handy including stability which can be temperature and power supply dependent. “It’s got to be very stable but it has to be different from chip to chip.”

In response to calls for greener engineering aircraft manufacturers and suppliers have sought viable methods for reducing emissions.

The relationship between hydraulic power and fuel consumption has thus been increasingly scrutinized. Accordingly a partnership between Microchip and Clean Sky has birthed a new family of baseless power modules explicitly made for aircraft electrical systems.

These modules aim to usher in next-generation systems based on efficiency and compactness; however before jumping into this new family it's essential to understand why the movement towards greener aviation is so important.

The Demand for Greener Aviation

Most of today's commercial airliners are hybridized systems comprised of both mechanical and electrical components.

Examples of electric propulsion systems. Image used courtesy of IATA

The pneumatics and hydraulics found within most planes power several critical in-flight systems most notably alternators actuators and auxiliary power units (APUs).

These parts enable a number of functions including:

Flight-control surface adjustments related to elevators rudders flaps landing gear thrust and more

Supplying power to vital electronics and charging the battery and

Power generation for avionics engine starts and other electrical systems while the plane is idling or encounters an emergency.

The existence of these components is non-negotiable for safe flight and reliable operation. However that functionality comes with a cost. One Boeing 747 consumes one gallon of fuel per second while in flight; additionally 57 million flights littered the skies worldwide last year.

Regardless of how fuel expenditures per traveler are calculated passenger aircraft expel a fair amount of CO 2  roughly 915 million tons in fact in 2019. That amount accounts for about 12% of all transportation-based CO 2 emissions and approximately 2% of all human-caused emissions.

Despite the growing levels of emissions and the global push for change it is widely recognized throughout the industry that complete engine electrification isn't imminent. Accordingly some believe that airplane manufacturers won't significantly electrify aircraft engines until 2050 largely due to uncertainties over battery technologies.

Consequently engineers and companies like Microchip and Clear Sky have recognized that component-level design must make adjacent improvements until engines catch up.

Introducing the BL Family of Modules

Incoming electrical systems in planes will require some changes if they're to replace mechanical components. One area of interest is power conversion.

Existing airplanes have two primary electrical circuits and an alternate circuit. These alternating currents feed into a transformer rectifier unit (TRU) which converts them to DC. These AC and DC currents are routed throughout the plane to receiver busses thus powering the specialized components tied to them.

At this moment it isn't feasible to replace many moving parts in the power generation system. However Microchip's BL1 BL2 and BL3 baseless power modules could be a step in the right direction.

Each semiconductor boosts AC/DC (and vice versa) conversion efficiency and power generation; their silicon carbide construction is also 40% lighter than market alternatives. All three devices meet Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) guidelines and Microchip claims that they're 10% cheaper than metal-baseplate modules.

In addition to those features they're also low profile which is critical within a complex densely packed electrical system.

Designers can easily solder them onto printed circuit boards especially since soldiered connections are less susceptible to cracking and deformation during high-wattage temperature cycling. They're also more performant when operating at higher temperatures thanks to improved heatsinking.

Since all three modules are the same height it's easier for them to be paralleled into a three-phase bridge as well as other topologies to create higher-performing power inverters and converters.

A final key feature is their low inductance or rather the chip's tendency not to oppose changes in electrical currents passing through its circuitry. The BL family's lowered inductance thus equates to higher power density.

Despite the overall features already covered thus far the next section will briefly outline even more key specifications.

Quick Specifications

The BL module family is MOSFET by design and changing voltages determine how each semiconductor conducts electricity.

An example overview of the MSCSM120AM31CTBL1NG a baseless SiC MOSFET module included in the BL1 family. Image used courtesy of Microchip [Datasheet PDF]

It's the most common transistor in digital circuits today and the technology excels at either switching or amplifying incoming signals.

Additionally Schottky barrier diodes are incorporated to increase efficiency in the 100 W to 10 kW range.

They’re available in the following configurations:

Phase leg

Full bridge

Asymmetric bridge

Boost

Buck

Dual common source

MOSFETs and IGBTs in the family operate at ranges from 600V to 1200V while accompanying rectifier diodes operate at up to 1600V. They're tailor-made to complement other Microchip aerospace technologies like drive controllers storage ICs FPGAs microcontrollers microprocessors and more.

While this family hopes to open the door for future cleaner technology there is still a lot more electronics and design that needs to be done.

Pursuing a Cleaner Future

Without a doubt Microchip's efforts have stemmed from increased demands for aircraft modernization. There's a significant push to electrify aircraft and decrease their collective environmental footprint especially as air travel grows cheaper and more popular with annual flights increasing worldwide for over a decade now.

There's an acknowledgment that change will be gradual for the time being. However companies like Microchip (and especially EU bodies) have committed to developing transitional technologies for the decades to come. It will be interesting to see what technology comes out on both the component level and in the case of large-scale system design.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJydXNzZWxzdGltZXMuY29tLzE4MTI0NS9taWNyb2NoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2Utc2h1dHMtZG93bi12b2x2by1pbi1naGVudC1mb3ItdGhyZWUtZGF5c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microchip shortage shuts down Volvo in Ghent for three days,"The shortage in microchips heavily impacted the production of electric vehicles. Credit: Belga

The worldwide shortage of microchips means that the Volvo Cars factory in Ghent will shut down on Monday Thursday and Friday next week putting 5000 employees on temporary unemployment.

The shortage of chips is a result of the coronavirus pandemic. When the virus first struck in 2020 many factories cut back on production and the problem was made worse by the fact that much of the world’s production comes from China.

The shortage will not be rapidly taken care of: forecasts are that the backlog in orders could take years to be worked out.

In the meantime the technical advances in motorcar technology mean that the industry is utterly reliant on chips to manufacture its product. The problem is about to filter down into the repair sector as well if it hasn’t already.

Volvo Gent has already suffered five days of shutdown in the first half of this year. This time around about 5000 of the 6000 people who work there will be on temporary unemployment.

That is a mechanism that can be called upon by employers when in cases of force majeure or circumstances beyond their control workers have to be temporarily laid off work.

In that case the government pays an allowance based on a percentage of normal earnings but not counting extras like overtime or weekend hours – which form an important part of a factory worker’s income.

""That's not good news"" said Volvo spokesperson Barbara Blomme. “The production of an average of 1000 cars per day will again come to a standstill. But we are not alone. This is a global problem and we are only one of the players affected.”

Other Volvo factories are affected but the one in Ghent turns out high-tech models like the XC40 which are more dependent than conventional vehicles on supplies of chips.

“Our electric models do indeed contain a great many of those components” said Blomme. “The average car contains at least a hundred microchips. That number goes up in an electric car.”

In other Belgian plants De Tijd reports shutdowns have happened for example at Volvo Trucks in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe in Brussels and the heavy goods division of Audi.

At Audi’s car plant in Brussels meanwhile the workers are on summer break until 23 August but the third quarter is expected to be ‘volatile and tense’ a company spokesperson said.

There too the possibility of shutdowns is not being excluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE0L2RlYnVua2luZy1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLW15dGhzLWFuZC1saWVzLWZyb20tZHVtYi10by1kYW5nZXJvdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Debunking COVID vaccine myths and lies from dumb to dangerous,"COVID-19 vaccines work but try telling that to half the country.

Millions of Americans are choosing to ignore reliable research instead relying on faux Faucis spewing pseudo-science on their own misinformation superhighway.

And it’s killing people.

The World Health Organization deems vaccine hesitancy to be among the biggest threats to global health. Coronavirus vaccine falsehoods carry particular dangers said Dr. Stephanie Sterling chief of infectious diseases at NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn.

“They’re dangerous because they are feeding into the fear and anxiety that this pandemic continues to cause” she told the Daily News noting that the more people who contract COVID the more chances it has to mutate. Getting vaccinated reduces the chance that “we’ll get something worse than the delta variant. Something worse could very well ignore all the vaccines.”

Many people are hampered by the logistics of taking time off work finding child care and getting to a vaccine site. Still others have legitimate questions but are not sure where to find the answers.

People flock Sixth Avenue near Radio City Music Hall. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that every event going forward at the iconic New York City venue will require attendees to be fully vaccinated. Radio City Music Hall will host Tribeca’s closing night on June 19 before a full capacity 100% vaccinated mask-free audience Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday.

“Most of the hesitation is honestly just kind of distrust in how quickly everything has been evolving and I think not having a good sense of where to get trustworthy information from” Sterling told the Daily News.

Queens – December 14 2020 – Northwell Health Director of Employee Health Services Dr. Michelle Chester holds a small bottle containing 5 doses of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine after applying on Dr. Yves Duroseau the second person in New York State to receive the vaccine at the Hospital in Queens.

A sizable number though adhere to theories that simply have no basis in reality. Why are so many dying while denying that COVID even exists?

The myths themselves range from the ridiculous to the blatantly untrue to misconstrued and distorted facts.

Many of the biggest disseminators of vaccine misinformation online are entrepreneurs themselves — making money off people’s vaccine hesitancy — as the Center for Countering Digital Hate documented in demonstrating that 65% of online misinformation comes from just 12 people.

Still others are politicians using the pandemic to drive a further wedge between blue and red voters. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene a Georgia Republican was banned from Twitter for a week on Monday for spewing nonsense about vaccines and masks not working. Likewise Sen. Rand Paul a Kentucky Republican was taken down from YouTube for saying that masks don’t work.

Demonstrators gather outside Flathead High School to protest the Kalispell School District’s face mask requirement on March 9 2021 in Kalispell Mont. Local school boards around the country are increasingly becoming cauldrons of anger and political division boiling with disputes over such issues as COVID-19 mask rules the treatment of transgender students and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America.

Here is a list of the biggest coronavirus and vaccine myths and the impediments they bring to curbing this public health crisis that has killed more than 600000 people in the U.S. alone since early 2020.

Myth: Some COVID shots will turn people into chimpanzees.

Truth: Um no. Facebook just last week dismantled a viral disinformation network headquartered in Russia removing hundreds of accounts that were convincing social media influencers to push phony claims such as this one about coronavirus vaccines.

Myth: Coronavirus vaccines make you magnetic.

Truth: This one tops the CDC’s myth list. It’s physically impossible the agency points out as the vaccines contain exactly zero magnetic compounds. For those who don’t trust the nation’s top health agency the proponents of the theory could not themselves prove its veracity.

Myth: The COVID vaccine implants a microchip that nefarious tech billionaires specifically Microsoft founder Bill Gates will use to track people.

Truth: This one has been the butt of many a late-night comedic monologue but the traction it still seems to have has stymied many — not least of all Gates. It has been debunked by everyone from the Mayo Clinic on down.

“You have a cellphone and you’re on social media” said Chrysalis Wright an associate lecturer in the psychology department of the University of Central Florida who focuses on understanding the allure of misinformation and so-called fake news. “They’re already tracking you based on your own reasoning.”

Two mass promoters of this one are Ty and Charlene Bollinger “anti-vax entrepreneurs who run a network of accounts that market books and DVDs about vaccines cancer and COVID-19” said the Center for Countering Online Digital Hate in a recent report. The Bollingers have promoted the conspiracy theory that Gates plans to inject everyone with microchips as part of a vaccination program the report says.

The only chip idea that Gates has backed so far is that of a birth control device that would be implanted under a woman’s skin — with her consent and knowledge — and automatically release hormones as BBC News reported in 2014.

Myth: The vaccine will alter your DNA.

Truth: Vaccines based on mRNA teach our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response but the mRNA (“m” stands for messenger) never enters the cell’s nucleus which is where the DNA resides the CDC explains. In fact after delivering the instructions it breaks down almost immediately. Likewise a “viral vector” vaccine takes a modified version of a different virus and uses it to deliver immune-response instructions to a cell — again never coming into contact with one’s DNA.

Myth: Vaccines — any vaccines — cause autism.

Truth: This has been a fear since long before COVID. It has been traced back to a since-debunked study by Andrew Wakefield a British surgeon whose license was later yanked. The study published in the esteemed journal The Lancet was taken down after severe procedural irregularities were noted. In addition no one was ever able to duplicate his results.

Myth: The COVID vaccine can impair fertility make you infertile entirely or cause a woman to miscarry.

Truth: This may stem from the apparent mixed messages when the vaccine was approved for emergency use. It wasn’t recommended for pregnant women University of Central Florida’s Wright pointed out but only because it hadn’t yet been tested on them. Since then enough evidence has come in to convince medical experts that the vaccine is not only safe for pregnant or would-be pregnant women but also will help ward off severe illness. The CDC last week urged pregnant women to get the shot.

Myth: Vaccines make you sick can give you COVID and have uncertain long-term side effects.

Truth: Any immediate side effects from the vaccine are short-lived and do not actually constitute illness from the vaccine. The symptoms are one’s immune response and mean that your body is making the antibodies that will fight off the real thing.

Myth: The vaccines were rapidly developed and tested and therefore their safety cannot be trusted.

Truth: Years of research went into developing the mRNA technology underlying the Pfizer and Moderna shots as The Associated Press reported extensively last December.

“The emergency situation warranted an emergency response but that does not mean that companies bypassed safety protocols or didn’t perform adequate testing” the Mayo Clinic said on its website.

This may stem in part from the dubbing of last year’s vaccine effort as “Operation Warp Speed” said Jay Van Bavel an assistant professor of psychology and neural science at New York University telling the Daily News “It was a PR decision rather than a way to frame something you wanted to build confidence in.”

Myth: The fact that the vaccines only have emergency use authorization means they’re experimental — and possibly unsafe.

Truth: When the vaccines were approved for emergency use exhaustive trials had already been conducted. In addition both Van Bavel and Wright believe that full authorization which is most likely on tap for the coming weeks will give some vaccine-hesitant people the confidence to go forward with the jab.

Myth: Someone who has already had coronavirus is immune.

Truth: This is inaccurate on two counts. For one the body’s immune response is not as strong as the one the vaccines help create. Second the vaccine has been shown to improve the symptoms of long-haul COVID patients who continue to suffer long after the infection itself has cleared.

Myth: The virus is not dangerous; it’s more like the flu. Moreover the entire pandemic is a hoax.

Truth: Many of the people who have said that are dead.

The COVID landscape is littered with grieving loved ones. Among the casualties are a Texas pastor who preached that coronavirus was a wake-up call for fornicating sinners; a conservative radio talk show host who spent June telling people not to get the vaccine and July dying from it and a man who famously said he had “99 problems but a vax ain’t one.”

A Texas politician also succumbed earlier this month five days after posting an anti-vax meme. There was also the Ohio man who called the coronavirus lockdown a political ploy before taking ill then dying. His widow later said they had been mistaken.

For some it is too late. One Alabama doctor made a poignant social media post revealing she tells grieving family members the hard truth that the best way for them to honor their departed loved one would be to get vaccinated themselves

But not everyone gets the message. Last August the Twitter account of businessman Tea Party activist and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain posted “It looks like the virus is not as deadly as the mainstream media first made it out to be.”

Advances in technology promise to improve horse welfare and traceability as the equestrian world moves into the digital age.

Knowing where horses are and what happens to them throughout their lives has always been inseparable from equine welfare and traceability is in the spotlight more than ever before. Brexit travel implications the Covid pandemic and equine herpes virus (EHV) outbreaks plus concerning allegations raised in Panorama (news 29 July) have heightened awareness as to why traceability is key.

The FEI’s HorseApp Weatherbys ePassport and EquiTrace are among the latest developments improving how horses’ movements and health are monitored from paper-based systems.

From this year all thoroughbred foals born in Britain and Ireland will be issued with a Weatherbys ePassport. In a nutshell this is a secure place to keep all legally required details. Its vaccination and horse location records were already in use prior to the full official launch in July to track breeding stock and support British and Irish authorities with their pandemic “return to racing” protocols.

Weatherbys chief executive Russell Ferris told H&H that the ePassport’s launch “couldn’t be more timely”.

“Equine welfare is quite rightly the priority for anyone involved with horses and the ePassport gives them the mechanism to manage everything relating to equine identification health welfare movement and ownership through a simple-to-use single secure platform” he said.

“As if the welfare benefits brought by the Weatherbys ePassport were not enough many in the equine world are also looking to the ePassport to ease European horse movement post-Brexit – particularly when it comes to interoperability between it and Government systems. As many in the equine world have said the importance of the ePassport cannot be overstated.”

The FEI updated its HorseApp in April to monitor horse health and movements and help with a safe return to sport following EHV-1 outbreaks. This means grooms riders and owners can easily check horses in and out from venues and upload any other health information as required.

“[The FEI HorseApp] is a key element in ensuring a safe return to competition today and in minimising the impact of a disease outbreak in future” said FEI veterinary director Göran Åkerström at the time.

‘What isn’t measured isn’t done’

“Our mission is to get horse identification and health care into the digital age” EquiTrace app co-founder and vet Jennifer Corley told H&H.

The subscription app on which more than 19500 horses are registered works by securely storing a horse’s ID location health and medical records. Information can only be added to a horse’s record when his microchip is scanned at which point his GPS location is also updated. It is compatible with any microchip works with or without signal and means a groom can update the app and the horse’s owner trainer and vets have access to up-to-date records from anywhere in the world.

“Covid has taught us all this: if you get an infectious disease like herpes like influenza the first thing you have to do is trace all those movements and yet [people aren’t] keeping those records because it’s just impossible with the current solutions” said Ms Corley.

EquiTrace has a function to turn on alerts for medication and vaccination reminders plus withdrawal times and drug barcodes can be scanned by the app so details and batch numbers are accurately recorded. This saves admin time and also means it can be used by anyone so literacy is not a barrier.

“The health record is linked to the microchip so essentially the horse’s medical records can never be lost they’re always with the animal” she said adding that this function could benefit all kinds of scenarios where a horse and the owner are in different places from emergency vet visits to loaning or rehoming.

“At the moment when you rehome an animal there’s almost no way to check up on that animal without physically going out to visit” she said.

“Even [for a charity] just going through your list to call every single rehomed animal is going to be almost impossible. You could ask somebody who’s rehoming an animal to take a scanner and then you have complete control on whatever you want to check up on. You could say ‘I want the animal vaccinated once a year’ and then we can set the system so it creates a list of anyone who’s not complying.”

She added: “Whatever we do to improve horse welfare what isn’t measured isn’t done. And we have to have a way to easily communicate from the people on the ground who are looking after the horses to these organisations who are responsible for their welfare – and it has to be simple.”

All apps are available from the Apple and Android stores.

Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs split over future course of Korean chipmakers



By Park Jae-hyuk



Last week two of the top U.S.-based investment banks ― Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs ― published reports showing rather contrasting views for the global semiconductor industry.



Titled ""Memory ― Winter is Coming"" Morgan Stanley cut its target on Samsung Electronics ordinary shares (ORDs) to 89000 won ($76) from 98000 won as the report warned of a rather tough chip-pricing environment heading into next year.



Despite Samsung Electronics' repeated confidence over the continued tight supply of memory chips the Morgan Stanley report directly hit investor sentiment as ORDs at Samsung and SK hynix plummeted. It hugely cut its target on SK hynix to 80000 won from 156000 won.



Morgan Stanley's abrupt skepticism contradicted its previous week's report that recommended investors stay ""overweight"" leading foreign investors to massively unload their holdings in the world's top two memory chipmakers throughout last week.



But unlike Morgan Stanley's stance which triggered massive unloading of the world's No. 3 memory chipmaker ― Micron Technology ― Goldman Sachs maintained its optimistic targets on Samsung Electronics at 107000 won and SK hynix at 177000 won with expectations of a limited decline in global DRAM prices next year.



Their contrasting reports harken back to similar events in 2017.



Industry experts said Sunday that the reports reflect a similar situation four years ago.



In November 2017 Morgan Stanley lowered its target on Samsung Electronics ORDs claiming prices for NAND-type flash memory chips would go down and the electronics company would not see gains the following year. After the report Samsung Electronics shares fell 5 percent in a single trading day knocking off 18 trillion won in market capitalization.



At the time Goldman Sachs analyst Daiki Takayama refuted Morgan Stanley's view.



""Excessive concerns over the cycle of memory chips in the semiconductor industry were affecting the stock price"" he said in a report. ""We see the current price as an attractive opportunity to buy shares. We have found no factors to make a change in our positive recommendation on Samsung Electronics.""



In 2018 both Samsung Electronics and SK hynix posted record-high earnings as Goldman Sachs expected.



Industry experts also regard the recent concern as inaccurate given that the Korean chipmakers have already signed large-scale contracts to supply memory chips to their clients until the end of the year. This means the long-term fixed prices of DRAMs will remain stable for a while.



""Samsung Electronics SK hynix Micron and other major memory producers have limited inventories and production bottlenecks are deepening"" Yuanta Securities analyst Lee Jae-yun said in a report. ""The chances are slim for memory chip prices to drop sharply.""



While increased chip price volatility has been cited as one variable factor inventory levels for Samsung and SK remain tight said company officials. Plus demand for premium chips for use in corporate servers and high-end mobile devices will rise until next year offsetting the effects of the decline in conventional PC DRAM chips.

Here's what you need to know about boosters for all,"CNN —

Vaccine makers are preparing for a next possible phase of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout: booster doses.

The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday authorized third doses of both the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines for certain immunocompromised people: solid organ transplant recipients or “those who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise.”

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has signed off on the authorization and now recommends an additional dose of vaccine for these certain people.

But these doses will be considered part of the initial vaccination series for people who have not mounted an adequate immune response. A booster dose is something different. It helps refresh a waning immune response or helps the body fight an evolving pathogen.

The companies Pfizer and BioNTech said Monday they have submitted data from a Phase 1 study to the FDA supporting the use of a third or booster dose of their Covid-19 vaccine. The data showed that the booster dose elicited a significantly higher antibody response against the initial strain of the coronavirus as well as against the Delta and Beta variants compared to what was seen among people who got two doses.

“The data we’ve seen to date suggest a third dose of our vaccine elicits antibody levels that significantly exceed those seen after the two-dose primary schedule. We are pleased to submit these data to the FDA as we continue working together to address the evolving challenges of this pandemic” Albert Bourla Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive officer said in the announcement.

And many Americans who aren’t now eligible for an additional shot are wondering when it will be their turn.

Who is eligible for an additional shot now?

The CDC said immunocompromised people are more likely to get breakthrough infections than people with healthy immune systems and the recommendation on Friday allows certain immunocompromised people to get a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine.

“This EUA is intended to be for people with moderate to severe immunosuppression and not persons with chronic conditions for which there might be mild associated immunosuppression” the CDC’s Dr. Amanda Cohn told the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

The third doses were recommended for immunocompromised people as young as 12 who are included in Pfizer’s EUA. People as young as 18 can get a third dose of Moderna’s vaccine. The CDC urges people to get the same vaccine they got originally.

There’s not enough data to discuss the possibility of an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot Covid-19 vaccine the FDA said.

The CDC said patients and doctors should decide who needs an extra dose and what the timing of that dose should be. No prescription or doctor’s note will be needed – people must attest to their need for the third dose – and third doses are already available at major pharmacies and doctors’ offices.

What about boosters for everyone?

Covid-19 vaccine boosters are not currently needed for the general US population but the administration is checking the data daily and will be ready if that changes US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Thursday.

“We’re trying to understand if there’s a decrease in protection that’s manifesting as a significant increase in breakthrough infections particularly breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths” Murthy told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

Murthy said the administration is looking at data from pharmaceutical companies private health care systems and other countries including the UK Israel and Canada.

“We look at that data very regularly closely. When we see the threshold met that’s when we’ll recommend boosters for additional people” Murthy said. “That’s an if question. It’s a when question and the data is going to drive our decision on that.”

However the Biden administration is expected to lay out a Covid-19 vaccine booster strategy for all vaccinated Americans in September – with possible details on a phased rollout starting with the most vulnerable.

National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins acknowledged on Fox News Sunday that boosters may be needed “maybe beginning first with health care providers as well as people in nursing homes and then gradually moving forward.”

The US can look to Covid-19 vaccination in Israel for an idea of what may need to be considered a month or so in the future Andy Slavitt former White House Covid-19 adviser said Thursday. Israel has authorized Covid-19 vaccine booster doses for adults older than 50 becoming one of the first countries in the world to make such a move.

“Israel began their vaccination process a little bit ahead of us so I think in many respects we’ve been looking to them – and to a certain extent the UK – for what we can expect as well as the people who participated in the original clinical trials of the vaccines in 2020” Slavitt told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday. “Those three things together generally speaking give us a sense of what to predict for the future.”

Some researchers and health officials suspect antibodies against coronavirus produced through the vaccines may diminish over time – possibly after a year or more – and may not protect as well against coronavirus variants that could emerge.

In July Israel’s health ministry said in a statement that it had seen efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine drop from more than 90% to about 64% as the B.1.617.2 or Delta variant spread.

That might mean a vaccinated person would need a booster dose of vaccine to stay protected against the original coronavirus strain and newly emerging variants – including the Delta variant – in a way similar to how a tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years or different flu vaccines are recommended each year.

In the case of Covid-19 vaccines it remains unknown for how long immune protection lasts but vaccine developers and health officials know it may not be forever – and that emerging variants could evade immunity.

“There is a little nuance with Covid-19 vaccines” Dr. William Moss professor and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told CNN in May.

While typical booster doses use the same vaccine formula someone previously received to remind the immune system about immunity to a pathogen Moss said any future boosters for the Covid-19 shot could use altered vaccine formulas.

For instance the companies Pfizer and BioNTech said in a statement that while a third dose of their coronavirus vaccine “has the potential to preserve the highest levels of protective efficacy against all currently tested variants including Delta the companies are remaining vigilant and are developing an updated version of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that targets the full spike protein of the Delta variant.”

What happens if you skip the booster?

Whether booster coronavirus vaccine doses are modified or not missing a booster dose – if one is recommended in the future – could leave someone less protected against Covid-19.

“A person who skipped a booster is placing themselves at higher risk of getting infected and getting disease from the SARS-Coronavirus-2 but I would also expect that they’re going to have some partial immunity and so they may be protected against more severe disease” Moss said in May. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19.

“They’re just at higher risk of infection and disease than someone who got the booster but they have more immunity than someone who was never vaccinated.”

Scientists are also currently investigating whether it makes a difference if someone gets the same type of vaccine as a booster as the original dose administered.

Then there is the question of mixing and matching doses.

Researchers in the United Kingdom reported in May that people who got mixed doses of coronavirus vaccines – receiving a different vaccine type as a second dose than the first dose – appear to be more likely to experience mild side effects such as fever chills fatigue or headache.

But the side effects following mix-and-match vaccinations were short-lived and there were no other safety concerns the researchers reported in the Lancet medical journal.

Who is making booster shots?

All three companies that currently have authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States – Pfizer Moderna and Johnson & Johnson – are investigating the potential use of boosters.

“The data that I see coming they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told Axios in May. “But that remains to be seen and I believe in one two months we will have enough data to speak about it with much higher scientific certainty.”

The first dose of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine in the United States was administered on December 14 2020.

Moderna is currently conducting booster shot trials too.

The fight against the coronavirus pandemic is expected to continue through next year due to the emergence of variants Dr. Stephen Hoge president of Moderna said during an earnings call in early May.

“We think this is just the beginning” Hoge said. “Therefore we’re committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine to add as many variants as we think are necessary to ensure that when people receive a booster it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range of variants.”

Johnson & Johnson is also looking into the potential for boosters the company told CNN.

Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine along with Pfizer’s Moderna’s and four others are being tested as seasonal boosters in a study called Cov-Boost being conducted by the UK’s National Institute for Health Research and the University of Southampton.

The biotechnology company Novavax has developed a coronavirus vaccine that its chief executive officer Stanley Erck believes could be used as a booster shot for people who have already been vaccinated. The company plans to apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Who has to OK the Covid-19 booster shots?

The decision to broadly use Covid-19 boosters is expected to involve two agencies – the FDA and the CDC – and the regulatory process to get the shots into arms could vary depending on whether the booster is the same vaccine that was originally used or is a modified version.

“So if it’s the same vaccine my understanding is that what would have to happen is that the CDC would have to recommend an additional dose with details around when that should occur” Moss said in May.

In other words the FDA must give authorization for the vaccines to be used in new ways outside the existing authorization. Then the CDC advises on whether to actually use the vaccine as authorized by the FDA.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

If it’s a modified vaccine “this is where things get interesting and I don’t think we quite know” Moss said but added that the regulatory process could be similar to what happens with flu vaccines each year.

“Technically whenever a vaccine like that is modified it’s often considered a new vaccine and has to go through the whole process again. But there is a precedent obviously with influenza virus vaccines not to do that” Moss said. “So the influenza vaccine each year doesn’t have to go through a large Phase 3 trial.”

That’s because the vaccine technology stays the same and the only change is the strain of flu virus that the vaccine targets.

How is it determined that someone needs a booster?

There is no definite way to know someone needs an additional dose of coronavirus vaccine – but so far studies on booster doses have measured antibody levels.

Cancer patients who receive the Covid-19 vaccine for example are less likely to develop protective antibodies according to two studies published this week in the journal JAMA Oncology. Antibodies are proteins the body makes to fight infection.

Yet the researchers noted that the test used to detect Covid-19 antibodies does not provide information about T-cell-based immunity or clinical outcomes related to potential Covid-19 infection. T-cells and B-cells are other components of the immune system with immune memory that can protect the body against infection.

In one of those studies researchers in Israel followed up on initial findings showing anti-spike Covid-19 antibody levels were significantly lower among cancer patients 5.5 weeks after the second dose of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine compared to non-cancer patients.

The team looked at 95 cancer patients and 66 control patients from their initial analysis about four months after their second vaccine dose. About 87% of cancer patients and 100% of patients in the control group showed anti-spike antibodies and antibody levels were still significantly lower in the cancer patients. The researchers noted that the median antibody level for both groups decreased over time.

Separately among organ transplant recipient patients in a Johns Hopkins University study who had no measurable antibodies after receiving two doses of vaccine one-third of them saw a rise in antibodies after a third dose – and among those with low antibody levels after two doses all of them saw an increase after a third dose.

Dr. Dorry Segev an author of the study and founder of the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation at Johns Hopkins University told CNN in June that it’s unclear what antibody level provides protective immunity. “We don’t know if you need the same off-the-charts level of antibodies that people with normal immune systems have” he said.

How often will you need a Covid-19 booster?

Some experts predict that a coronavirus vaccine booster dose might be needed annually – but despite such predictions Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said that the bottom line is no one knows yet.

Still the US is prepared for the possibility Fauci said during a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing in August.

Fauci said he believes eventually everyone will need a booster to maintain full protection from the vaccine.

“We are evaluating this on a day by day week by week month by month basis looking at any of a number of studies both international and domestic.” he said.

He added that if it looks like immunity is waning or a variant is evading the protection offered by current vaccines then health officials will be ready to recommend boosters.

Eventually it’s possible that a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine might just be part of the completion of immunization not an annual requirement to revaccinate Dr. Peter Marks director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said last week.

“I don’t think that we want to think that these vaccines have somehow failed us” Marks said at a discussion hosted by the Covid-19 Vaccine Education and Equity Project.

“It may simply be that to get the kind of really good immunity against Covid-19 that we get with some other vaccines it may take a series of three vaccinations much the same way that hepatitis B for adults and multiple childhood vaccination primary series you need to get a vaccination you know 0 1; or 0 2 and 4; or 0 2 and 6 months.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2N2cy1waGFybWFjeS13YWxncmVlbnMtdGhpcmQtY292aWQxOS12YWNjaW5lLWRvc2UtYm9vc3Rlci1zaG90cy8xMDk1MTM2NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS and Walgreens offering 3rd dose of COVID-19 vaccine for those with weakened immune systems,"CVS and Walgreens offering 3rd dose of COVID-19 vaccine for those with weakened immune systems

CVS and Walgreens will start giving third COVID-19 vaccine doses but only for those with weakened immune systems. Here's what to know.

CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens are both now administering COVID-19 booster shots but only for those with weakened immune systems.

It comes after the Food and Drug Administration ruled that transplant recipients and other similarly immune-compromised patients can get a third dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. But the decision offers an extra dose only to those high-risk groups - not the general public.

CVS says people can schedule vaccination appointments on their website.

A spokesperson for the company said those who want the booster shot will also be required to confirm that they are immuno-compromised during the scheduling process as well as when they get the third dose.

Walgreens locations nationwide are also offering the third dose following the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization and the new guidance from the CDC.

Same-day appointments will be available on a walk-in basis at select Walgreens stores.

If you're eligible bring your vaccination record to appointments. You'll also be required to attest to your eligibility.

Here's what else to know about the shots:

WHY DO SOME PEOPLE NEED AN EXTRA DOSE?

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines offer powerful protection for otherwise healthy people but many who take immune-suppressing medications or have diseases that tamp down their immune systems generally get less benefit from the standard two doses. The CDC cited one study suggesting about 40% to 44% of people hospitalized for a so-called breakthrough case - infection after vaccination - are among the immune-compromised.

Those hospitalized patients ""did all the right things -- they're just suffering from a lack of good vaccine protection"" said Dr. Camille Kotton of Massachusetts General Hospital one of CDC's advisers.

WHO QUALIFIES?

Roughly 7 million American adults are classified as immune-compromised but the FDA singled out transplant recipients and others with similar levels of immune suppression. The FDA didn't spell out exactly who falls into those other categories but in new guidance to doctors issued Friday the CDC listed several categories of people who could qualify including people with advanced or untreated HIV infections and those with cancers who are receiving certain chemotherapies.

ARE THERE AGE RESTRICTIONS?

For now the new policy allows a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for children as young as 12 who also meet the high-risk requirement but adults only for a third Moderna dose. That's because the Pfizer vaccine currently is the only authorized option for Americans under 18. That could change if Moderna's vaccine eventually is allowed for teens.

WILL I NEED A DOCTOR'S NOTE OR A BLOOD TEST?

The government isn't requiring either - patients will just need to tell the vaccine provider why they're seeking another dose. ""We would want to make that as easy as possible"" said Dr. William Schaffner an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.

WHAT WILL A THIRD DOSE COST?

Shots given under FDA's emergency use authorization are free.

IS MIX-AND-MATCH ALLOWED?

The government encourages the third dose to be the same as the first two but doesn't mandate it.

HOW WELL DOES A THIRD DOSE WORK?

It helps at least some people. Canadian researchers this week reported 55% of transplant recipients given a third dose two months after standard vaccination had good antibody levels compared to 18% who were given a dummy third shot for comparison. Health experts urged these high-risk patients to continue masking and taking other precautions since there's no guarantee a third dose will work.

WHAT IF A THIRD DOSE STILL DOESN'T WORK?

It's not a substitute for vaccination but the FDA has authorized an antibody treatment as a preventive treatment if high-risk patients are exposed to the virus. And it's critical for family members and others close to fragile patients to be vaccinated.

More research is underway to better tease out whether some immune-compromised patients need still other options such as carefully monitored changes to their medications.

WHAT IF I HAD THE SINGLE-DOSE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE?

There's little data on how another dose works in high-risk people who received that vaccine although it's likely a small number since fewer than 14 million Americans overall have received the J &J shot. Still CDC counts at least 90000 who have gotten another dose on their own.

FDA vaccines chief Dr. Peter Marks said the agency is working to get more information about immune-suppressed J &J patients but that for now the evidence only backs a recommendation of extra doses for Pfizer and Moderna recipients with fragile immune systems.

IS THIS A BOOSTER?

Not really because boosters are for people whose immunity wanes over time and these high-risk groups didn't get enough protection to begin with. They now will qualify for a third dose at least 28 days after their second shot - making a third dose part of their initial prescription. That's similar to how France has handled vaccinations for the immune-compromised since April.

WHAT ABOUT BOOSTERS FOR EVERYONE ELSE?

U.S. health authorities insist it's not yet time for booster doses for the general population.

""We believe sooner or later you will need a booster for durability of protection"" -- but not yet Dr. Anthony Fauci the government's top infectious diseases expert told reporters this week.

The CDC is closely monitoring rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths as well as long-running studies of how often vaccinated health workers experience breakthrough infections especially with the contagious delta variant. That evidence will drive any decision.

The two-shot vaccine is currently only offered to those 18 and older.

“I want to help out other kids’’ Clary said according to the news outlet. “And it’s exciting to be one of the first my age to get the shot.”

He’s a rising fourth-grader from Cicero a northern suburb of Syracuse.

Walker got his shot at an upstate hospital on Wednesday his father Bob Clary told syracuse.com with nothing more than a sore arm and a little disturbed sleep for his troubles.

In just under a month he’s slated to get his second shot.

With his mom dad 14-year-old brother and 12-year-old sister all inoculated as well Walker had no qualms about getting the jab.

“I’m not really worried about it at all’’ he told Syracuse.com. “I don’t want to get COVID.”

His older brother Jack did the trial last year his dad told The Post. “And we showed both of them the opportunity based on some information our pediatrician had posted” he said.

“[Walker] like most kids struggled being at home and not school last year so I think he also knows this is an opportunity to help make sure kids across the country stay in school and sports” he dad added.

Clary got his shot at Upstate University Hospital in Kirkville as part of Moderna’s KidCOVE study. Families are offered compensation to participate. Nearly 7000 people are participating in the trial Moderna said.

Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs split over future course of Korean chipmakers



By Park Jae-hyuk



Last week two of the top U.S.-based investment banks ― Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs ― published reports showing rather contrasting views for the global semiconductor industry.



Titled ""Memory ― Winter is Coming"" Morgan Stanley cut its target on Samsung Electronics ordinary shares (ORDs) to 89000 won ($76) from 98000 won as the report warned of a rather tough chip-pricing environment heading into next year.



Despite Samsung Electronics' repeated confidence over the continued tight supply of memory chips the Morgan Stanley report directly hit investor sentiment as ORDs at Samsung and SK hynix plummeted. It hugely cut its target on SK hynix to 80000 won from 156000 won.



Morgan Stanley's abrupt skepticism contradicted its previous week's report that recommended investors stay ""overweight"" leading foreign investors to massively unload their holdings in the world's top two memory chipmakers throughout last week.



But unlike Morgan Stanley's stance which triggered massive unloading of the world's No. 3 memory chipmaker ― Micron Technology ― Goldman Sachs maintained its optimistic targets on Samsung Electronics at 107000 won and SK hynix at 177000 won with expectations of a limited decline in global DRAM prices next year.



Their contrasting reports harken back to similar events in 2017.



Industry experts said Sunday that the reports reflect a similar situation four years ago.



In November 2017 Morgan Stanley lowered its target on Samsung Electronics ORDs claiming prices for NAND-type flash memory chips would go down and the electronics company would not see gains the following year. After the report Samsung Electronics shares fell 5 percent in a single trading day knocking off 18 trillion won in market capitalization.



At the time Goldman Sachs analyst Daiki Takayama refuted Morgan Stanley's view.



""Excessive concerns over the cycle of memory chips in the semiconductor industry were affecting the stock price"" he said in a report. ""We see the current price as an attractive opportunity to buy shares. We have found no factors to make a change in our positive recommendation on Samsung Electronics.""



In 2018 both Samsung Electronics and SK hynix posted record-high earnings as Goldman Sachs expected.



Industry experts also regard the recent concern as inaccurate given that the Korean chipmakers have already signed large-scale contracts to supply memory chips to their clients until the end of the year. This means the long-term fixed prices of DRAMs will remain stable for a while.



""Samsung Electronics SK hynix Micron and other major memory producers have limited inventories and production bottlenecks are deepening"" Yuanta Securities analyst Lee Jae-yun said in a report. ""The chances are slim for memory chip prices to drop sharply.""



While increased chip price volatility has been cited as one variable factor inventory levels for Samsung and SK remain tight said company officials. Plus demand for premium chips for use in corporate servers and high-end mobile devices will rise until next year offsetting the effects of the decline in conventional PC DRAM chips.

NDAQ,"Nasdaq, Inc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3MvYW5hbHlzdC1mb3JlY2FzdHMtY2Vsc2l1cy1ob2xkaW5ncy1pbmMtMDcxNDE5MDM1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analyst Forecasts For Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) Are Surging Higher,"Shareholders in Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. The consensus statutory numbers for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) increased with their view clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.

Following the upgrade the current consensus from Celsius Holdings' four analysts is for revenues of US$256m in 2021 which - if met - would reflect a sizeable 36% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are presumed to surge 21% to US$0.18. Prior to this update the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$225m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.14 in 2021. There has definitely been an improvement in perception recently with the analysts substantially increasing both their earnings and revenue estimates.

See our latest analysis for Celsius Holdings

It will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for Celsius Holdings 11% to US$95.67 on the back of these upgrades. There's another way to think about price targets though and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Celsius Holdings with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$105 and the most bearish at US$82.00 per share. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Celsius Holdings is an easy business to forecast or the underlying assumptions are obvious.

Of course another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The analysts are definitely expecting Celsius Holdings' growth to accelerate with the forecast 86% annualised growth to the end of 2021 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 42% per annum over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.5% per year. It seems obvious that while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past the analysts also expect Celsius Holdings to grow faster than the wider industry.

The Bottom Line

The biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates with improved earnings power expected for this year. They also upgraded their revenue estimates for this year and sales are expected to grow faster than the wider market. With a serious upgrade to expectations and a rising price target it might be time to take another look at Celsius Holdings.

These earnings upgrades look like a sterling endorsement but before diving in - you should know that we've spotted 4 potential risks with Celsius Holdings including concerns around earnings quality. You can learn more and discover the 3 other risks we've identified for free on our platform here.

Of course seeing company management invest large sums of money in a stock can be just as useful as knowing whether analysts are upgrading their estimates. So you may also wish to search this free list of stocks that insiders are buying.

In any sector with entrenched competitors there's room for a disruptive upstart to come in and steal oodles of market share. Such innovative new entrants can often be great picks for your portfolio as they have the benefit of doing things differently to address problems that have already proven to be profitable to solve. Of course there's always a chance that a scrappy young business will fail to gain traction but if it succeeds it has a solid chance of going big.

Each of the three healthcare companies I'll analyze today is pioneering a unique business model to address the needs of patients with difficult-to-treat issues. If everything goes according to plan they'll excel and become the very first juggernauts of their kind. And that could make the people who invest now significantly richer.

1. Compass Pathways

Compass Pathways (CMPS 0.47%) is developing psychedelic chemicals like psilocybin into therapies for difficult conditions including treatment-resistant depression. Aside from its drugs Compass' lead depression program also includes elements of psychotherapy to help patients prepare for and adjust after their treatment with psilocybin. Working with chemicals formerly eschewed by the medical establishment is one thing that makes Compass a disruptor but the idea of combining psychedelics with support from trained clinicians into a cohesive package is even more important.

The thing to appreciate about Compass' conception of psychedelic therapy is the numerous options it offers to add value for customers beyond what might be ""normal"" for a biotech company's product.

Before patients even get to the front door of the therapy clinic they've interacted with the company's automated online prep platform which helps them to get ready for their experience. And they've already had contact with the support staff that will be a part of their therapy. Once they're in the clinic for the duration of the eight-hour therapy experience the company's carefully designed therapy rooms are packed with amenities to support their comfort and healing.

All of the above gives Compass the ability to command a high price for its services while also providing the opportunity for customers to build positive feelings about its brand thereby creating a competitive advantage and cementing market share. If it were only in the business of making psychedelic drugs it would not be able to accomplish either of those things.

At the moment Compass' lead program is in phase 2b of clinical trials and it could report results by the end of the year. By the end of the decade it could be operating therapy clinics everywhere if its brand of clinician-assisted psychedelic therapy is proven to be effective and that's what makes it worth a purchase today.

2. Talkspace

Talkspace (TALK 7.14%) provides telehealth services for behavioral health so its psychotherapists and psychiatrists can help patients who would otherwise be far beyond the geographical reach of robust local mental health systems. It sells subscriptions to businesses insurers and consumers all of which pay monthly according to the services their patients use.

Right now the company is leading other behavioral telehealth providers in brand awareness though it isn't profitable. Growing its membership base and forming a core of loyal customers domestically are the challenges of the moment. In the future it plans to expand its coverage outside the U.S. to all of the English-speaking world.

The key point of uncertainty is whether Talkspace will be able to outcompete the other behavioral telehealth companies once the market shakes out including those that currently do mental healthcare only as an ancillary service. On the basis of its plans at the moment it could report positive earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as soon as 2022 while growing annual net revenue by as much as 64%. Aggressive investors may want to consider buying the stock sometime over the next few quarters as proof of progress toward those estimates starts to trickle out.

3. Atai Life Sciences

Atai Life Sciences (ATAI 1.99%) is a biotech that aims to combine the innovative therapies of Compass Pathways with the behavioral telehealth of Talkspace though its primary focus is on drug development for the time being.

Atai is collaborating with Compass Pathways on its psilocybin program for treatment-resistant depression. But it also has a few other development collaborations for projects addressing opioid use disorder generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to name a few. The majority of Atai's pipeline is in the early stages which means that it could be years before it brings a drug to the market.

Atai's innovation is to make treatment with novel psychedelic drugs into something that's safe effective scalable and accessible via telemedicine. To accomplish this it's building a suite of telehealth tools for remote counseling of patients during their treatment with psychedelics. And it's also developing new drug discovery and delivery technologies so its therapies are more effective and more efficient than competitors'.

Its telehealth tools are what could enable Atai to scale its psychedelic therapies to address a huge swath of the market for novel behavioral health solutions. If the company's therapists can prescribe its medications for patients to take in the comfort of their homes with continuing support from afar that would negate the need to operate costly clinics -- and keep the price of treatment much lower too.

In sum Atai is planning to make its psychedelic therapies scale better than any other company can manage and that's why it's worth considering as an investment.",,,,,,

By Ravi Chandpurkar

Although the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has dented the production for tractors the tractor industry is highly optimistic that when normalcy will be restored the production will bounce back.

“It is expected that after removal of restrictions the production for tractors would scale up. The Government too spending on infrastructure projects including irrigation and incentive schemes like Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) giving impetus to the tractor industry” said Shrikant R Dube Senior General Manager and Plant Head of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Ltd Farm Equipment Sector MIDC-Hingna in an exclusive interview with The Hitavada.

The demand for tractors is cyclical in nature tending to rise and fall with fluctuations inline with the economic conditions Dube conveyed.

Highlighting a major achievement he said that the M&M tractor plant at Nagpur has completed 50 years of successful operations.

The plant was established in 1970 on a sprawling area of 45 acres at Hingna MIDC. This plant comprises an Industrial Estate as a farm equipment and implement producer. At that time the site was chosen due to its strategic location being centrally located in the country. This is one of the oldest facilities he said.

The company started tractor production in 1996 to strengthen its presence in the growing market. As of now M&M Nagpur employs a highly trained workforce of more than 3000 people.

Apart from this the plant has touched a milestone of producing 10 lakh tractors in 2020. “This is just one of the major achievements we are proud of” Dube said. The Nagpur tractor plant produced over 75000 units last year. The Nagpur plant has an installed capacity of 90000 units. The engine transmission hydraulics assembly machine shop and sheet metal paintshop are major aggregates within the plant he said.

The Swaraj tractor brand is also a part of the M&M Group. M&M tractors along with Swaraj tractors command a lion’s share of over 40 per cent in the domestic tractor market. “Our tractors are sold across the country majorly UP MP Telangana & Maharashtra” he said.

On the export front he said the Nagpur plant exports to more than 25 countries including US and Europe. M&M tractors are popular between the 20 HP and 90 HP segment in US and European countries.

Mahindra has five tractor plants and Nagpur is one of

the five tractor plants in

the country. Mahindra Nagpur is taking all possible precautions and following safety operating procedures (SOPs) at the plant to protect its employees and contain the spread of COVID-19. All workers above the age of 45 have already been vaccinated. Currently the vaccination process is underway at the plant and remaining workers will be vaccinated soon he said.

“Apart from this pre-pandemic our customers mainly farmers visited Nagpur plant and delivery of tractors directly from plant was also being done” he pointed out.

Furthermore the Nagpur Plant is instrumental in introducing a new range of tractor SP+.

“We have the Mahindra Excellence Centre at Nagpur plant used for capability building of channel partners and own employees in tractor and farm machinery. Nagpur plant actively contributes to society under CSR activities under ‘Prerna’ initiative for women farmers as well as supporting self health groups” he further said.

The company’s agriculture centric solutions will help farmers gain access to knowledge and latest farming techniques enabling them to improve

yields reduce cost of cultivation and increase profitability

Netflix's ""Cocaine Cowboys: The Kings of Miami"" is a thrilling look inside the rise and fall of Sal Magluta and Willy Falcon who were Miami's biggest drug traffickers during the 1980s.

The filmmakers behind the six-episode docuseries director Billy Corben and producer Alfred Spellman knew they had to have a hype theme song to live up to their high-octane story.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Luckily they had an original song from a major recording artist already in their back pocket.

Kicking off every episode of ""Kings of Miami"" is the song ""Blood Sport"" written and performed by Pitbull. Though it sounds perfect for the series it actually was created for a previous project by Corben and Spellman that never panned out.

Corben and Spellman are known best for creating the ""Cocaine Cowboys"" documentary franchise including 2006's ""Cocaine Cowboys"" and its sequel two years later.

Corben wanted to do a hip-hop soundtrack to accompany the release of 2014's ""Cocaine Cowboys: Reloaded"" which featured footage and interviews that didn't make it into the 2006 doc.

The movie's composer put together some tracks with music similar to the score and then Corben and Spellman sent it out to Miami-based rappers who in the past were supporters of ""Cocaine Cowboys"" asking if they would add their raps to it.

""Pitbull was the only artist to send something back"" Corben told Insider.

Though the ""Cocaine Cowboys"" hip-hop soundtrack idea was scrapped the filmmakers held onto Pitbull's ""Blood Sport"" track. And when ""Kings of Miami"" became a reality it became the docuseries' theme song.

""I thought the song was brilliant"" Corben said. ""It's all from the perspective of cocaine. He takes over the voice of cocaine and talks about it in the first person which I thought was very clever.""

One lyric in the song Pitbull raps goes: ""They'll kick in your door like Bruce Lee / just to have an intimate love affair with me / I corrupt governments / yeah that's me / I built the streets / listen closely.""

The filmmakers said they don't know if Pitbull has watched the series yet as he's currently on tour but they are trying to get his theme song released on Spotify and iTunes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoYXRzLW9uLW5ldGZsaXguY29tL2xlYXZpbmctc29vbi90cnV0di1jb21lZHktaW0tc29ycnktbGVhdmluZy1uZXRmbGl4LXVzLWluLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TruTV Comedy 'I'm Sorry' Leaving Netflix US in September 2021,"Andrea Savage’s comedy series is set to depart Netflix. Seasons 1 and 2 of I’m Sorry are currently due to depart the service on September 13th 2021 meaning your last full day to watch will be September 12th.

The sitcom series first debuted in 2017 with its second and final season airing in 2019. Sadly the show was a casualty of the pandemic with it being canceled back in August 2020.

The show is still well-worth watching despite never getting a proper ending.

Here’s what you can expect if you’ve not watched yet:

“Life is a series of awkward situations for comedy writer and mom Andrea thanks to plenty of neuroses and a knack for sticking her foot in her mouth.”

This departure only applies to Netflix in the United States as it’s the only region streaming the show. There’s almost no hope for the show being added to Netflix internationally.

It’s going to be a busy month for departures in September 2021 in the US. The region is set to see the departure of the high-profile BBC show Ripper Street as well as plenty of licensed movies.

Where will I’m Sorry stream next?

TruTV is currently streaming a season of the show but we suspect the show will take up permanent residence on TruTV’s parent company streaming service HBO Max. That’s where Impractical Jokers and other titles from the network are now streaming mostly exclusively.

What does this mean for TruTV on Netflix?

Netflix has seen a number of TruTV titles come and go over the past few years. For example The Carbonaro Effect arrived on Netflix with a collection back in 2018 before eventually departing in September 2019. The same can be said for Impractical Jokers.

Adam Ruins Everything was available on Netflix for 2 years departing in September 2020.

Some other TruTV titles still remain on Netflix US right now however. Billy on the Street is still available with four seasons which were added back in November 2019 (these could depart in November 2021). Elsewhere in Canada for example Big Trick Energy was added just recently on July 1st.

In terms of what you should watch if you love the show. We’d recommend giving The CW’s In the Dark a spin which is currently airing its third season. We’d also recommend Lady Dynamite and Workin’ Moms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGlzY2gubnl1LmVkdS9hcnQtcHVibGljLXBvbGljeS9uZXdzL2FwcC1hbHVtbmEtcmVsZWFzZXMtbmV0ZmxpeC1zZXJpZXMtdGFja2xpbmctYnVsbHlpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,APP Alumna Releases Netflix Series Tackling Bullying,"APP '19 Hayat Abu Samra is a member of the cast of the limited series ""ALRawabi School for Girls"" released in July on Netflix working as an artist to explore social justice.

She sat down at her kitchen table in Berkeley Calif. and frantically started Googling to find out what it was.

Her experience wasn’t uncommon. People working at the tourism guide Lonely Planet the travel site The Points Guy and the health and medical information site Healthline were similarly blindsided in recent years when Red Ventures bought up special interest publications in a multibillion-dollar shopping spree.

Their Googling and mandatory corporate retreats led them to the company’s South Carolina headquarters a 180-acre campus with a cluster of modern buildings a fire pit a six-lane bowling alley spin room pickle ball courts and 264 residences for employees who choose to live where they work.

And the vendor of the Young Street property Dr Andrew Tidemann says a family would provide a perfect fit for the versatile five-bedroom home with the neighbourhood’s mix of quality schools – Burnside Primary is only a short walk away – and open space among its standout features.

“We were certainly attracted by the home’s proximity to good schools” he says. “The children were able to walk to school walk to their mates’ places play all their sport in local parks – it’s great. It’s fantastic being able to see your children fulfilling their potential and not having to travel to do it. Everything is just so close. A really nice lifestyle is pretty much right there on your doorstep. Burnside Village is probably the nearest big shopping hub … and a kindergarten is two blocks away.”

Set on a comfortable 696sqm allotment the 1948-era home has been owned by “a succession of families” Dr Tidemann says.

“We moved there 12 years ago. The people we bought it from actually moved across the road where they still live and they’re still fond of the property. When we got it it didn’t really have a functional family area and kitchen so we’ve had all of that remodelled and redone – that’s a real feature area now at the back of the home.”

Highlights of the home’s open-plan living zone include louvred glass and window seat picture panes a feature stone fireplace wall and seamless connectivity to the home’s contemporary kitchen.

Designed to make entertaining a breeze the kitchen boasts Australian Oak benchtops high-end stainless appliances and a walk-in pantry. Another bonus for wine lovers is the adjacent wine room complete with inbuilt fridges and a 400-bottle capacity.

The living area opens out to deck space overlooking the home’s mix of private gardens lawns and stacked stone retaining walls which makes it a perfect setting for any gathering – with the salt-chlorinated pool sure to be a summer hit. Dr Tidemann says a solar blanket means the pool can generally see plenty of use between October and April while automatic irrigation helps keep the rear gardens well watered.

Also downstairs is the home’s lounge room – complete with a combustion fire and polished timber floors – and adjoining formal dining room; adding the character charm to its contemporary touches.

There are also two bedrooms on the lower level serviced by a bathroom while another downstairs toilet offers extra convenience. Upstairs are a further three bedrooms while the property’s flexibility for family accommodation is enhanced with a study that could also be utilised as a sixth bedroom if desired.

Four of the bedrooms have built-in robes while the upstairs master suite has walk-around robes and a balcony perfect for taking in the treetop views. An attic offers plenty of handy space for “storing old suitcases” and so on. There is also ducted reverse cycle airconditioning upstairs to ensure year-round comfort.

A full-sized tiled family bathroom – finished with matte-black fixtures – services the upper bedrooms.

The property is a little more than 6km from the city making it an easy commute for work school shopping or leisure. Close to foothills walking trails other nearby attractions include the ever-popular Hazelwood Park Reserve and playground while the Feathers Hotel is also only a short walk away.

With the house completely done it is primed for the next occupants simply to shift in and enjoy. And Dr Tidemann – who is downsizing and moving closer to work – says he would be keen to see another family move in to enjoy the same benefits his did and create their own memories.

“It wouldn’t really suit anyone apart from a good-sized family or a smaller family with another generation” he says. “There is certainly scope to have three generations living in the home.

“I am a bit sad to be leaving but time marches on. The kids are at a different phase of their lives now. The house is great for a young family but we’re not that anymore.”

She sat down at her kitchen table in Berkeley Calif. and frantically started Googling to find out what it was.

Her experience wasn’t uncommon. People working at the tourism guide Lonely Planet the travel site The Points Guy and the health and medical information site Healthline were similarly blindsided in recent years when Red Ventures bought up special interest publications in a multibillion-dollar shopping spree.

Their Googling and mandatory corporate retreats led them to the company’s South Carolina headquarters a 180-acre campus with a cluster of modern buildings a fire pit a six-lane bowling alley spin room pickle ball courts and 264 residences for employees who choose to live where they work.

Red Ventures which started as a digital marketing company has attracted serious investments from private equity firms. Its location has helped obscure what is perhaps the biggest digital publisher in America a 4500-employee juggernaut that says it has roughly $2 billion in annual revenues a conservative valuation earlier this year of more than $11 billion and more readers as measured by Comscore than any media brand you’ve ever heard of — an average of 751 million visits a month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbW9yZS1sYXlvZmZzLWFuZC1hLXBvdGVudGlhbC1mdXR1cmUtc3RyYXRlZ3ktY29tZS10by1saWdodC1hdC1maWxzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Filson confirms more local layoffs a potential new strategy emerges,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito were both wealthier in 2020 than they were in 2018 according to their annual financial disclosures filed earlier this year

Manchin’s estimated net worth for 2020 was $8.6 million compared to $7.6 million for 2018. Capito was worth $2.53 million compared to $2.15 million in 2018.

The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probably range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

For 2020 Manchin’s asset values ranged from $4376067 to $12844100. He reported no liabilities. The midpoint was $8610083.50.

Capito’s assets ranged from $1596629 to $4996000. She reported liabilities ranging from $475005 to $1065000. Using the formula put her range of worth from $531629 to $4520995 with the midpoint at $2526995.

Here’s a look at some selected details from their reports.

Manchin

OpenSecrets ranked Manchin 19th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 67th overall in Congress. OpenSecrets hasn’t yet published its compilation of 2020 filings.

For comparison the richest senator in 2018 was Mark Warner D-Va. worth $214 million. Current Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was worth $1.12 million and current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was worth $34.14 million.

Manchin reported collecting $48282.24 from the state Public Employees Retirement System in 2020.

Members are required to report both their own and their spouse’s assets and liabilities. His wife Gayle Manchin currently co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission holds a savings account worth $500001-$1 million which paid interest ranging from $2501-$5000.

Manchin reported two savings accounts ranging respectively from $100001-$250000 and $50001-$100000. They produced interest ranging from $201-$1000 for the first and less than $201 for the second.

The Joe Manchin III Qualified Blind Trust is worth $500001-$1 million and generated revenue of $5001-$15000.

He owns a storage building in Fairmont worth $50001-$100000 that collected $2501-$5000 in rent. A commercial rental property in Fairmont is worth $250001-$500000 and collected $5001-$15000 in rent and $2382 in “ordinary business income.”

He owns stock in Fairmont-based Enersystems which he founded and is described as providing services and materials for utility plants (according to news reports it supplies coal to Mon Power’s Grant Town plant). The stock is worth $1000001-$5 million and produces $100001-$1 million in dividends plus $491949 in business income.

Manchin holds stock in two Morgantown-based companies. Figure 8 Surgical makes a sternal closure tool. CereDX (now Valtari Bio) is developing a blood test to aid rapid triage in stroke patients. The stock holdings for each is worth $1001 to $15001 and both generate dividends labeled “none” meaning less than $201.

The final asset on Manchin’s list is the house boat that recently made headlines as the site of a gathering of senators from both parties where Sen. Lindsey Graham R-SC subsequently reported testing positive for COVID despite being vaccinated.

Manchin reports the house boat being worth $100001-$250000.

Capito

Open Secrets ranked Capito 46th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 169th overall in Congress.

Capito has a stake in Disney magic. She owns Walt Disney Co. stock worth $15001-$50000.

She and her husband have stock in a number of energy companies: Duke Energy ($1001-$15000) NextEra Energy ($1001-$15000) ExxonMobil ($1001-$15000) Royal Dutch Shell ($1001-$15000) Chevron ($1001-$15000) Phillips 66 ($1001-$15000) Wisconsin Energy ($1001-$15000) and BlackRock ($1001-$15000).

They each have a Wells Fargo bank account each worth $50001-$100000 and they report four separate stock holdings in Wells Fargo. They also have several Citigroup holdings.

Their high-tech stock includes Microsoft Apple AT&T Cisco Verizon and IBM.

Her husband owns stock in Viatris (which closed its Morgantown plant last month) worth $1001-$15000. Their other pharmaceutical holdings include Johnson & Johnson Merck Novartis Pfizer Roche Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

They have a wide variety of holdings in the food industry: General Mills Kellogg McDonald’s J.M. Smucker Coca-Cola Mondelez and PepsiCo.

They have three box stores covered with holdings in WalMart Target and Lowe’s.

Other holdings include Nordstrom UPS Ford Colgate-Palmolive Proctor & Gamble #M and Nike.

Reps. David McKinley Carol Miller and Alex Mooney all had reports due in May and all three filed for extensions. Their new deadline was Friday and a story on their filings will follow after their reports are published.

There are no points for guessing why the Jordan 1 High has dominated the last two years of sneaker releases. Nike is piling resources and time into the silhouette positioning it as an all-time classic with timeless potential. On the heels of Travis Scott’s latest smash-hit Jordan 1 comes the Jordan 1 High Pollen which released on August 14 but if you missed out you can bag a pair at StockX.

Any long-time Swoosh fans will probably feel like they’ve pined over this design before. In a way you have. The Nike Air Jordan 1 High Pollen bears a striking resemblance to the highly sought-after 1999 Wu-Tang Nike Dunk with its two-tone color blocking.

Black tumbled leather sets the foundation for Pollen Yellow leather overlays in a simple yet striking style. The black and yellow palette holds weight in the Nike world placing the Jordan 1 High Pollen in the conversation for future classics. Adding to that case is the fact that the design comes with special packaging. The Swoosh-adorned shoe box comes in a matching bumblebee colorway which is sure to excite collectors.

How much does the Jordan 1 High Pollen cost?

While the Pollen retails for $170 you might be hard-pushed to secure a pair at that price. StockX market data shows a 12-month trade range of $223-$700 but an average sale price of $301. As far as this year’s Jordan 1 releases have gone a price premium of 47% feels fairly kind so this might be a pair to keep on ice for a few years. Be sure to cop your certified-authentic pair at StockX now.

Release Date: August 14 2021 Price: $170 Brand: Nike Model: Jordan 1 High

What a fascinating career streak for Felix!

First let’s throw some light on her previous achievements. To begin with Felix has had an incredible Olympic career. With a grand total of 11 medals she’s definitely become the face of American athletics. With 7 golds 3 silvers and 1 bronze nobody can deny the fact that she’s phenomenal!

Allyson Felix talks about her experience at Tokyo Olympics

Recently in one of her interviews with CNN she talked about why Olympics has a “different sense” among the athletes. However there were certain aspects of the interview which are certainly very interesting to know about!

Interestingly Felix raised a very important issue in the year 2019. Apparently Nike started paying the female athletes lesser after giving birth to their children. Indeed it was very courageous for Allyson to talk about this fearlessly on social media. Thus she brought about a tremendous change when she stood up for something so very crucial!

The reporter asked her about the complete thought process that went behind for Allyson’s end. The reporter asked “Were you scared to do that?“. Felix had an intriguing answer.

Allyson Felix’s reply

Allyson expressed her concerns by saying “I was terrified for so long. I had really just focussed on performance and focussed on what I was supposed to do. And when it wasn’t aligning with what I felt was right and what I had seen marketed I felt like I had to speak up and to share my story. But it was absolutely so scary and also I didn’t know what was going to come from it. And I knew that there were going to be real consequences.”

What Allyson did was inspirational. Since few athletes worked actively towards highlighting such an important issue certainly shows how daring she is. Despite knowing that there will be repercussions for taking such bold steps she went ahead with it anyway.

Hence this makes her an impactful personality to be celebrated thoroughly.

But as you take in the Northern Trust -- the first of three season-ending events -- don’t spend time trying to figure out exactly what you are watching or how it works.

You’d be better off working a Rubik’s Cube studying scientific journals or searching for Hoffa. Just sign off on it all and move on.

The reason it is the FedExCup is because it is sponsored by FedEx. If it was sponsored by Stanley Tools it would be the Stanley Cup which would make things even more confusing. Perhaps the winners would get their name etched on an oversized socket wrench.

If it were sponsored by The Athletic the sports news subscription outfit it would be The Athletic Cup and winners might get their names etched on an oversized athletic cup. And wouldn’t that look great on the old mantelpiece?

Regardless of the name the Cup represents the Publisher’s Clearing House of golf. If you track the FedEx package to when it arrives on Sept. 5 at East Lake Golf Club you will see it contains $15 million for the winner.

To put that in perspective one could win the first two playoff events ($1.71 million each) Masters ($2.07 million) PGA Championship ($2.16 million) British Open ($2.07 million) and U.S. Open ($2.25 million) and collect $11.97 million or more than $3 million less.

Yeah go ahead … “Baba Booey!”

These playoffs take place in stages beginning with 125 qualifiers at the Northern Trust trimmed to 70 survivors for the BMW Championship (Aug. 26-29) paired to 30 finalist for the Tour Championship finale (Sept. 2-5). It’s kind of like an NBA game in that there’s no reason to pay close attention until the final moments.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Vince Lombardi would not be a big fan of the playoffs. That is Lombardi once famously said “Show me a good loser and I will show you a loser.” That doesn’t translate well to the FedEx format.

By the time the sun sets on Sunday Sept. 5 at East Lake the winner will not necessarily be the guy with the lowest score for the Tour Championship. The playoffs leader enters the Tour Championship with a score of 10 under. So for instance although Xander Schauffele shot the best four rounds at East Lake last year he actually finished second in the weighted field. Dustin Johnson captured the FedEx pot o’ golf by virtue of finishing T4.

In short and contrary to Lombardi’s creed it takes a real winner to be a good loser in the FedEx. Again don’t try to understand just move on.

With this somewhat illogical overview complete let’s take a look at a handful of favorites make the large bank deposit on Monday Sept. 6.

Collin Morikawa

Collin Morikawa leads the Fed Ex Cup points standings.

USA Today

The 24-year old British Open winner is atop the points standings coming in. Last month he had the audacity to put new irons into play the week of his first British Open -- and then win it. Who does that? He also was T4 at the U.S. Open and T8 at the PGA. His poise maturity and iron-play are off the charts. He is first on the Tour in tee-to-green and first in birdie average. By today’s standards Morikawa is not long. But the FedEx facilities generally fall into the “shot-maker’s” category which makes him a dangerous man.

Jon Rahm

Winning the $15 million Fed Ex Cup prize would be a great end to an unlucky year for Jon Rahm.

USA Today.

If he can avoid testing positive for Covid for a third time the 26-year old Spaniard figures to be in the mix. He has been a top-10 finisher in each of the last five majors with a dramatic win at the U.S. Open in June and a T3 at the British Open. Rahm has been doing special things throughout his golf career like being No. 1 in the World Amateur Golf Rankings for a record 60 weeks before turning pro. As Ghostbuster Winston Zeddemore might say “He has the tools he has the talent!”

Jordan Spieth

Jordan Spieth is headed in the right direction and is second in the Fed Ex Cup standings.

USA Today

He is a relatively modest 12th in the OWGR but Spieth has been trending all summer and moved to second in the FedExCup standings. With a win nine top-10s and 13 top-25s he has rediscovered some ball-striking consistency. The 28-year old was especially noticeable at the British Open where he shot four rounds in the 60s … and still finished second to Morikawa. In his last 15 starts Spieth has been worse than T19 only twice. Remember he has won three majors and the 2015 FedExCup. He knows how to do this.

Dustin Johnson

Dustin Johnson won the FedEx Cup last season.

USA Today

Since winning the 2020 Masters last November the 37-year old Johnson has not been especially prominent. A T8 at the British Open was his best 2021 major and he currently stands 17th in the points parade. But that doesn’t mean “DJ” has disappeared. He is third on the Tour in scoring average (69.564) and still second in the OWGR behind Morikawa. Oh yeah he also is the reigning FedExCup champion. Last year he was first at Northern Trust playoff-second at BMW and 44-under par for the playoffs. Under different sponsorship that’s Conn Smythe Trophy stuff.

Xander Schauffele

Gold medalist Xander Schauffele watches his tee shot narrowly avoid the water at the St. Jude Classic.

USA Today

Winner of the recent Olympic golf tournament the 27-year old has made the East Lake 30 four years in a row and finished No. 2 in the FedExCup standings two years in a row. Like Morikawa Schauffele is a shotmaker who seems to perform when the spotlight burns brightest evidenced by nine top-10s in majors over the past four years. This season he has three second-place finishes seven top-10s 14 top-25s and now some gold medal momentum entering the playoffs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3NlY3JldC1tYWtpbmctc3BlY2lhbC10b20tY29sbGlucy1jb2NrdGFpbC1saWJlcnR5LW5hdGlvbmFsL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3NlY3JldC1tYWtpbmctc3BlY2lhbC10b20tY29sbGlucy1jb2NrdGFpbC1saWJlcnR5LW5hdGlvbmFsLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The secret to making the special cocktail they’ll be drinking at Liberty National this week,"The secret to making the special cocktail they’ll be drinking at Liberty National this week

Liberty National's version of the Tom Collins is dubbed the Tom Kite after the course's architect. Shaun Lewis

The FedEx Cup playoffs get underway this week with the Northern Trust at Liberty National Golf Club in New Jersey a heated competition at the height of a Northeast summer. As the executive chef at Liberty National — and as someone with an extensive background in mixology — I was asked to help develop a special cocktail menu for the event composed of drinks that are great for seasonal sipping. The one I’ll focus on today is a refreshing classic that I’ve given a local and contemporary spin.

With origins dating to the 1870s a traditional Tom Collins is a gin or whiskey cocktail mixed with lemon juice sugar and club soda and stirred in a tall glass with ice. But as you might imagine it has spawned a myriad of variations.

A delicious version can be made with vodka. I’ve been known to whip up one with mezcal lime juice and heavily carbonated water such as San Pellegrino. I also do a riff on the Bees Knees turning a drink of gin honey and lemon juice into a Collins simply by adding carbonated water and serving it in a tall glass with ice.

For this year’s specialty menu I’ve tipped my cap to the season by embellishing a classic Collins with blueberries almonds and herbal tea. It’s a summery combo that changes colors as you make it shifting into a light purple as the lemon juice alters the pH levels of the tea.

I also changed the name of the drink to a Kite Collins in honor of the co-designer of our course Tom Kite.

We’ll be serving the Kite Collins at the Liberty Club and the Northern Trust Pavilion. But in case you won’t be joining us here’s how to whip one up at home.

The Kite Collins

Ingredients:

-2 ounces Old Tom gin

-1 ounce lemon juice

-1/2 ounce blueberry orgeat syrup

-1/2 ounce Butterfly Pea Flower Tea (recipe below)

Steep the flowers in the hot water for a half-hour until it cools then strain and re-serve.

Method:

Henley held a commanding four-shot lead after his superb performances in the first two rounds and a birdie on the 5th hole and an eagle at the par-5 15th hole helped him build on his advantage yesterday.

The 32-year-old has had a great season in 2021 finishing in the top 25 on eight occasions and in the top 10 on four occasions. With his third-round 69 he is three shots ahead of Tyler McCumber in second place on 15-under-par.

Henley who last won on the PGA Tour at the Shell Houston Open in 2017 is safely ranked 23rd in the FedEx Cup standings so he will almost certainly be playing at the Northern Trust Open next week in the 125-man cut.

South African Branden Grace and Kevin Kisner are four shots behind on 11-under-par as both players respectively shot 64 and 66 in the third round

Justin Rose equalled Henley's score of 1-under-par on day three to move to 10-under-par for the tournament which puts him in contention at Sedgefield Country Club but in a precarious position in the FedEx Cup standings.

The Englishman won the FedExCup in 2018 but he is currently 126th in the standings and must maintain his challenge on Sunday if he is to qualify for next week.

Olympic silver medallist Rory Sabbatini is four shots behind Henley on 11-under-par but he currently sits 122nd in the FedEx Cup rankings which means he would sneak into the first stage of the playoffs.

Veteran PGA Tour star Matt Kuchar is also right on the bubble in 124th place. The 43-year-old is nine shots behind Henley on 6-under-par as he carded a 1-over-par 71 on Saturday.

Due to the expectation of inclement weather later in the day the tee times have been brought forwards between 7 am and 9 am local time in North Carolina.

Bush was commissioned in January 2009.

Here's What You Need to Know: The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is unquestionably a symbol of American might and power projection abroad.

At 1092 feet the Nimitz-class supercarriers are more than three times the length of a football field and with a crew of 3200 sailors and 2480 airmen these are essentially floating cities. The lead ship of the class USS Nimitz—nicknamed ""Old Salt""—was commissioned in May 1975 was named after Adm. Chester Nimitz who led the U.S. Navy through World War II.

The ship was first deployed to the Indian Ocean during the Iran Hostage Crisis and has since logged untold miles providing security at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games and later service in the Persian Gulf after Operation Desert Storm. Most recently USS Nimitz was deployed against ISIS in Iraq and Syria where her F/A-18s took part in the Battle of Afar in 2017.

A total of 10 Nimitz-class carriers have been built and the last of the class USS George H.W. Bush was commissioned in January 2009. These nuclear-powered carriers which have two reactors and four shafts for propulsion with a top speed of 30+ knots (34.5mph) were the largest warships in the world until the USS Gerald R. Ford the lead ship of her class of carriers entered service in 2017. Each of the Nimitz-class has an expected 50-year service life with one mid-life refueling. These warships which have a displacement of 102000 tons were all built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding (now Northrop Grumman Ship Systems) based in Virginia at a unit cost of approximately $8.5 billion (constant year FY 12 dollars).

Each carrier has approximately 60 aircraft onboard and this includes a variety of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft with up to 90 of various types. Typical aircraft on a Nimitz-class carrier include 12 F/A-18E/F Hornets 36 F/A-18 Hornets four E-2C Hawkeyes and four EA-6B Prowlers fixed-wing and helicopters including four SH-60F and two HH-60H Seahawks. In addition the carriers could also deploy the S-3B Viking before these were phased out and replaced the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The flight deck which measures 1092 feet by 252 feet is equipped with four lifts four steam-driven catapults and four arrester wires. The carriers are capable of launching one air every 20 seconds.

The air wings of the carriers are customized according to the nature of operations with the usual air wings replaced with 50 army helicopters on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower for its operations in Haiti in 1994. Similar considerations can be made when a carrier is used for disaster response and humanitarian assistance.

In addition to the aircraft the most recently built Nimitz-class carriers are now armed with three Raytheon GMLS mk29 eight-cell launchers for NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles which has semi-radar terminal guidance. There are also four Raytheon/General Dynamics 20mm Phalanx six-barreled Mk15 close-in weapons systems that have a 3000rpm rate of fire.

While the last of the Nimitz-class carriers have been commissioned and the class will eventually be replaced by the Gerald R. Ford-class these ten carriers will still strike fear into potential U.S. adversaries for many years to come.

NASA is testing out the printing system from company Redwire for use in its upcoming Artemis moon missions hoping to make use of the moon’s dusty soil (technically known as regolith) as raw material for printing. The idea is to use readily available materials on the moon to make what is required instead of having to haul lots of heavy equipment all the way from Earth.

Engineers have been considering how to 3D print using moon regolith for some time and have demonstrated the process on Earth. But sending a 3D printer into the microgravity environment of the ISS for testing is a big new step in getting the technology ready to use. The researchers want to know whether printing works without gravity and what the strength of the printed material will be.

The printer works using moon simulant — that is a human-made compound of chemically similar material to moon regolith — because real samples from the moon are so precious and rare. But the simulant should be close enough to the real lunar material that it can be used to test the 3D printing hardware. The stimulant is used as feedstock being processed and fed into the printer to be printed into useful parts and shapes.

Redwire says that as well as being used for small fixtures and fittings this approach could eventually be used to print larger and more complex parts such as landing pads foundations roads and even lunar habitats for the astronauts to live inside.

And the effects could go beyond Earth’s gravity too. NASA says that it is developing the technology with the hope it could eventually be used on other planets such as for crewed missions to Mars which could make use of the dusty Martian soil to 3D-print whole structures.

Walter Roban the Deputy Premier watches rocket launch monitoring operations at the Nasa tracking station on Cooper’s Island (Photograph supplied)

A Bermuda-based Nasa station helped track a rocket launch to deliver vital supplies to the crew of the International Space Station.

The Northrop Grumman Antares rocket which carried 8200 pounds of equipment passed over the island on Tuesday from its launch site at the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia more than 1200 kilometres away.

The Nasa control centre at Wallops announced “coming your way Bermuda” just after the 7pm launch.

Walter Roban the Deputy Premier and Karen Grissette the US Consul General watched the launch from the Nasa tracking station on Cooper’s Island in Castle Harbour.

Ms Grissette said: ""It was so exciting to observe my first launch and to watch the Nasa team hard at work.

“I am so proud of the co-operation between Bermuda and the United States in support of space exploration and scientific discovery.

“The Nasa Tracking Station in Bermuda is critical to Nasa's launch operations.""

The resupply mission aerospace firm Northrop Grumman’s 16th mission for Nasa will assist the International Space Station with dozens of research projects.

Ms Grissette and Mr Roban also had a chance to watch the operations in the Virginia control room through a live link-up.

They also spoke to Shannon Fitzpatrick the chief of Wallops’ range and mission management office about how mission operations were organised.

The Nasa Tracking Station on Cooper’s Island was first set up in the 1960s.

It plays an important role in helping Nasa monitor its launches.

Mr Roban said: “I was proud to witness this longstanding partnership in action.

“On behalf of the Government and people of Bermuda I look forward to continuing our involvement with Nasa in support of human space flight and space exploration.”

The International Space Station is a scientific research laboratory in low earth orbit."

Redditor snake-robot takes NVIDIA RTX A4000 apart.

NVIDIA RTX A4000 Source: u/snake-robot

We do not get to see many teardowns of NVIDIA workstation cards mainly because they are utterly expensive and such operation usually means that the warranty is voided. Fortunately this has not stopped snake-robot from looking under the hood of this blower-type this workstation model.

It may be hard not to refer to this card as Quadro but with this generation of its workstation cards NVIDIA ultimately dropped this brand in hopes of simplifying its product naming convention. It didn’t work and even NVIDIA themselves still list their cards under the ‘RTX/Quadro’ page on the official website. There is really no better way to call these cards other than ‘RTX Ampere’ ‘RTX workstation” or ‘Quadro Ampere’.

NVIDIA RTX A4000 Source: u/snake-robot

NVIDIA RTX A4000 is based on PG190 board design a derivative of RTX 3060 Ti PCB with an 8-pin power connector. This card however does not have a power connector attached directly to the board but relies on an extension cable.

The graphics card is equipped with NVIDIA GA104-875 GPU featuring all 6144 CUDA cores enabled (essentially the same GPU as RTX 3070 Ti). Unlike the GeForce series though workstation Ampere relies on GDDR6 non-X memory. This model features Samsung K4ZAF325BM-HC16 modules each featuring 2GB of capacity clocked at 16 Gbps. Another difference is 230W TDP in comparison to RTX 3070 Ti’s 290W.

This RTX A4000 teardown might answer a question that has been frequently asked by our readers. What had ever happened to blower-type Ampere gaming cards? According to our information NVIDIA has banned board partners from launching such designs because they could’ve affected the sales of RTX Ampere models all of which are using blower coolers. There were even instances where RTX gaming cards that launched 2 weeks prior have been removed from AIB websites. Some manufacturers had even reached out to us to remove articles about these cards those requests were obviously ignored. In case you are wondering what have we missed take a look at this article.

The pictures show the extremely compact PCB design that resides underneath the single-single cooler which makes us want a half-length variant of the card.

NVIDIA RTX A4000 Features The Smallest PCB For A Full GA104 Ampere GPU Perfect For Custom SFF & Mini PCs

The NVIDIA RTX A4000 comes in a single-slot & full-length form factor. The graphics card features a blower fan that circulates air within the cooler shroud from both the top and bottom sides. That is why the backplate extends beyond the PCB and has a cutout for the blower-fan at the bottom too. It cools a really compact aluminum fin array which makes direct contact with the GPU and VRAM modules through flat copper heat pipes. The VRMs are also covered by a singular heatsink that is also part of the frame.

2 of 9

Underneath the shroud is a very compact PCB almost as small as the AMD Radeon R9 Nano. The card itself features the NVIDIA GA104 GPU core in its full-fat configuration featuring 6144 Cores & an impressive 16 GB GDDR6 memory bus with speeds of up to 16 Gbps for a total bandwidth out-put of 448 GB/s. The card has a TDP of 140W which is supplied through a single 6-pin connector & that's located beyond the PCB with extender cables routed in the shroud. As for VRMs the card is powered by a 6+2 phase delivery and features four Display Outputs all of which are Display Port 1.4a.

Coming to the total horsepower of the NVIDIA RTX A4000 we are looking at around 20 TFLOPs of FP32 compute (19.2 TFLOPs to be exact). The AMD Radeon R9 Nano delivered 8.1 TFLOPs of FP32 compute at 170W. This shows just how far we have come in terms of efficiency with current-gen GPUs.

The NVIDIA RTX A4000 features a very compact PCB making it perfect for Mini ITX and SFF setups. (Image Source; NVIDIA Reddit)

If NVIDIA wanted they could've released a small form factor version of the GA104 GPU with a standard dual-slot half-length board aimed at Mini ITX PCs. Even the 8 GB GDDR6 memory would have been absolutely fine and a TDP of around 150W would make it slightly higher clocked than the RTX A4000. So far this generation has seen the least Mini ITX & small form factor graphics cards as manufacturers are putting more emphasis on bigger coolers and more power intense designs. It would be great if we had options on both sides. The GTX 1080 was the last high-end card to receive a MIni ITX treatment that was scaled down to RTX 2070 and now a true ITX card is only available in the form of RTX 3060 Ti and below.

NVIDIA also has a really cute RTX A2000 which was launched last week and features a dual-slot half-height form factor. The card is based on the GA106 GPU and has a TDP of just 70W & doesn't require any external power input.

Inside the NVIDIA RTX A4000 uses a PG190 board design which is based on the RTX 3060 Ti PCB with a single 8-pin PCIe power connector. On the RTX A4000 however the power connector isn't directly connected to the board and rather uses an extension cable.

As for the GPU NVIDIA is using its GA104-875 GPU with has all of its 6144 CUDA cores making it more like the GPU that NVIDIA uses in its GeForce RTX 3070 Ti. Unlike the RTX 3070 Ti NVIDIA has used GDDR6 non-X memory but with ECC (Error Checking and Correction).

NVIDIA is using Samsung K4ZAF325BM-HC16 modules each with 2GB so we have 16GB of GDDR6 with ECC memory in total clocked at 16Gbps. NVIDIA's RTX A4000 workstation card has a 230W TDP down from the 290W on the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NhbXN1bmctam9pbnMtZ29vZ2xlLWFuZC1udmlkaWEtaW4tdXNpbmctYWktdG8tZGVzaWduLWNoaXBz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Joins Google and Nvidia in Using AI to Design Chips,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pcmag.com/news/samsung-joins-google-and-nvidia-in-using-ai-to-design-chips on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NhbXN1bmctam9pbnMtZ29vZ2xlLWFuZC1udmlkaWEtaW4tdXNpbmctYWktdG8tZGVzaWduLWNoaXBz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYm1pbmVyLW52aWRpYS1hbnRpLW1pbmluZy1saW1pdGVyLTcwLXBlcmNlbnQtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtYW1wZXJlLWxoci1ncHVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBMiner Partially Cracks Nvidia Anti-Mining Limiter Restores 70% Performance on Ampere LHR GPUs,"Nvidia probably thought it had put a definite stop to Ethereum mining on GeForce RTX 30-series (Ampere) graphics cards with the introduction of the Lite Hash Rate (LHR) series. NBMiner a popular mining software has found a partial workaround to Nvidia's enhanced anti-mining limiter.

The latest version of NBMiner (via VideoCardz) debuted today and brought a very interesting hack with it. According to the changelog the tool restores up to 70% of the mining performance on Ampere LHR graphics cards. It's just a partial bypass but NBMiner is on to something so we can't discard the possibility of a full workaround down the line. Sadly miners will probably have the LHR series on their radars with this new development. This comes as bad news for gamers as another shortage may be on the horizon.

NBMiner's solution is currently a work in progress. The developer recommends that miners use 68% of the graphics card's mining performance since that's the most stable value according to tests. The software works on both Linux and Windows operating systems and with Nvidia's latest GeForce drivers without a hiccup. However the hack only supports the ethash algorithm at the moment - other mining algorithms may be supported in the near future.

The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti was one of the best mining GPUs prior to Nvidia's crackdown on Ethereum mining. The coveted Ampere graphics card delivered a hash rate around the 60 MH/s range. Nvidia eventually gimped the mining performance in half. With this new bypass from NBMiner miners could potentially squeeze up to 41 MH/s out of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti LHR putting it in the alley of the Radeon RX 5600 XT or GeForce RTX 2070.

Ethereum's pending transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) model to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model aims to reduce power usage by up to 99.95% according to the Ethereum Foundation and eliminate the dependency on graphics card. The upgrade may happen by the end of 2021 or early 2022 so miners may have their days numbered."

The oil and gas sector has been experimenting with solar power as a generation source for oil operations for decades such as this Chevron (then ChevronTexaco) California project in 2003. As costs of solar come down and pressure intensifies on oil companies to cut emissions more renewable energy will de deployed but it may remain limited — in scope and effectiveness. David McNew | Getty Images News | Getty Images

Oil and gas companies are working hard on their messaging in the climate change era. If it's ""code red for humanity"" as the UN's IPCC said last Monday in its latest dire climate report it's some sort of ""code red"" for the fossil fuels industry too in terms of figuring out how to stay relevant believable — and for the market investable — in an era of carbon emissions reduction mandates from governments regulators and shareholders. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub took a stab at it earlier this year saying fossil fuels aren't the problem — it's emissions. It follows that if fossil fuel companies can find ways to eliminate emissions on a large enough scale maybe they can convince shareholders and stakeholders that they are moving into the future in more sustainable way. But there are big differences in emissions types and emissions reduction strategies. What oil and gas companies do to reduce emissions in their operations and supply chain are in the end a smaller part of the carbon reduction game than reducing what is known as Scope 3 emissions — for example from the tailpipe of your car. Those Scope 3 emissions by expert estimates are responsible for the vast majority of carbon emissions from the energy industry.

Lowering carbon emissions profile of oil and gas drilling

Companies including ExxonMobil have begun to disclose Scope 3 emissions but in terms of their efforts to reduce emissions remain focused on their own operations. What oil and gas companies do to lower operational emissions the energy used to power drilling and all the way to the trucks going to and from drilling sites does matter. Though how much it matters is inevitably smaller in the grander scheme of carbon emissions reduction efforts. ""The electricity oil and gas companies use is a pretty small contributor to their carbon footprint"" said Chris Archer head of Americas for Macquarie Capital's Green Investment Group. Occidental has been a leader in many of the new technology approaches to lowering the emissions profile of the oil and gas business. As Hollub told CNBC earlier this year ""The reality of a net-zero carbon barrel it is possible and we are doing things to make it possible. It's not a goal on a sheet of paper."" Occidental is working on multiple projects related to carbon sequestration not just for its operations but other heavy emitters in the industrial sector. A growing but smaller part of that new technology thinking for oil and gas operations which is expected to see more development in the future is solar energy — solar panel arrays spreading out in places like the Permian Basin to help lower the emissions profile of oil and gas operations. Occidental already has a 16 megawatt solar farm in the Permian — the first large-scale solar project to directly power oil and gas operations in Texas — and Hollub told CNBC earlier this year ""we will be doing more of that. We believe it will take everything and we will add more solar over time.""

Oil and gas industry's history with solar

Solar isn't a new thing for oil and gas. Chevron had a project powering operations in the Kern oil field of California as far back as 2003 and BP even got into solar panel manufacturing for decades under Sir John Browne's ""Beyond Petroleum"" mission (before solar manufacturing became mostly China's game and most everyone else went bankrupt). ""This isn't a brand new journey"" said Amy Chronis leader of Deloitte's US Oil Gas & Chemicals team in Houston. ""But it's still early days to see broad-based carbon reductions."" Now several of the European and U.S. majors are making major investments in renewable again including BP and Royal Dutch Shell  and all the big oil and gas companies have at least a few solar power projects whether they developed them on their own or signed what are known as power purchase agreements with project developers including ExxonMobil which has added to its renewable energy portfolio in recent years. It bought 500 megawatts of wind and solar in 2018 from Danish renewable energy company Orsted the largest renewable deal ever signed by a U.S. major. Chevron signed its own 500 MW project last summer with the energy generation to be split between the Permian Argentina and Kazakhstan. A lot of the renewable energy history within solar has been more fits and starts — and lower down the priority list —than consistent application to the business. Though the pressure is mounting. Benjamin Shattuck research director for Americas upstream oil and gas at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said most of the companies he follows in the U.S. are still fairly early on in their journey to a carbon reduction model but as environmental performance and ESG become more mainstream — he said ESG is top of agenda when he talks to oil CEOs lately —and more companies talk about net-zero targets and tie executive compensation to the goals the situation is rapidly changing. ""Oxy is one of the companies helping to lead the conversation between the Goldsmith solar plant [the 16 MW plant Hollub referenced] and longer-term carbon capture and storage they are thinking about it from a bold standpoint which is good to see. Everything points to it picking up and accelerating"" Shattuck said.

The Permian is well-suited to renewables

Places like the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico are well-suited to renewable energy with lots of land and a regulatory framework favorable to project development whether oil and gas or renewables but the economics have to make sense. And increasingly they do.

Archer says these companies can have a much bigger impact on carbon reduction through carbon capture efforts and flaring reduction than by going into renewables for the power. But the Permian Basin is one of the best places in the U.S. to cite solar with loads of cheap flat land and really good irradiance. ""Today solar for lots of oil and gas is the economic choice versus diesel generators"" Archer said. That implies solar and wind projects being developed may have been less about a focus on carbon reduction in his view than being driven by the power generation being economically competitive. And Archer said given how economic solar has become in places like the Permian if oil and gas companies were serious about it as a de-carbonization strategy we might have seen more of it already under development.

Never going to be oil's carbon solution

No one is suggesting solar is oil's solution. One or two solar plants ""won't move the needle"" Shattuck said. But larger power purchase agreements and multiple projects across companies in the sector isn't insignificant either in his view. ""More operations need to be powered from renewables whether they own the projects or are taking renewable generation from the grid"" Shattuck said. It's a complex process to attempt to make oil and gas drilling operations 100% renewable from running the drilling rigs to generators and compressors and fracking trucks to get people to and from the field. The energy being used to prepare and drill new wells is greater than for existing wells and these operations are not stationary either moving around the Permian from West Texas to New Mexico with electric needs variable. In other words if you build a solar plant in one area you can't just easily pick it up and move it to another where more wells are being focused on. That's why Shattuck said we may see more oil and gas companies signing power purchase agreements with project developers. ""In some cases that alleviates the capital risk"" he said. But all the diesel that is used today — especially the more remote a drilling site is —does represent a wide range of power replacement opportunities.

The oil field is emissions reduction 'low-hanging fruit'

Because Scope 3 emissions are the vast majority of emissions and the furthest from the oil and gas companies direct control — and maybe active interest in controlling with ExxonMobil saying that while it will track Scope 3 it is really up to society and consumers to make their own energy choices — renewable energy in the fields is in a sense the low-hanging fruit. ""Electrification of the oil field is important and solar and wind can play a role part of a larger puzzle that has to be solved. There isn't a single solution today that's the theme"" Shattuck said. ""It needs to be multi-technology for them."" This won't go over well with those ready to leave the fossil fuels economy behind because the model is in effect augmenting what oil and gas companies are doing in the oil field rather than representing any full-scale pivot. It's the emissions are the problem —not fossil fuels — of Hollub.

Building solar is not their solution. It's good asset management with economic benefits on their existing assets. But it's not a rubric through which they de-carbonize. Chris Archer Macquarie Capital's Green Investment Group

But that low-hanging fruit gives the companies a means to test the market see how investors and stakeholders react and going down the road of renewables because it's not what they have typically done in the past is part of the effort that will be put into winning back investors in the years ahead. ""They need to find out what's hitting the mark and what isn't and if Goldsmith [the Oxy solar project] is resonating well with investors then maybe they do more"" Shattuck said.

The first net-zero oil barrel

Archer worries it is still more about issuing a press release than executing on significant change and he is skeptical that these projects can change the image of these companies. ""When was the last time you bought something from Oxy? It's not like you're swayed as a consumer"" he said. ""Building a 20 MW solar farm and issuing a press release won't earn you many points. You need a bigger strategy and goals."" But while the consumer at the gas pump may not think in those carbon-neutral barrel terms today industrial buyers already do. ""We have talked to companies producing natural gas and the off taker is a utility and that utility does care about the carbon footprint about the gas burning in a power plant"" said Kate Hardin executive director of the Deloitte Research Center for Energy & Industrials. ""So maybe it is not as direct as a person as the end user in retail but companies buying the oil and gas may care."" And that is exactly what happened in early 2021 when Oxy shipped its first-ever carbon-neutral barrel of oil to India and issued a press release about it. There are multiple business cases to make in the future that revolve around more of these deals if on the margins and that relate back to the value of more renewable energy generation in the fields. Oil and gas companies need to find new competitive advantages and even if there is a case where the economics of a solar plant don't work on their own decreasing export risk could be another way to make the model productive. ""It will be interesting to watch that competition. It's proof of concept work really early on"" Shattuck said. That work comes at time when the sector is focused more on capital discipline and budget cuts then spending making it more difficult for oil and gas companies to pull the trigger on experiments with technology. One of the biggest questions for the future of the oil and gas industry is tied up in the question of how much renewable energy development it pursues — what percentage of the overall spending is earmarked for carbon emissions reduction. ""I don't think it will be an insignificant amount. If they want to continue to have access to funding and capital they will have to continue with a variety of these technologies and strategies and we will learn more about what's most effective"" Shattuck said. The oil and gas companies early work on solar implies they are learning and getting familiar with the technology and it will stay in the mix but other initiatives will be more material in Archer's view. ""Building solar is not their solution. It's good asset management with economic benefits on their existing assets. But it's not a rubric through which they de-carbonize. But we will see more of it"" he said. For a long time the oil and gas industry could do no right when it came to cutting spending and running operations on a more conservative basis. But in recent years the industry has been forced by investors to do just that. Now capital discipline is a top priority to stay in favor with investors. Carbon reduction efforts including renewable energy projects like solar are a different mode of thinking than deciding on exploration spending but there's a similarity: the companies are leapfrogging each other in terms of targets and as technology gets rolled out it will play a role in the sector players that investors decide on as the likely winners. ""It would be surprising if the budget line item is low"" Shattuck said. Especially with oil and gas executive compensation packages now much more frequently designed to only go up if carbon emissions go down.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of the pandemic shortages and supply-chain issues have clogged up practically every industry from manufacturing to transportation. One major product affected is semiconductors something you use throughout your entire day even if you don’t realize it. While it’s easy to ignore these industry hiccups the semiconductor shortage affects you in more ways than you might expect.

What is a semiconductor and how is it made?

Semiconductors also known as chips or microchips are tiny pieces of electronics that host billions of transistors within them. The transistors allow or disallow electrons to pass through them. The chips are found in thousands of products like phones dishwashers medical equipment spaceships and cars. They function as the “brain” of our electronics by running software manipulating data and controlling functions.

To make a single chip spends over three months in production encompasses over a thousand steps and requires giant factories dust-free rooms million-dollar machines molten-tin and lasers. This process is both extremely tedious and expensive. For example in order to even place the silicon into a chip-making machine in the first place a cleanroom is needed—so clean that a speck of dust can cause millions of dollars of wasted effort. The chip plants run 24/7 and it costs about $15 billion to build an entry-level factory due to the specialized equipment needed. To avoid losing money chipmakers must generate $3 billion in profit from each plant.

Why is there a shortage?

Many factors in the past year and a half have combined to cause this shortage. The complicated and expensive process of chip manufacturing is one of the major causes of the shortage. As a result there aren’t many chip manufacturing plants in the world so a problem in one factory causes a ripple effect throughout the industry.

However the biggest cause of the shortage can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. First of all many factories closed at the beginning of the pandemic meaning that supplies needed for chip manufacturing were unavailable for a few months. Multiple industries involved with the chips such as shipping manufacturing and transportation faced labor shortages as well. Additionally more consumers desired electronics in light of stay-at-home and work-from-home measures causing orders requiring chips to pile up.

Furthermore COVID caused Asian ports to shut down for a few months. Since 90% of the world’s electronics go through China’s Yantian port this closure caused a huge problem in the shipping of electronics and parts required for chip manufacturing.

If all of the COVID-related issues weren’t enough various weather issues have inhibited production as well. Japan’s Renesas plant which creates about ⅓ of the chips used in cars was severely damaged by a fire in March 2021 and operations did not return to normal until July. Winter storms in Texas at the end of 2020 forced some of America’s already small number of chip plants to halt production. Lastly severe droughts in Taiwan in early 2021 the leading country of chip production caused production to slow down as chip production requires a great deal of water.

How does the shortage affect you?

The sheer amount of consumer products that contain semiconductor chips used every day makes the severity of the shortage clear. Device prices will likely go up and other products will be delayed. There are estimates that US Manufacturers will make at least 1.5 to 5 million fewer cars this year. For example Nissan announced that it will be making 500000 fewer vehicles due to the chip shortage. General Motors even temporarily shut down all three of its North American plants in early 2021 parking thousands of vehicles that are completed except for their needed chips.

Consumer electronic companies stockpiled chips early in the pandemic out of caution. However in July Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the chip shortage will likely delay iPhone production and has already impacted sales of iPads and Macs. Sony similarly acknowledged that they can not keep up with demand for the new PS5.

Home appliances such as microwaves dishwashers and washing machines have already been tougher to purchase. Many home appliance companies like Electrolux can not meet the demand for all of their products. Smart home appliances like video doorbells are equally at risk.

With the holiday season almost ahead there is a caution to not expect the vast variety of electronic options that we are used to in typical years—“out of stock” warnings may be increasingly common. There is an urge to plan ahead and not expect to order and receive products immediately.

What is the future of the shortage?

There is a light at the end of the tunnel with the semiconductor shortage. First of all COVID-19 closures of factories and labor shortages are beginning to alleviate. Major companies like TSMC and Samsung have also pledged billions of dollars together to invest in capacity for the supply chain and incentives for chipmakers.

A major realization from this shortage is the fact that there must be a decreased reliance on Taiwan and South Korea. Currently America only makes about 10% of the chips it uses increasing shipping costs and time with the chips from overseas. To address this issue Joe Biden pledged to support the semiconductor sector with a tech funding bill introduced in June which dedicates $52 billion for US chip production. Intel is spending $20 billion on two new factories in Arizona. Military and Space semiconductor manufacturer CAES expects to expand its workforce significantly during the next year with an emphasis on getting chips from U.S. plants as well.

This shortage shocked the industry but also alerted it of future issues with the increased demand for items that require many semiconductors like smart homes and electric vehicles. It will hopefully heed a sort of warning for the chip production industry preventing future issues of this caliber.

We estimate the revenue to grow around 5% levels in Q3 2021 driven by cloud and computing segments offsetting a slow quarter for smart devices business (re: Apple) and some headwinds from component supply crunch as well as pandemic peaking in some Asian markets home to company’s operations.

Long-Term Strategy & Outlook: Boost Gross Margins

Looking at the new growth segments globally with AI Robotics and Electric Vehicles  Hon Hai wants to cash in on these segments via its F3.0 strategy

and  Hon Hai wants to cash in on these segments via its F3.0 strategy For example Hon Hai made series of investments partnerships and new alliances over the last 12 months in the EV Space with huge ambitions to capture more value across the EV value chain from semiconductors to chassis design to software to assembling to services.

From a semiconductor perspective  Hon hai also wants to control the upstream supply chain for a more integrated offering have invested in: 8-inch wafer fab ( DNex / SilTerra  Malaysia) – focusing on mature nodes 110nm 6-inch wafer fab from Macronix in Hsinchu to develop components such as SiC MOSFETs for EVs KoreSemi in Qingdao GigaSolar Materials to develop EV Battery materials

 Hon hai also wants to control the upstream supply chain for a more integrated offering have invested in: From software and services perspective  If Tesla is the iPhone of the EV market HonHai wants to become the “Android” of the EV market via its EV Open Market platform. So this is from a software perspective.

 If Tesla is the iPhone of the EV market via its EV Open Market platform. So this is from a software perspective. From a hardware perspective Foxconn is also looking to set up additional factories in Thailand and the USA to produce EVs via contract manufacturing (e.g. Fisker Byton Geely Stellantis) and for prospective new entrants relying on the company for the entire EV stack.

The Mumbai-based conglomerate is gearing up to foray into semiconductor manufacturing. The decision has come in the wake of a global shortage of chips and semiconductors in the pandemic-wounded world.

According to a Business Standard report N Chandrasekaran at the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry said “Tata Group has already shifted its focus into multiple new businesses like 5G Network equipment high-tech manufacturing of electronics and semiconductors. “India can benefit from the global rebalancing of supply chains. A domestic electronics industry is capable of churning $1 Trillion in GDP and creating millions of jobs. We have already set up a business to seize the opportunity"" he added.

Semiconductors are the brain behind any electronic technology. Earlier the key players in the supply chain were limited to China South Korea and Taiwan. However post the pandemic there is a substantial shift in other country’s reliance on China. In addition to that manufacturing plants in South Korea and Taiwan shut closed due to COVID-19.

On the one hand where plants were being shut on the other hand there was a sharp increase in the demand for electronic devices like smartphones laptops etc. The confluence of both phenomena led to a global shortage of silicon chips. The deficit of chips is projected to last till 2022.

Also Watch:

With Tata tapping in on the toppling sector of chips and semiconductors it can hugely benefit the auto industry as semiconductors in cars are used in myriad ways such as fuel-pressure sensors navigation displays instrument consoles speedometers etc. Tata Motors including other subsidiaries can proliferate profits as the automotive giant recently announced that its subsidiary Jaguar-Land Rover would incur huge losses due to the lack of silicon chips in the United Kingdom.

The US is confronted with a historic defeat in Afghanistan at the hands of the Taliban. America's longest war which began in 2001 is ending in complete humiliation. The Taliban has captured the countryside every major city and now Kabul has effectively fallen. This is Saigon in 1975 all over again except the US withdrawal from Vietnam took place in 1972 and its puppet government managed to survive another three years. America's puppet government in Kabul has fallen only four months after the announcement in April that the US would withdraw. It tells us that the Kabul government and the American occupation had only a tiny sliver of popular support: The condition for the former's survival was America's troops and airforce. In contrast the Taliban clearly enjoys considerable backing amongst the people.The last two decades have been disastrous for the US. The election of George W. Bush in 2000 was supposed to mark according to its neo-conservative doctrine the beginning of a new American century and the continuation of the US' unipolar moment following the end of the Cold War. Instead it led to the humiliating defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan followed in 2008 by the worst financial crisis since 1931. By the time of Bush's departure in 2008 unipolarity was effectively dead and America's reputation for military prowess had been undermined. America is now widely seen as a superpower in rapid decline a pale shadow of what it once was. Its defeat in Afghanistan will have major implications across the world; It brings into question the competence of its political and military leadership its willingness to engage in further military entanglements and its reliability and commitment as an ally. If it can make such a huge miscalculation and suffer such a catastrophic defeat in Afghanistan then who is going to trust its judgement in East Asia or the South China Sea.Military power has been fundamental to America's global role since 1945. It played a key role in undermining the Soviet Union during the Cold War. America has long believed that overweening military strength was the primary factor in enabling it to get its way in the world. That is why its military expenditure has been far greater than that of any other country. The first great setback to this philosophy was Vietnam. Now we have the examples of Iraq and Afghanistan. In each of these cases America enjoyed a massive military advantage but in the circumstances it proved entirely inadequate. The key was to win over the people and military superiority could not win hearts and minds the contrary in fact.The US of course is not alone in having failed to conquer Afghanistan. Down the ages many foreign powers have tried including Britain and the Soviet Union. There has been speculation in the West that perhaps China might try its hand next. The chances of China being so stupid are zero. In fact nothing better illustrates the fundamental difference between China and the US than their approach to Afghanistan. The US sought to subdue the country overwhelmingly by force. It offered precious little else. There was no serious attempt to foster economic growth in a desperately poor country. China's approach in contrast will be completely different. There will be no military involvement. The PLA will have no role. China in the longer term will attach the greatest importance to how it can assist in the economic development of the country just as it has done in Africa Latin America and South East Asia. Development has been the calling card of China. It lies at the heart of the Belt and Road Initiative. The fact that China has been a developing country since 1949 gives it an understanding and empathy with the problems of the developing world. The US as a rich society has little comprehension of or interest in their problems.China will have another overriding concern. While the US has spent 20 years waging a war in Afghanistan that has sown profound divisions and instability in a country and a region that is over 11000 kilometres away China's interest is the opposite. As a country that shares a border with Afghanistan it will seek to bring stability to the country and to the wider region not least because this also has implications for the situation in Xinjiang. Above all China understands that instability and war are the enemy of economic development.The fundamental difference in the approach of China and the US has of course much deeper historical roots. The credo of America ever since its birth has been expansion - across its own continent the Pacific and since 1945 across the whole world with nearly 800 military bases in over 70 countries. In contrast China has no such history and has never regarded military power as paramount. While the US has pursued global expansion China has prioritized its own stability and development.The author was until recently a Senior Fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies at Cambridge University.

Playback singer Benny Dayal is one of the judges in the eighth season of Super Singer which is currently being aired on Vijay Television. Along with Benny Anuradha Sriram SP Charan and Unnikrishnan have been judging the music reality show on the channel for the past few seasons.

Today Benny's latest post on Instagram has come as a shock to everyone. He said that he cannot take the hate messages anymore and hence he wouldn't be part of Super Singer from next season. It is the outcome of the hate comments he has receiving as a result of being the judge of Super Singer 8.

Dayal wrote ""I will no more be posting anything associated with Super Singer 8. I can't take all the hate messages. Thank you for all the love you have shown me. I am human after all. I'm done. Thank you. Won't see you next season."" While the singer has not stated the reason directly the fans are suspecting that is because of a contestant's recent elimination from the Super Singer 8 show.

Sridhar Sena is a very versatile and talented contestant in Super Singer 8. He has been the best performer on several rounds of the contest. Unfortunately Sridhar was eliminated from the show last week. The audience of the show thinks that the judges eliminated him though there were weaker contestants than him. The fans who thought the decision was biased showed their anger at Benny Dayal on his Instagram page as he was the one who announced the elimination.

Benny who felt that he doesn't deserve this much hate has vented out his feelings on his post. There are both positive and negative comments in that post too. The singer has been responding to some of them. Dayal reportedly could not take the hate comments which is what made him take this decision. He added that he won't post anything regarding Super Singer in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhZ2xpdHouY29tL2FudS1lbW1hbnVlbC1ob3QtcGhvdG9zaG9vdC1waWN0dXJlcy1nb2VzLXZpcmFsLXRhbWlsLW5ld3MtMjkzMDEy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sivakarthikeyan film actress Anu Emmanuel treats fans with extreme hotness! - Tamil News,"American Indian actress Anu Emmanuel who was inactive in the year 2020 has heated up her timeline by posting some glamorous photos to treat her fans with her daily dose of extreme hotness.

Who could possibly be against that? Except the trouble as it always is when it comes to measures like censorship is that the people doing the censoring usually have a very different definition of what an “extremist and hate movement” is than you the reader does. For them it might be someone who talks about “revolution” or “eating the rich” someone who protested against police brutality last year or simply groups and people that fight for the rights of Palestinians. In fact this exact thing has already happened once before with PayPal which has been banning and cancelling the accounts of various groups and individuals over the last few years. In 2018 the company came under fire when alongside its ban of the far-right Proud Boys it also threw in the accounts of several anti-fascist groups for good measure. Just like when Reddit included a host of left-leaning subreddits in its purge of violent and hateful content last year these platforms have a commercial interest in appearing to be equally opposed to extremists on “both sides” even when one of those sides is violent racists like the Proud Boys and the other is people who oppose and confront those racists. But PayPal’s partnership with the ADL threatens to go even further down this worrying road. The ADL which was founded in 1913 as the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith has been on the right side of many issues related to racism and intolerance but it also has a long history of acting as essentially an informal lobbying group for the Israeli government and in the process conflating opposition to Israel’s apartheid policies with actual antisemitism — as well as attacking the Left and skirting dangerously close to bigotry itself.

A Checkered Past This history goes all the way back to the 1960s when the ADL’s then-leader attacked the famed civil rights group the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee over its anti-Zionist stance charging it with “extremism” and ties to “the Chinese-Soviet and now Arab propaganda machines” and putting it in the same league as the Ku Klux Klan. In the words in 1961 of its national director the ADL “for many years has maintained a very important confidential investigative coverage of Arab activities and propaganda” and “an information-gathering operation since 1948” focusing on Arab state organizations and groups. By 1993 a police raid on its California headquarters found this surveillance went much much further encompassing more than six hundred mostly liberal organizations including the NAACP ACLU and the International Indian Treaty Council. But that’s ancient history by now right? Unfortunately not. Under its former president Abe Foxman with whom the ADL was virtually synonymous for years the organization began increasingly embracing Washington’s Islamophobic “war on terror” and subsuming its stated principle of ensuring “a world in which no group or individual suffers from bias discrimination or hate” to the more central goal of defending Israeli apartheid and maintaining the government connections to do so. When the Right freaked out over the intentionally misnamed “Ground Zero mosque” — a classic case of right-wing cancel culture targeting a planned Islamic cultural center with a pool and basketball court that was to be built two blocks away from where the Twin Towers had stood — Foxman sided with them. Just as “survivors of the Holocaust are entitled to feelings that are irrational” he said to widespread condemnation September 11 victims’ families’ “anguish entitles them to positions that others would categorize as irrational or bigoted.” On the ADL’s one-hundred-year anniversary Foxman claimed that Jews had it worse than Muslims and that anti-Muslim hatred “didn’t happen” after September 11 before explaining that Rep. Peter King’s call for more surveillance of Muslims was “a natural response” and blaming “Muslim communities that have been brought in and are not assimilating.” The ADL often set its sights and energies not so much on white supremacists and neo-Nazis but on liberal Jewish organizations critical of Israel and various college campus groups that organized around Palestinian justice. Fittingly the ADL never said a thing about the NYPD’s outrageous spying on Muslim New Yorkers and actually bestowed an award on the man who had overseen it. He was one of the officers who had been trained in the counterterrorism exchange program with Israel that the ADL has sponsored since 2004 educating US police in the tactics used by the country’s abusive security services. For the ADL a commitment to the defense of the Israeli government came to supersede all other considerations as when Foxman opposed a congressional resolution to finally label the Turkish slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians a genocide — a stance the ADL reportedly adopted to protect Israel’s strategic relationship with Turkey. During this period the ADL often set its sights and energies not so much on white supremacists and neo-Nazis but on liberal Jewish organizations critical of Israel and various college campus groups that organized around Palestinian justice. Among its semiregular list of the “Top 10 Anti-Israel Groups in the U.S.” it listed institutions like J Street New Israel Fund Code Pink Jewish Voice for Peace and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights a coalition of 380 organizations opposing Israeli apartheid some of them Jewish charging they were “fixated with delegitimizing Israel” and pushing a “misleading narrative” about the country. It praised a 2010 Education Department decision to use the 1964 Civil Rights Act to “protect” Jewish college students from “anti-Israel and anti-Zionist sentiment that crosses the line into anti-Semitism” compared a talk at Brooklyn College about boycotting Israel to the Ku Klux Klan holding an event about maintaining a white-dominated America and denounced a Harvard conference on the idea of a one-state solution — in which Jews and Palestinians would live together within a single state — as “the elimination of Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish people.” This regular conflation of Israel with all Jews everywhere and the implication that the distinct interests of each were really one and the same somehow coexists with the organization’s practice of lobbing accusations of antisemitism at left-leaning targets over poorly phrased statements that could be interpreted as advancing the racist idea of “dual loyalty.” To wit when former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he would be trying to torpedo Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran by delivering an outrageous speech to Congress as “a representative of the entire Jewish people” the ADL didn’t condemn this clearly antisemitic trope. Instead it criticized J Street for asking Jews to sign a petition saying that Netanyahu “doesn’t speak for me” which Foxman called “inflammatory and repugnant.” Note that at the same time the ADL fixated on criticism of Israeli policies and kept a laser focus on pop culture and obvious satire it was deathly silent about the many many stunningly racist things that actual Israeli officials regularly said out loud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9lc3BvcnRzL3NtYWxsLXN0cmVhbWVycy1tYXktZG9vbWVkLW5ldy1wYXlwYWwtZG9uYXRpb24tZmVlLWNoYW5nZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Small Streamers may be doomed after this new PayPal donation fee change,"Recently online payments system/platform PayPal introduced a change in its’ merchant fees bringing forth a range of reactions from concerned “smaller” streamers.

The online payment system has increased its merchant fees especially for smaller transactions. With most Twitch streamers generally receiving $1 or $2 donations on the platform this has been said to be a problem for small streamers who depend on thes.

Earlier PayPal allowed streamers to receive $.67 for every $1 donation. On August 9 the platform saw a change in fee which means that streamers will now receive only $.48 for every $1 donation which is less than half of the amount!

The new surcharge percentage decreases for transactions of higher value with $20 donation now netting Twitch streamers $18.93 instead of $19.12 that they previously got.

Streamers PayPal has recently increased its transaction fees. A $1 tip will now only net you $0.48. That's right less than half of a $1 tip actually goes to you.

Small streamers expected to see decrease in earnings after PayPal increases merchant fees on small transactions

The updated merchant fees for domestic and foreign transactions as well as donations can be seen on this link. Earlier PayPal used to charge a $.30 fee for every transaction along with 2.9% of the overall value of the transaction. Now the fee has been reduced to 2.89% with the additional surcharge being increased to $.49. In such a scenario streamers receiving larger donations have hardly seen a change. However smaller donations are bound to be affected with a $2 donation now resulting in the streamer receiving only $1.45.

The following screenshot can be seen to get a detailed look at how the new system has brought forth a marked change in earnings for smaller streamers.

As expected a range of smaller streamers complained about the issue on Twitter. Quite a few creators might be forced to use other payment services to receive donations.

Correction to above statement. If someone donates 1 dollar to a streamer PayPal takes over 50% of it due to their transaction fees. The ratio would be less with higher transaction amounts I'd assume. PayPal's transaction fee is 2.89% + $0.49. — Kaz (@EternalKaz_) August 9 2021 Expand Tweet

Twitch allows affiliated streamers to directly send the money that they receive to their bank accounts. Streamers can also make use of snail mail to receive their earnings.

Finally streamers can also get rid of PayPal as the middleman in these transactions by using other donation services such as Twitch Bits PeachPay or DonorBox.

It boasts 295 million customers globally and touts a host of benefits to retailers to integrate its payment processing services – allowing retailers large and small to accept payments manage their supply chain and pay suppliers currency conversion services and access to insight on customer behaviour.

PayPal also claims that its systems can help detect fraud offers protection for sellers and can help manage disputes between buyers and businesses and being a multi-billion-dollar technology business offers slick tech to help businesses manage their money online.

So given the scale and access that PayPal can offer businesses it has become an incredibly common form of payment. But you’re absolutely right there are some differences in your consumer protections when you pay in this way.

Let’s start with Section 75. What you’re referring to is Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 the legislation that governs how the credit market works. It is one of the most powerful weapons in a shopper’s arsenal to deploy when things go wrong with a purchase.

It makes your credit card company jointly liable with the retailer for a breach of contract making it just as responsible for the goods or service supplied as the retailer. So if something goes wrong – the item doesn’t turn up or the retailer has gone bust – you can put a claim into your credit card company to get your money back. It even applies to foreign transactions.

The goods or service you bought must have cost over £100 and not more than £30000 for it to apply though you don’t actually need to spend that much on your credit card – a £1 deposit for goods costing between £100 and £30000 would still entitle you to protection.

However there are some instances where Section 75 may not apply although you start entering some grey areas here. For Section 75 to be applicable there needs to be three parties – the buyer the seller and the credit card firm. But sometimes the link between the retailer and buyer is broken – for example if there is a business taking payment that is acting as an agent for the seller.

For example you might want to buy theatre tickets. If you buy them from the venue Section 75 is likely to apply. If you buy them through an agency it might not as the credit card company may argue that the purchase was not made to the supplier of the goods.

It is a similar issue with PayPal and other third-party payment processors. Essentially by using PayPal you are breaking the chain between your credit card provider and the retailer – in essence paying PayPal to then pay the retailer.

PayPal does have its own buyer protection scheme which is designed to reimburse you if you have problems with your order. Which? research carried out last year has found that 71 per cent of people were satisfied with the way PayPal’s buyer protection process worked and 61 per cent said it was easy to do.

But this protection is not enshrined in law – making it less powerful than Section 75. However there are some arguments that state that Section 75 can be applied to some PayPal payments.

If you use your credit card to pay for something through PayPal and the funds go direct to the seller then as long as the company you're buying from has a 'Commercial Entity Agreement' with PayPal you may still be able to claim against your credit card company under Section 75 for any misrepresentation or breach of contract by the seller.

PayPal does have a banking license in the UK which means it is regulated and that gives you access to the Financial Ombudsman Service – an organisation that mediates disputes between consumers and financial firms. So if you were unhappy with PayPal when something went wrong with a purchase you do have the ability to escalate your complaint.",,,,,,

PEP,PepsiCo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaHVzdGxlLmNvL3RoZS10aW1lLXBlcHNpLWdvdC1zdWVkLWZvci1hLTMzbS1maWdodGVyLWpldNIBTmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaHVzdGxlLmNvL3RoZS10aW1lLXBlcHNpLWdvdC1zdWVkLWZvci1hLTMzbS1maWdodGVyLWpldD9oc19hbXA9dHJ1ZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The time Pepsi got sued for a $33m fighter jet,"In the spring of 1996 Pepsi debuted a hot new TV commercial.

It opens with a cocky teenager donning a Pepsi shirt. The text “T-SHIRT 75 PEPSI POINTS” appears to the beat of a military drum line.

Said teen then swaggers through a door in a leather jacket (“LEATHER JACKET 1450 PEPSI POINTS”) and flips on a pair of blue-tinted sunglasses (“SHADES 175 PEPSI POINTS”).

The narrator chimes in — “The more Pepsi you drink the more great stuff you’re gonna get!” — and the scene shifts to the teen landing a computer-generated Harrier fighter jet in front of his high school blowing the clothes off a bewildered principal in the parking lot.

“HARRIER FIGHTER … 7000000 PEPSI POINTS” flashes across the screen as the music crescendos into a fade-out.

Via YouTube (nonfps)

The commercial was the national debut of a promotion called Pepsi Stuff.

It was per The New York Times the “largest promotional campaign in the company’s history” — one that Pepsi hoped would steal market share from Coca-Cola at the tail end of the decades-long Cola Wars.

In total this promotion cost Pepsi an estimated $200m ($350m today) to roll out including $125m worth of merchandise.

Pepsi Stuff worked like so:

Billions of Pepsi products around the US were marked with “Pepsi Points.” A 2-liter bottle of Pepsi was worth 2 points; a 12-pack of cans yielded 5. Customers could save up the points and redeem them for items listed in a Pepsi Stuff catalog. Customers could also purchase Pepsi Points for 10 cents each.

The catalog included 53 items in total — most of which were your run-of-the-mill corporate swag: T-shirts hats and beach towels.

The Hustle

Notably absent from this list of items was the Harrier fighter jet.

Most of the kids who saw the commercial — members of the so-called “Pepsi Generation” a new class of youthful consumers who cared more about lifestyle than brands — figured that the jet was part of Pepsi’s zany sense of humor and not a real prize.

But in Seattle Washington a young man named John Leonard wasn’t laughing.

I’ll take the jet

Leonard first saw the commercial during a Pacific Northwest test run in February of 1996.

Then a 21-year-old business student at Shoreline Community College he saw the Harrier jet as a legitimate offer — and sniffed an opportunity for promotional arbitrage.

He knew from an interest in flying that the Harrier was a US Marine Corps aircraft used extensively in the Gulf War. Capable of taking off vertically and carrying 10k pounds of bombs it had been called the “most captivating and the most dangerous plane in the US military.”

Moreover it cost ~$33m to manufacture and — needless to say — wasn’t available to the general public.

At 7m Pepsi Points the jet was a steal. So he decided to go for it.

Leonard during a CBS interview in 1996 (CBS News via YouTube)

Leonard was a 10-cans-per-day kind of guy.

But even at this high rate of consumption collecting 7m points was a daunting task.

Each 12-pack of Pepsi was worth 5 points meaning he’d have to consume 16.8m cans to reach his mark. That amounted to:

46k cans every day for 1 year

cans every day for 1 year 552k total ounces of Pepsi

total ounces of Pepsi 2.5B calories and 689m grams of sugar

calories and grams of sugar ~$4m in expenditure

Luckily there was a workaround.

The catalog only required participants to submit 15 points they’d collected from cans and bottles; the rest could be bought directly from Pepsi for 10 cents each by mailing in a check.

All Leonard had to do to get 7m points was raise $700k.

Over several months the enterprising college student put together a business plan researched case law on promotional advertisements and convinced several investors — wealthy clients he’d met while working as a climbing guide — to front the cash.

On March 28 1996 he mailed 15 Pepsi Points along with a check for $700008.50 (including shipping) to Pepsi and politely asked for his jet.

Several weeks later Leonard received a reply from Pepsi.

The company returned Leonard’s check threw in some pity coupons and made it clear that the jet in the commercial was purely “fanciful.”

By this point Leonard had already sunk ~$4k into consulting with legal professionals and researching case law on deceptive advertising.

Instead of backing down he secured an attorney and doubled down on his demand:

A mock-up of Leonard’s correspondence with Pepsi (legal proceedings via Justia)

Leonard’s letter made the rounds at PepsiCo and eventually ended up in the hands of BBDO New York the advertising firm Pepsi had retained to create the commercial.

A VP at the firm Raymond E. McGovern Jr. seemed perplexed by Leonard’s persistence.

“I find it hard to believe that you are of the opinion that the Pepsi Stuff commercial really offers a new Harrier Jet” he wrote back. “No reasonable person would agree with your analysis of the commercial.”

So Leonard decided to go to battle for his fighter jet.

A battle in the courts

With the help of counsel Leonard filed suit claiming that Pepsi’s ad had constituted as a binding offer and that the company had breached contract by refusing to exchange 7m Pepsi Points for a Harrier jet.

A flood of news reports followed the filing — and Pepsi made no qualms about publicly sharing its thoughts on the matter.

“Tens of millions of Americans and people around the world saw the spot got the joke and laughed” a PepsiCo spokesman told CBS News. “Mr. Leonard saw the spot hired business advisers and lawyers and decided to take legal action.”

“I didn’t want any publicity on this” Leonard retorted. “I’m not trying to make a statement. I’m not looking for a settlement. I just want a plane.”

In an interview with The Associated Press he reiterated that he was “simply trying to take Pepsi up on an offer it made to the public.”

PepsiCo the parent company of Pepsi beverages was swift to counterattack.

The conglomerate responded with its own suit in New York seeking to recoup $88162 in attorney’s fees and dismiss Leonard’s claims as frivolous without going to trial.

As things often play out in America’s justice system the case turned into a 3-year-long procedural slog before making its way to Judge Kimba Wood of New York’s Southern District Court.

Ultimately the case came down to whether Pepsi’s TV ad constituted a legally binding “offer.”

And on Aug. 5 1999 Judge Wood ruled resoundingly in Pepsi’s favor.

Newspapers around the country followed Leonard’s saga (various news sources; 1999)

The decision came down to 3 key points:

Advertisements are generally not considered offers in contract law: “Ads for the sale of goods (TV radio newspaper newsletter)… are merely the requests to offer or negotiate” and an advertiser must accept an offer from a customer for it to be legally formed. The ad was obviously a joke: An “ordinary reasonable person” would conclude that a soft drink company would not give away a fighter plane as part of a promotion. An enforceable contract requires both parties’ signatures: Under existing law any contract for the sale of goods worth $500+ must be evidenced by writing; Pepsi did not sign anything.

Leonard would not get his jet.

But as a Defense Department spokesman clarified a fully demilitarized jet probably wouldn’t have been much fun anyway.

“Even if the lad were able to get the plane from Pepsi it would not be one he could fly” the official said at a Pentagon briefing.

The aftermath

After mounting an unsuccessful appeal in 2000 Leonard pursued his next adventure.

He moved to Alaska where he became the chief mountaineering ranger at Denali National Park. In recent years he was promoted to the DC Bureau of the National Park Service.

Despite — or perhaps thanks to — the controversial press Pepsi Stuff was a massive success.

The company did not respond to requests to comment on the campaign’s impact. But in 1996 one Pepsi executive called it “by far the most successful promotion” the company had ever run.

After Leonard’s lawsuit was filed the Harrier jet commercial continued to air but with some minor tweaks to drive home the joke.

The points for the jet were increased from 7m to 700m and 2 words were tacked onto the closing text: “just kidding.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY2xhc3NpYy1zb2RhLWJyYW5kcy11cGRhdGluZy1mb3JtdWxhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Classic Soda Brands That Are Updating Their Formulas Right Now,"Without even thinking about it you count on your favorite beverage to consistently deliver the flavor you crave.

4 Major Coca-Cola Brand Changes…

Recently Coca-Cola's been making some major shifts perhaps most notably in the form of discontinuations. In the spring the Coca-Cola Company announced the discontinuation of Coke Energy. This had been preceded by last fall's news that for the first time since 1963 Coca-Cola will no longer make Tab; nor are they continuing production of Odwalla juices and smoothies or Zico coconut water.

It's been reported that the shuttering of Coca-Cola's quieter-performing brands is due in large part to James Quincey the Coca-Cola Company's CEO since 2016 and chairman of the board since 2019 and his desire for aggressive investment in business development strategies and progressive corporate social responsibility initiatives like recycling.

Devyani International Ltd (DIL) largest franchisee of Yum Brands in India has formalised an extension of its partnership with UK-based cafe chain Costa Coffee. DIL entered into a revised development agreement for its existing Costa Coffee business on August 14 2021 following which DIL has been granted development rights across India in a phased manner.This agreement has initially granted DIL development rights for a period of five years and extendable from time to time subject to meeting of development and contractual obligations a company spokesperson said in a statement.While Coca-Cola acquired Costa Coffee globally three years back in India Costa Coffee has been operated by rival PepsiCo’s exclusive and biggest bottling partner RJ Corp-owned DIL since 2005. India is among the few markets where Costa Coffee is aligned directly with a PepsiCo bottling partner.However in India Costa Coffee remains a small business unlike scale players such as Starbucks and Cafe Coffee Day. The number of Costa Coffee stores in India also reduced from about 70 in 2018 to 44 as on June this year. DIL presently runs two formats of Costa Coffee stores—full retail at high-street locations and malls and branded kiosks at airports hospitals and food courts at highways.Coca-Cola had bought out Whitbread Plc-owned UK cafe chain Costa Coffee in a global $5.1-billion buyout in 2018. Costa Coffee is UK’s biggest coffee chain and Coca-Cola’s global buyout of the cafe chain set it in direct competition with rivals such as Starbucks and is seen as a bid to hedge its risks in a sluggish soft drinks market and broaden its portfolio beyond sugary drinks.DIL is also among the largest operators of chain quick service restaurants KFC and Pizza Hut and operates 735 stores across India Nepal and Nigeria as of June 30 2021. Its business is broadly classified into three verticals that includes stores of KFC Pizza Hut and Costa Coffee. DIL’s other businesses include Vaango and Food Street.DIL will be listing on the stock exchange on Monday following its initial public offer (IPO) earlier this month to raise ₹1838 crore.For the year ended March 2021 DIL reported revenue of ₹1135 crore which was 25% lower compared to the previous year.In an interview last fortnight RJ Corp chairman Ravi Jaipuria said DIL expects to turn profitable this financial year if there is no third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The quick service restaurant chain operator is betting on bullish consumer sentiment and strong brand pull to turn profitable. An India Foodservice Delivery Report (IFDR) released last week estimated that by 2024-25 the gross merchandise value (GMV) of the food services delivery market would increase to $36 billion from $5.3 billion in 2019-20 riding on an increase in average order value frequency and penetration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2dlYXIvcHJvZHVjdHMtd2Vlay1jaGVlemUtcG9udG9vbi1ib2F0cy1ib296eS1tb3VudGFpbi1kZXfSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVob29rLmNvbS9nZWFyL3Byb2R1Y3RzLXdlZWstY2hlZXplLXBvbnRvb24tYm9hdHMtYm9venktbW91bnRhaW4tZGV3L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Products of the Week: Cheeze-It Merch Pontoon Boats and Boozy Mountain Dew,"Nota bene: If you buy through the links in this article we may earn a small share of the profits.

Bourla told the Financial Times how Israel came to be picked as the location of a real-world examination of the vaccine’s efficacy in return for supplies of the shots.

The pharma giant’s head said the Jewish state was a small nation with a good system for collecting data: Greece had been considered but electronic medical record-keeping was not good enough; and Sweden was dismissed amid concerns that other European Union countries could be angered if the Scandinavian nation were singled out.

The Pfizer boss said that a key factor in the choice of Israel was Netanyahu’s persistence. But Bourla said he was aware that it was in the Likud leader’s political interest to be seen as bringing the country out of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year ahead of yet another election.

“The biggest thing that became clear was Bibi was on top of everything he knew everything” Bourla said using Netanyahu’s nickname. “He called me 30 times asking: ‘What about young people . . . what are you doing about the South African variant?’ I’m sure he was doing it for his people but I’m also sure he was thinking: ‘It could help me politically.’”

Vaccine doses began arriving in Israel in December. The country announced in January that it had struck a deal with Pfizer promising to share vast troves of medical data with the international drug giant in exchange for the continued flow of its hard-to-get shots.

Israel home to some 9.3 million people was considered an ideal place for studying the vaccine in a real-world setting. Its mandatory universal health care is provided by four publicly funded HMOs with meticulously digitized medical records.

While the mass vaccination drive temporarily appeared to bring Israel out of the pandemic the arrival of the highly contagious Delta variant has now plunged the country back into crisis. The government has launched a fresh campaign to give booster shots to all those age 50 and up in a bid to strengthen immune defenses and bring the disease back under control.

Bourla has spoken with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett since he became premier although Netanyahu has also called the Pfizer boss behind the premier’s back.

The Pfizer boss also discussed the fact that he is increasingly talking about being the son of Holocaust survivors.

“I was never vocal about these things” he said. “Even my closest friends knew only a little of it.”

Bourla said that his father hid during the Holocaust and at the end of World War II discovered that his parents and two of his three siblings were among the tens of thousands of Jews from Thessaloniki who were killed.

Bourla’s mother was captured during the war and only escaped being killed by a firing squad because her Christian brother-in-law gave “all his money to pay bribes.”

The CEO said that it was not his story to tell but his mother’s. “I don’t want it to become folklore because it may be inspirational or not but . . . she was the one who was arrested she was sexually abused and physically abused at 17 18 years old.”

Bourla said experiences during the war were openly discussed in the family.

“They never spoke [of] revenge… If you have ever seen an Italian film La Vita è Bella it was kind of like that: a story of horror but given with humor” he said.

Bourla said his mother and father had very different approaches to life in the wake of their experiences during the Holocaust.

“‘Life is miraculous’ [my mother] told me. ‘I was in front of a firing squad seconds before they pulled the trigger and I survived. And look at me now. Nothing is impossible. You can do anything you want’” Bourla said.

“What I got from my dad was to identify what can go wrong” he added.

That trial’s completion date is in 2022. Phase 3 results generally are required before regulatory approval.

“We are confident in this vaccine and the third dose but you have to remember the vaccine efficacy study is still going on so we need all the evidence to back up that” Jerica Pitts Pfizer’s director of global media relations said Monday. The financial stakes are enormous: Pfizer announced in July that it expects $33.5 billion in COVID-19 vaccine revenue this year.

Meanwhile Pfizer recently said that if a third dose couldn’t combat the delta or other variants the drugmaker is poised to come up with a “tailor-made” vaccine within 100 days.

All of this has sown a sense of confusion about what exactly will work and when. The pharmaceutical industry’s rush to recommend boosters for the public is “a little frustrating” said Dr. Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and an adviser to the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. Even if a booster is found to be safe he said the U.S. effort should focus on “vaccinating people who are unvaccinated.”

In any case decisions about boosters do not rest with vaccine makers he said.

“Pharmaceutical companies aren’t public health agencies. It’s really not theirs to determine when or whether there should be booster dosing” Offit said. “That is the purview of the CDC.”

Indeed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA ― the federal agencies overseeing the authorization of COVID vaccines ― said in July that fully vaccinated Americans do not need a booster shot. Currently authorized vaccines ― from Pfizer Moderna and Johnson & Johnson ― are working as they should: All three lower the risk of COVID severe enough to hospitalize or kill a person.

If hospitalization and death rates increase among the vaccinated then it would be time to talk about boosters Offit said but “we’re not there yet.”

The White House has added to the mixed messaging: Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that the U.S. will buy an additional 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for inoculating children under 12 and for possible boosters.

Natalie Dean a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta said the confusion is not necessarily the fault of any one institution but rather that “there is genuine scientific uncertainty about how well [existing] vaccines work against the new variant.”

Scientists are piecing together information from observational studies outbreak investigations and analyses of antibody responses.

For many Americans ― especially those who struggled six months ago to find any dose frantically using vaccine hunters and driving hours-long distances for their first jab ― the confusion has set off a feverish search for an illicit third dose just in case it’s necessary.

“I snuck in a dose of Pfizer last week” Angie Melton a 50-year-old mother of four shared on Facebook. Melton received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot at a mass vaccination site in April and feared the highly contagious delta variant could infect her and then her unvaccinated 10-year-old son who has asthma.

After consulting friends and doctors and seeing reports about mix-and-match approaches in Europe Melton signed onto a local pharmacy site and made an appointment to get a Pfizer shot. She’s scheduled for a second shot as well.

“I’m trying to keep my family safe” Melton said.

A CDC advisory panel was set to meet Friday to consider updates on whether additional vaccine doses are necessary for immunocompromised people. A presentation about boosters is also on the agenda.

Immunocompromised patients like Sarah Keitt who has multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease expressed relief that federal regulators planned to recommend a third dose. Keitt a disability rights activist who lives in Connecticut said her neurologist told her to get a booster even after she had received two doses of Moderna. On Thursday she said she was eager to get another dose but still frustrated about a lack of confidence in how much protection it would offer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNC9oZWFsdGgvY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS1ib29zdGVycy1leHBsYWluZXItZmRhLXdlbGxuZXNzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVpodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzA4LzE0L2hlYWx0aC9jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5lLWJvb3N0ZXJzLWV4cGxhaW5lci1mZGEtd2VsbG5lc3M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A third dose of Covid-19 vaccine is now authorized for some. Here's what you need to know about boosters for all,"CNN —

Vaccine makers are preparing for a next possible phase of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout: booster doses.

The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday authorized third doses of both the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines for certain immunocompromised people: solid organ transplant recipients or “those who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise.”

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has signed off on the authorization and now recommends an additional dose of vaccine for these certain people.

But these doses will be considered part of the initial vaccination series for people who have not mounted an adequate immune response. A booster dose is something different. It helps refresh a waning immune response or helps the body fight an evolving pathogen.

The companies Pfizer and BioNTech said Monday they have submitted data from a Phase 1 study to the FDA supporting the use of a third or booster dose of their Covid-19 vaccine. The data showed that the booster dose elicited a significantly higher antibody response against the initial strain of the coronavirus as well as against the Delta and Beta variants compared to what was seen among people who got two doses.

“The data we’ve seen to date suggest a third dose of our vaccine elicits antibody levels that significantly exceed those seen after the two-dose primary schedule. We are pleased to submit these data to the FDA as we continue working together to address the evolving challenges of this pandemic” Albert Bourla Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive officer said in the announcement.

And many Americans who aren’t now eligible for an additional shot are wondering when it will be their turn.

Who is eligible for an additional shot now?

The CDC said immunocompromised people are more likely to get breakthrough infections than people with healthy immune systems and the recommendation on Friday allows certain immunocompromised people to get a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine.

“This EUA is intended to be for people with moderate to severe immunosuppression and not persons with chronic conditions for which there might be mild associated immunosuppression” the CDC’s Dr. Amanda Cohn told the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

The third doses were recommended for immunocompromised people as young as 12 who are included in Pfizer’s EUA. People as young as 18 can get a third dose of Moderna’s vaccine. The CDC urges people to get the same vaccine they got originally.

There’s not enough data to discuss the possibility of an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot Covid-19 vaccine the FDA said.

The CDC said patients and doctors should decide who needs an extra dose and what the timing of that dose should be. No prescription or doctor’s note will be needed – people must attest to their need for the third dose – and third doses are already available at major pharmacies and doctors’ offices.

What about boosters for everyone?

Covid-19 vaccine boosters are not currently needed for the general US population but the administration is checking the data daily and will be ready if that changes US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Thursday.

“We’re trying to understand if there’s a decrease in protection that’s manifesting as a significant increase in breakthrough infections particularly breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths” Murthy told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

Murthy said the administration is looking at data from pharmaceutical companies private health care systems and other countries including the UK Israel and Canada.

“We look at that data very regularly closely. When we see the threshold met that’s when we’ll recommend boosters for additional people” Murthy said. “That’s an if question. It’s a when question and the data is going to drive our decision on that.”

However the Biden administration is expected to lay out a Covid-19 vaccine booster strategy for all vaccinated Americans in September – with possible details on a phased rollout starting with the most vulnerable.

National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins acknowledged on Fox News Sunday that boosters may be needed “maybe beginning first with health care providers as well as people in nursing homes and then gradually moving forward.”

The US can look to Covid-19 vaccination in Israel for an idea of what may need to be considered a month or so in the future Andy Slavitt former White House Covid-19 adviser said Thursday. Israel has authorized Covid-19 vaccine booster doses for adults older than 50 becoming one of the first countries in the world to make such a move.

“Israel began their vaccination process a little bit ahead of us so I think in many respects we’ve been looking to them – and to a certain extent the UK – for what we can expect as well as the people who participated in the original clinical trials of the vaccines in 2020” Slavitt told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday. “Those three things together generally speaking give us a sense of what to predict for the future.”

Some researchers and health officials suspect antibodies against coronavirus produced through the vaccines may diminish over time – possibly after a year or more – and may not protect as well against coronavirus variants that could emerge.

In July Israel’s health ministry said in a statement that it had seen efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine drop from more than 90% to about 64% as the B.1.617.2 or Delta variant spread.

That might mean a vaccinated person would need a booster dose of vaccine to stay protected against the original coronavirus strain and newly emerging variants – including the Delta variant – in a way similar to how a tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years or different flu vaccines are recommended each year.

In the case of Covid-19 vaccines it remains unknown for how long immune protection lasts but vaccine developers and health officials know it may not be forever – and that emerging variants could evade immunity.

“There is a little nuance with Covid-19 vaccines” Dr. William Moss professor and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told CNN in May.

While typical booster doses use the same vaccine formula someone previously received to remind the immune system about immunity to a pathogen Moss said any future boosters for the Covid-19 shot could use altered vaccine formulas.

For instance the companies Pfizer and BioNTech said in a statement that while a third dose of their coronavirus vaccine “has the potential to preserve the highest levels of protective efficacy against all currently tested variants including Delta the companies are remaining vigilant and are developing an updated version of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that targets the full spike protein of the Delta variant.”

What happens if you skip the booster?

Whether booster coronavirus vaccine doses are modified or not missing a booster dose – if one is recommended in the future – could leave someone less protected against Covid-19.

“A person who skipped a booster is placing themselves at higher risk of getting infected and getting disease from the SARS-Coronavirus-2 but I would also expect that they’re going to have some partial immunity and so they may be protected against more severe disease” Moss said in May. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19.

“They’re just at higher risk of infection and disease than someone who got the booster but they have more immunity than someone who was never vaccinated.”

Scientists are also currently investigating whether it makes a difference if someone gets the same type of vaccine as a booster as the original dose administered.

Then there is the question of mixing and matching doses.

Researchers in the United Kingdom reported in May that people who got mixed doses of coronavirus vaccines – receiving a different vaccine type as a second dose than the first dose – appear to be more likely to experience mild side effects such as fever chills fatigue or headache.

But the side effects following mix-and-match vaccinations were short-lived and there were no other safety concerns the researchers reported in the Lancet medical journal.

Who is making booster shots?

All three companies that currently have authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States – Pfizer Moderna and Johnson & Johnson – are investigating the potential use of boosters.

“The data that I see coming they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told Axios in May. “But that remains to be seen and I believe in one two months we will have enough data to speak about it with much higher scientific certainty.”

The first dose of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine in the United States was administered on December 14 2020.

Moderna is currently conducting booster shot trials too.

The fight against the coronavirus pandemic is expected to continue through next year due to the emergence of variants Dr. Stephen Hoge president of Moderna said during an earnings call in early May.

“We think this is just the beginning” Hoge said. “Therefore we’re committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine to add as many variants as we think are necessary to ensure that when people receive a booster it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range of variants.”

Johnson & Johnson is also looking into the potential for boosters the company told CNN.

Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine along with Pfizer’s Moderna’s and four others are being tested as seasonal boosters in a study called Cov-Boost being conducted by the UK’s National Institute for Health Research and the University of Southampton.

The biotechnology company Novavax has developed a coronavirus vaccine that its chief executive officer Stanley Erck believes could be used as a booster shot for people who have already been vaccinated. The company plans to apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Who has to OK the Covid-19 booster shots?

The decision to broadly use Covid-19 boosters is expected to involve two agencies – the FDA and the CDC – and the regulatory process to get the shots into arms could vary depending on whether the booster is the same vaccine that was originally used or is a modified version.

“So if it’s the same vaccine my understanding is that what would have to happen is that the CDC would have to recommend an additional dose with details around when that should occur” Moss said in May.

In other words the FDA must give authorization for the vaccines to be used in new ways outside the existing authorization. Then the CDC advises on whether to actually use the vaccine as authorized by the FDA.

If it’s a modified vaccine “this is where things get interesting and I don’t think we quite know” Moss said but added that the regulatory process could be similar to what happens with flu vaccines each year.

“Technically whenever a vaccine like that is modified it’s often considered a new vaccine and has to go through the whole process again. But there is a precedent obviously with influenza virus vaccines not to do that” Moss said. “So the influenza vaccine each year doesn’t have to go through a large Phase 3 trial.”

That’s because the vaccine technology stays the same and the only change is the strain of flu virus that the vaccine targets.

How is it determined that someone needs a booster?

There is no definite way to know someone needs an additional dose of coronavirus vaccine – but so far studies on booster doses have measured antibody levels.

Cancer patients who receive the Covid-19 vaccine for example are less likely to develop protective antibodies according to two studies published this week in the journal JAMA Oncology. Antibodies are proteins the body makes to fight infection.

Yet the researchers noted that the test used to detect Covid-19 antibodies does not provide information about T-cell-based immunity or clinical outcomes related to potential Covid-19 infection. T-cells and B-cells are other components of the immune system with immune memory that can protect the body against infection.

In one of those studies researchers in Israel followed up on initial findings showing anti-spike Covid-19 antibody levels were significantly lower among cancer patients 5.5 weeks after the second dose of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine compared to non-cancer patients.

The team looked at 95 cancer patients and 66 control patients from their initial analysis about four months after their second vaccine dose. About 87% of cancer patients and 100% of patients in the control group showed anti-spike antibodies and antibody levels were still significantly lower in the cancer patients. The researchers noted that the median antibody level for both groups decreased over time.

Separately among organ transplant recipient patients in a Johns Hopkins University study who had no measurable antibodies after receiving two doses of vaccine one-third of them saw a rise in antibodies after a third dose – and among those with low antibody levels after two doses all of them saw an increase after a third dose.

Dr. Dorry Segev an author of the study and founder of the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation at Johns Hopkins University told CNN in June that it’s unclear what antibody level provides protective immunity. “We don’t know if you need the same off-the-charts level of antibodies that people with normal immune systems have” he said.

How often will you need a Covid-19 booster?

Some experts predict that a coronavirus vaccine booster dose might be needed annually – but despite such predictions Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said that the bottom line is no one knows yet.

Still the US is prepared for the possibility Fauci said during a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing in August.

Fauci said he believes eventually everyone will need a booster to maintain full protection from the vaccine.

“We are evaluating this on a day by day week by week month by month basis looking at any of a number of studies both international and domestic.” he said.

He added that if it looks like immunity is waning or a variant is evading the protection offered by current vaccines then health officials will be ready to recommend boosters.

Eventually it’s possible that a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine might just be part of the completion of immunization not an annual requirement to revaccinate Dr. Peter Marks director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said last week.

“I don’t think that we want to think that these vaccines have somehow failed us” Marks said at a discussion hosted by the Covid-19 Vaccine Education and Equity Project.

“It may simply be that to get the kind of really good immunity against Covid-19 that we get with some other vaccines it may take a series of three vaccinations much the same way that hepatitis B for adults and multiple childhood vaccination primary series you need to get a vaccination you know 0 1; or 0 2 and 4; or 0 2 and 6 months.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy9ib3VybGEtbmV0YW55YWh1LWZvdWdodC1mb3ItdmFjY2luZXMtYmVjYXVzZS1pdC1oZWxwZWQtaGltLXBvbGl0aWNhbGx5LTY3Njc3MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bourla: Netanyahu fought for vaccines because it helped him politically,"Benjamin Netanyahu acted for the good of his people but also to improve his political situation according to Pfizer head Albert Bourla.

In an interview to the UK's Financial Times published on Friday Pfizer head Albert Bourla gave his version of the events leading up to Israel's successful vaccination campaign that began in December.

Bourla's version of the events was different than what Netanyahu told the nation at the time.

Bourla chose Israel for the vaccine's first major rollout because he cut a deal with Netanyahu: Vaccines for the entire country in exchange for clinical data on how the vaccination campaign fares

He also saw Israel as an ideal playing field for purely business-related reasons. The country of choice needed to have a small population with good data collection systems. Greece was considered but its data-collection systems were not up to date Bourla said. The next country considered was Sweden but Bourla nixed the option not wanting to anger other EU countries who needed the vaccine just as badly.

Israel had all of the necessary requirements but Netanyahu also played a part.

""The biggest thing that became clear was Bibi [Netanyahu] was on top of everything he knew everything” Bourla said.

""He called me 30 times asking: ‘What about young people . . . what are you doing about the South African variant?’ Bourla explained.

He then added ""I’m sure he was doing it for his people but I’m also sure he was thinking: ‘It could help me politically.'""

To interviewer David Crow's comment that Netanyahu's moves ended up being a miscalculation as he lost power soon after Bourla responded ""Maybe but he did it very well.""

The article did not make clear whether Bourla was referring to the vaccine campaign or the political savvy or both.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZvbGxvdy1wYXRlbnRzLXRyYWlsLWZpbmQtY292aWQtMTktb3JpZ2lu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Follow the patents trail to find Covid-19 origin - The Sunday Guardian Live,"For many years the US and China were closely collaborating in virus research. Defence researchers of both nations were independently working to weaponize these viruses. Now the high and mighty of both nations are in denial of the lab origin of Covid-19 and are undermining any inquiry into its origin.

BENGALURU: The “deep state” is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as a secret network of especially non-elected government officials and sometimes private entities (as in the financial services and defence industries) operating extra-legally to influence and enact government policy. It quotes David Rothkopf: “The power of the deep state comes from experience knowledge relationships insight craft special skills traditions and shared values. Together these purported attributes make nameless bureaucrats into a super-government that is accountable to no one.” Power hungry greedy leaders of the defence and commercial Deep State responsible for this deadly pandemic have no remorse and are using all their powers and manipulative skills to cover their tracks. “Follow the money” is a popular dictum to expose corruption money laundering terror financing etc. Many investigators are following the coronavirus money trail. Similarly we should follow the patents to unravel unethical scientific ventures their methods motives and identities.

CRISIS LEADS TO MEDIA HYPE AND PROFITS: Dr Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance said at a workshop “We need to increase public understanding of the need for Medical Countermeasures (MCM) such as a pan-influenza or pan-coronavirus vaccine. (During an infectious disease crisis) A key driver is the media and the economics follow the hype. We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of the process.” This workshop on Rapid MCM Response to Infectious Diseases was co-convened by the National Academies of Sciences with three national fora in Washington DC on 26 and 27 March 2015. The details of this workshop were then published on 12 February 2016 in eight chapters.

THE EAGLE-DRAGON VIRAL TANGO: For many years the United States and China were closely collaborating in virus research to the exclusion of other nations. The defence researchers of both nations were independently working to weaponize these viruses. Now the high and mighty of both nations are in denial of the lab origin of Covid-19 and are undermining any inquiry into its origins. National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) mentions on its website a series of joint meetings on emerging infections between Chinese and US institutions. These include the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other Chinese organizations. Top-flight American researchers including current and former directors of BSL-4 laboratories CDC and uniform military biodefence experts met with China’s BSL-4 laboratory directors and researchers from across China. According to Lt Col (res) Dr Dany Shoham an Israeli expert on chemical and biological warfare four Chinese facilities are believed to be involved in biological weapons development. They are:

1. Institute of Military Veterinary Academy of Military Medical Sciences Changchun;

2. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Chengdu Military Region;

3. Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences Hubei;

4. Institute of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing.

The appropriately named US Fort De-trick is a fortress of-tricks (“de” in French means “of”). Sleeping with the enemy is bad enough producing a deadly virus and letting it spread globally is disastrous.

CHINESE PATENTS OF CONCERN: Investigating the murky origins of Covid-19 in Wuhan led to the discovery of Chinese patents of concern. Patents to Wuhan Institute of Virology include CN208317981U for cages to rear carnivorous bats and CN112205352A for a six-step method of artificial breeding of wild bats with predatory insects. This disproves the denials of presence of bats by the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its collaborators like Dr Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance (see tweeted image). CN111218459B the first patent for a Covid-19 vaccine virus was awarded to the Institute of Military Medicine Chinese Academy of Military Sciences in conjunction with CanSinoBIO a Chinese vaccine maker for application CN202010193587.8 filed as early as on 18 March 2020. On 23 June 2021 Tom Blackwell of National Post reported how Winnipeg lab scientist Xiangguo Qiu who was fired for stealing intellectual property and lethal virus samples is listed as co-inventor on two Chinese government virus patents based on work in Canada.

DEEP STATE AND BIG BUSINESS PATENTS OF CONCERN: Dr David Martin PhD founding CEO of M∙CAM an intellectual property-based financial risk management firm has been expressing concern about Big Pharma and NIH patents especially the following five patents.

1. US patent 6372224 to Pfizer in 2000 (for multiple applications the first filed in 1990) for canine coronavirus S gene and uses. Hence he argues that Covid-19 virus was not a novel virus. Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965 and many others have been found since then hence each virus was new when first identified including the Covid-19 virus.

2. US patent 7220852 was granted on 12 April 2004 to the United States of America as represented by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention for the newly isolated human coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This is claimed to be ineligible for a patent as it is a discovery of a natural virus and not a newly synthesised virus. If it was a synthesised virus then it would have been for gain of profit or as a bioweapon. Actually isolated genes (extracted from a longer DNA sequence) were patentable in the US in 2004 and till years later when the Supreme Court found that “[a] naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated”. Ironically a chemical or biological weapon that is illegal to use isn’t illegal to patent and possess (for research purposes). Dr Julie Gerberding then director of the CDC stated that filing for the patent was “a protective measure to make sure that the access to the virus remains open for everyone”.

3. US patent 7151163 was granted on 28 April 2004 to Sequoia Pharmaceuticals for antiviral agents for the treatment control and prevention of infections by coronaviruses such as the SARS virus. The concern here is about how a big pharma acquired details of the virus and got a treatment patent for a virus before the virus itself was patented by the government. Was the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) compromised or did it collude?

4. US patent 9193780 was granted on 5 June 2009 to Ablynx N.V. a subsidiary of biopharmaceutical company Sanofi for amino acid sequences directed against envelope proteins of a virus and polypeptides comprising the same for the treatment of viral diseases. It has been alleged that this and subsequent series of patents to Ablynx and Sanofi specifically targeted the novel features of Covid-19: polybasic cleavage site spike protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD) before the Covid-19 outbreak. In this patent details of various viruses are mentioned and it is difficult to prove that these patent applications were based on prior knowledge of the Covid-19 virus.

5. US patent 7279327B2 for methods for producing recombinant coronavirus granted to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on an application filed on 19 April 2002 is another contentious patent.

THE END-GAME: The three months given by President Biden to investigate the origins of Covid-19 will soon be over. There are news leaks that a massive amount of data from Wuhan is being analysed so let us hope for a revelation.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito were both wealthier in 2020 than they were in 2018 according to their annual financial disclosures filed earlier this year

Manchin’s estimated net worth for 2020 was $8.6 million compared to $7.6 million for 2018. Capito was worth $2.53 million compared to $2.15 million in 2018.

The Dominion Post periodically reviews the net worth of the state’s congressional delegation employing a method used by the watchdog group Open Secrets for all members of Congress.

We total each person’s reported assets and liabilities and subtract the liabilities from the assets.

Members report their holdings in broad ranges: $0-$1000; $1001-$15000; $15001-$50000; $50001-$100000 and so on.

We total the minimum and maximum values for assets and liabilities. To get the most probably range we subtract the maximum liability total from the minimum asset total and the minimum liability from maximum assets.

This represents the extremes of what each person could be worth. From those extremes we take the average as the estimated net worth.

For 2020 Manchin’s asset values ranged from $4376067 to $12844100. He reported no liabilities. The midpoint was $8610083.50.

Capito’s assets ranged from $1596629 to $4996000. She reported liabilities ranging from $475005 to $1065000. Using the formula put her range of worth from $531629 to $4520995 with the midpoint at $2526995.

Here’s a look at some selected details from their reports.

Manchin

OpenSecrets ranked Manchin 19th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 67th overall in Congress. OpenSecrets hasn’t yet published its compilation of 2020 filings.

For comparison the richest senator in 2018 was Mark Warner D-Va. worth $214 million. Current Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was worth $1.12 million and current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was worth $34.14 million.

Manchin reported collecting $48282.24 from the state Public Employees Retirement System in 2020.

Members are required to report both their own and their spouse’s assets and liabilities. His wife Gayle Manchin currently co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission holds a savings account worth $500001-$1 million which paid interest ranging from $2501-$5000.

Manchin reported two savings accounts ranging respectively from $100001-$250000 and $50001-$100000. They produced interest ranging from $201-$1000 for the first and less than $201 for the second.

The Joe Manchin III Qualified Blind Trust is worth $500001-$1 million and generated revenue of $5001-$15000.

He owns a storage building in Fairmont worth $50001-$100000 that collected $2501-$5000 in rent. A commercial rental property in Fairmont is worth $250001-$500000 and collected $5001-$15000 in rent and $2382 in “ordinary business income.”

He owns stock in Fairmont-based Enersystems which he founded and is described as providing services and materials for utility plants (according to news reports it supplies coal to Mon Power’s Grant Town plant). The stock is worth $1000001-$5 million and produces $100001-$1 million in dividends plus $491949 in business income.

Manchin holds stock in two Morgantown-based companies. Figure 8 Surgical makes a sternal closure tool. CereDX (now Valtari Bio) is developing a blood test to aid rapid triage in stroke patients. The stock holdings for each is worth $1001 to $15001 and both generate dividends labeled “none” meaning less than $201.

The final asset on Manchin’s list is the house boat that recently made headlines as the site of a gathering of senators from both parties where Sen. Lindsey Graham R-SC subsequently reported testing positive for COVID despite being vaccinated.

Manchin reports the house boat being worth $100001-$250000.

Capito

Open Secrets ranked Capito 46th wealthiest in the Senate in 2018 and 169th overall in Congress.

Capito has a stake in Disney magic. She owns Walt Disney Co. stock worth $15001-$50000.

She and her husband have stock in a number of energy companies: Duke Energy ($1001-$15000) NextEra Energy ($1001-$15000) ExxonMobil ($1001-$15000) Royal Dutch Shell ($1001-$15000) Chevron ($1001-$15000) Phillips 66 ($1001-$15000) Wisconsin Energy ($1001-$15000) and BlackRock ($1001-$15000).

They each have a Wells Fargo bank account each worth $50001-$100000 and they report four separate stock holdings in Wells Fargo. They also have several Citigroup holdings.

Their high-tech stock includes Microsoft Apple AT&T Cisco Verizon and IBM.

Her husband owns stock in Viatris (which closed its Morgantown plant last month) worth $1001-$15000. Their other pharmaceutical holdings include Johnson & Johnson Merck Novartis Pfizer Roche Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

They have a wide variety of holdings in the food industry: General Mills Kellogg McDonald’s J.M. Smucker Coca-Cola Mondelez and PepsiCo.

They have three box stores covered with holdings in WalMart Target and Lowe’s.

Other holdings include Nordstrom UPS Ford Colgate-Palmolive Proctor & Gamble #M and Nike.

Reps. David McKinley Carol Miller and Alex Mooney all had reports due in May and all three filed for extensions. Their new deadline was Friday and a story on their filings will follow after their reports are published.

“My mom thought it would be a good idea if we came to the air show” Lydia said.

The airport will host the event again from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday with the air show beginning at noon.

Excited about each stop Lydia was able to walk up to aircraft meant for aviation experts and professionals.

“I liked going in the planes and taking pictures” she said.

The mother and daughter along with hundreds of other aviation fans arrived at the airport early before the air show began at noon. Visitors climbed into cockpits analyzed the interiors of the planes and touched the outsides as well.

However the four-hour air show kept the crowd's attention through the remainder of the day.

The air show included maneuvers by pilots in bi-planes monoplanes fighter jets and warbirds. Others performed aerobatics while some jumped out of the planes.

Five-year-old Braxton Berg sat patiently with his parents waiting for the planes to arrive. Although the show would be above his head Braxton made sure the family was as close to the action as possible. He had his favorites he was looking for including helicopters and the crop duster planes often seen near his Decatur home. “They fly over the fields” he said.

But his excitement and attention were devoted to the sky with the first airplane a C-85 powered T-Clips.

Throughout the day vendors and aviation displays were featured behind the airport terminal. Several activities were geared toward families and children. Crafts food and airplane displays were available.

Standing next to a small airplane Karlie Emery flight instructor at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale spoke with future aviators and those interested in the college’s aviation program. “We teach students to fly we teach them to manage an airport we teach them to fix airplanes” Emery said. “It’s not only how to fly the airplane.”

Before the show fans were encouraged to learn more about the aircrafts that would soon be in the air.

Navigator Jordan Robb hung around the C-130 Hercules 3 ready to answer questions about the plane. “It’s a cargo plane for the Air Force used to haul anything from people to cargo” he said. “It’s kind of like the pickup truck of the Air Force.”

The plane is useful for areas that have limited landing strips he said. With parachutes attached cargo can be pushed out the tail end of the plane. The C-130 H3 was used in American conflicts dating back to the Vietnam War according to Robb. The plane on display at the Decatur Airport Anniversary was built in 1993. “So this is one of the newer C-130’s out there” he said.

One of the visitors studying the aircraft was Decatur resident Mike Sorrentino. His father served in the Air Force from 1960 to 1980. As a child Sorrentino often watched the planes fly overhead. “But I don’t know much about them” he said.

He still wanted to visit the air show. “Just to take a look around at some of the aircraft” he said.

There oftentimes is a compelling backstory especially if that abandoned something is large and potentially valuable. That's the case with a jet airplane that a guy found abandoned in the Illinois woods.

Before I share what I've learned about the history of this plane check out this dude's investigation of a jet in the woods.

I looked up the planes N111RZ tail markings. Plane Logger details an interesting history of this plane's creation to where it is now. It was built and delivered to American Airlines on January 22 1966. Back in that era this small jet would have been quite the performer. 9 years later in 1975 it looks like it went to a leasing company. Rotec Industries took possession of the plane in 1997 and the site indicates it was ""stored"" on December 8 1998.

Pacific American Airlines looks like it had this plane as a part of its fleet in 1977.

The FAA website indicates this is a BAC One-Eleven that was built in 1965 which confirms the likely 1966 delivery is spot-on correct.

One comment on YouTube indicated that what appeared to be broken wings was likely to show that the wings were cut off to make its final transport to this wooded location easier.

The exact location of the plane isn't provide by the YouTube guy but based on the FAA and Plane Logger websites the likely burial ground for this plane is either Gilberts or Elmhurst Illinois.

Imagine all of the destinations around the world this plane likely saw back in the 1960's and 1970's before its final resting place...abandoned in the Illinois wilderness.

REVIEW:

“This is a rough area of Indianapolis for gas stations. There’s a Phillips 66 at Washington and Arlington I frequent. The clientele is often rough. The crew who works there does a good job but what can they control. Just down the road is Circle K . It’s an old facility and there’s a rental motel next door. We need them but Thornton’s is the best near 465 on Washington on the east side. Better people better experience. Skip issues and stop here. I’d love to lie and paint the area better. Bad side of Irvington. But I’ve had no ill experience at Thornton’s. I’ve got a ton to say on that but it’s on a soap box.” – Nathan G.

Will Power finally got his first victory of the 2021 NTT INDYCAR SERIES season on a track he has mastered like no other.

Power drove the No. 12 Verizon 5G Team Penske Chevrolet to victory in the Big Machine Spiked Coolers Grand Prix on Saturday on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course his fifth career win on the 14-turn 2.439-mile layout that debuted in 2014.

It was the 40th career INDYCAR SERIES victory for Power who broke a tie with four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Al Unser to climb into fifth on the all-time win list. The win also was the sixth of Power’s career at IMS as he also won the 2018 Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge. Only NASCAR star Kyle Busch with two Brickyard 400 wins and four Xfinity Series wins on the oval has as many major race victories at the Racing Capital of the World.

“We needed that as a group” Power said. “I can’t tell you how good these guys have been all year. Flawless on pit stops. They’ve given me the car and we’ve had some bad luck. I’ve made some mistakes as well.

“So stoked to get the Verizon 5G car in Victory Lane. Oh what a relief man!”

Rookie Romain Grosjean equaled his season-best finish – on this same circuit in the GMR Grand Prix in May – by placing second in the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda 1.1142 seconds behind Power. Colton Herta rebounded from his disappointing late-race crash last Sunday in Nashville to finish third in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda.

2016 Indianapolis 500 winner Alexander Rossi earned his season-best finish by placing fourth in the No. 27 AutoNation/NAPA AUTO PARTS Honda. NTT P1 Award winner Pato O’Ward finished fifth in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet but he still ended up a winner because of a dramatic shift in the championship standings.

O’Ward pulled to within 21 points of series leader Alex Palou with four races remaining in the season as Palou retired from the race on Lap 68 with a mechanical problem while running fourth in his No. 10 NTT DATA Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Palou led six-time and reigning series champion Scott Dixon by 42 points entering this event. Dixon fell to third but still trimmed the margin to the top 34 points behind Palou after placing 17th – tying his season low – in the No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda.

A tense strategic duel erupted into a mad dash for the checkered flag when Palou retired from the race.

Palou was running fourth and closing on Grosjean on Lap 68 when smoke began to flow from the rear of his No. 10 NTT DATA Chip Ganassi Racing Honda in Turn 4. He pulled off track and hopped from his car out of the race with a 27th-place result his lowest of the season.

There were warning signs from the opening lap about possible troubles for Palou who told his team on the radio after Lap 1 that he felt down on power.

“We started having some issues with the mapping and we weren’t sure what was going on” Palou said. “We managed like 60 laps and it was fine. We were losing a bit of power but it wasn’t too bad. We were trying to fight for a podium and we had to stop.

“It’s a shame when we were running so good but it’s just a bump in the road. We’ll continue and we’ll get those points back.”

The ensuing full-course caution the first of the 85-lap race erased Power’s 1.9-second lead over Herta. Grosjean who had closed to within a car length of Herta’s gearbox before the caution passed Herta for second on Lap 72 on the restart.

Power maintained a 1.1-second lead over Grosjean when the field was bunched again by a full-course caution on Lap 77 when Rinus VeeKay’s No. 21 Sonax/Autogeek Chevrolet stalled in Turn 7 after contact from behind by the No. 3 CarShop Team Penske Chevrolet of Scott McLaughlin.

“When the yellow came and then another one you’ve got to survive those yellows” Power said. “We had a really good car. It’s tough to get by lapped traffic but the car was solid out front.”

2014 series champion Power kept the lead on the restart on Lap 79 helped by Grosjean using all 200 seconds of his push-to-pass by Lap 65. He maintained a gap of about one second to Grosjean over the final six laps with both drivers running on the Firestone alternate “red” tires.

“We had a good car all day long and we fought at the front” Grosjean said. “We ran out of push-to-pass early today. I had to use quite a bit early in the race to make sure we were going through the lapped cars. Through the end Will had more than I did. I just had to go flat out and try not to make any mistakes.”

Various tire and fuel strategies unfolded during the first 67 laps of the race which ran caution-free. That helped breed 11 lead changes among six drivers as teams tried to undercut and overcut rivals with well-timed pit stops.

Herta appeared to be the biggest threat to Power as he trimmed a deficit of nearly nine seconds to just 1.9 seconds before Palou’s problem triggered the first caution.

The next race is the Bommarito Automotive Group 500 on Saturday evening Aug. 21 at World Wide Technology Raceway near St. Louis. It’s the final oval race of the season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvYXN0bGFuZHRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE1L2FydHJhZ2VvdXMtcmV0dXJucy10by1kb3dkeS1wYXJrLWluLW5hZ3MtaGVhZC10aGlzLWZhbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artrageous returns to Dowdy Park in Nags Head this fall - The Coastland Times | The Coastland Times,"Artrageous returns to Dowdy Park in Nags Head this fall Published 6:19 am Sunday August 15 2021

This year’s theme “Be You! You’re An Original” encourages children to celebrate being themselves and creating original artwork.

“Having fun making art listening to music and enjoying time with family and friends is what Artrageous is all about” said Dare County Arts Council interim executive director Jessica Sands. “Our plan is to offer high-quality art activities that inspire children while showing them there is no right or wrong way to express themselves through art.”

Organizations and businesses interested in hosting a kids art activity and artisans interested in selling their works at Artrageous can find the applications online at DareArts.org/artrageous. The application deadline is Friday August 27.

The Artrageous Kids Art Festival is Dare County’s longest-running kids art program.

Palou was running fourth in the Big Machine Spiked Coolers Grand Prix – two positions ahead of O’Ward – when his No. 10 NTT DATA Chip Ganassi Racing Honda had mechanical trouble with all scheduled pit stops behind him. Which means O’Ward said he was fortunate to gain 26 points on Palou.

“I think it was a positive that we gained (on Palou) but it was a negative that if it wasn’t for his (trouble) he would have beat us today and we would have lost even more ground” said O’Ward the driver of the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

Palou finished 27th of 28 drivers allowing the field to gain on him in the standings.

Palou’s lead on second-place O’Ward is down to 21 points heading to the season’s final four races beginning with next Saturday night’s Bommarito Automotive Group 500 at World Wide Technology Raceway. Scott Dixon (No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda of Chip Ganassi Racing) is within 34 points after a 17th-place finish while Josef Newgarden (No. 2 XPEL Team Penske Chevrolet) and Marcus Ericsson (No. 8 Huski Chocolate Honda of Chip Ganassi Racing) are within 55 and 62 points respectively after finishing Saturday’s race in the eighth and ninth positions.

“It’s a shame (not to get more) because we had race-winning pace” said Newgarden who started 20th after serving a six-position grid penalty for an unapproved engine change. “If we’d have started up front we’d have probably had a really good day.

“But yeah I think it worked out pretty good for us.”

Dixon’s finish doesn’t suggest a productive day but he still gained eight points on teammate Palou after starting 26th his lowest position in eight years (since the 2013 race in Long Beach California).

Regardless of how the gain was achieved O’Ward had a positive spin for it.

“We’re back in the fight” he said. “We’re right there.”

Lundgaard Battles through First INDYCAR Race

Christian Lundgaard couldn’t give a fair performance assessment of his first INDYCAR race because of a bout with food poisoning that went through the Rahal Letterman Lanigan team Friday night.

Sitting on the pit wall following Saturday’s race the 20-year-old Dane looked dehydrated and seemed to be sweating more than the other drivers finishing the nearly two-hour race.

Lundgaard estimated he got two hours’ of sleep before climbing into his No. 45 Mi-Jack Honda for the longest race of his career. The FIA Formula 2 driver said there was no way his body was ready for this debut.

“I think the physicality in the end determined the racing because if you can’t hold on how are you going to race?” he said. “The whole day has been chaotic from when I went to bed last night.”

A team spokesperson said many members of the organization were fighting illness from food served to the team hospitality area by an outside vendor. Graham Rahal also had a rough night but he continued to drive well on the IMS road course scoring a seventh-place finish to extend his run of top-10 finishes here to 10 races. Takuma Sato did not eat the same food as other team members as he has his own pre-race eating routine – ramen noodles.

Lundgaard finished 12th but he led two laps in his first INDYCAR race.

“I got through it; I survived” he said forcing a smile. “I think (INDYCAR) is great fun.

“It’s been a hell of an experience.”

Lundgaard’s INDYCAR future hasn’t been determined but he hopes to have a better understanding of tire wear if he competes in more of these races. He said he didn’t know when he could push Firestone’s tires and when he couldn’t.

He gave himself a reasonable grade for how he handled his first rolling start and his first three INDYCAR pit stops.

“I guess it went fine” he said. “We were probably more on the safe side than the aggressive side. The target was to get through it and not make any mistakes. We survived that.”

Rahal Again Moves Up

If only Graham Rahal could qualify better …

Rahal driver of the No. 15 One Cure Honda started Saturday’s race from the 17th position and finished seventh. It was the 20th time in the past 22 INDYCAR races where he finished better than he started.

Best of all Rahal told his engineer Allen McDonald that they hit on something positive Saturday.

“The setup we tried today was significantly better than what we had yesterday (in qualifying)” Rahal said. “I do think we were quite good on the (Firestone alternate) red (tires) and would have qualified quite nicely if we’d have had used that (setup) yesterday.

“The positive is it’s a good foundation something for us to consider when we go to Laguna (Seca) and some other (road courses) that can relate in certain ways.”

As for the food poisoning Rahal said it definitely impacted him Friday night – “It was a rough night (and) I haven’t eaten much today” he said – but he emerged from the car in reasonable shape.

“I feel fresh which is surprising (as) I didn’t really sleep at all” he said.

The heel of Rahal’s racing boot also had a rough time. He raised his foot high enough to show how the heel had essentially melted against the floor of the car.

“Kind of strange” he said.

Odds and Ends

The 269 on-track passes were the most ever on the IMS road course. The 190 passes for positions tied the event record set in 2018 another race won by Team Penske’s Will Power.

Power’s victory extended his streak of consecutive victories with at least one INDYCAR victory (now 15). Dixon extended the series record to 17 with his May 1 victory at Texas Motor Speedway. A.J. Foyt holds the record for the most winning seasons – with 18 – but his didn’t come in consecutive years.

INDYCAR newcomer Jimmie Johnson (No. 48 Carvana Honda of Chip Ganassi Racing) finished a series-best 19th which was welcomed with so many of his longtime NASCAR friends on hand for Brickyard Weekend.

Felix Rosenqvist and NASCAR Cup Series driver Austin Dillon did a driver swap of sorts prior to Saturday’s race with each climbing into the other’s race car. Rosenqvist finished 13th in the No. 7 Vuse Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

Indianapolis Colts safety Kenny Moore watched O’Ward finish fifth. They have become fast friends and Moore has attended a handful of INDYCAR races this season including the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge. NASCAR driver Daniel Suarez whom O’Ward has known since their karting days in Mexico also watched the race from his friend’s pit box.",,,,,,

A Family representative will join Faurecia’s Board of Directors underlining the Family’s strong commitment to the combined company. This combination marks an unprecedented step in Faurecia’s ambition to accelerate its strategic transformation investing in fast-growing segments with leading positions. The transaction represents an estimated total enterprise value of €6.7bn for 100% of Hella.

This especially applies to product range and market coverage. In addition both partners place a high value on consequent customer orientation operative excellence and technology leadership. Therefore it is only logical that we join forces to drive the future of mobility together. With Faurecia at our side we will have even more opportunities to do so than before.”

The debt financing of the transaction is fully secured through a bridge facility with tier-one banks. Faurecia’s current credit ratings are expected to be confirmed by all three agencies shortly.

Strategic rationale

1/ Combining Faurecia with Hella’s strong identity businesses and employees

Faurecia values the high technology content of Hella activities and intends to further enhance and globalize them. Faurecia will accelerate the multi-pillar business strategy of Hella with a focus not only on automotive original equipment (Lighting and Electronics) but also on additional market segments (Aftermarket Services and Special Applications). Lippstadt will continue to play a major role and will be the Headquarter of three Business Groups of the combined Group: Electronics Lighting and Lifecyle Value Management. The management and business CEOs of these three BGs will be based in Lippstadt. Faurecia’s objective is to leverage Hella’s talents that are essential to achieve the combined profitable growth ambition. A key success factor of the combined Group docking and integration is Hella’s management stability and involvement. Senior management roles will be dedicated to Hella executives. An integration committee equally composed by members of the management of both companies will be created to supervise the integration project. Positions will be staffed according to best of class principle. Faurecia is willing to continue the constructive dialogue with all of Hella’s workforce constituencies and to stand by its current works council and collective bargaining agreements

2/ Creating the 7th largest global automotive technology supplier focused on fast-growing automotive technologies with leading positions and with a significantly increased ‘powertrain-agnostic’ share of revenues

• Developing a strong and focused offer for Electric Mobility (BEV + FCEV)

The combined Group will develop a comprehensive offer for electric vehicles (HEVs PHEVs BEVs and FCEVs) building on Hella’s energy management portfolio sensors and actuators related to BEVs as well as Faurecia’s hydrogen system solutions(FCEV) and hybrid systems. Battery management systems DCDC converters onboard charging systems brought by Hella as well as battery pack systems hydrogen storage systems and stack systems brought by Faurecia are examples of the combined product offer. With its portfolio of solutions the Group will be uniquely positioned to benefit from the zero emissions mobility market transition.

• ICE sales exposure will decrease from 25% in 2020 to less than 20% at closing and down to c. 10% in 2025

• Becoming a major player in Electonics and Software solutions to accelerate in ADAS & Autonomous Driving

In ADAS & Autonomous Driving the combination of Faurecia Clarion Electronics with Hella Electronics and Software will create a strong global player supporting the next high-speed and low-speed ADAS convergence. Radars Electric Power Steering (including fail operational) e-mirrors 360° views & automated parking solutions are a few examples of the combined product and system offer. With combined sales of €3.7bn in Electronics and Software the new Group will operate 24 production sites and 21 R&D centers. Our ambition with orders already significantly booked is to grow sales to c. €7bn in 2025.

• Boosting Faurecia’s Cockpit of the Future strategy thanks to complementary portfolios

Faurecia's leading positions in Seating and Interiors (including SAS) combined with Hella’s leading position in Interior Lighting and both companies’ Electronics will significantly strengthen our Cockpit of the Future strategy. Hella’s HMI Interior solution capabilities its portfolio of body electronics (access comfort seat) sensors and actuators will support value creation through new customer experiences.

• Creating a Lifecycle Value Management activity in line with environmental concerns and industry evolutions The combination will bring opportunities to build a real lifecycle value offer including Aftermarket Services & Repairs and Special Applications. Faurecia will be able to enhance the very well established Hella brands. It will allow to leverage potential business in eco-design products sustainable materials and circular economy.

3/ Accelerating innovation with strong R&D capabilities

With 18500 highly talented and motivated engineers and specialists including 3000 software engineers the new Group will boost the development of advanced innovation projects with high technology content short time-to-market and sustained profitability.

4/ Capitalizing on complementary customer portfolios across all geographies and leveraging Faurecia’s strong position in Asia particularly in China

The combination will bring together two companies with established and complementary positions. It will open new sales opportunities for Hella by leveraging Faurecia’s privileged access to key Chineseand Japanes OEMs. It will increase Faurecia’s intimacy with German Premium OEMs thanks to Hella’s strong position. Both will benefit from complementary intimacies with US based OEMs.

Five of the six Business Groups – Electronics Lighting Seating Interiors Clean Mobility – will each exceed €3bn of sales. The newly created Business Group Lifecycle Value Management will contribute to grow this segment with a leading position.

5/ Generating significant synergies to drive profitability and cash generation improvement

Cost synergies and optimization including procurement SG&A and other operating expenses should generate > €200m EBITDA run-rate. The P&L impact should gradually ramp up from 40% in 2023 to 80% in 2024 to reach 100% in 2025. Sales synergies should generate between €300m and €400m of sales by 2025 capitalizing on Faurecia’s strong footprint in China Japan and the Americas to sell Hella brand and on Hella’s Electronic position with German OEMs to enhance Faurecia’s market share. In addition to these synergies cash flow optimization by c. €200m per year on average from 2022 to 2025 will be generated mainly through working capital and capex.

6/ Leveraging common ESG commitments and priorities

Both companies share strong values including an industry-leading ESG approach with an ambitious CO2 neutrality roadmap. The combined Group will be a driving force in the decarbonation and sustainability of mobility.

2022 - 2025 ambition for the combined Group: strong sales outperformance best-in-class profitability and €5.5bn net cash flow generated

Projected key financial metrics for the combined Group including the above mentioned synergies demonstrate: ✓ Strong sales growth to reach above €33bn in 2025 broadly doubling the market’s average growth ✓ Best-in class profitability with an EBITDA margin above 15.5% and an operating margin above 8.5% in 2025 exceeding previous companies’ individual targets ✓ Solid cash generation with net cash flow reaching c. €1bn in 2022 and representing above 5% of sales in 2025.

Net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio back to 1.5x at the end of 2023 equivalent to Faurecia’s ratio as of June 30 2021 before the acquisition

Net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 1x at the end of 2025

2022 ambition 2023 ambition 2025 ambition Net debt-to-EBITDA ≤ 2x 1.5x 1x

Fully secured debt financing

Credit ratings expected to be confirmed

Faurecia has fully secured the financing of the acquisition of Hella through a committed bridge facility of €5.5bn. Except for the bridge to equity component of €800m such facility will be mostly refinanced through bond issuance and bank loans.

The bridge to equity of €800m will be refinanced through a rights issue with maintenance of the preferential right of subscription of the shareholders. The Family pool undertakes to participate in such rights issue in proportion to its then prevailing shareholding in Faurecia.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)



Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

She sat down at her kitchen table in Berkeley Calif. and frantically started Googling to find out what it was.

Her experience wasn’t uncommon. People working at the tourism guide Lonely Planet the travel site The Points Guy and the health and medical information site Healthline were similarly blindsided in recent years when Red Ventures bought up special interest publications in a multibillion-dollar shopping spree.

Their Googling and mandatory corporate retreats led them to the company’s South Carolina headquarters a 180-acre campus with a cluster of modern buildings a fire pit a six-lane bowling alley spin room pickle ball courts and 264 residences for employees who choose to live where they work.

Red Ventures which started as a digital marketing company has attracted serious investments from private equity firms. Its location has helped obscure what is perhaps the biggest digital publisher in America a 4500-employee juggernaut that says it has roughly $2 billion in annual revenues a conservative valuation earlier this year of more than $11 billion and more readers as measured by Comscore than any media brand you’ve ever heard of — an average of 751 million visits a month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFya2FuYWdhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9hdWcvMTQvbWF0dXJlZC1tYXlmaWVsZC1sZWFkaW5nLWJyb3ducy1hbWlkLXN1cGVyLWV4cGVjdGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matured Mayfield leading Browns amid 'Super' expectations,"CLEVELAND - Baker Mayfield has grown up. There was no other option.

""I had to hit rock bottom for a little bit"" he said.

He's rising and judging by last season so are the Browns.

As he picked at lunch during a break last month while shooting commercials at FirstEnergy Stadium Mayfield exuded some of that chip-on-his-shoulder confidence that transported him from college walk-on to NFL starting quarterback.

That will always be on display defining him driving him. The brashness though has been muted.

While discussing the stuttering start to his pro career his future in Cleveland and expectations for this season during a sit-down interview with The Associated Press there was something noticeably different about Mayfield.

He's changed.

It's not a 180-degree turn by any means but Mayfield is more measured with his actions and words: business Baker. More of a leader a role model franchise quarterback.

""Experience"" he said ""definitely teaches you.""

Mayfield crashed after a record-setting rookie year only to bounce back in 2020 under first-year coach Kevin Stefanski. On the eve of his fourth training camp he was relaxed and reflective as he prepared for a season Browns fans have awaited for a generation.

Mayfield helped Cleveland end the playoff drought. Next challenge: the Super Bowl which the Browns never have reached.

He's physically fit having dropped ""bad weight"" and in a good place mentally. He's found inner peace and the 25-year-old feels a strong connection with this football-crazed city and its fans. Cleveland is where he wants to play his entire career.

""We've talked about it Emily and I"" Mayfield said referring to his wife who co-stars with him in those TV ads for Progressive Insurance. ""It wouldn't be the same if we lived in a city where they didn't live breathe and die football. That's the atmosphere we want - and it's here.""

There's an unmistakable bond between this Ohio city and this Oklahoma quarterback. Both underdogs they've been through good years and bad ones. Knocked down and counted out they've fought back.

""When I say that my work ethic and mentality fits right in here"" he said. ""I genuinely mean that.""

Even before being drafted first in 2018 Mayfield sensed Cleveland was where he belonged.

""If anybody's going to turn that franchise around it would be me"" he boasted at the combine that year.

He was right.

The Browns went 1-31 in two seasons before he arrived and spent two decades discarding quarterbacks and coaches at dizzying speed. In Mayfield they have seemingly found the leader missing since Bernie Kosar led Cleveland to three AFC title games from 1986-89.

He's eligible for a contract extension but to this point his agents and the Browns have not had formal talks.

It's possible the team wants Mayfield to replicate his strong 2020 - or the Browns are spooked by the massive deal Buffalo gave Josh Allen who signed a six-year $258 million package.

Mayfield is under contract for two more years and insists his focus is solely on winning another sign of development.

For a while though it looked as if he might be another bust.

After breaking Peyton Manning's rookie record for TD passes and going 7-8-1 Mayfield took things for granted. He didn't spend nearly enough time working on his craft got heavy and threw nearly as many interceptions (21) as TDs (22) in 2019.

Picked to contend for the AFC North title the Browns disintegrated. They went 6-10 fired coach Freddie Kitchens and Mayfield's critics circled with sharpened knives.

""For the first time in my life I was kind of listening to the outside noise and I let that affect me too much"" he said. ""I was so worried about what type of picture I needed to portray as a franchise QB because everybody was telling me I had to be a certain way instead of just doing how I've always done it - which is how I'm here.""

Mayfield quickly interjects he doesn't want to ""sound cocky or conceited."" It's just that others wanted him to be someone he's not.

""Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady aren't the same people"" he said. ""I listened to too much of that for too long had a few losing seasons and then realized OK I've got to find a peace on the inner side before I can lead this team to where it needs to go.""

While it would have been easy to blame Cleveland's ceaseless dysfunction Mayfield held himself accountable.

""The whole 2019 season was just kind of a miserable year"" he said glancing at a ""Believe In Yourself"" tattoo on his left forearm. ""I expect a lot of things out of myself and I just didn't play well. That was a humbling experience.""

Then came 2020's strangeness. But in the midst of masks and mandates Mayfield found stability and kinship with Stefanski his third coach in three years. Shortly after being hired Stefanski visited Mayfield in Texas not imagining he wouldn't see him again in person for five months.

Although most of their interactions came over Zoom coach and QB bonded.

""He's a sports junkie and not the biggest guy ever"" Mayfield said smiling when asked about their connection. ""We agree on the work-ethic mentality. You can't just show up. He loves the grind and so do I. When you put two people together with the same inner values and drive that's pretty special.""

Expectations for the 2021 Browns are enormous even excessive. Mayfield says he isn't fazed by them.

""It would bring the great tradition back"" he said. ""It's a football town because of what it's been in the past and what it deserves to be. It would mean a ton to me but I wouldn't be satisfied at just stopping at one.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbGRvc3RhZGFpbHl0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbF9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLWJyaWVmcy9hcnRpY2xlXzkxYjBiOTliLTcyNTQtNTJkNi04ZTI3LTQ0YWVjYTk1OTdjYS5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFsZG9zdGFkYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtYnJpZWZzL2FydGljbGVfOTFiMGI5OWItNzI1NC01MmQ2LThlMjctNDRhZWNhOTU5N2NhLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business Briefs,"Valdosta GA (31601)

Their pitch is intoxicatingly simple: “Try saying it. ‘I’ve got a nice little place in Asspen.’ Rolls off the tongue nicely doesn’t it?” Eventually the residents open up their checkbooks and buy the scam.

This is exactly what happened when recruiters from Goldman Sachs showed up at Harvard in 2006. As a 20-year-old I fell for the trick: I joined Goldman that summer as an intern. By July I had learned many of the firm’s unspoken traditions like how instead of wearing Rolexes the managing directors sported cheap digital watches with black rubber wrist straps prominently juxtaposed against their expensive tailor-made dress shirts.

The hallmark event at Goldman that summer wasn’t a poker tournament on a lavish boat cruise followed by a debauched night of clubbing as it had been at Amaranth the more edgy firm where I’d worked the prior year. Rather it was “service day” — a day that involved dressing up in a T-shirt and shorts and then serving the community. Back in 2006 that involved planting trees in a garden in Harlem. The co-head of my group was supposed to lead the way.

When we showed up at the park in Harlem very few of my colleagues seemed interested in . . . well planting trees. The full-time analysts shared office gossip with the interns. The vice presidents one-upped each other with war stories about investment deals. And the head of the group was nowhere to be found.

After an hour I noticed that very little service had actually been performed. As if on cue the co-head of the group showed up an hour late —wearing a slim-fit suit and a pair of Gucci boots . . . and of course a cheap digital watch. The chatter amongst the rest of the team died down as we awaited what he had to say.

7 Vivek Ramaswamy was attending Harvard when he was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 2006.

“All right guys” he said somberly as though he were going to discipline the team. A moment of tension hung in the air. And then he broke the ice: “Let’s take some pictures and get out of here!” The entire group burst into laughter. Within minutes we had vacated the premises. No trees had been planted. Soon the entire group was seated comfortably at a nearby bar — pitchers of beer ready on the tables and all.

I turned to one of the younger associates sitting next to me. I quipped that if we wanted to have a “social day” then we should’ve just called it that instead of “service day.”

He laughed and demurred: “Look just do what the boss says.” Then he quipped back: “You ever heard of the Golden Rule?”

“Treat others like you want to be treated?” I asked.

“Wrong” he said. “He who has the gold makes the rules.”

They want to make sure any IPO they bring to market has a brown or black person on the board but are okay with ripping off millions of Malaysians by engineering a slush fund for an oil tycoon’s private jet. A critic blasting Goldman Sachs’ double standards quoted in “Woke Inc.”

I called it “the Goldman Rule.” I learned something valuable that summer after all.

Over a decade later the Goldman Rule had only grown in importance. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last year Goldman CEO David Solomon declared that it would refuse to take companies public unless they had at least one “diverse” member on their board.

Put the “diversity” debate to one side: The bigger problem is that Goldman’s edict wasn’t about diversity at all. It was about corporate opportunism: seizing an already popular social value and prominently emblazoning it with the Goldman Sachs logo. It was like planting trees in Harlem all over again.

The timing of Goldman’s announcement was revealing. In the prior year approximately half the open board seats at S&P 500 companies went to women. In July 2019 the last remaining all-male board in the S&P 500 appointed a woman. In other words every single company in the S&P 500 was already abiding by Goldman’s diversity standard long before Goldman issued its own proclamation. Goldman’s announcement was an ideal way to attract praise without taking any real risk: another great risk-adjusted return for Goldman Sachs.

Goldman’s timing was also impeccable in another way. Its diversity quota proclamation stole the headlines from a much less flattering event: Goldman had just agreed to pay $5 billion in fines to governments around the world for its role in a scheme stealing billions from the Malaysian people. Goldman reportedly turned a willfully blind eye as corrupt Malaysian officials immediately turned the fund into their own private piggy bank. Ironically some of that money literally ended up funding Martin Scorsese’s 2013 movie “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

As one Redditor on the now-infamous forum WallStreetBets observed “They want to make sure that any IPO they bring to market has a brown or black person on the board of the company they are IPOing but are perfectly okay with ripping off millions of Malaysians by engineering a slush fund for an oil tycoon’s jewelry collection and private jet.” Well yes. Welcome to the woke-industrial complex.

Woke capitalism is really just crony capitalism 2.0. Here’s how it works: Big business uses progressive-friendly values to deflect attention from their own monolithic pursuit of profit and power.

7 Now that the Democratic Party is leaning ever leftward under Sens. Elizabeth Warren (left) and Bernie Sanders (right) Goldman and other businesses are trying to please them with woke virtue-signaling. Getty Images (2)

Crony capitalism 1.0 was simple by comparison: Banks simply had to make campaign contributions and hire lobbyists. In return they get favorable regulations that codify their status as gatekeepers who enjoy oligopoly status in taking companies public. Championship-level players of this game like Goldman Sachs often top it off with a flourish by lending their executives to serve as US treasury secretaries — Steve Mnuchin under President Donald Trump Hank Paulson under President George W. Bush and so on. And it pays off in the end: Winners like Goldman Sachs get bailouts in tough times like 2008 while less adroit competitors like Lehman Brothers get hung out to dry by the likes of Hank Paulson. That much is straightforward.

7 Woke Inc will be published on Tuesday.

But crony capitalism 2.0 is far trickier. Goldman’s diversity edict at Davos last year came at a time when Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren two of the biggest critics of the US government’s 2008 bailout of Goldman Sachs were presidential front-runners. Having supplicated to business-friendly Republicans and centrist Democrats for decades the moment had arrived for Goldman Sachs to begin placating the identity-politics-obsessed Far Left just as that wing of the Democratic Party had begun to accrue greater political power. Their new CEO is woker than woke and he’s a DJ on the side too. That’s how the 2020 edition of crony capitalism looks: Hank Paulson is outmoded by comparison.

Once the American public becomes “woke” to this new trend of self-interest masquerading as morality our citizenry can see through the charade of corporate virtue-signaling. When Amazon issues a public challenge to Walmart to pay workers $15 per hour we can simply chuckle to ourselves that Jeff Bezos is just doing what he does best: undermining his competitors when they’re most vulnerable.

Most importantly we can return the power to implement our social values back to American democracy where it belongs rather than to corporate chieftains who use it to make an extra buck. As a society we should allow and even embrace the corporate pursuit of financial self-interest above all. The only thing we should ask in return is this: Keep it naked instead of dressing it up as altruism. America might just be better off in the end if Goldman Sachs executives wear their Rolexes to work instead of preaching about diversity and pretending to plant trees.

4 Major Coca-Cola Brand Changes…

Recently Coca-Cola's been making some major shifts perhaps most notably in the form of discontinuations. In the spring the Coca-Cola Company announced the discontinuation of Coke Energy. This had been preceded by last fall's news that for the first time since 1963 Coca-Cola will no longer make Tab; nor are they continuing production of Odwalla juices and smoothies or Zico coconut water.

It's been reported that the shuttering of Coca-Cola's quieter-performing brands is due in large part to James Quincey the Coca-Cola Company's CEO since 2016 and chairman of the board since 2019 and his desire for aggressive investment in business development strategies and progressive corporate social responsibility initiatives like recycling.

Built with an expected lifespan of 50 years much of its infrastructure is now more than 60 years old. Its outmoded design reflects an era when power flowed only one way — from generators to consumers.

Now the grid must become more of a beehive with energy entering and exiting in countless directions given distributed energy resources like wind and solar generation. Like a hive it needs substantial storage capacity. And it must handle increased demand: The New England regional grid is expected to see a doubling or tripling of electricity use by 2050 as heating and transportation shift from fossil fuel reliance.

Maine is just starting to confront the magnitude of this power sector overhaul. Last fall and winter a diverse group representing environmental consumer and industry interests utilities and state agencies — the Maine Utility/Regulatory Reform and Decarbonization Initiative (MURRDI) — met repeatedly to discuss how to navigate this grid transformation eventually releasing consensus recommendations. A few are already taking form thanks to laws passed in the recent legislative session.

A more flexible grid

The grid of the future must be nimble partly due to the intermittent nature of renewable power. Another factor driving load flexibility is that electricity consumers can now be active producers (in the case of rooftop solar) and can adjust their electricity use in response to price signals (such as time-of-use rates).

Electricity consumers who shift their use to lower demand times can — in industry lingo — “shave the peak.” Load flexibility offers numerous benefits Kay Aikin co-founder of Dynamic Grid in Portland said at a June E2 Tech Forum: It reduces infrastructure needs and costs (including energy storage capacity) and helps cut carbon emissions.

As part of a newly passed law to advance energy storage the Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has opened a docket to look into rate design issues at Maine’s two dominant utilities CMP and Versant exploring how time-of-use rates could offer sufficient incentive to shift consumer behavior.

The PUC also has opened a docket to investigate the design and operation of electricity distribution trying to determine how the system can accommodate substantially more power. The commission has hired consultants and expects their reports by early next year according to Susan Faloon a PUC spokesperson and then “the commission will conduct a full investigation.”

Better data sharing utility accountability

That investigation should help identify data gaps said Rob Wood director of government relations and climate policy at The Nature Conservancy in Maine which contracted with the Great Plains Institute to facilitate MURRDI. Strong consensus emerged among participants on the “importance of good data and the availability of data to those who need it.”

The group recommended that Maine utilities share interconnection data with renewable power developers so proposed generation sites can link to the grid expeditiously and cost-effectively. Interconnection represents a significant roadblock for solar expansion in Maine. A recent letter solar developers sent the PUC urges it “to take an explicit oversight and advisory role to increase accountability and ensure CMP adheres to its renewable energy interconnection commitments” given the utility is still months from having results of transmission site studies begun early in 2020.

‘Holistic planning process’

MURRDI affirmed that the state urgently needs to undertake a “holistic grid planning process.” The Climate Action Plan made this clear last December calling for a “comprehensive stakeholder process” to start in 2021 that would address “utility structure load management data and information access grid modernization and expansion non-wires alternatives (like battery storage) interconnection distributed energy resources aggregation equitable cost allocation rate design integrated grid planning regional and local electricity markets regional collaboration reliability and resiliency and changes in law and regulation.”

Eight months later the Governor’s Energy Office and PUC have yet to assemble that “Power Sector Transformation Group.” Asked when that might happen Anthony Ronzio deputy director of the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future indicated “a date is not certain but we are working toward the recommendation in the plan.”

Another grid stakeholder group will be formed in coming weeks he noted in response to LD 936. That group must develop recommendations on optimal levels of distributed (or decentralized) generation and report back to the Legislature by Jan. 1 2022 on “how the state should undertake the adoption and implementation of a forward-looking holistic grid planning process.”

Whether these two efforts coordinate remains to be seen but according to MURRDI participant Jeff Marks Maine director for the nonprofit Acadia Center “they need to get started quickly and they need to work together.”

There’s widespread acknowledgment he added that “if we’re going to get to the scale of decarbonization we need to we’re going to have to do planning in a completely different way than we do now.” A growing number of people Marks included are convinced that means separating grid planning functions from utility ownership. Who takes over that planning role is “still an open question” he added but “there’s going to have to be a discussion about utility structure going forward.”

Investing resources inviting more people

Grid expansion and reinvention pose a daunting challenge for Maine requiring vast technological transformation without loss of short-term grid functioning. It also requires an unprecedented capital investment on the order of $60 billion Richard Silkman former State Planning Office director has estimated.

For those costs to be distributed equitably Maine will need to have more voices engaged in grid planning than have traditionally participated. Equity concerns environmental justice and climate resilience must be central to shaping that plan.

The PUC has “an outsized impact on people’s lives” Marks noted but offers limited opportunities for public input – operating in an arcane world of filings dockets and lobbyist-laden hearings. In the MURRDI process Wood saw “eagerness from a lot of stakeholders to see more public engagement at the PUC.” That change in culture will be especially important if the PUC takes on new roles such as overseeing long-term grid planning or hosting grid interconnection information.

Surveying all the grid challenges ahead brings to mind humorist Marshall Dodge’s line that you “can’t get theyuh from heuh.” But the hard truth is we have to — and soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 888+ SoC has a better performance than the Snapdragon 888. However one major problem with high-performing chips is heating. Smartphones that come with high-performing processors need to have a proper heat dissipating system. In fact in some cases they may need an external device for heat dissipation in some scenarios.

According to recent reports Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 can easily use the black shark magnetic heat dissipation back clip. The report claims that using this heat dissipation back clip significantly improves the performance of the MIX 4. Like we said earlier the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888+ SoC. In order to fully release the powerful performance of this chip the MIX 4 comes with a brand-new cooling system.

This new heat dissipation system has an area of 11588mm². It uses the latest graphene temperature equalizing plate with an area of ​​1232mm² which reduces the weight by 50%. In addition to the excellent heat dissipation system of Mi MIX 4 the black shark magnetic heat dissipation back clip can also effectively help the phone to dissipate heat.

This accessory uses the Peltier effect to achieve hot and cold partitions. The built-in high-speed fan provides a strong air supply which effectively reduces the center temperature of the back of the phone and quickly removes excess heat inside the phone.

Not only that the BlackShark magnetic heat dissipation back clip uses a composite thermal silicone pad. The ultra-high thermal conductivity pure copper is attached to the bottom of the silicone to increase the contact area between the back clip and the mobile phone while reducing the cooling effect of the back clip.

A few days ago the lineup also began its first sale. Amid this exciting environment a new piece of interesting news regarding its next flagship – Huawei Mate 50 is already on the Horizon.

According to a well-known Weibo tipster the Huawei Mate 50 series could equip the Snapdragon SM8450+ chipset. Before we reach any conclusion Let’s dive into the SM8450+ chip and learn more about it.

According to the information this SM8450 will be the next flagship Qualcomm processor based on 4-nanometer (nm) process technology. However it’s not confirmed whether this chip will be manufactured by Samsung or TSMC. To be mentioned the processor also has ‘Plus’ and a standard version.

Famous leaker – EvanBlass has previously shared information about the SM8450. This is the next-gen Qualcomm premium system-on-chip (SoC). Featuring an integrated Snapdragon X65 5G Modem-RF system and is fabricated on a 4nm process tech.

The chip has the following chip architecture components including:

Kryo 780 CPU built on ARM Cortext v9 technology Adreno 730 GPU Spectra 680 ISP Up to 1GHz mmWave downlink and 400Mhz Sub-6D Qualcomm secure processing unit (SPU260) Support for Qualcomm FASTConnect 6900 subsystem Support for the quad-channel package on package LPDDR5 RAM Adreno 665 video processing unit (VPU) Adreno 1195 display processing unit (DPU)

These are the specs for the standard SM8450 and it’s yet to find out what extra the Plus version has to offer. Therefore it’ll be very interesting to see what the Huawei Mate 50 series could do with these new chipsets if launched.

Current process:

Tipster DigitalChatStation revealed that the SM8450 is being manufactured by Samsung and its performance has been increased by 20 percent compared to the previous generation. However there seems to be some kind of heat issues and we may not see it until next year.

Still there’s no confirmation on the launch date of the Snapdragon SM8450 processor as we await more hints on this matter.

Supplies after December:

A report reveals that Huawei’s latest flagship – Huawei P50 Series will solely sell with Snapdragon 888 4G processor around December this year. Reflecting that Huawei planning to emphasize Snapdragon processors and use them in every model due to the lack of Kirin chipsets.

Furthermore the Snapdragon-powered Huawei models will have sufficient chip supplies after December. In the awakening Huawei phones with Snapdragon 888 chips will become the mainstream models made by the company.

More interestingly the report also claimed the upcoming Huawei Mate 50 and a new foldable phone will feature a new Snapdragon processor.

Huawei P50:

After a long time Huawei adopted the Snapdragon processor in its flagship devices and unveiled the Huawei P50 series package with SD 888 processor alongside Kirin 9000. Yet these chips are locked on the 4G network due to some component-related issue.

Huawei Mate 50 series launch:

Currently Huawei has not made any official announcement regarding the launch of the Huawei Mate 50 lineup but it depends on when Qualcomm is actually driving in its new processor and present it among the device makers.

We’ll keep you posted.

If the rumour is accurate the new phone would succeed Black Shark 4 series that debuted earlier this year. The development comes from a notable tipster who goes by the name Digital Chat Station. In a post on Twitter the tipster claims that Black Shark is developing the next-generation Black Shark 5 with model number KTUS-A0. The phone will reportedly carry Qualcomm Snapdragon 888+ SoC that Xiaomi recently introduced with their flagship Xiaomi Mi Mix 4.

The tipster also suggests that the Black Shark 5 may have support for 100W fast charging (probably 120W like its predecessors). Unfortunately the post does not mention anything else other than these two parameters. The tipster does not highlight anything on a Pro model. If true Black Shark 5 would hope to rival the Asus ROG Phone 5 and the Nubia Red Magic 6. The duo also faced stiff competition from the Black Shark 4 series that includes the vanilla Black Shark 4 and Black Shark 4 Pro. Both devices feature a 6.67-inch FHD+ hole-punch display with a 144Hz refresh rate and 720Hz touch response rate – the highest response rate seen on any smartphone display. The vanilla carries Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 SoC while the Black Shark 4 Pro packs Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 SoC. Both the smartphones also come with 120W fast charging for their 4500mAh batteries. The Black Shark 4 and Black Shark 4 Pro are claimed to charge the battery completely in just 15 minutes. The Black Shark carried a starting price tag of CNY 2499 (roughly Rs 27800) for the 6GB RAM + 128GB storage and the Pro model cost CNY 3999 variant which is roughly Rs 44500. Since most of the old Black Shark series phones did not launch in India the arrival of rumoured Black Shark 5 remains uncertain. It is also unclear whether the phone would launch this year.

The offseason free-agent addition by Big Blue tackles a preseason Q&A with Post columnist Steve Serby.

Q: Describe your on-field mentality.

A: Violent. I’m always talking to myself to be more violent.

Q: Describe that transformation from being a family man and dog lover.

A: It’s really just like opening the door and going to a new room.

Q: Do you try to be a bully?

A: That goes into like being a violent player being a bully off the ball.

Q: You tweeted once: “In the trenches there are no apologies given. Dominate or be dominated.”

A: You have to be prepared for everything. … Every rep is a battle you gotta have that mentality that you’re gonna be a dominator or you’re just gonna try and survive.

Q: What are your thoughts on Leonard Williams?

A: He’s a dominator. He has that mindset. I feel like we all have that mindset on the line we want to be great. Obviously he put up the numbers to be great. A guy that I’m excited to go to war with.

Q: Dexter Lawrence?

A: He’s another guy I see as a dominator as well. You have a big guy like him being able to run down running backs and blow people off the line — it’s crazy to see.

Q: What are your impressions of Joe Judge?

A: I think he’s a great coach … somebody that is easy to trust. The way he carries himself and the way he controls the meetings and practice … he doesn’t change. That’s something that you need leading the team. I’m happy that I have this opportunity to play for him.

Q:. How is he different from Bill Belichick?

A: He definitely has the youth. He also has a louder voice in the room. They’re both great coaches.

Q: What was Tom Brady like as a teammate?

A: It was an opportunity for me to learn from an elite pro.

Q: Daniel Jones?

A: He’s definitely a guy who wants to win and I’m excited to play with.

Q: Were you big when you were little?

A: Yeah pretty much.

Q: What was it like growing up so big?

A: Same as any other big kid you go through your ups and downs and name calling and fun times and good times. I feel like I had a good childhood somewhat. I was able to make it here so I’m not complaining. … I wasn’t such a bad kid but my mom would have to come to school because I got in trouble sometimes. I feel like it’s all stuff that I was able to grow from and continue to grow from.

Q: Do you remember one memorable time when your mother had to come to school?

A: Yeah too many times. Anytime I got into fights anytime I was suspended. I heard it 10 times more from her ’cause she was a single mother taking care of five. I was the boy that gave her a hard time. She had headaches because of me.

Q: Were you angry as a young kid?

A: I don’t know. … I’d say somewhat. I was also still learning and adjusting ’cause I was raised in Samoa for the first part of my childhood and I came back to the States and had to learn English. So I was obviously dealing with the language barrier and having to go school.

Q: You’ve had to overcome more than most. The well-chronicled story of your older brother [Skeevie 22 years old] being shot in the head [May 2011] causing you to think about not pursuing your NFL dream at the University of Washington. Tell me why he meant and means so much to you.

A: He was an athletic guy. … He was really about the community. He was I would say my uncle’s favorite. He was a role model for me … for many kids too. … Gone too soon.

Q: What caused you to punch a goalpost in practice and break your hand as a college freshman?

A: It was maybe two or three months from when my brother passed in training camp. I was still dealing with a lot of inner demons … flashbacks … just trying to work through all that.

Q: You think of him every day is that right?

A: Most definitely.

Q: He would be proud of the man you’ve become.

A: Appreciate that. I try and make him proud.

Q: How was he such a good big brother?

A: He definitely didn’t make it easy for me. That’s a sign of a big brother. He knew that nothing was gonna be given that you had to earn everything. He got the opportunity to travel with me to my official visits and unofficial visits. He was a mentor somebody you go to to get advice … girl problems or school problems. He was also that father figure. You wanted to make him happy and proud. You definitely didn’t want to bring dishonor to the family. You just wanted to meet the expectations that he and my oldest brother set.

Q: How long did it take you to get over his death?

A: I don’t know. … Sometimes I feel like I don’t know if I’m over it I don’t know if you truly do get over it. You just continue to try and live each day like he would want.

Q: Why did you switch to No. 55 with the Browns?

4 Danny Shelton with the Browns in 2017. Diamond Images/Getty Images

A: That was my brother’s favorite number. He was a big Junior Seau fan. It basically became his identity. It was something that my family used as a way of coping … a sign from him. … Every time we wake up and we see No. 55 somewhere we saw that as like our brother’s just letting us know that he’s with us and still do today.

Q: Do you remember the day Junior Seau committed suicide May 2 2012?

A: A lot of people were hurt and shocked. It was just a big hit on not only the football world.

Q: Giants fans are concerned about the offensive line. Maybe you can ease their concerns. Let’s start with Nick Gates.

Q: He uses his leverage he’s a tall guy long arms … and I feel like he takes control of the line. He’s a communicator he’s a guy that gets everything going for those guys. He’s the guy that they need to be.

Q: Will Hernandez.

A: He’s a dog man. He’s a guy that’s ready to go to war. Same thing with Nick you know?

Q: Shane Lemieux.

A: Shane’s a younger guy and I feel like he’s grown a lot.

Q:. If you could test your skills against any offensive lineman in NFL history who would it be?

A: [Former 49er] Jesse Sapolu. Just to be able to pick his brain while he’s in his prime and also work on technique.

Q: Did you learn anything about yourself during your 0-16 2017 season with the Browns?

A: You definitely learn a lot about yourself and the teammates you have and the coaches you have. I appreciate and I’m thankful to have played with those guys.

Q: On the flip side describe the emotions winning Super Bowl LIII with the Patriots.

A: As a kid just like you grow up wanting to play football when you reach that dream of playing in the NFL you come that much closer to winning a Super Bowl but you don’t realize that that much closer is the hardest thing ever … the long seasons the long training camps the multiple days of full contact multiple injuries you go through. You put all this work for so many years and you finally get rewarded and you gain that title as a world champion. You just feel like you’re on top of the world for the first time that moment.

Q: Did you get to hold the Lombardi Trophy?

A: Yes sir.

Q: Describe what that moment was like.

A: It wasn’t as good of a feeling as watching the time go out after the game and seeing the confetti and the fans rushing and teammates crying and everybody hugging and jumping around.

Q: Do you think you’re in the best shape of your life right now or no?

A: I think I am getting there.

Q: What is your weight?

A: Right now it’s 345. That’s what the coaches want me at right now.

4 Giants defensive tackle Danny Shelton Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post

Q: Do you have to watch what you eat?

A: Definitely. I’m a big guy so it’s easy for me to gain weight.

Q: So what kind of foods do you avoid?

A: I try to keep a low-carb diet.

Q: What is fatherhood like for you?

A: Every day is something new and every day you have to find a way to cherish the moment you have with your kids. After long days of work and getting beat up and coming home sore you kind of forget you’re sore because your kids want to run up and jump up on you. You become more cautious and aware and everything I do I want to do for my kids.

Q: Your son Crue Skeevie was 2 in July and your daughter Saylor is 6 months old. Describe his personality.

A: Right now he’s in that terrible-twos phase. He’s learning to share at the same time he doesn’t want to share and gets aggressive. He’s the best brother. He’s always wanting to carry my daughter and always watching me and copying me.

Q: Describe your four dogs.

A: I have a pit bull a husky a malamut mixed with a husky and a French bulldog. I think I’ve always been kind of like an animal lover. Our family was gifted a dog when my brother passed and kind of helped with coping. That’s what I’ve always seen my dogs as a family member. It’s always good to see them when I get home.

Q: Who gifted you the dog Tama?

A: A family friend. He had a litter of Rottweilers. They gifted to all my family when I left for college. He was really my younger brother’s best friend. Every time I’d visit I’d always wrestle with him play with him.

Q: You’ve been involved with shelter dogs.

A: I just wanted to help out those shelter dogs especially the pit bulls. Sometimes pit bulls get misunderstood.

There’s no reason not to follow the formula that these guys have to us from their experiences and what guys went through to become world champions. We have the blueprint just have to trust and continue to work. It’s been great to hear the history and see the excitement that the Giants bring to New York New Jersey.",,,,,,,,,

It was the first time the Bucs have played in front of a full house since 2019.

In the end it wasn't the start Bucs fans were hoping for. The Cincinnati Bengals beat the Bucs 19 to 14.

Ray Jay is at 100 percent capacity this season and every game is already sold out so fans obviously have high hopes for another great season. Especially since more of them are able to watch in-person this year.

“We won last year we’re gonna win again this year so I’m here to support again. Rain or shine here” said Gregory Delaine.

Some Cincinnati Bengals fans showed up for the game too. Including the mother of one of the newly drafted Bengals players.

“Most of all D'Ante Smith! Cause he’s my son and I love him and this is hopefully his NFL debut” said Samantha Russel.

The Bucs fans inside the stadium Friday have high hopes the Bucs will head back to the Super Bowl this year.

“Super Bowl that’s it nothing else. Tom Brady what’s your favorite ring? The next one” said Scott Witt.

And some of them are already making plans to be there.

“We got the same team coming and I don’t know much about sports but I know they said we got a easier schedule this year as well so I’m pretty sure we’re gonna make it right back into the playoffs and right back into the Super Bowl and I might have to take a flight over to I think what L.A. is where they’re having it at” said Ryan Mosley.

The Bucs' next game is against the Tennessee Titans on Saturday August 21 at Raymond James Stadium.

For a few breathless seconds as Brady was sprawled on the turf it was fair to question the sanity of playing the 44-year-old Bucs quarterback in a meaningless game.

There simply wasn’t enough biscuit to risk it.

Fortunately Brady got off the ground in one piece and the Bucs defense of their Super Bowl 55 title is still whole.

“He saw it coming and just folded up like a cheap tent” coach Bruce Arians said of Brady who left the game after that play. “Smart as hell.”

Bucs drop preseason opener The Bucs fell to the Cincinnati Bengals 19-14 in their preseason opener Saturday at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

The Bucs lost to the Bengals 19-14 in a turnover-marred game in which Tampa Bay didn’t have the football much. They compiled only 159 total yards on 60 offensive plays while allowing 303 yards.

The defense forced four turnovers including two fumbles to stop Bengals drives. One was caused by linebacker Lavonte David. Rookie K.J. Britt recovered the only one forced by safety Ross Cockrell.

Linebacker Joseph Jones intercepted Cincinnati’s Kyle Shurmur and returned the ball 15 yards for a touchdown with 11:10 remaining in the game. A conversion pass from Kyle Trask to Codey McElroy cut the Bengals lead to two points but the Florida rookie was unable to mount a comeback.

“Honestly he just threw it right to me” Jones said. “First pick ever first pick six. I’m excited.”

Blaine Gabbert put together the drive of the night a 15-play march capped by running back Ke’Shawn Vaughn powering across the goal line for a 2-yard TD run.

The Bucs tried to use some razzle-dazzle on the conversion lining holder Bradley Pinion up at quarterback with kicker Ryan Succop at running back before shifting into the normal kicking formation. The PAT was good but “aborted” because the ball wasn’t placed at the 15-yard line.

“We had really bad communication on the faked extra point” Arians said. “The kicker didn’t know the rule. You can’t line back up and kick it. You don’t get a point for it. Evidently it wasn’t communicated well enough that you can’t do that so that’s on me.”

Vaughn a third-round pick from Vanderbilt last year was the Bucs’ workhorse in the first half. He finished with 27 yards on 11 carries including the TD while adding a 7-yard reception.

Unfortunately the Bucs couldn’t protect the football. Quarterback Ryan Griffin had two passes deflected into the air and intercepted.

Trask deserved a better fate than his numbers (4 of 15 passing for 35 yards) would indicate. His receivers dropped two deep passes that may have changed the outcome.

“Those are plays I’ve seen those guys make in practice” Trask said. “Little things here and there just didn’t go our way. We’ll get it coached up and hit it next time.”

Another rookie who drew raves was first-round pick Joe Tryon who had a sack negated for unnecessary roughness.

“Bang-bang play” Tryon said. “It is what it is. I’ll probably go for the ball next time.”

Other teams have elected not to allow their starting quarterback to play at all in the preseason. The list includes Bengals starter Joe Burrow who has returned from offseason surgery to repair a torn ACL; and Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford whom coach Sean McVay said wouldn’t take a snap this preseason.

But the best thing Brady did was crawl out under the pile of Bengals defenders and walk to the sideline where he safely stood the rest of the night. “(Next time) just throw it away” Arians said.

Winding up on the wrong side of the scoreboard in a 19-14 preseason-opening loss to the Cincinnati Bengals didn't dampen the mood Saturday night.

“I didn’t know what to expect. ... But actually seeing all the fans and actually stepping back on the turf it feels really good to be back out here man"" linebacker Lavonte David said. ""It felt like it’s football season again.”

Chris Evans finished a long drive with a 1-yard touchdown run and kickers Evan McPherson and Austin Seibert combined for four second-half field goals for the Bengals who played without quarterback Joe Burrow. They also didn’t see much of Tom Brady or the rest of Tampa Bay’s regulars either.

With Brady and his talented supporting cast sitting after playing just six snaps during the lone series the 44-year-old quarterback worked veterans Blaine Gabbert and Ryan Griffin and second-round draft pick Kyle Trask ran the offense the remainder of the night.

Burrow the 2019 Heisman Trophy winner and the first overall selection in last year’s draft who’s coming off major reconstructive knee surgery did not dress. The Bengals got extended looks at Brandon Allen and Kyle Shurmur at quarterback.

“I was encouraged by a lot of things I saw” said Bengals coach Zac Taylor who also liked the way his defense began the game against Brady.

“It was six and out I think” Taylor added. “They got them off the field finished with a sack. That was a good way for them to start.”

Griffin played into the third quarter for the Bucs who return all 22 starters from the star-laden roster coach Bruce Arians and general manager Jason Licht assembled around Brady after signing him in free agency last year.

Trask who the Bucs are grooming as a potential successor to Brady entered midway through the third quarter. The former Florida star completed 4 of 15 passes for 35 yards and was sacked twice.

“It was fun to go out there and get some real NFL reps” Trask said.

Gabbert noted the difference in the vibe in the stadium with most of the seats filled compared to last season when the number of fans allowed to attend games was limited throughout the league due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“The energy was awesome” the 11th-year pro said.

SHORT OUTING

With Tropical Depression Fred weakening to a tropical wave but still threatening to bring heavy rain to Florida as it entered the eastern Gulf of Mexico Brady was1 of 2 for 9 yards and was sacked once before departing.

The seven-time Super Bowl champion handed off to Leonard Fournette on the game’s first two plays then connected with former Bengal and offseason free agent acquisition Giovani Bernard for 9 yards on third-and-8 to extend the opening drive.

Defensive end Joseph Ossai sacked Brady three plays later though ending the quarterback’s brief outing. Gabbert worked one series as well leading a 15-play 79-yard drive that Ke’Shawn Vaughn finished with a 2-yard touchdown run.

Gabbert finished 6 of 11 for 64 yards. Griffin was 6 of 11 for 47 yards and two interceptions before being replaced by Trask.

INJURIES

Bengals: Ossai left with a wrist injury and did not return. Allen started in place of Burrow while Billy Price filled in for Trey Hopkins at center and defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi was replaced in the starting lineup by Josh Toupo.

Buccaneers: Tampa did not report any injuries. Safety Mike Edwards started for Jordan Whitehead who along with rookie offensive lineman Robert Hainsey and tight end Cameron Brate were among the players who sat out.

UP NEXT

Bengals: at Washington next Friday.

Buccaneers: home vs. Tennessee next Saturday.

The pictures show the extremely compact PCB design that resides underneath the single-single cooler which makes us want a half-length variant of the card.

NVIDIA RTX A4000 Features The Smallest PCB For A Full GA104 Ampere GPU Perfect For Custom SFF & Mini PCs

The NVIDIA RTX A4000 comes in a single-slot & full-length form factor. The graphics card features a blower fan that circulates air within the cooler shroud from both the top and bottom sides. That is why the backplate extends beyond the PCB and has a cutout for the blower-fan at the bottom too. It cools a really compact aluminum fin array which makes direct contact with the GPU and VRAM modules through flat copper heat pipes. The VRMs are also covered by a singular heatsink that is also part of the frame.

Underneath the shroud is a very compact PCB almost as small as the AMD Radeon R9 Nano. The card itself features the NVIDIA GA104 GPU core in its full-fat configuration featuring 6144 Cores & an impressive 16 GB GDDR6 memory bus with speeds of up to 16 Gbps for a total bandwidth out-put of 448 GB/s. The card has a TDP of 140W which is supplied through a single 6-pin connector & that's located beyond the PCB with extender cables routed in the shroud. As for VRMs the card is powered by a 6+2 phase delivery and features four Display Outputs all of which are Display Port 1.4a.

Coming to the total horsepower of the NVIDIA RTX A4000 we are looking at around 20 TFLOPs of FP32 compute (19.2 TFLOPs to be exact). The AMD Radeon R9 Nano delivered 8.1 TFLOPs of FP32 compute at 170W. This shows just how far we have come in terms of efficiency with current-gen GPUs.

If NVIDIA wanted they could've released a small form factor version of the GA104 GPU with a standard dual-slot half-length board aimed at Mini ITX PCs. Even the 8 GB GDDR6 memory would have been absolutely fine and a TDP of around 150W would make it slightly higher clocked than the RTX A4000. So far this generation has seen the least Mini ITX & small form factor graphics cards as manufacturers are putting more emphasis on bigger coolers and more power intense designs. It would be great if we had options on both sides. The GTX 1080 was the last high-end card to receive a MIni ITX treatment that was scaled down to RTX 2070 and now a true ITX card is only available in the form of RTX 3060 Ti and below.

NVIDIA also has a really cute RTX A2000 which was launched last week and features a dual-slot half-height form factor. The card is based on the GA106 GPU and has a TDP of just 70W & doesn't require any external power input.

We do not get to see many teardowns of NVIDIA workstation cards mainly because they are utterly expensive and such operation usually means that the warranty is voided. Fortunately this has not stopped snake-robot from looking under the hood of this blower-type this workstation model.

It may be hard not to refer to this card as Quadro but with this generation of its workstation cards NVIDIA ultimately dropped this brand in hopes of simplifying its product naming convention. It didn’t work and even NVIDIA themselves still list their cards under the ‘RTX/Quadro’ page on the official website. There is really no better way to call these cards other than ‘RTX Ampere’ ‘RTX workstation” or ‘Quadro Ampere’.

NVIDIA RTX A4000 is based on PG190 board design a derivative of RTX 3060 Ti PCB with an 8-pin power connector. This card however does not have a power connector attached directly to the board but relies on an extension cable.

The graphics card is equipped with NVIDIA GA104-875 GPU featuring all 6144 CUDA cores enabled (essentially the same GPU as RTX 3070 Ti). Unlike the GeForce series though workstation Ampere relies on GDDR6 non-X memory. This model features Samsung K4ZAF325BM-HC16 modules each featuring 2GB of capacity clocked at 16 Gbps. Another difference is 230W TDP in comparison to RTX 3070 Ti’s 290W.

This RTX A4000 teardown might answer a question that has been frequently asked by our readers. What had ever happened to blower-type Ampere gaming cards? According to our information NVIDIA has banned board partners from launching such designs because they could’ve affected the sales of RTX Ampere models all of which are using blower coolers. There were even instances where RTX gaming cards that launched 2 weeks prior have been removed from AIB websites. Some manufacturers had even reached out to us to remove articles about these cards those requests were obviously ignored. In case you are wondering what have we missed take a look at this article.

Source: u/snake-robot (Reddit)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L0FjZXItTml0cm8tNS1BTjUxNy01My1yZXZpZXctQWZmb3JkYWJsZS1nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wLXdpdGgtUlRYLTMwNTAuNTU1MjAyLjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Acer Nitro 5 AN517-53 review : Affordable gaming laptop with RTX 3050,"Graphics card

The most interesting aspect for many users might be the GPU. While we were able to examine the mobile GeForce RTX 3050 Ti once or twice in the past there have hardly been any benchmark results for the RTX 3050 so far. Compared to the RTX 3050 Ti the DirectX 12 model has to make do with 2048 instead of 2560 shaders.

However the performance primarily depends on the cooling system (keyword clock margin) and the set TGP. The latter varies between 35 and 80 watts for the RTX 3050 (without Dynamic Boost). In the case of the Nitro 5 it is 75 watts including Dynamic Boost so it is a pretty good value that is in the upper third.

We see the limited video memory as the weak point. Both the RTX 3050 and the RTX 3050 Ti only have 4 GB of GDDR6 VRAM (128-bit interface) which is no longer up-to-date in 2021 and especially in view of the VRAM requirements of many current games and has a negative impact on the future-proofing of the laptop. Even in the mid-range segment at least 6 GB would be appropriate by now.

However the Ampere GPU has an easy game against the old GTX 1650 which still had to do without ray tracing support. In the 3DMark tests the lead is usually 30 to 40%. However it does not quite reach the GTX 1660 Ti's level - that was to be expected beforehand.

Acer Swift X specs Price: $1069

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800U

GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti

RAM: 16GB

Storage: 512GB NVMe PCIe SSD

Display: 14-inch 1080p IPS (16:9)

Battery: 9:11

Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.2

Size: 12.7 x 8.4 x 0.7 inches

Weight: 3.1 pounds

Acer's Swift X is all about packing the fastest components in the smallest chassis. It accomplishes this by combining a powerful AMD processor with discrete Nvidia RTX graphics in a surprisingly slim frame. Speed portability and endurance at a competitive price what else does one need?

Digging deeper reveals a few bones Acer buried to keep the price down. While its chassis is made of aluminum the no-frills Swift X feels less premium than its competitors and the plastic touchpad and display bezels aren't helping. Nor are the mounds of apps pre-installed on this $1000 laptop. I also wish more attention was paid to the speakers and that the 720p webcam was good enough for streaming.

Should you buy the Swift X? That depends. It certainly isn't for everyone — there are too many low points for this to be the ""If you could only buy one laptop"" answer. However if you need to run demanding tasks and are searching for a laptop that gets the job done without getting in the way the Swift X is worth considering.

Acer Swift X price and configurations

Talk about a value pick. The Swift X gets you top-of-the-line specs at a more reasonable price than competing laptops. Yes it's a premium product demanding a premium price but I expected a much higher MSRP after glancing at the specs.

There is only one configuration available at the time of writing. It comes with a 14-inch 1080p display along with an AMD Ryzen 5800U CPU 16GB of RAM a 512GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU — all for $1069.

Acer Swift X design

This doesn't feel like a flagship premium product. Something here is...lacking. The Swift X is made of aluminum but doesn't feel as luxurious as say the HP Envy 14 . Let me explain.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

The Swift X is made of metal but the pearlescent coating Acer applied to the surface gives off plasticky vibes. And while I'm glad Acer is playing with colors (the Swift comes in Steam Blue Prodigy Pink and our review unit's less-exciting Safari Gold) the laptop lacks flourishes like a chrome-trimmed touchpad. Also on the deck is a retro strip-style fingerprint sensor  and a distracting vent near the hinge. Look up at the display and you'll see that the thin bezels surrounding the panel are made of cheap plastic.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

These compromises result in a package that doesn't feel as deluxe as its peers but remember they were made so Acer could use high-end components without charging a fortune. For all my complaints there is no deal-breaking fault to the Swift X's design and I have no worries about its durability — I didn't notice any flexing when pressing on the lid and keyboard and the hinge is reassuringly stiff.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

I've even come to appreciate some of the practical details of the design like the lip on the front edge that makes the lid easy to lift and how the back of the deck raises a few degrees when you open the lid making the keyboard more comfortable to type on. So while the design isn't exactly inspiring it is at least functional.

Acer needed some extra space to pack a discrete GPU into the Swift X's frame which shows in its 12.7 x 8.4 x 0.7-inch dimensions and 3.1-pound weight. This makes the Swift X about the same size as the HP Envy 14 (12.3 x 8.8 x 0.7 inches 3.3 pounds) 12.3 x 8.8 x 0.7 inches) but thicker than the Lenovo Yoga 9i (2.6 x 8.5 x 0.6 inches 3 pounds).

Acer Swift X ports

Being slightly thicker than its rivals helps the Swift X pack a few extra ports into its chassis. On the left side is a USB 3.2 Type-C port  a headphone jack an HDMI 2.0 a USB 3.2 Type-A input and a power jack.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Over on the right side is a second USB 3.2 Type-A port alongside a Kensington lock slot and a headphone/mic jack.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Missing from this assortment of I/O is a card reader for photographers and videographers. And I wish there were a second USB-C port for connecting to modern gadgets while charging the Swift X. Of course Thunderbolt is missing because of the AMD processor.

Acer Swift X display

The 14-inch 1080p IPS display on the Swift X is good. This is no 4K or OLED screen but the matte panel is great for productivity work (if you're OK with a 16:9 aspect ratio) and is bright and colorful enough for watching your favorite shows or movies.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

As much as I wished I'd watched the lively Space Jam: A New Legacy trailer on an OLED panel the Swift X's display reproduced accurate and punchy colors. While these hues didn't exactly pop off the screen Foghorn Leghorn's scarlet red comb and wattle and Daffy Duck's pumpkin orange bill were more saturated than I expected from a matte display. The 1080p panel was also sharp enough for me to see small strands of fluff sticking out of Bugs Bunny's felt-like fur.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

The panel reached our minimum color and brightness preferences but didn't dare go any higher. For instance the panel covered 74% of the DCI-P3 color gamut  falling below the 83% category average and the Envy 14 (83%) and nearly matching the Yoga 9i (76%).

Maximum panel brightness reached 303 nits just above our 300-nit lower limit and below the Envy 14 (362 nits) Yoga 9i (334 nits) and the average (389 nits).

Acer Swift X keyboard and touchpad

Typing this review on the Swift X's keyboard was enjoyable once my fingers got used to the somewhat shallow travel. Key presses were registered instantly and each letter and number that appeared on screen was preceded by a pleasant audible ""click.""

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Adequate spacing makes up for small keys although the miniature arrow and shortcut keys will be tricky for those with sausage fingers like my own. Other minor complaints include inconsistent keyboard backlighting and the power button being located in the top-right corner making it easier to accidentally turn the system off when reaching for delete.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

And now we get to the tragic twist in this tale. I can overlook poor aesthetics but there is no excuse for cutting corners on something as important as the touchpad. It's not that the touchpad doesn't work properly — it responded quickly to my swipes and Windows 10 gestures — my problem is that it's made of Mylar a fancy name for plastic and the same material I criticized in my HP Envy 13 review. Put bluntly the material feels cheap and fingers don't glide as effortlessly as they do on glass.

Acer Swift X audio

Speaker quality tends to be a low priority on Acer laptops and that's the case with the Swift X. The dual-firing speakers located on the bottom panel sounded congested and they passed that symptom on to Slenderbodies' lead singer Aram “Max” Vehuni when I listened to the indie-pop duo's ""mirror.""

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Clogging up the soundstage was the varied instrumentation which merged into a cacophony of drum hits and synthesizers. I then switched to Thrice's ""Robot Soft Exorcism"" and the chorus told me all I needed to know — Swift X owners should listen to music through headphones or earbuds.

Acer Swift X performance

Don't be shy Swift X now is your time to step into the spotlight. Powered by an AMD Ryzen 5800U CPU paired with Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics the Swift X is a performance monster among its portable peers.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

We'll highlight its graphics prowess in the next section and focus for now on the AMD chip which is paired with 16GB of RAM on our unit. Running my typical workload on the Swift X was like handing a bodybuilder a 10-pound weight and asking for 15 reps. The Swift X scoffed loading 25 Google Chrome tabs in a flash. I watched YouTuber Kai W talk about film photography streamed Billie Eilish's new album on YouTube Music and poked around on Twitch to discover that Apex Legends is still a massive hit. The Swift X carried my web browsing curiosities without even a flicker of lag.

On the Geekbench 5.3 overall performance  the Swift X scored an outstanding 7954 crushing the Envy 14 (4761 Core i5-1135G7) the Yoga 9i (5321 Core i7-1185G7) and the category average (3566).

It isn't just the CPU and GPU helping the Swift X outperform its rivals — Acer outfitted this laptop with a blazingly quick 512GB NVMe SSD . It duplicated a 25GB multimedia file in just 26 seconds for a transfer rate of 1050 megabytes per second. In a sprint competition this made its rivals the Envy 14 (305 MBps) and Yoga 9i (692.3 MBps) look like speed walkers.

The Swift X needed only 8 minutes and 5 seconds to convert a 4K video to 1080p resolution using the Handbrake app. That is in a different league than the Envy 14 (13:20) the Yoga 9i (14:24) and the category average (17:21).

Acer Swift X graphics

Slim and lightweight — it must be time to start talking about integrated graphics  right? Hold on one moment! The Swift X isn't like those other ultra-thin laptops because deep within its belly is an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU a chip capable of playing the latest games at smooth frame rates.

The Swift X flexed its muscles in our graphics test playing Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Gathering Storm at a silky smooth 67 frames per second which narrowly tops the Envy 14 (63 fps GTX 1650 Ti) and crushes anything with integrated graphics including the Yoga 9i (25 fps).

Its dominance continued in our synthetic test in which the Swift X scored 8827 on the 3DMark Fire Strike benchmark well ahead of the Envy 14 (7423) and the Yoga 9i (5014).

Acer Swift X battery life

Putting a discrete graphics card in a thin chassis is usually a recipe for short battery life. But not this time. The Swift X lasted for an impressive 9 hours and 11 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test  which involves continuous web browsing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

The Acer couldn't match the Envy 14 (9:51) and powered down about an hour before the Yoga 9i (11:15) and the category average (10:58).

Acer Swift X webcam

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Who did abstract expressionism best Pollock or the Swift X's 720p webcam? OK maybe I'm being harsh here. The selfie I snapped in my dimly lit office isn't that bad but my goodness does the smearing of details in my face make it look more like a painting than a photo. Acer of course isn't the only offender using dreadful webcams but the Swift X lands somewhere near the bottom.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Our (oft-given) advice? Buy yourself an external webcam for important meetings and conference calls.

Acer Swift X heat

The Swift X's aluminum surfaces did a good job of dissipating hot air as we played a 15-minute 1080p YouTube video during our heat test. The toastiest location was the bottom panel which reached 96 degrees Fahrenheit just one degree above our comfort threshold. The parts your skin touches the touchpad and keyboard warmed to only 83 and 90 degrees respectively.

Acer Swift X software and warranty

Oh Acer please quit with the bloatware. Sure it can be quickly uninstalled but does it really need to be taking up precious storage space in the first place? There is Booking.com ExpressVPN some privacy risk dashboard from a startup called FigLeaf (really Acer?) and GoTrust ID a way to use your phone for login authentication (something we strongly discourage).

Let me take a sip of water because there's more. Among Acer's in-house apps are JumpStart which frustratingly redirected me to Acer.com; Documents which added to my frustration by simply opening the File Explorer to two pre-downloaded PDFs; and Acer Legal Information which I'm sure users are eager to read. These could've been neatly packaged in Care Center the app you want to keep around because it's where you can see system health and download new updates and drivers.

Oh and before I forget: Evernote Hearts Deluxe and a pair of content creation apps are also pre-installed on the Acer Swift X to go along with your standard Windows 10 Home software.

The Swift X comes with a one-year warranty. See how Acer fared in our Tech support showdown and Best and Worst Brands special reports.

Bottom line

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Who doesn't like a good mashup? The Swift X is one-part gaming laptop one-part ultraportable. Placing an AMD Ryzen 5000 CPU and Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti in the Swift X was a stroke of genius. And even better these components don't take much of a hit to battery life as the Swift endured for more than 9 hours on a charge. Acer then went a step further by pricing the ultra-portable at around $1000 making it less expensive than its direct competitors.

For some people speedy performance and top-notch graphics in a portable and relatively affordable laptop are enough reason to buy the Swift X. Others however will look at the entire package and find some tears in the wrapping. The Swift X's plastic touchpad and display bezels aren't up to the premium laptop standards of 2021 and the piles of bloatware will make you roll your eyes and learn how to uninstall Windows 10 apps .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MTEyNC9udmlkaWEtcnR4LWE0MDAwLXdvcmtzdGF0aW9uLWdwdS10ZWFyZG93bi13aXRoLWJsb3dlci1zdHlsZS1jb29sZXIvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA RTX A4000 workstation GPU teardown with blower-style cooler,"NVIDIA's workstation-focused RTX A4000 card has been torn apart by ""snake-robot"" on Reddit giving us a gander inside of the NVIDIA RTX A4000 workstation card -- something we don't normally see with high-end workstation GPUs.

Inside the NVIDIA RTX A4000 uses a PG190 board design which is based on the RTX 3060 Ti PCB with a single 8-pin PCIe power connector. On the RTX A4000 however the power connector isn't directly connected to the board and rather uses an extension cable.

As for the GPU NVIDIA is using its GA104-875 GPU with has all of its 6144 CUDA cores making it more like the GPU that NVIDIA uses in its GeForce RTX 3070 Ti. Unlike the RTX 3070 Ti NVIDIA has used GDDR6 non-X memory but with ECC (Error Checking and Correction).

NVIDIA is using Samsung K4ZAF325BM-HC16 modules each with 2GB so we have 16GB of GDDR6 with ECC memory in total clocked at 16Gbps. NVIDIA's RTX A4000 workstation card has a 230W TDP down from the 290W on the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti."

I spent two years there as a Retirement Plan Specialist. I then left Edward Jones to pursue my MBA full-time at Washington University in St. Louis. At Wash U. I landed an internship in Corporate Finance at S.C. Johnson in Racine WI. Through that internship my interest shifted from financial services to corporate finance specifically with an interest in corporate treasury. My internship was successful and resulted in a full-time offer post-graduation which I accepted. I stayed at S.C. Johnson for 6 years 3 of which I spent working in Treasury before moving to Rockwell Automation. At Rockwell I had the opportunity to move through a few roles in my first few years there supporting corporate development investor relations treasury and financial planning & analysis. Prior to my current role as Treasurer I had the opportunity to support one of our $1B+ global business units as finance director. I have served as Vice President & Treasurer since October of 2020.

How did your experiences in the Rankin College of Business prepare you for your professional career?

The breadth of courses in the core business curriculum combined with the great extracurricular activities offered in the business program helped me learn to bring a balanced understanding to business. Despite being a “numbers guy” you need to and are expected to understand implications of marketing human resources business information systems and other functional areas. Having that wholistic view has proven invaluable.

Were there any specific courses or areas of study that were especially useful to you?

Financial Institutions & Markets Organizational Theory & Behavior and Advanced Financial Management have all proven very useful.

Do you have any favorite memories from your time at the Rankin College of Business?

Traveling with Phi Beta Lambda and Enactus (formerly SIFE) for National competitions are among some of my best memories.

What advice would you offer to a new student beginning their course of study at the Rankin College of Business?

Get involved with business organizations take a broad breadth of coursework (not just within your major) network with your fellow students seek out internship opportunities build relationships with faculty and have fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier this week it was reported WWE was looking to ""amp up the rivalry"" between WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns and John Cena.

The thought was despite the two big names involved things were feeling a bit lackluster going into their match on August 21 at SummerSlam. During last night's face-to-face on SmackDown both Reigns and Cena steps up their verbal game.

For Cena he believed Reigns has been protected in WWE and in doing that it nearly ended Seth Rollins and ran Dean Ambrose (aka Jon Moxley) out of the company.

""You haven't been embarrassed"" Cena said to Reigns. ""You've been protected. This pretty face. Those giant bars of soap ya got for teeth. You've been protected Roman you've been protected by The Shield. Hell you almost ruined Seth Rollins. You ran Dean Ambrose out of WWE.""

Although he didn't mention Cena by name Rollins made comments seemingly in reference to what was said on Friday's SmackDown.

""Use my name all you want to validate your narrative. Truth is it only validates my influence. I'm never in danger and I'm always thriving. #ROLLINSFOREVER""

Still a Christian-Disciples church sat across the street from it with a social hall classroom building and parsonage. The Tabernacle’s stonework foundations filled-up with rain water forming a pond where boys caught frogs and swam.

City Hall feared the flooded ruins posed a danger so in August 1940 the Parks and Recreation Department leased the site from the state Christian Association and brought in a WPA crew (Works Progress Administration). They removed the octagonal stone foundations and filled in the hole then installed lawn restrooms and playground equipment.

For a neighborhood built of small cottages on tiny former campsites the park became everyone’s front yard. This center of activity included a row of shops across the street starting in 1919 with a dress shop that became a bakery in 1925 adding a grocery in 1929 known as Graff’s Market in 1935. A barber shop was built in 1941 and a building added in 1948 for the market and post office. Nearby at 714 Woodrow Rev. Myrtle Anthony founded the “Church of God” in 1941 when female clergy were rare.

Then on Dec. 7 1941 Pearl Harbor was attacked and Imperial Japan Nazi Germany and fascist Italy all declared war on the U.S. While the last stand for Democracy America had its own prejudices to face. Japanese German and Italian immigrants lacking U.S. citizenship were classified as “Enemy Aliens.” Italian resident aliens were mostly fishermen and fearing they might aid invading forces they were forced to resettle north of Mission Street. With the Japanese it didn’t matter if they were American-born or not they were all shipped to detention camps in the interior. German migrants were more selectively arrested or relocated based on evidence of Nazi sympathies.

Four months after Pearl Harbor the all-Black 54th Coast Artillery unit encamped on Lighthouse Point on Easter Sunday 1942 to guard the coast. Some locals refused service to Black soldiers and wanted parts of downtown off-limits to Black military personnel. The white commander of the 54th threatened to make the entire town off-limits if they persisted in harassing the very soldiers protecting Santa Cruz. Objections were withdrawn. Some families of Black soldiers found homes in Garfield Park and Fair Avenue in summer homes or cottages vacated by displaced Italians.

Woodrow Avenue was wide-enough to use as a landing strip for military planes. Some soldiers attended the Christian Church. The 54th Artillery unit left at war’s end but some Black soldiers liked Santa Cruz and returned to buy homes in Garfield Park. In 1948 the Black community organized the Missionary Baptist Church on South Branciforte Avenue then in 1949 obtained the former Church of God at 714 Woodrow Ave. Some realtors designated the Circles a Black neighborhood preferring to show Black clients these lots.

In 1953 the Parks Department recommended the City purchase the popular Garfield Park playground for a permanent park. The Christian Churches of Northern California regional board (CCNC) said it couldn’t give an answer until their January 1955 meeting so the City Council sent a representative to that meeting. It was there they learned the Christian-Disciples church on Errett Circle was looking to build a larger sanctuary on the park site. The board said that only the building would be owned by the congregation and the property would revert to the CCNC if construction wasn’t completed by 1960 or the site was no longer used for religious purposes.

New church

The local building committee was led by Bill Nunes who visited new churches studied architecture and listed what they needed. The architect was Frank Barhite a member of the congregation who ran “Bay City Construction” at 2734 Chanticleer Ave. with his partner Robert Schroeber. Their company chiefly designed and built shopping centers as the freeway-era “town square.” Barhite took a City Park and designed the church building to retain park uses with sufficient space for church facilities. It chose a courtyard layout like City Hall but in the Ranch House style invented 1926 by William Wurster in Scotts Valley.

The large auditoriums are masked by low eves and its single-story profile blends with the surrounding low-rise neighborhood. A Frank Lloyd Wright-style metal spire was fabricated by Ernest G. Swinn and painted gold as a beam of heavenly light bringing Love Truth and Charity. The spacious Festival Lawn and auditoriums permitted large events accommodating 150 cars in three small lots and curbside. Olive trees ringed the lawn-edged perimeter for a Mount of Olives setting. No sidewalks were built inviting people to enter-and-leave the property at any point.

On Nov. 10 1957 the church held its 50th Anniversary Party with a sanctuary program of music and memories featuring a church history lecture by the oldest surviving member Eulah Pracht (who joined in 1912). Then to the Social Hall where history displays including a scrapbook made by their first pastor J.H. McCollough plus a new scrapbook of “Golden Memories.” There was a chicken dinner followed by a cake then C.E. Camerzell showed Frank Thompson’s church movies of Christmas 1934 Easter 1937 and the dedication of the parsonage.

Groundbreaking on the new church took place on Oct. 5 1958. A time capsule containing historic documents was installed and a dedication plaque quoted part of Ephesians 2:20: “Built on the foundations of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.” The church held their inaugural services on June 14 1959. The congregation admired the large sanctuary social hall gymnasium kitchen school rooms library fireplace room and offices. There started a long tradition of community group meetings and gym activities. Rose bushes were planted around the grounds in memory of loved ones. The park had become a garden.

Rev. Gordon Mildrum soon obtained land on Bay Street for “Garfield Park Village” affordable senior housing which opened in 1964. To obtain federal funding for it he established a non-profit “Christian Church Homes” which grew into a nationwide company that today is a model of its kind managing 58 affordable senior facilities.

The Circles neighborhood of the 1960s and ’70s increased in diversity with UC Santa Cruz students retirees civil servants veterans hippies radicals and young families. Starting in 1966 Rev. Gary Wells grew his congregation by going door to door to meet all the neighbors. When the church bell rang people came walking from all over the neighborhood. A barefoot hippie once came and sat on the sanctuary floor was encouraged to come again and shortly became the church organist.

Revival

Membership declined in the 1980s and after the 1989 Earthquake. When Rev. Steven DeFields-Gambrel became full-time pastor in 2003 the church sought new ways to remain relevant emphasizing its community center tradition “…to draw us all together in the spirit of harmony tolerance and trust.” The spacious facilities were freely shared with nearby churches when they needed a larger space for gatherings weddings or events. The Missionary Baptist Church was one block south while the old Disciples’ social hall had became the Word of Life Church and First United Pentacostal Church and North Shore Community Church shared the new sanctuary.

The campus offered four self-help programs AARP Driver Safety Training classes Coryell Autism Center Gray Bears Brown Bag pick-up Westside Choir West Creative Performing Arts–Studio Wilde among other programs. The gymnasium was in constant use for basketball volleyball badminton and fencing plus yoga classes as well as a long-time voting precinct. The Festival Lawn hosted the yearly Hindu “Navratri Festival” the first-responders “National Night Out” party neighborhood flea markets picnics ice-cream socials and fourth Sunday lawn games.

Special outreach was made to alienated populations: LGBT homeless refugees atheist/agnostic backing progressive causes of Gay Pride Black Lives Matter Standing Rock Indians Women’s Rights and Environmentalism while at times enduring a backlash for supporting Civil Rights. Seeking to reimagine what church is they changed their name to the “Circle Church.” Sacred and popular music was played and the sanctuary doubled as an art gallery.

A visioning session in 2006 brought a new direction in time for the congregation’s 100th Anniversary in 2007. As banquets and potlucks were always a big draw they spend $12000 to replace the pews with tables each with a centerpiece of communion ware. The tables created intimate groupings for conversation and a “cafe style worship service.” Their vision statement was: “We are the Feast of Jesus Christ bringing to Santa Cruz the nourishment of Christ’s compassion healing and peace.” Just as America’s founding fathers gathered in pubs to plan our democracy the church started the Sunday night “Faith on Tap” program to share beer wine cider and food and plan ways to achieve a greater purpose.

When Christopher VanHall came to Garfield Park he loved the idea of a tap-room church and wanted to create a craft beer label called “Greater Purpose” with proceeds donated to progressive causes. He envisioned a brewery with a pub and restaurant if they could raise the money. The Greater Purpose backers decided in 2017 that the Church is the People not the Building so they’d sell the Circles Church to fund their dream project. The church cafe idea is laudable and highly innovative. But nothing went smoothly in what VanHall called “three years on a sea of bad luck” not just for the flock but those left behind to mourn losing the center of our community life.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed. Abbe Lowell his lead defense lawyer said in a statement that the team will appeal the panel’s decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpbGJlcnRzb25mdW5lcmFsaG9tZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wZXRlci1sYXR1cm51c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter S. Laturnus Obituary 2024,"Peter S. (Pete) Laturnus

December 30 1934 – May 09 2024

Peter S. Laturnus 89 of Munich ND passed away on May 09 2024 at CHI St Alexius Health Devils Lake Hospital.

Mass of Christian Burial for Pete will be held on Tuesday May 14 2024 at 10:30 a.m. at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich ND with Father Brian Moen celebrating the Mass. Burial will be at the St Boniface Catholic Cemetery. Visitation will be at the church one hour prior to the funeral Mass.

Visitation will be at the Gilbertson Funeral Home Devils Lake on Monday May 13th from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. with a Rosary and Prayer Service at 6:00 p.m.

Peter Sebastian was born on December 30 1934 in Wilkin Saskatchewan Canada one of 13 children of Sylvester and Gunda (Steffan) Laturnus. He was the third youngest of the family. In 1945 the family moved to a farm near Starkweather North Dakota and later to Cando North Dakota where Pete attended Metcalf County school through the 8th grade. Several years later the family moved to a farm near Clyde North Dakota. Pete obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1960.

Pete worked with his brother-in-law Elmer Mueller for many years doing plumbing and heating work. When Elmer retired Pete started his own plumbing and heating business along with farming for many years at Calio N.D. He so loved the farm and could build and fix almost anything. He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Pete is survived by his beloved wife of 67 years Donna their children and spouses Dean (Kim) Laturnus Munich Daryl (Sandy Hendrickson) Laturnus Munich Dennis (Lori) Laturnus Grand Forks Steve (Donna) Laturnus Grand Forks and Bonnie (Alvin) Wald Bismarck along with 11 grandchildren; Deanna (Jeff) Heidi (Troy) Kayla (Brant); Amanda (Tyler); Justin (Jessica) Rebecca (Justin) Matthew (special friend Emily); Mitchel Conner Emma Dominic and 14 great grandchildren sister-in-law Helen Laturnus and many nieces and nephews.

Pete was preceded in death by his parents nine brothers and three sisters. Brothers Paul Fred George John Joseph Frank Ed Martin and Wendell; sisters Regina Schall Annie Hoffart- Schiele and Betty Schiele; in-laws John and Margaret Mueller.

CRM,Salesforce,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE1LzUtZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2luZy1zdG9ja3MtMjUwMDAwLXRvLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Game-Changing Stocks That Can Turn $250000 Into $1 Million by 2030,"These innovative companies can generate life-altering returns for patient investors.

Since the stock market bottomed out in March 2020 investors have been treated to a record-breaking bounce-back rally. The widely followed S&P 500 has nearly doubled in 16 months and it's spent the better part of 2021 pushing to one new all-time high after another.

While some investors might be skittish about putting money to work with the market regularly knocking on the door of new highs history has shown that if you're a long-term investor who allows their investment thesis to play out anytime is a great time to buy high-quality stocks.

The following five game-changing stocks all offer the potential to turn a sizable amount of cash say $250000 into a life-altering amount of money ($1 million) by 2030.

Salesforce

Don't let anyone tell you that brand-name mega-cap stocks can't deliver big-time returns for investors. Despite a $236 billion market cap cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce.com (CRM -1.36%) has all the tools necessary to make a run at a $1 trillion valuation by the end of the decade.

For those of you wondering CRM software is used consumer-facing businesses to oversee client relationships handle service issues manage online marketing campaigns and run a variety of predictive analyses to name a few core functions. Salesforce is the undisputed king of CRM sales. When IDC examined global CRM revenue in the first half of 2020 it found that Salesforce brought in 19.8% of total sales. That was more than its four-closest competitors combined and it practically ensures that the company's leading position in this double-digit growth trend remains unmatched.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has also been a mastermind on the acquisition front. Previous purchases (MuleSoft and Tableau) have expanded its product and service ecosystem and helped to fuel a 29% compound annual sales growth rate over the past decade. The company's most recent acquisition of cloud-based enterprise communications platform Slack Technologies will serve as a jumping-off point for Salesforce to cross-sell to small-and-medium-sized businesses.

If all continues to go well Salesforce will surpass $50 billion in annual sales by fiscal 2026 after reporting $21.3 billion in revenue in fiscal 2021. That's sustainable growth long-term investors can count on.

The Original Bark Company

On the other end of the spectrum is dog-focused product and service small-cap stock The Original Bark Company (BARK 2.56%) which is perhaps better known as BarkBox.

Even though pet expenditures aren't growing as quickly as CRM software on an annual basis there may not be a more recession-resistant industry than pets. After all sales data from the American Pet Products Association shows it's been at least a quarter of a century since year-over-year pet spending declined. This year alone pet owners are forecast to shell out $109.6 billion.

What makes Bark so intriguing is its subscription-focused operating model. Approximately 90% of its sales are based on a monthly subscription model with the remainder originating from product placement in over 23000 retail locations. Not having to maintain brick-and-mortar locations or sit on mountains of inventory means lower overhead costs and a gross margin that's consistently hovered around 60%.

Furthermore Bark is leaning on innovation and tech-driven personalization to boost sales. Last year it introduced Bark Home and Bark Eats. Bark Home is a portal for basic need accessories like leashes and beds whereas Bark Eats is a subscription service that works with owners to develop a customized dry food diet for their pooch. The potential for add-on sales along with existing growth opportunities could triple Bark's revenue by fiscal 2026.

Lovesac

Another game-changing stock that can turn $250000 into a cool $1 million or more by 2030 is furniture stock Lovesac (LOVE 7.57%). And yes I did just use the words ""game-changing"" and ""furniture stock"" in the same sentence.

Typically retailing furniture is a highly cyclical and relatively boring operating model that's dependent on brick-and-mortar retail locations. However Lovesac is changing up multiple aspects of the furniture industry.

Arguably the biggest difference between Lovesac and traditional furniture manufacturers and retailers is the product. Almost 85% of Lovesac's revenue is derived from its ""sactionals."" These are sectional-based modular couches that can be rearranged a countless number of ways to accommodate any livable space. The company's sactionals have approximately 200 different cover choices which means that buyers shouldn't have any trouble matching Lovesac's modular furniture with the color scheme or theme of their home. And lastly the yarn used in these covers is made entirely from recycled plastic water bottles. That's functionality choice and environmentally friendly products all rolled up into one.

Were this not enough the company has dazzled Wall Street with its ability to shift its sales approach during the pandemic. In fiscal 2021 47% of Lovesac's sales were generated online with another 7% coming from pop-up showrooms. Having less in the way of overhead and emphasizing direct-to-consumer sales pushed the company to recurring profitability well ahead of Wall Street's forecast.

Jushi Holdings

The U.S. cannabis industry should be another source of opportunity for patient growth-seeking investors this decade. By 2030 small-cap marijuana stock Jushi Holdings (JUSHF -2.16%) has a good chance to quadruple (or more) in value.

Jushi's growth story can't be told without noting its focus on limited-license states. More than 80% of the company's revenue this year will likely originate from Pennsylvania Illinois and Virginia. The former two states cap how many retail licenses can be issued in aggregate and to a single business while Virginia assigns licenses according to jurisdiction. The key point being that these three markets are purposely reining in competition which will ensure that Jushi has a fair chance to build up its brand and garner a loyal following.

For such a small pot stock Jushi hasn't been afraid to put the capital it's raised to work. It's expanded its cultivation potential in Virginia added to its large retail presence in Pennsylvania and acquired two dispensaries in California just since the year began. California is the world's leading marijuana market by annual sales.

Between 2020 and 2024 Wall Street is looking for Jushi's sales to climb by 1100% to nearly $1 billion. With the company expected to become profitable on a recurring basis next year it may well be the biggest bargain in the industry.

Sea Limited

A final game-changing stock that could generate a life-altering return for investors is Singapore-based Sea Limited (SE -1.14%). What makes Sea such a special company is that it has a trio of rapidly growing operating segments to support its valuation expansion.

For starters Sea's gaming division has grown rapidly and is currently the only one of the three segments generating positive earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). As of the end of March Sea had close to 649 million active mobile gamers 12.3% of which were paying customers. Most pay-to-play platforms only average a 2% conversion rate so this is a phenomenal monetization rate for its mobile game platform.

Second Sea has a rapidly expanding e-commerce presence in Southeastern Asia and Brazil. Shopee as the company's online commerce platform is known is the most-downloaded shopping app in Southeast Asia. Between a burgeoning middle class and the coronavirus pandemic keeping people in their homes Shopee saw more gross merchandise value traverse its network in the first three months of 2021 than it did in all of 2018.

And third Sea has its relatively new digital financial services operations. Since many of the regions Sea operates in are underbanked the ability to offer mobile wallet payments could be a game-changer for consumers. The company already has more than 26 million paying users. Altogether these three segments could quintuple Sea's annual sales over the next four years.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SLB,Schlumberger,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL3NjaGx1bWJlcmdlci13aXRoZHJhd3Mtb3RjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schlumberger Withdraws From OTC As Houston Hospitals Near Capacity,"By Liz Hampton (Reuters) – Top oilfield services firm Schlumberger NV on Thursday said it had withdrawn staff from next week’s Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) which typically attracts at least 60000 attendees to Houston citing the area’s rise in COVID-19 cases.

The annual exhibition and technical exchange for offshore energy equipment and service companies historically ranks among the 10 largest trade shows by attendance attracting exhibitors and energy professionals from around the world.

Last year’s conference was canceled due to the pandemic and this year’s event was pushed back from its usual spring schedule because of COVID-19. It will include in-person and broadcast programs.

“As the Houston area hospitalization rates increase rapidly Schlumberger has taken the decision to withdraw from the Offshore Technology Conference” spokeswoman Moira Duff said. The company is developing virtual presentations for the event she added.

Houston has been hit by a surge in the Delta variant with some 3422 people testing positive on Wednesday from just 398 new cases a month ago. Harris County which includes Houston last week raised its alert level to its highest and asked unvaccinated residents to stay home.

The city’s hospital complex Texas Medical Center this week said its Phase 1 intensive care units were full and a combination of Phase 1 and 2 two beds which include additional ICU capacity was 85% full as of Wednesday.

An OTC spokeswoman did not have an immediate response to Schlumberger’s withdrawal. The program this year includes extensive safety measures in the conference hall and was designed to allow for in-person or online attendance she said.

Other companies including engineering and construction firm McDermott International have reduced staffing and lowered their expectations for attendance. While the trade show drew 59200 people two years ago the number is likely to be down significantly this year.

“We will have minimal personnel on-site” said Gentry Brann senior vice president at exhibitor McDermott International Ltd. The firm continues to evaluate conditions and is “prepared to take further precautions to ensure the well-being of our people.” (Additional reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Karishma Singh)",,,,,,,,,,,,

The internet is a network of computers that stretches globally and it is. But will there ever be a point in time where the internet runs out of space?

The internet will not run out of space if technology continues to improve. However humans produce mind-boggling amounts of data per day that needs storage. Over the next five years global data is projected to grow to more than 180 zettabytes and the amount keeps increasing.

Although the internet keeps expanding there’s no risk of running out of space if technology keeps up. This article will explain what the internet is and highlight some cutting-edge technologies helping us make giant strides in data storage. Keep reading to find out more.

What Is the Internet?

The internet refers to a connection between computer networks and other electronic devices stretching globally making it possible to communicate share and store information.

The internet uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and their devices. It allows people to exchange ideas learn new concepts and make money while working from anywhere in the world.

Will the Internet Run Out of Space?

Will the Internet Run Out of Space?

The Internet can only run out of space if one of the following happens:

The global electrical power grid stops working.

Data centers stop working.

So much data is created that it can not be stored with current technology.

Internet Service Providers cannot provide service.

The Internet is defined as a network of computers that exist worldwide so as long as our computer network keeps working and expanding the internet will not run out of space.

However as the world becomes more dependent on the Internet and its connections it stresses the system. With the expanded growth and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) The Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data analytics data growth is exploding.

We are currently in the “Zettabyte Era” and as more data is produced every day we could theoretically run out of storage space. But the chances of running out of space are very slim as technology evolves every day to accommodate the number of data humans produce so there’s no risk.

How Big is a Zettabyte of Data

A zettabyte is read as the 2 to the 70th power bytes and one zettabyte has 21 zeros. 1021 (1000000000000000000000) bytes. A Zettabyte is equal to a thousand exabytes a billion terabytes or a trillion gigabytes.

Since much electronic Data is not saved currently all the data in the world is estimated to be only a few zettabytes. However the data is forecasted to continue to grow at an exponential rate. How long until we get to a Yottabyte? That remains to be seen.

“In 2020 64.2ZB of data was created or replicated defying the systemic downward pressure asserted by the COVID-19 pandemic on many industries and its impact will be felt for several years” said Dave Reinsel senior vice president IDC’s Global DataSphere. “The amount of digital data created over the next five years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage. The question is: How much of it should be stored?” Data Creation and Replication Will Grow at a Faster Rate than Installed Storage Capacity According to the IDC Global DataSphere and StorageSphere Forecasts

Mega – 1000000; a Megabyte is a million bytes.

Giga – 1000000000; a Gigabyte is a billion bytes.

Tera – 1000000000000; a Terabyte is a trillion bytes.

Peta – 1000000000000000; a Petabyte is 1000 Terabytes.

Exa – 1000000000000000000; an Exabyte is 1000 Petabytes.

Zetta – 1000000000000000000000; a Zettabyte is 1000 Exabytes.

Yotta – 1000000000000000000000000; a Yottabyte is 1000 Zettabytes.

Can the Internet Be Shut Down?

Can the Internet Be Shut Down?

The internet was originally conceptualized for the U.S. Military by a program called (Arpanet) Advanced Research Projects Agency Network and was a U.S. Defense Department research project.

A researcher named Paul Baran was trying to figure out how to create a communication system that would survive a nuclear attack on the United States. The Internet was designed as a mesh network broken up into blocks or packets.

So the current global internet is pretty resilient and multifaceted and was purposely built that way. There are however governments that have shut down or restricted the internet in their countries. War could also shut down the Internet in places but it is unlikely to be shut down globally.

Countries That Have Shut Down Or Disrupted Their Internets

Are We Running Out of Internet?

Running out is different from reaching limits because network capacity can vary greatly between carriers cities and countries. We have all hit peak demand when your internet slows down or even stops. Even though carriers don’t want to talk about it bottlenecks are common.

With the advent of 5G that spectrum we will see new challenges that have never been explored with data capacity and internet access. Currently we are not running out of internet but we do reach limits at times. As long as new and better ways of storing and transferring information are created the internet will always likely be there increasing its capacity.

A total of 16777214 devices can use one IP address on Class A Addresses so there’s no chance of running out of IP addresses for the Internet. As long as devices still connect to form a network the internet will always exist.

Please see some of our other interesting articles “How Will The Internet of Things Affect You? IoT” and “How to Lower Your Home WiFi Data Usage.”

Where Is Data Stored?

Where Is Data Stored?

Computers that are called data servers store data from the internet. Like any other computer a data server stores and processes information but it lacks regular computer additions like a mouse keyboard or monitor. It’s solely for data storage and processing.

A connection between an internet server and the Web is a vital step before accessing data and enables you to access information on the server.

What Are Data Centers?

A data center refers to a collection of data servers that are in an exact location. Data centers continue to expand and by 2021 experts estimate that there will be 7.2 million global data centers globally and that number will keep growing as more data is added.

So we’re not in any danger of running out of space anytime in the future but we may face challenges as users produce more data.

Still the expansion of data centers and the introduction of cutting-edge technology will allow data storage in even smaller spaces to prevent a global internet shutdown. New technologies may lead to less reliance on data centers and cloud storage.

Technological Advancements Made in Data Storage

The increasing amounts of data produced by users every day mean that we need to find better and more efficient methods to store data that won’t use up too much physical space or need costly data transfers to newer storage devices.

We could reduce the creation of data to release the pressure on storage locations. Still that idea isn’t feasible as almost everything we do from business to socializing depends on the internet and is therefore connected to data storage.

Producing less data or halting data production would have grave consequences on a considerable amount of the world’s population. So the solution is to create better technologies that let us store more significant amounts of data to keep up with data creation speeds.

New Data Storage Technologies

Seagate HAMR Hard Drive Laser Light heating recording material to 450 degrees centigrade.

Some of these new Data Storage technologies are already on the market while experts are still perfecting the rest which will be available for use soon.

Even as scientists work hard to perfect new technologies flash drives and hard drives will be used for the foreseeable future. Hybrids of flash drives and hard drives will become more common to create more storage space improving durability and longevity.

Let’s look at some new advancements that can store data and keep the internet safe from extinction.

Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording

This technology employs lasers to heat minute areas of a computer’s internal disk platter to a searing heat of about 400°C (752°F) before writing which causes a shift in magnetism. That shift lingers long enough to allow data writing in a smaller section than regular internal disk drives. HAMR makes it possible to store more data per square inch of a disk.

Seagate which produces these HAMR hard drives has stated that the disk drives will have upwards of 40 terabytes of storage by 2023.

DNA Data Storage

DNA can store large amounts of information so harnessing it in data storage would make history. One gram of DNA can keep a mind-boggling 215 million gigabytes of data.

But this technology is too costly and is still a few steps away from being ready for release in the market. Synthesizing one megabyte of data will cost about $3500 but it may solve the looming storage problem as time progresses and the chemical synthesis costs experience a reduction.

The genetic material is considerably denser than the most compact hard drive and it’s more durable making it suitable for a more extended period which can stretch to thousands of years with the right storage conditions.

Helium Disk Drives

Helium has less density than air so using it in drives will use less power. Air-filled disk drives require more energy to spin discs and using helium reduces this energy by about 20%.

Helium-filled hard drives also run cooler and produce less heat with less friction preventing damage caused by overheating resulting in data loss.

These disk drives have a larger storage capacity than traditional air-filled disk drives. They are already available on the market and you can get the Seagate IronWolf 8TB Helium disk drive on Amazon for better and improved storage space.

Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR)

SMR – Toshiba’s DT02 series of 3.5-inch HDD

The name Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) comes from how the data is stacked resembling shingles on a roof to maximize and increase storage space.

Trimming the stored data releases more space for storage without altering the already existing data. This kind of data storage has a very notable advantage: it doesn’t need new equipment to operate.

SMR technology is compatible with the traditional hard drive which means the overall cost is affordable making it accessible to the average person.

5D Data Storage

5D technology can make use of fused quartz or glass. Each disk can store upwards of 360 terabytes of data which is an impressive amount compared to our traditional storage disks. They are also relatively smaller than the conventional disks with a width of only three inches.

Experts use glass to construct these disks. They are very durable and can withstand extreme temperatures dust exposure or humidity without losing any data unlike the traditional disk drives which are susceptible to damage over time.

Glass disks are assumed capable of storing data for more than 10 billion years in ideal conditions. Using 5D data storage enables us to read data in five dimensions instead of the usual two or three.

Quantum Data Storage

This form of Quantum Data Storage is still in its infancy. A quantum computer would be faster and store notably large amounts of data. A bit on a computer can occur as either 1 or 0 but in a quantum computer a quantum bit can exist in all its possible states simultaneously.

Simultaneous existence enables the storage of large amounts of data. However this method of storing data is unstable and can disintegrate in just a few seconds. This technology isn’t available for use because it still needs vast improvements to make it suitable for release into the market.

Global Data Storage Energy Use

The hidden cost of the Internet is energy usage. In 2020 energy demand growth from data centers and data transmission networks accounted for around 1% of global electricity use. In reality that is a huge chunk of power.

The projected infiltration and permeation of IoT and AI-run digital infrastructure will greatly affect and increase Data Center energy requirements. The article “Usage impact on data center electricity needs: A system dynamic forecasting model” by Martijn Koot and Fons Wijnhoven suggest substantial possible increasing energy usage.

“We expect a combined growth of data center electricity needs of 286 TWh in 2016 up to 321 TWh in 2030 if today’s technological and behavioral trends remain the same. The end of Moore’s law results in a total of 658 TWh for 2030 and an increase of the global data centers’share electricity consumption from 1.15% in 2016 to 1.86% in 2030. The rise of Industrial IoT applications may consume a total of 364 TWh (about 1.03%) in 2030. Moore’s law and IoT combined cause data center energy needs going up to 752 TWh in 2030 and about 2.13% of global electricity available.” A system dynamic forecasting model” by Martijn Koot and FonsWijnhoven

Final Word

The internet is limitless and though some have been predicting an internet failure for years it’s improbable. It would take years to exhaust the storage space we have at present and even then the internet will keep expanding to accommodate the increasing need for storage space.

Experts are developing cutting-edge technologies to meet the demand for storage space stretching from HAMR to DNA Data Storage. The improved technologies will reduce the energy used in data storage and cut back on costs and physical space so a “storage armageddon” is unlikely.

Park spokesman Chad Showalter said the Eiffel Tower one of Kings Island’s original attractions is closing after this weekend which is also the end of the daily operation of the park. Kings Island will be open to the public on Aug. 22 Aug. 29 and Labor Day weekend Sept. 4 5 6.

Showalter said over the next several months the iconic tower will be repainted.

The Eiffel Tower at the park and at sister park Kings Dominion in Virginia are one-third replicas of the Eiffel Tower in Paris France and are both 315 feet tall. The tower at Kings Island was built in 1972 while the tower at Kings Dominion was built in 1975. Both Eiffel Tower replicas have been in the parks since their public openings according to Kings Island.

Showalter said the last time the Eiffel Tower was repainted was in 2004-2005 prior to the opening of the 2005 season. He said he did not know the specific color that it will be painted this fall. However Showalter said “when it opened in 1972 Sherwin Williams created a new color just for the project ‘Eiffel Tower Green.’”

Showalter said season passes for the 2022 season went on sale today and also include admission for the rest of 2021. More information is available at www.visitkingsisland.com.

In 2022 Kings Island will celebrate 50 years of fun memories and traditions Showalter said. Guests will join the park in commemorating the landmark anniversary with limited-time events enhanced food offerings and all-new live entertainment – each telling the stories of Kings Island’s first 50 years. The park will announce more anniversary details in the coming months.

Text description provided by the architects. Belle.Club a subscription beauty salon that breaks away from what we know of a traditional beauty salon. One that seeks to be disruptive in all areas to be practical versatile innovative. One that meets the demands and needs of modern women who seek agility and practicality in beauty services.

The brand's identity is the seed for the project which seeks to bring the soul of Belle. Club to the physical world. It goes far beyond aesthetics creating a space that allows for a better user experience and the creation of a sense of belonging to the customer.

The development of the architectural and interior identity of the salon started long before the project became a reality. It is the result of a complete study for the brand which resulted in a franchise visual guide that details and specifies every element present in the space. A spatial concept with unity uniquely representing the Belle.Club brand.

In this project the workstation is the protagonist. It was developed so that beauty professionals could tend to the same client simultaneously occupying the least possible physical space while still executing their jobs with no spatial hurdles. It organizes and divides spaces and respective functions while being comfortable for the client and for the worker. It was the result of careful design and many prototypes iterated on with both the client and beauty professionals.

The workstation has rotating tables for customers looking for a manicure a table upfront with foot support if the customer is going for a manicure and pedicure as well as a lower chair for the worker positioning them perfectly to execute their jobs comfortably. There are portable baskets under the tables which can be taken between workstations allowing the professional to keep her materials with ease. Finally the client's high chair allows for good hair care with the hairdresser working standing up behind them.

Altogether the workstation allows up to four nail and two hair professionals to work comfortably and simultaneously while the customer has everything they need at their fingertips whether it's the nail polish niche that rotates or the bag support under the chair.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2NyYWlucy1jbGV2ZWxhbmQtYnVzaW5lc3MtMjAyMS1ub3RhYmxlLWdlbmVyYWwtY291bnNlbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crain's Cleveland Business 2021 Notable General Counsels,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL21hcnktZ2FyY2VhdS1ub3RhYmxlLWdlbmVyYWwtY291bnNlbHMtMjAyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary Garceau Notable General Counsels 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainscleveland.com/awards/mary-garceau-notable-general-counsels-2021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL21hcnktZ2FyY2VhdS1ub3RhYmxlLWdlbmVyYWwtY291bnNlbHMtMjAyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Eight serious bids were made for the property which opened in 1989 and was once a thriving multi-purpose arts centre – it even had a fully equipped rehearsal space for unsigned bands in the basement paid for by U2. But for the last two decades the building has been derelict covered in graffiti and damaged by a fire that broke out inside the building in 2011.

It was all a long way from its origins when a community arts group called Grapevine bought the three-storey former shipping terminus on Moss Street for £250000 in 1988.

There had been great hopes for it when the centre was opened by the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Lord Henry Mountcharles Peter Sheridan and Paul McGuinness all sat on its board at one stage or another and for its first decade at least the venue was a success.

But by 2000 it was facing difficulties. Artists were complaining that the building was run-down. Internally questions were being asked about its finances. Some staff were threatening to strike and there was more competition from rival artistic spaces.

Meanwhile the value of property around the City Arts Centre was now rocketing especially after Ulster Bank opened its striking pyramid-like headquarters nearby.

Declan McGonagle a former director of the Irish Museum of Modern Art was appointed by its board in October 2001 to conduct a review to try and determine what should happen next.

“It’s like a completely fresh start and that is very energising and very exciting from my point of view” McGonagle said on his appointment.

The centre’s building went into somewhat hibernation while this review took place. Twenty-one of its staff were laid off. Then in June 2003 the board of City Arts Centre decided to sell its building and move elsewhere.

The building was sold for €4.2 million in 2003 to a Celtic Tiger era consortium that included Paddy Kelly the McCormack family Philip Monaghan and Pat Ryan. But then the crash came and the building was never developed. It became instead a lingering eyesore overlooking the Liffey.

Colony Capital became involved when it acquired debts associated with Kelly as part of a larger portfolio from Nama. Colony thought about redeveloping it but due to its own internal issues it later decided to sell its Irish interests which included the City Arts Centre.

In August 2020 Monaghan and Ryan sought a High Court injunction preventing Colony from taking control of the building by appointing PWC as a receiver. This delayed the sale and it was only after this matter was resolved that Colony’s receiver was free to place it on the market in April of this year.

It was at that stage that the next dramatic act in its history unfurled.

*****

When Savills put the City Arts Centre on the market it guided a price of €35 million. Most of the major developers in Dublin submitted a bid including Ronan Group Real Estate Marlet Property Group and Simon Kelly’s RQTwo.

Also eyeing a bid was KC Capital a company founded by 30-year-old developer David Kennan.

KC Capital is working on just one significant development albeit a good one called the Greenside Building on Cuffe Street in Dublin 2.

It hadn’t been the easiest project as a high-end boxing club run by Karl Bennett a former Irish national kickboxing champion part occupied the building using its top two floors

KC Capital had bought the building in 2019 but Bennett had signed a 20-year lease with the former owners of the building in 2014. Both sides had tried to do a deal but had been unable to agree on terms for various reasons.

The Greenside Building Cuffe Street Dublin 2

KC Capital eventually issued a forfeiture notice citing fire safety service charges and planning issues. While the boxing gym was in good condition other parts of the building required renovation. A narrow staircase and small elevator were the only way to get around the building leading to fire safety officers expressing serious concerns.

To address these concerns would cost millions which neither side was prepared to fund.

Bennett went to the High Court in November 2019 seeking an injunction preventing his gym from being asked to exit. It is not clear how the matter resolved itself exactly but the end result was clear KC Capital took over the building and began to redevelop it as a grade A office space significantly increasing its value.

It is in a prime location too just a short walk from St Stephen’s Green and not far from the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland. Renamed the Greenside Building the project is due to be completed in the first quarter of 2022. It has been described as “pandemic proofed” due to its high-end air filtration system and antibacterial protection and it has a striking design.

With Greenside on-site and progressing when the City Arts Centre came up Kennan was interested. He was reported early on to have teamed up with Derek McGrath’s Core Capital to submit a bid.

McGrath has been for years a low-profile force in Dublin and he is a very experienced property investor. He has been involved in dozens of deals with various partners including the McKillen family the Brennan family and others.

He has also worked with institutional investors like Europa Capital and Core is part of the consortium working with this fund on developing a new Clerys Quarter on O’Connell Street. All told Core is working on projects worth €1 billion with many different partners.

Its managing director McGrath was friendly with the younger Kennan and the two would discuss business together. But they’d never teamed up before.

KC Capital and Core submitted a joint bid of €40.54 million. There was a cluster of bids around the €40 million mark but when the bids were unsealed they were highest.

A company had been formed specially to make the bid and the challenge now was to raise the debt and equity required to close the deal within a four-week exclusivity period. This tight time frame is an important factor in what happened next.

Bids and disagreements

KC Capital approached a number of parties to try and fund the deal and it discussed what to do with Core.

Angelo Gordon a multi-billion London fund founded by two ex-Rothschild executives took a serious look at getting involved but in the end it didn’t.

Kennan also approached Barry English a successful businessman who made his fortune as the founder of engineering firm Winthrop.

English was friendly with McGrath too and he had originally met Kennan with him sometime earlier at a social event. All three men were now talking about what to do against an ever-shortening deadline.

About €14 million in equity was required to do the deal from overseas institutional lenders interested in funding the debt side of the deal.

English said he would put up €7 million in equity but said the other half needed to come from either Core or KC Capital or both. Understandably he didn’t want to be the sole investor. McGrath did not find the terms on offer acceptable but Kennan was prepared to go for it.

It is from here that disagreements began to arise. Kennan knew he had created significant value in Cuffe Street and he had another interest that also had equity in it.

A computer-generated image of the office scheme proposed in a feasibility study for the City Arts Centre site in Dublin’s south docklands.

His loan-to-value ratios were good so he asked his bankers an alternative lender if he could leverage up by borrowing money from someone else against the equity he had created.

His lender agreed and expressed interest in providing development finance to the City Arts Centre building a significant attraction.

Kennan then asked English if he would lend him the €7 million in equity required to close the sale in return for giving him a second charge on his property assets including Greenside.

English agreed and now the money was there to close the sale just days before the preferred bidder status of the company set up to buy the centre would have lapsed sending it back to the market.

However McGrath wasn’t happy. He believed his reputation and experience had been important in securing preferred bidder status.

He maintained this should be recognised and that he should get a stake in the deal or an option to buy into the deal at a later stage for a nominal sum to reflect this.

Things began to heat up. There were various messages flying back and forth between Core and KC Capital but an agreement wasn’t reached.

In the third week of July a company called Tracare which is part of the Marlet Group wrote to PWC submitting a new bid for the City Arts Centre. It said that the winner in the previous process should not be allowed to close as it alleged it was now a different group as English was involved and Core was not.

Tracare said it had now teamed up with Core to make a revised bid and it said that PWC should accept this offer instead. It followed up this approach with a letter from Arthur Cox setting out its legal position. This offer was considered by PWC but ultimately it decided to allow the sale to continue.

Ultimately the rights and wrongs of what occurred may be heading to court or perhaps a deal will be reached to satisfy all parties.

On July 30 2021 Arthur Cox wrote to KC Capital and English on Core’s behalf.

This letter set out what happened as McGrath saw it and included what it claimed were supporting Whatsapp messages and correspondence.

Core said it believed it had an entitlement to a 20 per cent option in the joint venture vehicle acquiring the property. It alleged that it only agreed to what had occurred in return for this option.

Maples Group on behalf of KC Capital wrote back denying any such option or deal existed.

It went through the correspondence sent by Arthur Cox and explained why its client disagreed with Core.

Maples said its client’s position was that Core had not procured the required funding to close the deal but that KC Capital and English had – and therefore the deal had proceeded without it.

Legal letters were now flying back and forth. Last week KC Capital and English pushed on with closing the purchase of the City Arts Centre from PWC securing the building.

It is already working on plans to redevelop the building which under the Local Area Plan can become a building of between six and nine storeys high.

A feasibility study by RKD Architects has concluded the site could host a 145000 square feet office block subject to planning. But it has the potential too for other uses in an area that is undergoing further regeneration.

Core however is not backing down. On Friday August 13 Arthur Cox wrote again stating that its client was entitled to a 20 per cent shareholding in the joint venture vehicle which was to acquire the property.

Ultimately the rights and wrongs of what occurred may be heading to court or perhaps a deal will be reached to satisfy all parties. What is for certain is that after 18 years derelict the future of the City Arts Centre finds itself again centre stage.",,,,,,,,,

She captions the video by writing: “Let’s talk SUBTLE photoshopping - and why it’s so gosh darn dangerous' she wrote in the caption.

“First subtle photoshop is EVERYWHERE. Influencers use it to shave off INCHES or SHRINK WAISTS enhance skin or darken lashes.

'Subtle photoshop is EVERYWHERE'

“It softens veins removes cellulite elongates legs and does a dozen other things.

“And unlike those photoshop ""fails"" that pop up in the news from time to time most subtle photoshop jobs are nearly IMPOSSIBLE TO SPOT.

“Like this pic here. I’m posing (clearly!) but then I also using apps to change my body.

“I shrink my waist and smooth my forehead vein then get rid of the dimples on my thighs.

“Apps like these exist for photos AND FOR VIDEOS.

“My point here isn’t to shame the women who do this to their bodies - because I’ve been in that space shrinking myself through apps and it’s not a balanced one.

Meanwhile the couple also shared a candid snap as they posed with their three children after the ceremony.

Prince Julian was dressed in the christening gown worn by his father to his own baptism in 1979 with the family heirloom dating back to Prince Gustaf Adolf's christening in 1906.

It's been worn by royal babies ever since and features elegant lace detailing and ruffled sleeves.

Doting mother Princess Sofia who held her baby during the ceremony looked the epitome of glamour in a floral V-neck long puff-sleeve maxi dress by Italian fashion house Etro.

They looked adorable in matching navy shorts white shirts and cream blazers while sitting at the front of the chapel.

Among the guests were Carl Philip's parents King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia and his siblings and their spouses; Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel Princess Madeleine and Christopher O'Neill.

The newborn's older cousins were also at the event including Crown Princess Victoria's children Princess Estelle nine and Prince Oscar five.

They were joined by Princess Madeleine's children Princess Leonore seven Prince Nicolas six and Princess Adrienne three.

Prince Julian's grandfather King Carl Gustaf revealed his name and dukedom at a cabinet meeting at the Royal Palace in Stockholm days after his birth both of which are touching tributes to royal family members.

Prince Julian is the Duke of Halland the former duchy of King Carl's beloved uncle Prince Bertil whose former home Carl and Sofia currently live in with their children.

Meanwhile Folke is one of the King’s middle names and was the name of the grandson of King Oscar II who negotiated the release of around 31000 prisoners from German concentration camps during the Second World War.

Unlike his older brothers Prince Julian will not receive Royal Highness status after King Gustaf revoked the HRH style from the children of Sofia and Carl in October 2019.

While the children lost their positions in the Royal House and won't be expected to carry out senior royal duties they will remain in the line of succession.

Prince Julian is the eighth grandchild of King Carl XVI Gustaf. Carl Philip is the only son and second child of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia.

His older sister Princess Victoria 43 is the heir to the Swedish throne and he is currently fifth in the line of succession.

Last month the members of Sweden's Royal Family were all finally reunited 'after a long time in different places' due to the coronavirus pandemic.

King Carl XVI Gustaf 75 and Queen Silvia 77 were joined by their three children and their spouses as well as their eight grandchildren and pet dogs at Solliden Palace on Öland island off the southeast coast of Sweden.

A sweet picture of the reunion taken that month was shared to the Swedish Royal Family's Instagram account alongside the caption: 'Together on Öland again! A long-awaited reunion for the King.

'The family which after a long time in different places can now once again gather on the ""island of the sun and the winds"". A continued happy summer is wished to all.'

Donna Eubanks was not looking to make history — she just wanted to take care of her children as single parent.

But Eubanks 28 is the first female lineman to work for Entergy Corporation and she’s based in Brookhaven.

Originally from Perry County she relocated to Monticello temporarily and hopes to move soon into Bogue Chitto.

Eubanks said she was initially interested in working within the electrical installation and repair business after seeing her brothers and dad working in the field.

“And being a single parent jobs that are normally for typical women don’t put a lot of food on the table” Eubanks said.

She began working for the energy company June 7 but she’s had much more than just three months of experience.

Eubanks worked 3-1/2 years with independent electrical contractors such as Southern Electric Corporation.

Entergy Brookhaven supervisor and 32-year power company veteran Mark White said he has seen women working in line installation repair and maintenance for independent contractors and knew Eubanks was a good worker because he had been around her and seen her working with SEC in emergency situations.

“Entergy is a very diverse company and everybody has an equal opportunity to come on board” White said. “Being a lineman isn’t everybody’s line of work. Hours are long in the hot or cold but it’s a good living.”

The work she does building power lines setting frame poles and maintenance is not the difficult part of the job she said. The job presents challenges for school-related things for her children and they are not able to participate in sports but they are rewards for the family too.

“Entergy came to me and offered me a job with them” she said. “On the contractor side I was on the road a lot. I chose Entergy so I could be at home more and it’s a good company.”

She said her biggest encouragers all along her journey have been her family and she is grateful to White for giving her the opportunity with Entergy.

“And my former foreman Josh Nations talked me into this step to get on with Entergy” she said. “He saw the benefit it would be for me.”

Eubanks will be a lineman trainee apprentice for 32 months after which she’ll “graduate” to journeyman. She did not attend a lineman school but started with a contractor as a greenhand learning on the job.

“You pay attention and learn the best you can” she said.

Entergy has since hired another female lineman in North Mississippi White said and Eubanks said she knows of another one in Hammond Louisiana.

White said he expects more women to move into this type of work.

“It shows our industry is changing” he said.

Eubanks said any woman who wants to step into lineman work should take the chance and learn the way that works best for them.

“It’s hard sometimes so don’t give up. Don’t cry in front of the men” she said. “You have women out there that are single parents and they’re struggling and if you can find just a little bit of a support system then you can do this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRoY29tLm1pbC9OZXdzL1ByZXNzUmVsZWFzZXMvQXJ0aWNsZS8yNzMyMDYwL3VzLXNvdXRoZXJuLWNvbW1hbmQtc3VwcG9ydHMtdXMtZGlzYXN0ZXItYXNzaXN0YW5jZS10by1oYWl0aS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Southern Command Supports U.S. Disaster Assistance to Haiti,"MIAMI – U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) established Joint Task Force-Haiti Aug. 15 to conduct U.S. military operations in support of U.S. foreign disaster assistance to the people of Haiti.

The task force is led by U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Keith Davids commander of U.S. Special Operations Command South (SOCSOUTH).

In preparation for that mission a 14-person SOUTHCOM Situational Awareness Team (SSAT) from SOCSOUTH arrived in Port-au-Prince Haiti Aug. 15 where they will work with U.S. government diplomatic and disaster-assistance personnel assessing the situation in areas impacted by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake Aug. 14.

The team will join officials from the U.S. embassy and a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployed to Haiti Aug. 14 at the direction of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA).

A U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft transported the SSAT team from Homestead Air Reserve Base Fla.

The team’s assessments will be used by SOUTHCOM mission planners to identify U.S. military capabilities needed and available to support U.S. foreign disaster assistance led by USAID/BHA and requested by the government of Haiti.

Additionally the U.S. Navy is utilizing its ScanEagle unmanned air system and P-8 Poseidon aircraft to provide aerial images of earthquake devastated areas. The images will be used by experienced disaster relief planners to determine what relief capabilities and supplies are needed immediately and where.

Two UH-60 and two CH-47 helicopters from Joint Task Force-Bravo are also en route to Haiti where they will provide critical airlift support to ongoing relief efforts.

The U.S. military relief mission will join ongoing U.S. Coast Guard support operations in the Caribbean country.

SOUTHCOM remains in very close contact with its chain of command the U.S. State Department and USAID the lead federal agency for U.S. foreign disaster assistance and ready to provide additional support if asked.

Historically U.S. military capabilities are needed most in the critical early stages of a disaster relief operation when fewer resources capabilities and disaster-response experts are available to help victims and impacted communities. As those disaster-relief missions progress and more experienced experts arrive to aid longer-term recovery and reconstruction U.S. military capabilities are no longer requested and roles previously performed by military units and troops are assumed by other more experienced relief organizations.

SOUTHCOM has supported USAID/BHA-led disaster relief missions in Haiti in the aftermath of previous disasters most recently in 2016 after the nation was struck by Hurricane Matthew.

SOUTHCOM has also assisted Haiti in preparing for natural disasters with the construction of emergency operations centers disaster relief warehouses fire stations and community centers that double as shelters. The command has also previously donated search and rescue boats as well as transport vehicles to Haitian emergency response and civil protection agencies.

A symphony in splendid technicolor the reefs are among the world’s most resilient coral colonies against warming seas. They have also become an unlikely battleground caught between Israeli diplomatic and business interests and ecological groups that fear this natural treasure could be in danger.

A clandestine oil deal struck last year as part of the historic agreement establishing formal diplomatic ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates is turning Eilat into a waypoint for Emirati oil headed for Western markets.

Initially hailed as a move that could cement fledgling diplomatic ties and further Israel’s energy ambitions the deal is now in question after Israel’s new government opened a review. The decision has upset investors and risks a diplomatic spat with Israel’s Gulf allies.

The UAE and Israel which normalized relations last year as part of the U.S.-brokered “Abraham Accords” have since signed over $830 million in trade deals and inked numerous trade and cooperation agreements.

But the deal between the Europe-Asia Pipeline Company an Israeli government-owned corporation and MED-RED Land Bridge a joint Israel-Emirati venture remains a secret.

Senior officials in former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government — including his former energy foreign and environment ministers — said they didn’t know about the deal until it was announced last September after the accords were signed at the White House.

The pipeline company known as EAPC was founded in the 1960s to bring Iranian oil to Israel when the countries had friendly relations. Its operations are shrouded in secrecy ostensibly for security reasons.

Israeli environmental groups have asked the country’s Supreme Court to halt oil shipments citing EAPC’s questionable safety record and the risk posed by parking supertankers alongside Eilat’s fragile coral ecosystems.

As for an oil spill it’s “not a question of if it will happen but when it will happen” said Assaf Zvuloni a Nature and Parks Authority ecologist in Eilat. Even a small rupture or human error would have disastrous consequences he said.

Israel suffered its worst ecological disaster in February when a spill in the eastern Mediterranean coated virtually all of its 270-kilometer (170-mile) coastline with oil. The petitioners — three Israeli environmental groups — argued that incident would “be dwarfed alongside a massive oil spill” off Eilat.

Israel long lacked natural resources. But that began to change after the 2009 discovery of natural gas in the Mediterranean Sea and Israel’s first exports.

The deal with the UAE would expand this fledgling energy sector with oil shipped across Israel in a pipeline to the Mediterranean port of Ashkelon and on to European markets.

Yona Fogel executive of one of the Israeli partners in the project told public broadcaster Kan in June that the UAE deal “will produce for EAPC earnings of hundreds (of millions) and perhaps billions of dollars” without “raising the risk to the environment whatsoever.”

Ksenia Svetlova an ex-lawmaker and director of Mideast relations with the Mitvim Institute an Israeli think tank said the project is especially appealing because it provides an alternative to the Suez Canal. The canal the main waterway for Gulf exports to the West was paralyzed early this year when a massive tanker ran aground there.

The Emiratis are gaining “a cheaper alternative route something that they can use in case they need to divert some of the tankers to this direction” she said.

But opponents say the potential cost is irreversible damage to a natural wonder.

The EAPC terminal dominates a stretch of Eilat shoreline a kilometer (half mile) north of Israel’s Coral Beach Nature Reserve. Its cranes and pipes jut into the Red Sea’s aquamarine and navy blue waters. The air reeks of petroleum.

For now multitudes of corals still bloom on neighboring reefs attracting fish in kaleidoscopic abundance.

A senior government official said Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s office asked the Supreme Court for additional time to respond to the environmentalists’ challenge. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.

Israel’s new environment minister has pledged to scrap the pipeline altogether and her ministry has frozen the company’s planned expansion of operations pending a government decision.

“The Gulf of Eilat is in real danger because of the Med-Red pipeline and the state of Israel doesn’t need to be the oil bridge for other countries” Tamar Zandberg said upon taking office in June. Her office declined interview requests.

No less important is a future spill’s impact on tourism Eilat’s lifeblood. Meir Yitzhak Halevi a freshman lawmaker who was Eilat’s mayor from 2003 until June said he was left in the dark about EAPC’s operations and called for complete transparency.

An ecological disaster would also likely impact the ecosystems of Jordan Egypt and Saudi Arabia all of which share the gulf’s waters.

“We have a real potential loss to humanity and to global biodiversity” said Gidon Bromberg head of the cross-border EcoPeace environmental group.

EAPC dismissed environmental concerns as unfounded claimed “the inherent danger in the arrival of tankers is zero” and contended that hundreds of tankers docked at the adjacent Jordanian port of Aqaba in the past decade.

The company refused interviews as did Emirati officials. But Hebrew daily Israel Hayom recently quoted unnamed Emirati officials as saying canceling the deal “is definitely a violation” of diplomatic agreements and could damage relations.

Meanwhile EAPC has confirmed it has initiated operations. At least eight oil tankers moored in Eilat in 2021 up from an average of one every five years according to the court petition which contends the agreement could bring over 100 oil vessels each year.

EAPC has had a poor safety record. A 2014 pipeline rupture spilled millions of gallons of crude oil in a desert nature reserve. In the 1970s a series of spills nearly eradicated Eilat’s coral reefs.

Yossi Loya a marine biology professor at Tel Aviv University said the reefs managed to recover over the past decade — a rare exception to the deterioration of reefs worldwide.

DTE said about 145000 customers remained without power Saturday afternoon while Consumers Energy had about 77000 still without service. Both companies expect to have power restored to nearly all of their customers by Sunday night.

The silver lining is a glorious weekend ahead with sunshine and blue skies expected at least through Monday.

""The weather is perfect through Monday — highs around 80 dry sunshine light winds today Sunday and Monday"" Steven Freitag a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in White Lake Township said Saturday morning.

""Nighttime temperatures will be in the 50s or 60s so if you're without power that's obviously good sleeping weather.""

DTE said it had 2800 workers in the field Saturday working 16-hour shifts to safely restore customers as quickly as possible.

""We have restored about 75% of customers affected by the storm earlier this week and are targeting to have more than 80% of customers restored by the end of today"" DTE said in a news release.

Over 550 Consumers Energy crews made progress restoring power overnight reducing the number without service to 77000 from an initial total of 370000 who lost service.

""We are expecting we will have the vast majority restored by tomorrow (Sunday)"" Consumers Energy spokeswoman Debra Dodd said Saturday.

The company on Saturday was diverting crews to Southern Michigan around Coldwater which suffered some of the worst damage Dodd said.

""That's where a lot of our heavy damage is — a lot of wire downs pole damage that sort of thing. We are taking crews that have finished up north and sending them down to help with that area.""

In the meantime Consumers brought relief to customers with water and ice distributions across the region on Saturday. An ice cream cone giveaway is set for 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday at the Red Barn Market in Lowell.

Dodd said Consumers would also buy tickets for the first 2500 people to visit Binder Zoo in Battle Creek on Saturday.

We all want to be free.

So I've often been told does information.

That's why the internet was created.

Somehow America's most beloved airline -- it's a relative concept -- doesn't seem to see things quite like this.

Southwest Airlines is fed up that there are business entities out there that scrutinize its fares and schedules and try to find ways for people to get better deals on the airline. Yes even better than Southwest's (supposedly) cheapest possible deals.

I'm not suggesting these companies occupy some elevated moral peaks. It's just that this is the way the internet tends to work.

Hidden Gems?



Let's bathe in the factual mire.

Southwest is suing Skiplagged. This is a company that helps people find itineraries that involve a two-step flight when the traveler merely wants to go to the first of those destinations. The two-step flight turns out to be cheaper than a single direct flight. So the traveler gets off at the first destination and leaves an empty seat.

Southwest claims this means its staff are unable to discern where the missing passenger is perhaps leading to a delay of the flight and affecting its ""on-time performance metrics."" It also claims there are problems with baggage going to the wrong destination. I fear passengers who take advantage of these so-called hidden city fares rarely check baggage.

Some moral philosophers believe this to be poor behavior on the part of passengers. (Some airlines ban those who try it too many times.) Other moral experts might say that there's nothing illegal to see here. If the offer is out there why not take advantage? The cheaper one-stop fares are often offered because a competitor has a direct flight to the final destination.

In its complaint against Skiplagged Southwest insists it ""prides itself on offering customer-friendly policies.""

To protect this customer-friendliness Southwest has previously been active in suing online travel agencies which dared to feature Southwest's fares and schedules without express permission.

Now the airline is going after Skiplagged. In addition it's also suing Czech-based online travel agency Kiwi.com. It claims Skiplagged is getting its Southwest fares and schedules from Kiwi rather than say peeking at the Southwest website itself.

In the formal words of Southwest's lawyers: ""On information and belief Kiwi distributes to Skiplagged the Southwest schedules and fares Kiwi scrapes from Southwest's website.""

Many Customers Are Secret Shoppers.



I'm sure lawyers on both sides will enjoy their exchange of arguments.

Some might say that Skiplagged for example never agreed to Southwest's terms and conditions so it shouldn't be an object of the airline's ire. Rather it's just passing on information to interested customers. It's also not selling tickets. In any case customers shop around. It's what they do. It's what the web makes far easier to do.

Southwest sniffs that Skiplagged ""was inducing Southwest customers to violate the Southwest Terms & Conditions and/or Contract of Carriage.""

Skiplagged has said it's already tried to reason with Southwest. Kiwi is a touch more bullish.

Its spokesperson told me: ""Kiwi.com is not 'hacking' Southwest. Southwest openly admits that it makes all of its flight and fare data generally available to the public. The question in this case is whether a company like Southwest can publish information openly on the internet and then sue its online competitors from accessing that same data.""

The casual bystander may consider this a valid point.

The casual startup founder may also admire these words from Kiwi's spokesperson: ""We bring greater freedom of choice to consumers by finding routes and building unique itineraries that airlines cannot offer. This may upset the traditional way of doing things for some airlines that want to continue to control customer behavior limit options and price comparisons of publicly available information. Ultimately it should be up to consumers not Southwest Airlines to decide where to buy their airline tickets.""

Where Is The Love?



Southwest is selective about which companies it gives access to its fares and schedules. Some global distribution systems travel agencies and gosh corporate booking tools are given favor.

Oddly Southwest previously told me: ""Allowing a third-party access to our consumer fares and flights adds a new dimension that would erode our promise to our customers of offering friendly reliable and low-cost air travel. We prefer to build a relationship with the customer on their journey from booking to destination and OTAs would change the experience our customers expect from us.""

Some third-parties are clearly better than others.

I'm glad I'm not a lawyer especially in these difficult areas.

I tend to believe though that the bigger the company the bigger -- and more expensive -- its lawyers and those lawyers tend to win. Especially where the latest lawsuit has been filed -- Texas. Then again Skiplagged previously prevailed in a lawsuit brought by United Airlines and travel site Orbitz.

I wonder what the courts will make of this latest Southwest lawsuit in our era of (supposed) free internet openness.

I also wonder what Southwest's customers will think of the airline's lawsuit. As a customer I wonder whether it suggests the airline doesn't really want customers to know the cheapest way to fly the airline.

Which seems a touch off-brand for a low-cost carrier and even unlovable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDMyY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vbmV3cy9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudC1kaWVzLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE50gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94MzJjaGljYWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50LWRpZXMtb2YtY292aWQtMTkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines flight attendant dies of COVID-19,"Southwest Airlines is mourning the loss of Maurice Reggie Shepperson a flight attendant who died this week after a battle with COVID-19.

A vaccinated Southwest Airlines flight attendant died from COVID-19 on Tuesday USA TODAY reported.

Maurice Shepperson was put on a ventilator in a Las Vegas hospital his mother told the outlet.

Shepperson tested positive for COVID-19 in early June after flying to Hawaii she told USA TODAY.

A Southwest Airlines flight attendant died from COVID-19 less than two months after he tested positive following a work trip to Hawaii his family and friends told USA TODAY on Thursday.

Maurice Reginald ""Reggie"" Shepperson 36 died on Tuesday Dawn Shepperson his mother told the paper.

Shepperson tested positive for coronavirus in early July Marcia Hildreth a friend and fellow Southwest flight attendant told USA TODAY.

Both Hildreth and Shepperson's mother told the paper that he was fully vaccinated.

More than half of the US population has had two shots meaning they're fully vaccinated against COVID-19 data from the CDC showed.

A UK study recently found that having two vaccine shots lowers the risk of infection from the Delta variant by 50% to 60% compared with unvaccinated people. Another UK study in July found that two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines were 88% and 67% effective respectively against symptomatic COVID-19 from the Delta variant.

Shepperson often flew to Hawaii for work his mother told USA TODAY. She told the paper that she joined Shepperson for one of the trips in early June. This was one of the last plane journeys that he took for Southwest before testing positive for the virus his mother said.

Insider has reached out to Southwest for comment. A Southwest spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY that an employee died on Tuesday but declined a request for further details.

""We are heartbroken over the loss of our Southwest employee"" the spokesperson said in a statement to the paper. ""Out of respect for the family we do not have additional information to share.""

Shepperson spent one month in a Las Vegas hospital where he was put on a ventilator his mother and Hildreth told USA TODAY.

""It hurt me so bad because it was just so quick"" his mother told USA TODAY. ""I didn't have time to really even acknowledge what was going on.""

In a separate interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal his mother said Shepperson drove himself to the hospital after saying that he couldn't breathe.







Hildreth set up a GoFundMe page on Friday to raise money for the funeral expenses on behalf of Shepperson's mother. So far it's reached nearly $4500.

Southwest is one of three airlines in the US that are not requiring employees to get vaccinated CNN reported on Wednesday. CEO Gary Kelly said the company will ""continue to strongly encourage"" that workers get vaccinated but won't require it.

In February a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 55% of Americans said they had already been vaccinated or would get a shot as soon as possible. That figure rose to 69% in July.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTg5NDM1MS9GdWxseS12YWNjaW5hdGVkLVNvdXRod2VzdC1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50LTM2LWRpZXMtQ09WSUQtMTktdHJpcC1IYXdhaWkuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTk4OTQzNTEvYW1wL0Z1bGx5LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQtU291dGh3ZXN0LWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnQtMzYtZGllcy1DT1ZJRC0xOS10cmlwLUhhd2FpaS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fully vaccinated Southwest flight attendant 36 dies from COVID-19 after trip to Hawaii,"A Southwest Airlines flight attendant has died from COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated according to his mother and best friend.

Maurice 'Reggie' Shepperson 36 died at Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas on Tuesday nearly two months after he tested positive for the virus following a work trip to Hawaii.

He had reportedly checked himself into the hospital due to difficulty breathing on July 7 and was put on a ventilator weeks after testing positive.

Shepperson's mother Dawn told USA Today her son was fully vaccinated and his friend Marcia Hildreth another Southwest flight attendant said he took every precaution against the virus including wearing a mask constantly washing his hands sanitizing surfaces and wiping everything down in hotel rooms.

He is among a very small fraction of Americans who have died after suffering 'breakthrough' coronavirus infections after vaccination.

Fully vaccinated Southwest Airlines flight attendant Maurice 'Reggie' Shepperson 36 (pictured) died from COVID-19 on Tuesday at a hospital in Las Vegas - nearly two months after he tested positive following a work trip to Hawaii

Shepperson had checked into the hospital on July 7 weeks after testing positive following his trip to Hawaii in early June

Shepperson had been a flight attendant since 2007 and has worked for Southwest for nine years.

Dubbed 'high flyer' by his co-workers Shepperson was known to pick up more work trips than any other flight attendant both for the money and the ability to travel to new places.

A flight attendant from his training class Kiki Lee told USA Today: 'He was hitting the skies right way using his benefits. He loved working and he loved the perks.'

One of Shepperson's first trips was to China shortly after graduating from flight school.

The flight attendant who was fully vaccinated came down with the virus after returning home and drove himself to Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas on July 7

He took his mother Dawn on one of his last work trips to Hawaii before contracting the virus.

Both were repeatedly tested before leaving for the sunny island.

He wrote in a Facebook post from the trip: 'Took mommy on my work trip to Hawaii I’ll be back to get her tomorrow lol love this woman with all my heart.'

Her son fell ill after returning home and immediately began to quarantine.

On June 17 he posted on Facebook: 'Nevada is the only place I've lived where you call to make doctor's appointments and they give you three to four months out. People b e dead by then smh.'

He would later test positive for COVID-19. His mother did not contract the virus.

His co-workers called Shepperson a 'high flyer' and he was known for taking advantage of his perks and went on many works trips including the Hawaii trip he took his mother (pictured) on

Dawn who left food on her son's doorstep told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that her son was in a lot of pain and couldn't get up.

On July 7 Shepperson drove himself to the emergency room with breathing problems.

He would spend the following weeks in the hospital on a ventilator before passing away from the virus.

Southwest spokesman Brandy King confirmed Shepperon's death but the company declined to say anything further in respect to the family.

Dawn said Southwest Airlines reached out to her after the death of her son as well as to his best friend and fellow flight attendant Marcia Hildreth to fly her to Vegas from a work trip.

Hildreth has also started a GoFundMe page to help cover the cost of funeral expenses. It has raised $9386 so far.

Clark County currently has over 11000 COVID-19 cases and over 300000 cases in the state.

Although COVID-19 vaccines do not offer 100 percent protection from the virus they are still highly effective. There are breakout cases with the Delta variant however the fully vaccinated are less likely to get severely ill or die from the virus according to the CDC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtcGlsb3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Pilot Goes The Extra Mile To Share His Story With A Little Boy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtcGlsb3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Insider spoke with over a dozen current and former Starbucks baristas who said they were sick of getting complex orders.

Baristas said many would taste ""disgusting"" and slow order times. Some are based on TikTok trends.

A Starbucks rep told Insider most custom orders were simple and the company valued customization.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Starbucks customers in some cases are pushing drink customization to the limit with modifications that some baristas deem ""excessive"" ""ridiculous"" and ""disgusting.""

More than a dozen current and former baristas across the US and Canada told Insider they were sick of making overly complicated lattes cold brews and Refreshers including so-called TikTok drinks like the $7 iced white mocha.

Most custom drink orders aren't complicated. A Starbucks representative told Insider that 75% of customized beverages at Starbucks had fewer than three unique modifications.

But the baristas said complex drinks slowed down order times and customers sometimes got angry when their customized drinks weren't made perfectly.

This could be a particular issue with mobile orders they said adding that customers' requests on the Starbucks app could sometimes be confusing.

'The modifications are out of control'

""There are no limits to what people can really order"" a current Baltimore barista said.

""Some of the things I see are just disgusting"" a former Los Angeles barista said.

They said that some drinks had ""mile-long stickers"" listing order customizations and that sometimes there wouldn't be enough space to fit everything in the cup. Under company policy custom drinks still have to fit in the cup size customers request.

""I've made Frappuccinos before that literally did not have room for milk in them"" the former Los Angeles barista said. ""The modifications are out of control.""

Some of the baristas said people had ordered drinks with 20 or more pumps of syrup. Nat El-Hai a former barista in Beverly Hills California shared a photo with Insider of an iced latte she said she made for a customer with 12 shots of coffee and five shots of hazelnut syrup.

The former Los Angeles barista said one customer ordered an ""absolutely ridiculous"" drink topped with whipped cream nonfat cold foam and sweet-cream cold foam.







""People think that the more they add the more fancy they're being but there's definitely a point of diminishing returns"" the person said. ""I can't imagine someone ordering that drink and finishing it.""

Numerous baristas said they had turned down customers' requests for cake pops and brownies blended into drinks and one said she had even been asked to blend egg bites into a drink.

El-Hai told Insider that one customer even asked her to blend banana and milk together and then use that as a base for a latte.

She said some customers showed her drink pictures they found online that had ""clearly"" been edited. ""And then people got really upset when we can't do that"" she said.

Starbucks staff members generally have targets of around 45 seconds for each drive-thru order. Large numbers of modifications slow baristas down Sarah Ann Austin a North Carolina barista said.

A Starbucks representative said: ""We ask our baristas to make the moment right no matter the order and would expect a highly customized beverage to take longer to make.""

Eric Fellner a former barista in North Carolina said that complex requests would ""totally screw with you"" by deviating from Starbucks' standard base recipes.

""The reason why it causes such an issue is that everything is based on times"" he said. ""The whole thing is about being as fast as possible and so in order for that to work everything has to be systematic.""

""If a drink looks complicated assume that it's complicated"" a current barista in British Columbia said.

The Starbucks representative told Insider that most customizations were reasonable requests from customers.

The representative added: ""Customizing beverages at Starbucks and our baristas' expertise in helping customers find and craft the right beverage has and always will be at the heart of the Starbucks experience.""

The incident occurred inside the Starbucks on 15th and Walnut streets Saturday around 1:30 p.m.

The customer who did not want to reveal her identity told NBC10 the ordeal began after the Starbucks employees made the drinks she ordered incorrectly.

“They were made wrong so I asked him to remake it and he caught an attitude” she said. “When he remade it he had an attitude about it. Filled my cup halfway with caramel and slammed it on the counter.”

The woman said she then asked to speak with a manager but the employees told her there was no one around. She then said a male employee hit her in the face with a rag.

“He took his wet rag smacked me in my face with it and he swung at me” she said. “So we started fighting. I was shocked for a second. Then he swung at me so I swung back.”

While the woman said she was merely defending herself after being attacked by the employee the employee identified as Robert Freda claimed it was actually the other way around.

“I have a black eye” he told NBC10. “I have contusions here. Marks on my body here. If anybody was left with more damage it was me.”

Freda denied hitting the woman with the wet rag.

“I waved a wet rag in her face that I had in my hand” he said. “Not trying to hit her or anything and she proceeded to jump across the counter swinging at me. And at that point my fight or flight response kicked in.”

NBC10 reached out to Starbucks. A spokesperson told NBC10 Freda was fired after their initial investigation.

“It goes without saying Starbucks is a place where everyone should feel welcome” the spokesperson wrote. “I can confirm we have separated the partner (employee) after our initial investigation. The type of behavior described in this incident is not indicative of the type of dignity and respect we want our partners and customers to show when in our stores.”

Starbucks also said part of their investigation includes reviewing the video of the incident from inside the store. While they don’t plan on releasing the video they told NBC10 they stand by their decision to remove Freda.

Freda told NBC10 he was remorseful about how the situation escalated so quickly but insists he was only trying to protect himself.

“An actual attack was initiated by her” he said.

The customer meanwhile plans on filing charges.

“What he did should not have happened at all” she said. “You don’t do that at all.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZnJhbWluZ2hhbXNvdXJjZS5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwLzIwMjEvMDgvMTQvbmV3LXN0YW5kYWxvbmUtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLW9wZW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Standalone Starbucks Opens,"Share email print bookmark SOURCE reports.

For some people a coffee house isn’t just a place to pick up some java and a muffin – it’s like a second home.

That second home became challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic but so many of them have been closed to customers or only available for pick-up service.

Others however have never re-opened.

Like for example the Starbucks located at the Indigo store in Metropolis at Metrotown. It shut down during the pandemic and looks to be closed permanently.

“It was my second home” said Jen who spoke to the NOW on Friday at the Indigo store. “I spent a lot of time here studying for school and then doing work for my job. It’s nice to get out of the house and this was my favourite Starbucks because it was so much quieter than other locations because it was inside a book store. It felt so silent. I could also easily shop at the mall. It’s too bad.”

One Indigo staff member said it sucked to see it closed because they got to know all of the staff and it was really convenient to get her favourite drink.

This is the second Starbucks closed at Metropolis.

The Starbucks on the second floor of Metropolis at Metrotown closed forever Feb. 1 due to impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is another Starbucks in the mall – a fair walk to the food court - but a customer who contacted the NOW said this was the fastest one to hit before hopping onto the Metrotown SkyTrain.

“It’s about timing” said the woman who didn’t want her name used because she admitted this was “first-world problems” but said her commute is pretty tight due to child-care issues. “I only have so much time and this was perfect. This is really disappointing.”

Starbucks says its plan to close up to 300 coffee shops across Canada were completed by the end of March.

The Seattle-based coffeehouse and roastery chain announced the acceleration of its five-year ""transformation strategy"" last year as it responded to changes in consumer habits during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a statement the company says some of its locations closed last fall and it expects to complete its planned store closures by the end of its second quarter.

The restructuring includes adding new drive-thru locations the expansion of delivery and a pilot of curbside pick-up only coffee shops.

The company began experimenting with pick-up only locations before the pandemic. The first Canadian Starbucks store using the new format which measured 93 square metres or 1000 square feet launched in Toronto's financial district last January.

Starbucks says the changes will help the coffee chain ""best meet our customers where they are now.""

The company had previously said it would close up to 200 of its locations in Canada over two years."

George Porritt announced after Saturday's annual Red and White intrasquad scrimmage that he will retire as coach and athletic director after the 2021-22 school year.

Porritt is entering his 32nd season as coach with a 270-84 record seven state championships and 14 league titles.

“I’ve had the joy of living my life coaching sports I love at a school I love and most importantly around student-athletes and colleagues that have become as close as family” Porritt said in a statement.

The 2007 Army National High School Football Coach of the Year Porritt was inducted into the Michigan High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame this year and was inducted into the Catholic High School League Hall of Fame in 2000. He has been the OLSM's AD since 1989.

“If you played for Coach Porritt you learned how important it was to be committed to each other and the rewards that came from becoming a true team” Chicago Bears receiver and 2011 alum Allen Robinson said in a statement. “He instills that value in his players and there are three decades of St. Mary’s men that are proud to call him ‘coach.’ ”

What’s red and white and secret all over? The Peg the State Fair’s only full-service restaurant. Hidden in plain sight behind the Ag-Hort building The Peg isn’t secret in that it’s hard to find—the big red-and-white signs announce it loud and clear as do the myriad colorful murals and the 20-foot-high bays that contain it—but in that despite how hard it is to miss people still don’t seem to understand.

Let’s start with understanding the name. It comes from a blue-collar joint of days gone by just off of 280 called the Square Peg which was famous for old-school Minnesota comfort foods like roast pork and roast beef served with mashed potatoes and bread and plenty of brown gravy made from the drippings. The Square Peg was run by Greg Auge (pronounced oh-zhay) who in 1982 opened its sister shop The Peg at the fair with his former Howard Johnson coworker Tim Carlson.

As I’m sitting in a booth at The Peg with Tim Carlson and Greg’s son Brett Auge more secrets spill out. Those murals? Greg Auge was an old-school do-gooder with a soft spot for people down on their luck and hired a homeless artist living at the Dorothy Day Center to paint them. The younger Auge isn’t too different. His favorite part of the fair is when the crowd from Living Well Disability Services comes in to eat. He buys their 45 tickets and helps every wheelchair user find a table then piles their plates high with whatever they want. Typically they and everybody want one of the Peg top four: The Peg muffin (breakfast sandwich with sausage tomato egg and cheese) the famous Peg burger (double patties spicy sauce) loaded fries with barbecue pork or the Boss Hog barbecue sandwich.

“Sweet Martha’s opened around the same time as us” says Carlson. “But we’re not big like what she’s got now; we just try to keep comfort food and atmosphere like the old times.”

In fact if you want to see The Peg at its busiest you’ll need to get there at 7 am. That’s when all the vendors and anyone else living on-site at the fair pop in for breakfast. Even Sweet Martha herself comes in most days and eats in a booth with her team.

“We’ll serve 400 to 500 people a morning” says Brett Auge. “Just plain food good food eggs muffins biscuits. All the one-hit wonders we’ve seen come through the fair but we’re still standing.”

And while the food is great people don’t necessarily come for the food.

“People tell us ‘I come for the hugs.’ We had a great-grandmother grandmother granddaughter working here all at the same time; we’re real proud of that” says Auge of the staff which is mainly his and Carlson’s relatives and friends. “We’re the faces the old-timers know.”

The Peg also offers two more rarities at the fair: available seating and affordable prices.

“Seating is a premium out here and that’s one thing we provide” says Carlson. “And we don’t want to price-gouge people just because it’s the fair. I don’t want to hear people walking by saying ‘That’s too expensive.’ If we can’t do a volume business how can we feel good about ourselves? It’s not like there aren’t enough customers walking by.”

Sitting with Auge and Carlson a man in an “I [heart] lefse” T-shirt limps in and grabs a seat at the counter.

“My knee hurts” he announces.

“Welcome to getting old” says Auge. “You want coffee?”

All over the fair newbies stampede for the new spots offering the new foods but up here the wise old-timers eat at the one place left at the fair that understands value constancy and why it matters that a restaurant creates space for you to take a load off your creaking knees."

As many as 1.5 million existing T-Mobile customers using the feature will have it removed between August 31st and September 2nd.





A short code is a telephone number made up of four five or six digits. Businesses use short codes to send high-volume messages via MMS or SMS to customers including alerts codes for two-factor authentication and marketing messages. Allowing its customers to block or blacklist all short codes led T-Mobile subscribers who enabled the feature to complain to the carrier that they weren't receiving two-factor authentication codes important messages from their financial institutions and more.





The resulting flood of calls made by T-Mobile customers who blocked or blacklisted short codes became a headache for T-Mobile's customer service department. T-Mobile will still allow customers to block individual short code numbers following the removal of the option to block all short codes.





Starting this coming Tuesday August 17th running through Thursday August 19th T-Mobile will send out text messages alerting its customers to the change. If you're a T-Mobile customer and never blocked short codes from appearing on your mobile device you won't notice any change.

T-Mobile customers may want to brace for some bad news.

The mobile service provider is investigating a reported data breach that may have exposed the private info of more than 100 million people. The would-be perpetrator is apparently trying to sell off a portion of the data Vice noted in a Sunday report.

The site spoke with the anonymous author of a forum post offering up roughly one-third of the T-Mobile USA customer data in exchange for 6 bitcoins (worth a bit less than $280000 as of Aug. 15). While it could all be BS Vice was able to look at samples of the data and confirm that the seller has ""accurate information on T-Mobile customers.""

The stolen data which was reportedly obtained from multiple T-Mobile servers is filled with identifying information including names addresses and phone numbers; social security numbers; IMEI numbers which are unique to each mobile device; and driver's license info. It's not clear if this data is available for every person exposed in the breach but the seller did confirm to Vice that their access to T-Mobile's servers has been cut off.

On Sunday evening a T-Mobile spokesperson responded to Mashable's request for comment with the following statement: ""We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity. We do not have any additional information to share at this time.""

The company offered more on Monday in a brief post on its website titled simply ""T-Mobile Cybersecurity Incident Update."" While it doesn't address a number of details that came up in the original report the company does admit that some manner of breach occurred and that it's working with digital forensics experts and law enforcement as an investigation looks into what happened.

The post goes on to note: ""We have determined that unauthorized access to some T-Mobile data occurred however we have not yet determined that there is any personal customer data involved. We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed. This investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others.""

Given the continuing lack of information on the extent of the impacts T-Mobile customers (and potentially former customers as well no one really knows) would be wise to keep an eye on their accounts and overall digital footprint for suspicious activity.

The alleged data breach first surfaced on a hacking forum yesterday after the threat actor claimed to be selling a database for six bitcoin (~$280K) containing birth dates driver's license numbers and social security numbers for 30 million people.

Forum post selling T-Mobile data

While the forum post does not state the origins of the data the threat actor told BleepingComputer that they took it from T-Mobile in a massive server breach.

The threat actor claims to have hacked into T-Mobile's production staging and development servers two weeks ago including an Oracle database server containing customer data.

This stolen data allegedly contains the data for approximately 100 million T-Mobile customers and can include customers' IMSI IMEI phone numbers customer names security PINs Social Security numbers driver's license numbers and date of birth.

""Their entire IMEI history database going back to 2004 was stolen"" the hacker told BleepingComputer.

An IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a unique number used to identify mobile phones while an IMSI (International mobile subscriber identity) is a unique number associated with a user on a cellular network.

As proof that they breached T-Mobile's servers the threat actors shared a screenshot of an SSH connection to a production server running Oracle.

Alleged access to T-Mobile Oracle server via SSH

Sensitive info r​​​​edacted by BleepingComputer

Cybersecurity intelligence firm Cyble also told BleepingComputer yesterday that the threat actor claims to have stolen multiple databases totaling approximately 106GB of data including T-Mobile's customer relationship management (CRM) database.

Motherboard who first reported on this breach said they could verify that data samples provided by the threat actor belonged to T-Mobile customers.

When asked if they attempted to ransom the stolen data to T-Mobile the threat actors said they never contacted the company and decided to sell it on forums where they already have interested buyers.

When we contacted T-Mobile about the sale of this data they stated they are actively investigating it.

""We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity. We do not have any additional information to share at this time"" T-Mobile told BleepingComputer.

T-Mobile hacked for revenge

The threat actors tol Alon Gal CTO of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock that they performed this hack to damage US infrastructure.

""This breach was done to retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns (CIA Raven-1) in Germany by CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019"" the threat actors told Gal in a conversation.

""We did it to harm US infrastructure.""

Binns is a resident of Turkey who sued the FBI CIA and Department of Justice in 2020.

The complaint alleges that Binn was tortured and harassed by the US and Turkish governments and is seeking to compel the USA to release documents regarding these activities under the Freedom of Information Act.

Motherboard reported that it was in contact with the seller of the data who said they had taken data from T-Mobile’s servers that included Social Security numbers names addresses and driver license information related to more than 100 million people. After reviewing samples of the data Motherboard reported it appeared authentic.

“We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity” a T-Mobile spokesperson said in an email to The Verge. “We do not have any additional information to share at this time.”

It’s not clear when the data may have been accessed but T-Mobile has been the target of several data breaches in the last few years most recently in December 2020. During that incident call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers may have been exposed but the company said at the time that it did not include more sensitive info such as names or Social Security numbers.

In 2018 hackers accessed personal information for roughly 2 million T-Mobile customers that included names addresses and account numbers and in 2019 some of T-Mobile’s prepaid customers were affected by a breach that also accessed names addresses and account numbers."

But he wasn’t surprised.

Baltimore Gas & Electric informed employees it would no longer allow those vaccinated against COVID-19 to take off their masks when working indoors but outside their homes following the city of Baltimore’s reinstated indoor mask mandate. And the natural gas and electricity utility is reconsidering its plans to bring more remote workers back to offices amid another wave of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations attributed to the more contagious delta variant.

White 51 has worked at BGE for 30 years. He has embraced the benefits of working from home in Laurel like more time spent with his wife Tiah and J.J. their 9-year-old son. The utility training center manager doesn’t mind further delaying his full-time return to the office; his disappointment stems from “where we’re headed with the pandemic.”

“If it’s done out of caution and they want employees to be safe that’s what I want as well” he said.

With nearly 60% of Marylanders vaccinated against COVID many employers eyed Labor Day when students will be back in classrooms as a logical time to begin returning to the office. That was before the state began reporting hundreds of new cases per day and the number of hospitalized patients more than tripled.

Joe White a utility training center manger for BGE takes a break from remote work in his home office in Laurel to answer a question from his 9-year-old son J.J.

The resurgent pandemic and the city’s reinstated indoor masking order which took effect Monday set off a flurry of corporate activity with managers revising their expectations about when and how remote employees might return to the office. Now some employers have put plans on pause others are forging ahead and more still are keeping their options open as they monitor the spread of the delta variant.

The outcome of their decisions will particularly affect Baltimore’s downtown which brimmed with tourists and city workers before the pandemic emptied much of the city center. The lack of workers and visitors decimated demand for lunchtime haunts after-work watering holes and many of the area’s shops and services establishments.

Many Baltimore workplaces are committed to safely bringing employees back to the office “but the schedule for returning is being adjusted on a month-to-month basis” said Shelonda Stokes president of the Downtown Partnership which promotes downtown and counts 650 businesses as members.

“The Downtown Partnership has been collaborating with the health department and business leaders to educate and create vaccination incentives for employees to help mitigate the spread of the virus” Stokes said.

The majority of cases and hospitalizations have been among people who are not vaccinated state health officials say. However experts have raised concern about so-called breakthrough cases in which vaccinated people can be infected and transmit the virus.

“The increased number of cases and the number of unvaccinated people who are contracting [COVID-19] and being hospitalized has made businesses just take a pause and reflect on where things are right now and maybe where they’ll be in three to four weeks” said Don Fry president and CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee a regional organization representing more than 500 businesses.

“People are reassessing” Fry said.

BGE emailed its roughly 3100 Baltimore-area employees Aug. 6 informing them of the city’s just-announced plan to reinstate the mask order and its implications for their workplaces said Aaron Koos BGE’s vice president of communications. The roughly 40% who are working remotely had planned to return in three phases with the first 100 coming back after Labor Day another group 60 days later and the rest at the beginning of next year.

That’s on hold for now.

“We are reevaluating that schedule” Koos said. “It looks like we’re going to be in a remote environment for a while longer and it’s not looking positive for accelerating that given the numbers.”

“This is extremely disappointing to see numbers going in the wrong direction” he added. “The best way to get back to normal or as normal as we can get is to get people vaccinated and have people comply with the masking requirements. We’re trying to do our part to encourage employees and customers.”

Baltimore-based sports apparel maker Under Armour delayed its corporate employees’ planned mid-September return to the office until early 2022 “in order to continue to protect the health and safety of teammates and their families” the company announced in an Aug. 3 news release. It employs about 2400 people in the area.

When corporate employees do return to offices in Locust Point Port Covington and other workplaces in the U.S. and Canada vaccinations are required. Retail workers are not required to be vaccinated but must continue to wear masks the company said.

The Johns Hopkins University the Baltimore region’s largest private-sector employer is not adjusting its plans to bring back its more than 27000 workers in the fall university leaders wrote in an campus email Aug. 6.

All students faculty and staff must provide documentation showing they have been vaccinated (there was an Aug. 1 deadline to apply for an exception).

As public health conditions vary “we expect that periods of masking or other restrictions (e.g. on eating together indoors) will be a fact of life for the near future” Executive Vice Provost Stephen Gange Chief Risk Officer Jon Links and Chief Administration Officer Jane Schlegel wrote in the email.

But the university leaders said “we do not anticipate the need for public health precautions as extensive as those we instituted last year.”

“Our plans for broad resumption of in-person academic research and extracurricular activities as well as staff return plans are unchanged and we look forward to being together again in the coming weeks” the university officials wrote.

T. Rowe Price the Baltimore-based investment firm had set a Sept. 13 target for its approximately 1700 employees to return to their East Pratt Street offices.

But the company is continuing to review guidelines and developments from national and local government and health authorities as it decides when to go back T. Rowe Price spokesperson Robert Matthews said.

“We plan to take the next few weeks to consider all the factors that may influence our current return-to-office plans” Matthews said.

M&T Bank’s branches remained open throughout the pandemic and the bank’s offices have reopened welcoming remote employees back on a voluntary basis said spokesman Scott Graham.

M&T is not requiring its workforce to be vaccinated but “strongly encourages employees who haven’t already been vaccinated to do so” Graham said. Full-time workers are offered up to eight hours of personal time to get the shots he said.

CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield is monitoring local health and safety guidelines metrics and recommendations before bringing its 2485 Baltimore-area employees to the office in large numbers.

For now vaccinated employees at the regional health insurer can reserve drop-in workspaces and conference rooms “designed to adhere to social distancing guidelines at designated CareFirst locations” said spokeswoman Rebecca Hollamon. Wearing masks is required.

“Until it is safe CareFirst will focus efforts on creating a new and better normal for our workforce and workplace of the future” Hollamon said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZWxhd2FyZW9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3Jvbi1pbmdoYW0tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTQ3OTIxOTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ron Ingham Obituary (2021) - Wilmington DE - The News Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/delawareonline/name/ron-ingham-obituary?id=14792192 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZWxhd2FyZW9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3Jvbi1pbmdoYW0tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTQ3OTIxOTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The news helps explain Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive's recent GTA mod takedown spree - particular mods that recreated the games in question.

But it also helps explain why Rockstar nuked a San Andreas fan remake trailer in July 2020 too.

Last summer Eurogamer reported on a fan-made trailer showing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas ""remade"" in Unreal Engine 4. It was simply that: a trailer not a game or a mod of any kind. And yet Take-Two nuked it from YouTube issuing a takedown claiming copyright infringement.

The three-person team behind the trailer collectively called ArcadiaSquad even pulled their Patreon.

ArcadiaSquad ended up reuploading the video to its YouTube channel at the end of May this year this time with a hefty disclaimer admitting their naivety with the original release. At the time of this article's publication the video remains online.

Here's the disclaimer:

""This video was uploaded on July 10 2020. Due to copyright problems and misunderstandings it was removed. That project originally paid tribute to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas just a fan-made concept of what the game would be like in a modern graphics engine. That said we have decided to re-upload this video on this channel and hope that this time such serious measures are not applied again (considering all the replications of similar projects on the internet).

""We are not going to release anything related to this project. So we insist we will host this video as such: just a simple video. And to avoid any future issues we are not going to monetize this particular video.

""At that time we were a bit stupid and did not ask for the respective permissions that's another reason we are not going to monetise.""

Looking back at the video now with reports of San Andreas being remade in Unreal being an actual reality at Rockstar front of mind it's fun to imagine it gives us an indication of how the official release may look. To create the video ArcadiaSquad used assets from the original San Andreas as well as mods and assets from the Unreal Engine Marketplace.

Get the details on what this will look like when it comes out

Three Grand Theft Auto classics are racing to the ninth gen and Nintendo Switch this fall a Kotaku exclusive reveals. Rockstar is applying the finishing touches on remasters of Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas using the Unreal Engine with new Scottish subsidiary Ruffian Games Limited (now Rockstar Dundee) leading the fold. The re-releases are expected to be digital-only.

The trilogy will incorporate updated graphics with the vintage feel and design of the original resulting in a curious mishmash of past and present. The remastered versions are said to resemble common user mods of PlayStation 2-era Grand Theft Auto titles. Take-Two Interactive Rockstar’s parent company had previously invoked the authority of the DMCA in preparation for three remasters in active development; videos of classic GTA mods on Twitch YouTube and related platforms were removed at the developers’ request. Sources close to Kotaku confirm these mystery games to be three of the highest-grossing entries in Grand Theft Auto ending months of media speculation.

The project has more at stake than fans realize. Rockstar is relying on the success of the Grand Theft Auto trilogy to substantiate future remasters of the studio’s other tentpole games including Red Dead Redemption as well as ninth gen ports of Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. The original plan was more about quality updates than making an extra buck and surprisingly less ambitious. Rockstar wanted to reward GTA patrons for keeping online play on GTA V alive almost a decade since the title was released on the PlayStation 3 — a seventh-gen console — and offer classic remasters as thanks. In the process of reworking the trilogy however developers felt it deserved a major re-release of its own similar to a port.

The remastered Grand Theft Auto games were scheduled to hit shelves in January but like everything else in corporate had to be pulled back in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Not only did it hamper development and require the assistance of other in-house studios but it also made planning the release more difficult to time given projected release dates for other upcoming titles. Even among competitors entertainment follows its own carefully orchestrated timetable; as a rule of thumb creators are discouraged from overlapping with other projects on queue both to increase exposure and to maximize profit. The proliferation of the Delta variant complicated matters a step further however giving the trilogy a new release date toward the end of the year.

The Grand Theft Auto remasters have a comprehensive release spanning not only current-gen consoles and hybrids but also PC mobile devices and Cloud gaming services like the Google Stadia. Reworking old titles into more powerful engines is decidedly more complicated hence Rockstar’s decision to prioritize console release over platforms with less oppressive graphical needs and more modest CPU power. PC is a different beast altogether and may demand more tweaking than even your standard PlayStation 5. Rockstar has been so engrossed in eliminating the need for mods by introducing remasters that other projects haven’t had much elbow grease; system updates in Red Dead Online has been scarce precisely because. GTA VI is still in development though.

The remastered versions of Grand Theft Auto III Vice City and San Andreas will be released as a digital bundle for the PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox One Xbox Series X/S Nintendo Switch PC Google Stadia and mobile smartphones and tablets.

When it comes to GTA mods there is a huge library of assortments to choose from. While most of them tend to go in for ultra-realistic fidelity (with plenty of rain puddles to drive through) Gesha’s approach to Grand Theft Auto 3 feels respectful of the franchise’s heritage and impressive at the same time.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday formally announced the launch of a National Hydrogen Mission to accelerate plans to generate the carbon-free fuel from renewables as he set a target of 2047 for India to achieve self-reliance in energy.Delivering his Independence Day address from the ramparts of the Red Fort he said India can achieve self-reliance in energy through a mix of a gas-based economy doping sugarcane extracted ethanol in petrol and electric mobility.India he said spends over Rs 12 lakh crore on energy imports every year.While India is 85 per cent dependent on imports for meeting its oil needs overseas supplies make up for roughly half of the local requirement for natural gas.""For India to progress for Atmanirbhar Bharat energy independence is necessary"" he said. ""India has to take a pledge that it will be energy independent by the year we celebrate 100th year of Independence.""The roadmap for that is to increase usage of natural gas in the economy setting up a network for supply of CNG and piped natural gas across the country blending 20 per cent ethanol in petrol and electric mobility he said.The country has achieved the target of 100 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity ahead of the target Modi added.""I announce National Hydrogen Mission"" he said.The target is to make India a global hub for production as well as export of green hydrogen. ""Green hydrogen will give India a quantum jump in achieving its targets"" he asserted.The National Hydrogen Mission was first announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22 in February this year.Hydrogen is produced predominantly through Steam Methane Reforming or SMR which utilises fossils fuels such as natural gas or coal and through Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using a current of electricity.Currently all hydrogen consumed in India comes from fossil fuels. By 2050 three-fourth of all hydrogen is projected to be green -- produced by renewable electricity and electrolysis.Speaking at the 'Urja Sangam' conference in March 2015 Prime Minister Modi had set a target of cutting India's oil import dependence from 77 per cent in 2013-14 to 67 per cent by 2022. Import dependence has however only increased.The government is now looking at substituting some oil by one that is produced from sugarcane and other bio-materials. It is looking to supply petrol mixed with 20 per cent ethanol by 2023-24 up from the current 8 per cent.Also the government is looking at raising the share of natural gas in the economy to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current 6.2 per cent.On Sunday Modi said the roadmap for making India self-reliant in energy is clear -- ""promoting a gas-based economy a pan-India network of CNG and piped natural gas and achieving 20 per cent ethanol blending target.""""India has also moved towards electric mobility"" he said.While electric vehicles gain currency Indian Railways is also moving towards 100 per cent electrification.Out of the target of setting up 450 gigawatts of electricity generation capacity from renewable sources by 2030 India has already achieved 100 GW ahead of schedule he said.In line with the government's focus on hydrogen both private and public sector companies have announced ambitious hydrogen projects.While Reliance Industries and Adani Group are pushing ahead with their plans to make hydrogen a part of their portfolio the nation's biggest state-run refiner IOC has also unveiled hydrogen plans.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is working on technology to develop hydrogen-spiked compressed natural gas or H-CNG.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L2luZGlhLW9uLXRyYWNrLXRvLWFjaGlldmUtNDUwLWd3LXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktdGFyZ2V0LWJ5LTIwMzAtcG93ZXItbWluaXN0ZXItMTE2Mjg5MTc5MzMyNDEuaHRtbNIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L2luZGlhLW9uLXRyYWNrLXRvLWFjaGlldmUtNDUwLWd3LXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktdGFyZ2V0LWJ5LTIwMzAtcG93ZXItbWluaXN0ZXIvYW1wLTExNjI4OTE3OTMzMjQxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India on track to achieve 450 GW renewable energy target by 2030: power minister | Mint,"NEW DELHI: With the spectre of extreme weather events hovering upon the world India’s power and new and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh said that India is on track to achieve its renewable energy target of 450 gigawatt (GW) by 2030 at a US India Business Council (USIBC) meeting.

Singh added that electricity distribution reforms and the promotion of open access to the electricity grid will enhance renewable energy consumption.

This comes at a time when India’s push for green energy has borne results with the country crossing the 100 GW milestone of installed renewable energy capacity. India is running the world’s largest clean energy programme to achieve 175 GW of renewable capacity including 100GW of solar power by 2022.

“The agenda of the meeting was “Advancing cleaner more sustainable and affordable energy to mitigate climate change and power India’s economic growth"" India’s ministry of new and renewable energy said in a statement on Saturday.

While India has been resisting the pressure of declaring a net zero emission goal and calling out nations on their carbon neutral intent announcements its green energy trajectory has been on an upswing.

In the run up to United Nations Climate Change Conference also known as COP-26 to be held in Glasgow later this year its president Alok Sharma will be in India next week as reported by Mint earlier.

“He (Singh) highlighted India’s achievements in the field of renewable energy energy access energy efficiency reduction in emission intensity and shared GOI’s plans to promote manufacturing and exports from India including PLI scheme for manufacturing of solar cells modules and batteries and promotion of green hydrogen"" the statement added.

India on its part has been working on a raft of measures including clean electricity ethanol blending with fossil fuels green mobility battery storage and green hydrogen to help reduce pollution and facilitate commitments made at COP-21 in Paris. India plans to reduce its carbon footprint by 33-35% from its 2005 levels by 2030 and meet 40% of its electricity needs from non-fossil fuel sources by then as part of its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted by 195 countries in Paris in 2015.

“The minister reiterated his commitment to further US and India's shared goals on climate change clean energy and sustainability and the India-US Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership"" the statement said.

Despite India’s per capita emission being one-third of the world average the country has been building up its green portfolio. India is on track of meeting its Nationally Determined Contributions targets for electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources and emission reductions.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk got $0 in pay in 2020 according to a company filing but he did receive stock options during the year that are now worth $22 billion.

The filing is accurate — Musk received no base pay during the year. That’s in keeping with past practice at the company although in prior filings Tesla reported what Musk would have earned had he received California’s minimum wage. For 2019 that came to $23760.

“However he has never accepted his salary” said the company in it’s filing late Friday. “Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.”

Tesla (TSLA) did report the value of Musk’s massive options package but that was back in 2018 when the deal that grants him the stock options was first approved by shareholders. That valuation which was done using widely accepted methods proved to be very conservative as it put the value of the options at only $2.3 billion.

Under the compensation arrangement Musk is eligible for options to buy up to 101 million split-adjusted shares of stock at an exercise price of $70.01 each. Those are being distributed in 12 equal tranches of 8.4 million options based on the company hitting both financial milestones and achieving certain stock valuation targets.

Those stock targets were all easily hit during the course of 2020 as Tesla shares soared 743% making it the best performing US stock and by far the most valuable automaker on the planet.

The financial milestones have been somewhat harder to achieve but four of Musk’s stock tranches vested during the course of 2020 giving him the right to buy 33.8 million shares at an exercise price of $2.4 billion. As of Friday’s close those stocks were worth $21.9 billion

So far in 2021 the company has hit two more financial milestones qualifying Musk for an additional 16.9 million stock options. Those options would be worth $10.9 billion at today’s prices.

The company reported in an earlier filing which detailed its record second quarter profit that it is now “probable” it will hit another three milestones in the near term which means Musk’s options windfall for 2021 could meet or even top the 2020 awards.

As is the case for most top executives who earn stock options Musk has not actually exercised any of them. Typically options are only exercised when they’re due to expire such as when an executive is leaving the company and would stand to lose them.

Sometimes executives sell shares to diversify their holdings or pay taxes but Musk has rarely sold shares during his time with the company. As of June 30 he owned 170.5 million shares outright and had options to purchase another 73.5 million shares giving him control over 23% of the company’s stock.

Musk is one of the world’s richest people thanks to both his Tesla shares and majority stake in his other company — privately-held SpaceX — of which he is also CEO.

Forbes’ real time billionaire tracker puts Musk’s net worth at $186.7 billion just behind the $190.7 billion net worth of Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. Forbes ranks Bernard Arnault the CEO of French luxury goods giant LVMH and his family at the top of its richest person list with a net worth $201.6 billion.

Musk’s Tesla stake is worth $171.3 billion counting both stock and options after taking into account their exercise price.

But his practice of not taking cash salaries has prompted him to borrow substantially as well. The Tesla filing Friday said 88 million of Musk’s Tesla shares have been pledged as collateral “to secure certain personal indebtedness.”

Although the total amount of Musk’s borrowing is not known those 88 million shares are today worth $63 billion.

A $5 billion electric vehicle company backed by Amazon and Ford is weighing a North Texas site that would roughly match the scope of Tesla’s heavily hyped gigafactory under construction outside of Austin.

The site being considered in the Walsh development 12 miles southwest of downtown Fort Worth was one of the top locations pitched by North Texas leaders when Amazon was searching for a place to build its massive HQ2 project.

The Walsh development was designed to handle the nation and world’s biggest corporate projects — and this would be one of them.

Irvine Calif.-based Rivian Automotive Inc. the electric-vehicle startup backed by Ford and Amazon is in negotiations to invest at least $5 billion to build a factory with the capacity to produce 200000 vehicles a year according to a presentation Tuesday night by the city of Fort Worth’s Economic Development Department to the City Council.

The endeavor code-named Project Tera would create at least 7500 jobs by 2027 with a minimum average annual salary of $56000. The factory would include 12 million square feet of vertical construction.

The Fort Worth EDC proposed an economic development package with Rivian that would include up to $440 million in grants and county tax abatements according to the presentation.

Although Rivian’s facility would be primarily factory rather than office space it would be more than five times as big as Toyota’s 2.1-million-square-foot corporate headquarters complex on 100 acres in Plano and employ more than twice as many workers albeit at lower average salaries. Rivian’s project would have five times the capital investment as Toyota’s which is widely touted as one of North Texas’ biggest and most impactful economic development wins ever.

The scale of Rivian’s proposed Fort Worth spread would be similar in many ways to Palo Alto Calif.-based Tesla’s manufacturing plant being built just outside of Austin although comparisons are difficult because final elements of both projects are in flux or haven’t been released by the respective companies.

Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have touted the so-called GigaTexas project as the largest automotive manufacturing facility in the United States. The plant is being built on just over 2480 acres Tesla purchased last year. The electric automaker will hire at least 5000 employees to work at the facility according to a presentation the company gave to Travis County officials in June 2020. Musk said in a March 31 tweet that “Over 10000 people are needed for GigaTexas just through 2022!”

The city of Austin has approved the first phase of GigaTexas for just over 7.9 million square feet of covered construction area.

The $5 billion capital investment commitment from Rivian includes a minimum $2 billion in real property improvements and $1.6 billion in hard construction costs according to the presentation to the Fort Worth council.

Brandom Gengelbach CEO of the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce declined to comment on details of the Rivian proposal saying only ""We are pumped that Project Tera is considering Fort Worth as a finalist.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZWxvbi1tdXNrLXRlc2xhLXNhbGFyeS1kcm9wcGVkLXplcm8tMjAyMC1wYXktZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZXMtMjAyMS040gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9lbG9uLW11c2stdGVzbGEtc2FsYXJ5LWRyb3BwZWQtemVyby0yMDIwLXBheS1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy0yMDIxLTg_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk's Tesla salary dropped to zero in 2020,"Elon Musk in Germany on Friday.

Tesla cut CEO Elon Musk's salary to zero for 2020.

In 2019 the company said it eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of his base salary.

Musk's official salary was listed as $23760 in 2019 and $56380 in 2018.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn't receive a paycheck from the electric-vehicle maker in 2020.

Musk's 2020 salary dropped to zero according to an update filed with the SEC on Friday.

His salary in 2019 had been $23760. In 2018 it was $56380.

""However he has never accepted his salary"" the company said. ""Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk's request we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.""

Under his 2018 compensation agreement Musk's total compensation package is stock-based. His options vest based on his ability to push the company to hit certain operating metrics.

The 10-year agreement included 16 operational milestones. If Tesla hits 12 of those milestones and the company's market cap hits $650 billion Musk's shares will vest on schedule according to the company.

Tesla had hit six of those milestones as of Friday the company said.

The company's market cap surged past $650 billion in 2020. It was $704.81 billion as of Friday's close.

In 2019 Musk paid cash for vested options that were valued at $30.5 million but didn't sell any of the shares bought in that transaction according to Friday's filing. The filing didn't list a vested-option purchase for 2020.

Under the 2018 agreement Musk's exercise price was $70.01 per share SEC filings said. Tesla stock ended the week at $716.70 per share.

""Only time I sell Tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring & I have no choice"" Musk said on Twitter in June.

Bloomberg last week estimated Musk's total 2020 compensation to be $6.7 billion the highest of any US chief executive.







Musk has often said he's earmarked his Tesla stock to help humans reach Mars. When asked about his 2018 compensation plan in November he said he ""didn't expect the stock to rise so much so soon.""

""The reason for the stock options is that they're needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years"" he said on Twitter."

Globally we analysed data from 3744 samples obtained by different techniques: RT-PCR variant screening assays (n = 2095) spike Sanger or Next Generation Sequencing (n = 649) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS; n = 1000) (Table 1). Data for the analyses were obtained from each center as a part of routine test of variant monitoring or for research purpose for those not involved in national surveillance but included in the SCIRE (SARS-CoV-2 Italian Research Enterprise) collaborative group. SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive swabs were collected from the respiratory tract of individuals who were either hospitalized or tested within screening programs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted using different commercial kits such as the Kit QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Midi kit on the QIAsymphony automated platform (QIAGEN Hilden Germany) the NucleoMag 96 Virus (Macherey-Nagel Dueren Germany) on automated KingFisherTM ml Magnetic Particle Processors (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) and manually with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN Hilden Germany). RT-PCR variant screening assays were performed using TaqPath COVID-19 test (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) COVID-19 variant Catcher kit (Clonit srl Milan Italy) Allplex SARS-CoV-2 Variants (Arrow Diagnostics srl Genoa Italy) or multiplexed RT-qPCR developed by English consortium (https://www.protocols.io/view/multiplexed-rt-qpcr-to-screen-for-sars-cov-2-b-1-1-br9vm966?version_warning=no).

Table 1 Summary of analyzed data Full size table

Spike sequences were obtained using home-made protocols. Full genome sequences were obtained with different protocols by a modified version of Artic Protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) using Illumina DNA Prep and IDT ILMN DNA/RNA Index kit (Illumina) by Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham Massachusetts USA) or by CleanPlex® SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Paragon Genomics Inc Hayward CA USA). Sequencing was performed on Illumina Miseq or Nextseq platforms for all samples except for those from Marche that were sequenced with Ion GeneStudioTMS5 System instrument. The results were mapped and aligned to the reference genome obtained from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/ accession ID: EPI_ISL_406800) using Geneious Prime software v. 9.1.5 (Biomatters Auckland New Zealand) (http://www.geneious.com) or Torrent Suite v. 5.10.1 (Euformatics Oy Espoo Finland) or BWA-mem and rescued using Samtools alignment/Map (Hinxton UK) (v. 1.9).

SARS-CoV-2 sequences were classified using the Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool v. 3.1.5 (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/) and Nextclade v. 1.4.0 (https://clades.nextstrain.org/). Mutations were identified using Nextclade.

The table shows the analyzed data stratified according to different methodologies used for the variant monitoring and months of sampling collection.

The number of samples considered for variant monitoring increased from 4.2% (158/3744) in October to 32% (1215/3744) in March due to the increasing interest in viral variants at global level. In the study period the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) significantly increased growing from 3.5% (6/173) in December to 86.7% (1054/1215) in March (p < 0.001). Particularly from the second half of December this lineage was already present in Liguria (n = 1 on the 18th) Campania (n = 3 on the 28th) and Marche (n = 2 on the 31st) (EPI_ISL_778869 EPI_ISL_778868) with only one known case related to return from UK. The most important increase in its prevalence was observed from the second week of January (20/126 16.0%) to the end of the same month (35/68 51.5%) reaching 73.7% (171/232) at the end of February. In parallel the prevalence of previously circulating variants significantly decreased from 100% (158/158) to 9.4% (114/1215). The Gamma variant (P.1) was first detected in the second half of January in Campania (n = 1) Lombardy (n = 1) and Umbria (n = 2) subsequently setting at around 2% in February (33/1234) and March (24/1215). Only few Beta and Eta variants (B.1.351 and B.1.525 respectively) cases were identified never reaching 1% of the total samples analysed being firstly detected in Liguria at the end of January and in Campania in mid-February respectively. The B.1.258 lineage (also known as Scottish variant) was firstly observed in Campania Marche and Piedmont in mid-October 4 cases were reported in November in Campania (n = 2) and Piedmont (n = 2) thereafter it was only reported in Campania until February reaching a proportion of 18.5% (17/92) of total cases of other variants including its descendant lineages (B.1.258.3 B.1.258.14). In half of March two cases of the Iota variant (formally known as New York lineage B.1.526) were identified in Marche. Figure 1 shows the main viral variants observed overtime. Concerning other variants the main circulating lineage was B.1.177 that represented together with its descendents (B.1.177.4 B.1.177.8 B.1.177.14 B.1.177.15 B.1.177.52 B.1.177.53 B.1.177.75) more than half of cases (50.4% 54.3% 66.1% 71.4% and 59.8% from October to February). Despite limited data regarding lineage assignment in March (n = 28) we observed a 27% prevalence of B.1 and B.1.177 lineages (Fig. 1 Panel B). Clade assignment was available for a larger number of strains compared to lineage because these data was obtained also by spike sequencing highlighting the clear predominance of 20E(EU1) ranging from 43.2% (68/157) to 67.7% (189/279). Some noteworthy mutations were observed in different lineages: N439K in one lineage A and B.1 E484K in three B.1.177 and A222V + E484K + N501Y in clade 20E.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9leHBlcmllbmNpbmctdGhlLWJhYWRlci1tZWluaG9mLXBoZW5vbWVub27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon Makes You See One Thing Everywhere,"While the group may not have achieved all of its anti-imperialist objectives its greatest achievement may be that its name is attached to a peculiar phenomenon which many of us have experienced. The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon occurs when you see hear or experience something for the very first time. Then often the next day you see hear or experience it again.

Religious people might interpret the Baader-Meinhof phenomena as messages from God; agnostics may think that the phenomena are the Universe messing with us; and some don’t think the phenomena is real at all calling it a “frequency illusion” or a form of cognitive bias.

The beginning of the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon

The phenomenon got its start in 1994 when Minnesota resident Terry Mullen came across the name “Baader–Meinhof group” for the first time then came across it again less than 24 hours later. Mullen described his experience on St. Paul Minnesota Pioneer Press’ online discussion board and others quickly wrote in to say that they too had experienced the exact same thing.",,,,,,,,,

The project calls for a 6864-square-foot addition to house a garden supply store and bulk feed storage. The existing store is about 22250 square feet and the addition is sited in an adjacent fenced-in lot.

Additionally a canopied drive-through lane alongside the addition is replacing curbside pickups.

The store is at 3095 South Delsea Drive near Butler Avenue. Tractor Supply is a national company specializing in supplies for “rural living” but it has added pet services to a small number of outlets.

Herman Sheer | Elude

Thinking about finally taking that vacation yet all you're sure about is your budget? How about just your preferred activities or that you want to pay for it with loyalty points? There are now travel apps for that — or soon will be. A new ""travel discovery and booking service"" called Elude which launched its mobile app Aug. 5 aims to match open-minded travelers who have a fixed dollar amount in mind with trips that fit both budget and interests. Meanwhile the new Una Travel app from startup firm XOKind curates collaborative itineraries for individual travelers and groups primarily based on interests. Still in the works are Out of Office which debuts in beta on Aug. 19 and will let users browse travel recommendations from trusted sources and then book them via OpenTable and the new TPG App from travel website The Points Guy due out in September and focused on maximizing the power of users' accumulated loyalty rewards points.

Cryptocurrency takes off as way to pay for travel

Affluent American ready to travel again — using vouchers

Amadeus adds fintech from travel app Hopper to offerings Mitchell Stoutin senior director of engineering for The Points Guy said the site wants to stake out a central role in a rapidly evolving travel app landscape. ""Of course there have always been apps to buy flights or book hotels but what we're seeing with the new generation is a revolution around integrations discoverability and utility"" he said. XOKind co-founder and CEO Arjun Bansal said ""the travel planning and booking experience hasn't fundamentally changed in the last 20 to 25 years."" ""Where we see things going with all the improvements in [artificial intelligence] is that in five years I should just be able to turn to my smartphone and say 'Hey Una book me my next vacation.'""

'Where can I travel for $500?'

One of the first next-gen apps out of the gate is Elude. Described by its founders as ""the only booking platform answering the question 'Where can I travel for $500?'"" Elude is built around a ""budget-first"" search engine that offers users instant options for flights departing the nearest airport and accommodations all within their desired price range. Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt president of Atmosphere Research Group in San Francisco said Elude's ""intriguing"" business idea has been a long time coming. ""I've been saying for more than 10 years that travel firms need to offer 'budget-led' shopping"" he said. ""Better late than never I guess."" The iOS version of the Elude app can now be downloaded at the Apple App Store and web booking at Elude.co will be available soon. An Android app is planned for early next year according to a company spokesperson. Elude co-founder Frankie Scerbo said he and co-founder and CEO Alex Simon were avid travelers with corporate jobs who'd become friends in college and liked to get away on several shorter breaks each year rather than just one longer vacation.

Price and trip length for them were the primary concerns. ""For us destination never really mattered"" Scerbo said. ""It was just 'get us wherever our budget could afford to get us.'"" A frustrating experience trying to book a group New Year's trip with friends that met everyone's budget and expectations led Scerbo and Simon to seek out an app to help. Failing to find what they needed they decided to ""just do it ourselves"" Scerbo said. There are three elements to Elude according to Simon the first of which is user onboarding. ""Basically we ask a handful of fun kind of quirky questions to better know the user so [the experience] is more personalized"" he said citing WiFi weather or cuisine preferences as examples.

You're literally seeing everything you can afford to get to instead of … everything you can't afford to get to. Frankie Scerbo co-founder of Elude

Elude will use customer preferences to curate future trip requests. ""It's basically to figure out what you like to do and what type of traveler you are"" said Scerbo. ""Once we have more of that information we can kind of get a little bit better with the A.I. [artificial intelligence] and suggest trips that'll probably be really attractive to you."" Next comes the main search functionality wherein users input their budgets travel dates and point of origin. ""We then showcase all city options that match that person's budget"" Simon said. Users can choose a destination and fully customize their package. ""We have a recommended flight and a recommended hotel but if you want a five-star hotel great you can upgrade"" he noted. ""And let's say you want a 7 p.m. flight versus one at 7 a.m. — you're able to make that change within the app too.""

For now air and hotel are the focus; Elude will add activity and experience content at a later date. ""We're going to keep it very simple in the beginning"" he said. ""We just want to get people out and going."" The third component is direct booking via Elude. ""We are actually the merchant of record; we're not pushing you out to someplace else"" said Simon noting that many search engines present users with price quotes and then link them out to other sites for booking — where the price is often different. ""It's been our biggest hurdle but definitely what we're most excited about."" Sites like Skyscanner.com present users with a range of airfare and destination options but then direct them to supplier or online travel agency (OTA) sites for booking. Traditional OTAs like Expedia Priceline and Travelocity meanwhile are destination- and date-based for initial searches rather than budget-focused that Elude incorporates.

Curation and integration are key

For their part the developers of the Una Travel: Vacation Sidekick & Smart Trip Planner — alumni of Intel specializing in A.I. — wanted to create a virtual ""personal assistant who knows you best"" and crafts bespoke itineraries while also allowing collaborative decision-making in a social network style for group trip planning. Bansal at San Diego-based XOKind said Una available at the Apple and Google Play stores addresses ""the travel planning and booking experience being very fragmented and [people] having to use tools — like docs notes and spreadsheets — to collect all the information and collaborate with their co-travelers."" Una quizzes users on destination preferences presenting product and price options and refining future choices as they're given a literal thumbs up or down. Users can sort and filter options and add them to collaborative trip itineraries if planning group travel as well as share notes web links and other data. The app's A.I. comes up with the best matches for all and also pointedly offers info on free activities at chosen locales noted Bansal. ""Other apps tend to focus only on the bookable portions of the trip but we're trying to provide a more sort of holistic perspective on all the things [travelers] could be doing"" he said adding his development team ""thought of Una as being both concierge and travel agent.""

We're not just engineers and designers who haven't paid heed to the customer support piece. Sarah Harris vice president of product at XOKind

To wit Sarah Harris XOKind's vice president of product noted that streamlined user-friendly Una — which should be equally intelligible to Gen Z and baby boomer users alike — will offer ""more [customer service] support than probably the larger OTAs because we know that's such an important element of the travel experience."" ""We're not just engineers and designers who haven't paid heed to the customer support piece"" she added. At press time Una Travel allowed only hotel booking directly on the app while vacation-rentals and activities booking is imminent according to Bansal. Flight ticketing is planned by year-end. Elude based in Los Angeles can be used to book air and hotel travel anywhere out of available U.S. and international destinations by anyone according to Scerbo although content is only available in English at the moment. (The firm is currently using Covid-restrictions data from TripsGuard.com to filter inaccessible or restricted destinations for given users from trip choices offered.) ""With just a couple clicks — when you want to leave and how much you want to spend — you're literally seeing everything you can afford to get to instead of … everything you can't afford to get to"" said Scerbo adding that a user will likely be surprised at what they can actually afford.

XOKind's Una Travel: Vacation Sidekick & Smart Trip Planner is now available in the Google Play and Apple app stores.

Stoutin at The Points Guy said he envisions the TPG App and competitors as ""far beyond simple tools for buying and booking."" ""Travel apps in the new generation are offering up things to do and experience in a contextual just-in-time way"" he said. ""We're making one of our own: an award explorer that lets you see where your points can take you — and in what style — at the speed of your imagination."" The TPG App will pull together users' various loyalty accounts and offer suggestions to build up point balances and book trips. What's more the app will excel at ""discoverability"" Stoutin added. ""You can now go to a new city and with the scan of a QR code or an AppClip get the local scooter rental restaurant menus or cultural experience reservations"" he said. ""Your phone is your boarding pass your room key and your translator.""

Eyes on the future

Both Silicon Valley and Wall Street are taking notice of this new front in travel apps.

Strategic Rationale

Expand footprint in luxury and resort travel : The acquisition will expand Hyatt’s presence in luxury leisure travel and immediately add approximately 100 hotels and a pipeline of 24 executed deals in Europe and the Americas to its portfolio. Following completion of the transaction Hyatt will offer the largest portfolio of luxury all-inclusive resorts in the world will double its global resort footprint will be the largest operator of luxury hotels in Mexico and the Caribbean and will expand its European footprint by 60 percent. The acquisition will extend Hyatt’s brand footprint into 11 new European markets greatly enhancing Hyatt’s growth potential in Europe a critical region for global growth in leisure travel.

Expand platform for growth : ALG’s strong developer and owner base will expand Hyatt’s relationships with deeply committed partners in key complementary geographies. Hyatt’s global network of developers and its operational expertise is expected to further accelerate growth of ALG brands. Hyatt plans to apply the combined strength of the teams to expand beyond ALG’s current pipeline in new geographies in which ALG does not currently have hotels.

Benefit owners : Access to ALG’s owned distribution platforms and its extensive experience in leisure travel are expected to provide significant opportunities for Hyatt’s existing resorts. Owners of AMRTM Collection properties will receive increased access to a much broader collection of brands and the backing of Hyatt’s global distribution sales and marketing.

Increase choice and experiences for guests : The combined resources of ALG and Hyatt will open up expanded offerings and experiences for the benefit of the combined companies' high-end guest and customer base. ALG’s exclusive membership offering Unlimited Vacation Club® will bring more than 110000 highly passionate travelers closer to Hyatt when traveling for a variety of stay occasions apart from vacations. Following completion of the transaction Hyatt will determine ways in which World of Hyatt and Unlimited Vacation Club® can bring added value and unique loyalty benefits to their member bases while benefitting hotel owners.

Enhance end-to-end leisure travel offerings through: ALG Vacations ® as one of the largest packaged tour providers and leisure travel distribution platforms in North America serving Mexico and the Caribbean Amstar a leading destination services management company in Mexico and the Caribbean and its Hawaii-focused counterpart Worldstar and Trisept Solutions ®  its unique leisure travel technology platform.



Accelerate asset-light strategy: The acquisition of ALG’s asset-light business will meaningfully increase the percentage of revenues and earnings Hyatt will generate from fees. Additionally Hyatt anticipates fulfilling its current commitment to sell $1.5 billion of hotel real estate in 2021 resulting in a total of over $3 billion of proceeds realized since the asset-sale strategy was announced in 2017 at a combined multiple of over 17x EBITDA as compared to Hyatt’s original estimate of 13x to 15x. Hyatt is further committing to an additional $2 billion in proceeds from the sale of hotel real estate by the end of 2024.

Financing

At closing Hyatt expects to fund more than 80 percent of the purchase with a combination of $1.0 billion of cash on hand and new debt financings and the remainder with approximately $500 million from equity financing. Hyatt has secured a $1.7 billion financing commitment from J.P. Morgan. Cash proceeds from the $2 billion asset sale program are expected to be used to pay down debt including debt incurred to fund the acquisition. Hyatt is committed to maintaining an investment grade profile and to continue managing the balance sheet prudently after the transaction.

The construction of the 600-square-meter facility on a 16-hectare property overlooking the bay at Brgy. Dulangan was nearly halfway done already last month. With its ongoing construction locals and tourists can soon expect this upcoming premier environmental conservation venue and educational-cultural site in the country.

“It is the first of its kind in Mindoro and will be the physical embodiment of sustainability benefitting present and future generations” said Grace Diamante executive director of Mindoro Biodiversity Conservation Foundation Inc. (MBCFI).

This legacy project will be a focal point for nature preservation efforts and ecological research in the Philippines since MBCFI’s inception in 2008. Its location is strategic as Mindoro is known worldwide as a biodiversity conservation area because of its abundance in endemic species and diversity of habitats which unfortunately are threatened by human activities like poaching and deforestation.

Visitors can enjoy their journey at the MBCC with its many attractions such as a natural history museum; a forest restoration area for native tree species; a Mangyan heritage hall for Indigenous People groups to showcase their culture and products; a research laboratory to assist in the discovery of new species; a Nature Discovery Trail; eco-lodges with glamping areas at the view deck; and even a temporary holding facility for rescued endangered animals.

The facility is in synch with the local government’s One Island approach that considers use of natural resources social programs and economic viability in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

With its sustainability features the MBCC aims to be a green building certified by the International Finance Corp.’s EDGE. It is also expected to help MBCFI continue studies for science-based recommendations to policymakers and conduct information drives through its Conservation Awareness Raising and Education program.

The top executive emphasized that environmental conservation must be prioritized because the constant loss of biodiversity caused by human activities will affect communities with the consequences of climate change like typhoons drought and loss of natural resources.

The Philippines is ranked No. 2 among nations as the most vulnerable to climate change. Oriental Mindoro ranked ninth among the country’s provinces prone to flooding following forestry net loss of nearly 30 percent on the island from 1988 to 2015.

Recently the Department of Science and Technology-MIMAROPA approved the provision of solar panels to help power up the MBCC’s research laboratory. Naming opportunities are also open to help fund other components of the MBCC for posterity."

The wave formed from the convergence of ripples of software and hardware development and testing by geodesists mathematicians and scientists from government academic and commercial entities around the world.

Seeing significant potential benefits in marine and land surveying by leveraging a new constellation of satellites known as the Global Positioning System (GPS) these technology pioneers were pulling in a similar direction in the late 1980s and early 1990s to attain three-dimensional centimeter-accurate kinematic positioning in real time or RTK. This era also brought new GPS signals the launch of more GPS satellites and improved receiver development.

Although these pioneers pursued RTK to improve cumbersome and costly surveying techniques on land and water they didn’t fully imagine the multitude of ways the technology would eventually change the world and make precise positioning available in a growing list of applications.

In this third article on the history of RTK we focus on the most intense period of RTK development a fast-paced and heady time when highly motivated individuals sought to solve integer ambiguities reliably so the system could work dynamically or “on-the-fly” (OTF) a key that would unlock its full potential.

The push to create a working system

Before RTK which processes in real time users could do a continuous kinematic survey logging raw observations from the satellites and then go back to the office and process that data to get centimeter-accurate positions said Mark Nichols general manager at Trimble and one of the company’s early RTK development leaders. “This post-processing step would typically take several hours and generally required some form of static initialization. Sometimes there were so many cycle slips that you could not get a reliable answer.”

In the early 1990s there were simultaneous efforts to develop algorithms to initialize the carrier integer ambiguities while in motion identify and resolve cycle slips automatically and develop the data formats for transmission from a base station to a computing station and formats for real-time processing. The naming conventions had not matured and limited effort was going toward a full system integration.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers launched its high priority multi-year project to develop a complete operational prototype RTK system in 1988 with the goal of vastly improving the economies accuracies and timeliness of dredging and hydrographic surveying in particular to benefit the $400 million annual maintenance of the nation’s waterways.

The Corps’ intent was to develop a prototype system that could be immediately put to work. “We wanted to demonstrate an operational system that could be interfaced to multiple hydrographic and dredging systems run experiments for new applications and develop the geodesy to use GPS for tidal measurements on the survey boat” said Steve DeLoach a civil engineer and land surveyor who led the program for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. “Our goal was to prove the capability to develop the OTF algorithms and data formats and solve problems the industry had not yet recognized.”

When the program was done the hope was that a market would be created and industry would step in and create a more robust reliable and operational toolset DeLoach said. “What we were doing was developing testing publishing—unabashedly putting information out—and hoping the industry would pick it up and they did. They rewrote it changed it commercialized it and made it usable for everybody.”

OTF would open up the use of RTK for marine and machine control while also simplifying the use for surveyors because it automated the initialization without the need for a point of beginning each time the receiver lost lock. It would also provide a data analysis and processing tool to continuously and automatically look for cycle slips repair them and back-process the data for the correct solution—all automatically and processed without operator intervention. With the addition of data transmission between a reference station and the roving station RTK could be realized in a robust way.

Corps sparks flurry of research and testing

To help understand the intricacies of every component of a system and what other groups were doing the Corps asked the University of New Brunswick Canada to conduct a feasibility study in 1988-1989 (described by authors David E. Wells and Alfred Kleusberg). The study found the concepts feasible identified key components and determined that at that time no similar system or work was available.

The Corps then launched several efforts to examine the primary components for the hydrographic surveying and dredging case; a contract with Trimble to conduct a detailed system analysis (described by authors G. Jeffrey Geier Peter V. W. Loomis and Alfred Kleusberg) a contract with Worcester Polytechnic Institute to investigate data link alternatives (described by Per K. Enge and Keith Pflieger) and a contract with the University of Maine to investigate the use of GPS to measure tides by Alfred Leick and Quanjiang Liu.

In May 1991 Dr. Benjamin W. Remondi a GPS technologist for the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) (see History of RTK – Part 2) coined the term “On-The-Fly (OTF)” following many months of trials and updates to his software to allow kinematically collected data to be processed without static initialization. The testing followed the idea of using GPS in non-OTF mode to verify OTF; after all how else would you test a moving system with accuracy at the centimeter level?

Under the careful guidance of Dale Jarvis senior geodetic technician for the Corps many data campaigns were well underway in early 1990 with processing analysis and revision on a continuous cycle. The data would be processed using kinematic techniques and require a static initialization to determine the true antenna trajectory then reprocessed using the OTF algorithms removing any static initialization data.

Data campaigns were aggressive vigorous and often. They ranged from Holloman Air Force Base’s high-speed sled track with its millimeter-level positioning system to a Corps hydrographic survey vessel operating in the Chesapeake Bay to a shopping cart (borrowed from a nearby grocery store) pushed around a paved course by a then-young engineer Bryn Fosburgh now Trimble’s senior vice president.

The Corps also surrounded Remondi with young physicists and computer scientists including Rob Fischer and Jeff Walker to ensure the latest algorithms and search techniques were quickly coded to align with Remondi’s analysis and thoughts. This work is described in “Decimeter Positioning for Dredging and Hydrographic Surveying” by DeLoach and Remondi.

The Corps also worked hard to remain abreast of industry and academic progress. It advertised via a Request for Information offering to pay for OTF solutions and design review of their systems’ design alternatives. The data collections and processing with Remondi’s software the academic studies and the design review all helped the Corps make development decisions that recognized what was occurring within the industry and academic world.

Only two entities responded to the RFI: Magnavox and the University of the Federal Armed Forces in Munich. At that time Magnavox was not able to deliver operational software although Dr. Ron Hatch—who had a 50-year career in satellite navigation systems with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and companies including Boeing Magnavox and John Deere—proved to be a valuable colleague and thought leader on the subject DeLoach said.

In 1991 Dr. Herbert Landau now vice president of GNSS technology at Trimble was heading a lab at the Institute for Earth Surveying and Navigation at the University of the Federal Armed Forces in Munich. Working under Dr. Günter W. Hein Landau and Hans-Juergen Euler published “A System for Precise Real-Time Differential GPS Positioning in the Decimeter Range” presented at the June 1991 Institute of Navigation annual meeting. It was based on six-channel low-cost C/A code receivers reaching accuracies in the decimeter range in real-time and in the centimeter range for post-mission. The receivers were controlled by separate processors which were communicating via a radio link in the UHF band. This team presented OTF software and further design review comments to the Corps under the RFI.

Project moves toward implementation

By early 1991 the first phase of the Corps’ Dredging Research Program was complete and successful. It showed encouraging results from actual OTF data collection and testing campaigns; a complete system definition was in place; and the idea of using RTK GPS for tidal datum measurement on a survey vessel had been validated. During the summer of 1991 the team continued experimentation now including a second OTF software from the University in Munich. This work led to Phase 2 of the project to develop proper guidance for the ultimate users and to define operational criteria in the marine environment. Remondi continued updating his algorithms with every test.

At the time other researchers including Hatch also were making great progress. Dr. Peter Teunissen of Delft University of Technology The Netherlands was explaining how to improve the efficiency and reliability of integer searches. “His contributions were at the highest level” Remondi said. “His ‘LAMBDA method’ was a breakthrough that achieved universal acclaim.”

Both Remondi and Hatch started with a doppler approach to OTF initialization Remondi recalled. “It was not long before that was abandoned for a grid-like search for the ‘best’ integers. This worked very poorly at first because we had only single frequency receivers. Later we added a weak second frequency (half cycle L2 data) and achieved improved results. At this point many were skeptical about searching for integers. This was understandable as better GPS signals and more GPS satellites were needed.”

Soon the development of full-cycle L2 GPS receivers would make searches easier. “Fred Gloeckler (senior electrical engineer at the Corps) was an important contributor as he was both brilliant and insightful” Remondi said. “As our search methods were getting better and our optimism grew regarding better signals and more satellites Steve contracted with John E. Chance to implement RTK for real.”

Trimble’s first commercial RTK system makes its debut

In 1991 Nick Talbot joined Trimble’s engineering team in Sunnyvale California after completing his doctoral thesis—“Real-Time High Precision GPS Positioning Concepts: Modelling Processing and Results”—at RMIT University Melbourne Australia which followed completion of his degree in surveying.

“I’d read many times with great interest Ben Remondi’s Ph.D. thesis” Talbot said. “Ben developed theoretical techniques for post-processing GPS data to produce centimeter-level baseline vectors over long range. His research laid the groundwork for centimeter-level GPS positioning.”

Although Remondi’s well-known thesis only dealt with static GPS data post-processing he later published papers discussing the possibility of producing results in real time Talbot notes.

During his early employment at Trimble Talbot began working on the company’s first RTK product and was responsible for the algorithmic aspect of the development together with Dr. Timo Allison who had been with Trimble from the start and had developed the positioning engine in the very first Trimble GPS products. Allison was also responsible for signal tracking firmware. Other members of the RTK development team worked on GPS receiver data communications and the data collector communication interface.

The resulting product Trimble’s Site Surveyor RTK system was based on the 4000SSE receiver. The 4000SSE receiver represented a major reduction in size and power consumption compared with earlier models and this enabled it to be easily carried in a backpack. Importantly the 4000SSE used a new digital signal processor the Maxwell chip that delivered high quality dual-frequency measurements that would become an enabler for robust OTF real-time kinematic.

Corps partners with JECA on final steps to working system

In the 1980s marine positioning remained a tough risky and expensive endeavor which Kurt Maynard knew first-hand from his research and development role for John E. Chance & Associates (JECA) founded in 1957 by its namesake a surveyor who had worked in the Texas oil industry.

“We used everything we could use because positioning was not like it is today” said Maynard now of Trimble. During that era of oil-field navigation the best positioning accuracy was several meters in real time. “You couldn’t go down the street and grab a survey point and start your survey.”

Maynard became part of the Corps’ RTK project when DeLoach hired JECA for its history of developing real-time satellite-based positioning and communications systems and using those tools on board their own fleet of ships to support the Gulf of Mexico oil industry.

JECA initially relied on systems such as Loran-C or Raydist which had limited accuracy but was able to develop its own ‘GPS like’ system Starfix which was basically GPS on HBO satellites. JECA also owned the database for oil leases and pipeline locations in the Gulf of Mexico. “Any time an oil company wanted to drop an anchor or drill a well they had to call JECA to provide positions for their ships” DeLoach said “and JECA designed and built Starfix for that purpose.”

This relationship between JECA and the Corps enabled both entities to innovate Maynard said because “they had things we needed and we had things they needed and we’d work together on different contracts.” The Corps was interested in Starfix because it was much better than land-based line-of-sight positioning systems. And while Starfix didn’t have the potential of GPS for centimeter-level positioning its designers (including Maynard) had the magic of transmitting data between land stations and ships and computing positions in real time “and we needed that expertise on our team” DeLoach said.

The Corps in turn “brought the algorithms to actually do the task of OTF-RTK with three-dimensional accuracies at the centimeter level” Maynard said. But for the Corps “it needed to be real time and it needed to be one program that ran on a laptop that could be used in the field.”

In addition Gloeckler who served as chair of the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) differential carrier phase working group collaborated with Hatch Hein and Remondi to develop the data standard for transmission of the signals from a base station to allow OTF-RTK to occur.

Research with JECA puts prototype over finish line

The movement of the post-processing versions of the software onto a real-time platform and interfacing the hardware components into a working prototype would be a significant challenge. In July 1992 the entire team from the Corps and JECA sequestered itself for a week in a conference room (on the beach) at the Corps Field Research Facility in Duck N.C.

There the team learned each other’s strengths and weakness and who could design and build each component part. Team members also had to establish trust so they could exchange intellectual details of their contributions.

Another meeting soon followed at JECA’s facility in Lafayette La. where Remondi Dr. Dariusz Lapucha and Richard Barker revised the libraries and software for the prototype. Remondi and Lapucha worked for nearly a month in a closed room almost day and night converting the multitude of research software programs into something portable enough to use on a laptop to plug into a Trimble receiver to get RTK out of it Maynard said. The Trimble receivers were used because the Corps already owned them for static geodetic work and Ron Hyatt an original member of Trimble’s executive team had a hand-shake deal with DeLoach providing the internal device code to the team—with nothing asked in return.

“Everybody wanted it” Maynard said. “I think it was about a two-to three-month period to blend it into a working system. The working system consisted of a laptop computer a Trimble 4000 receiver and a radio communication link that would take the raw data from a base station to the user to be able to do real-time kinematic.”

Use of the system began sometime around March 1993 with demonstrations on the Corps’ survey vessels Adams in Norfolk Gillette in Wilmington and Hickson in Portland. These and many other tests—including important vertical accuracy checks on the Adams during a full tidal cycle—proved the system worked.

“The experience we have with the OTF system over the last few months has convinced us that we can obtain centimeter level accuracy in real time with current GPS receiver and computer hardware using the software developed for this project” wrote the project team in “Results of Real-Time Testing of GPS Carrier Phase Ambiguity Resolution On-The-Fly” for the Institute of Navigation Satellite Division’s 6th International Technical Meeting in September of 1993.

“As soon as we had the prototype OTF-RTK system working we immediately began demonstrating the system on hydrographic survey boats” DeLoach said “and working on photogrammetric aircraft an R&D project with Caterpillar and working out the geodesy for real-time tides.”

The S&P 500 value stock index which is relatively heavily weighted in shares of financials energy firms and other economically sensitive companies is up 5.5% from last month's lows outperforming its tech-heavy counterpart by more than a percentage point in a rally that accelerated over the past week. The value index is up 18% this year despite stalling after a strong start to 2021.

The move may herald a nascent comeback for the so-called reflation trade a bet on rebounding economic growth that saw value stocks surge starting late last year alongside Treasury yields. Yields have climbed this time around as well with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury which moves inversely to prices up about 20 basis points since last week to 1.36% before pulling back on Friday. “I do think the value is somewhat of a coiled spring” said Matt Peron director of research at Janus Henderson Investors who believes value could outperform for at least the next six months. “I do think it has another run left in it.”

Investors pointed to several reasons for value's rosier outlook. While the rise in coronavirus cases spurred by the Delta variant remains a wildcard signs that infections may be slowing in Europe and parts of the United States could mean that the lockdowns required last year will not be needed for the foreseeable future Peron said. At the same time some investors believe growth will remain strong in the U.S. even after peaking in the second quarter. U.S. gross domestic product is expected to rise 6.1% in 2021 and 4.8% in 2022 according to Oxford Economics stronger than what annual growth has been for the past decade.

""We haven’t seen growth rates this high in some time and that’s why we think ... value can keep outperforming even once the rate of growth peaks"" said Sameer Samana senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Among those calling for more gains in value stocks are technical strategists at JPMorgan who in the past week said the S&P 500 value index ""looks poised for a breakout."" Trust Advisory Services on Wednesday said it expects more upside for value over the next 12 months given the still strong economic outlook and weak earnings trends for tech compared to the broader market.

Since the 10-year yield made a recent bottom last week the S&P 500 value index has climbed 2.4% against a 0.5% rise for its growth counterpart. The value stock bounce comes as investors digest data from the past week showing a potential peak in inflation while looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium at the end of the month. That event or the central bank's next policy meeting in September could offer signals on when it will begin unwinding the $120 billion a month government bond-buying program that has helped support asset prices.

Next week the monthly U.S. retail sales report and earnings from retailers such as Walmart and Target could shed more light on the health of the consumer. Investors are also keeping a close eye on Treasury yields with rising yields often viewed as a sign of economic optimism that could also boost value stocks. Higher yields also particularly benefit the profit margins of banks which tend to make up large portions of value indexes.

Plenty of stumbling blocks remain for the value trade. Signs that the coronavirus is threatening the economic outlook could send investors back toward large technology and growth shares that performed well for much of 2020. Data on Friday showing that consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in a decade weighed on yields. Treasury yields have also experienced several sharp swings this year wrongfooting investors. Yields on the 10-year fell to about 1.13% as recently as Aug. 4 -- some 65 basis points below the year's highs.

Many investors may also be reluctant to overly reduce positions in growth stocks which dominated for much of the decade following the 2007-2009 financial crisis while value shares languished. “It is this epic battle back and forth between these two parts of the market"" said Matthew Miskin co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.

The regulator said the company did not comply with reporting and recordkeeping obligations for its grains cash positions and that it exceeded the regulator’s position limits for soybean meal futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade.

The CFTC settled charges with the food company it said. The penalty Tyson has to pay is a civil monetary penalty. The company did not admit or deny any of the findings in the CFTC’s order.

According to the CFTC its order found that over a five-year span that ended this past January Tyson held CBOT soybean meal futures positions that were more than the then-applicable federal position limits. This occurred on over 590 dates the CFTC said its order found.

The CFTC’s order also found that over about a four-and-a-half-year span that ended August of last year the company filed incorrect statements of cash positions in grain.

The company also didn’t maintain certain cash transactions records associated with futures positions that were over the position limits the CFTC said its order found. That violated the then-applicable recordkeeping requirements according to the regulator.

“We are pleased to have resolved this matter with the CFTC under its civil enforcement authority” Tyson said in an emailed statement.

Wearing a blue Panama City Beach shirt and a beige Columbia hat the farmer's son from Shelbyville smiled in his Facebook profile photo.

A smile that his mother Christy West Warner will never get to see again.

On Friday a Metro Nashville Water crew found the 22-year-old's body in West Nashville near the 400 block of 35th Avenue North. Metro police detectives believe Will Warner was driven to the area shot to death and left in the street.

Authorities arrested a 25-year-old man in Bedford County for questioning about the killing on Sunday night the Metro Nashville Police Department reported. The man was also wanted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation in another shooting in Bedford County.

News of her son's death reached Christy West Warner around noon Friday. Will Warner did not check in for the entire morning. The family knew something was wrong.

""It's like I had an out-of-body experience. I just collapsed"" she recalled. ""My whole world was broken into a million pieces.""

'He was just larger than life'

For the mother Will Warner — the elder of two sons — always brought her joy. The family raises chickens for Tyson Foods and Will Warner would always help breed cattle and grow row crops she said. As a kid he loved riding on the four-wheelers and playing in the creek and mud.

""Every second I stayed with Will was a joy"" she said. ""He was just larger than life. He was just a good boy. He was so personable.""

Will Warner's uncle Tennessee state Rep. Todd Warner R-Chapel Hill described his nephew as a ""typical country boy.""

""(He) loved life and loved people"" he said. ""It's just a tragic ending to something that should've never happened.""

Christy West Warner said her son enjoyed the outdoors. He enjoyed hunting she said especially turkeys. In photos he posted online Will Warner often would dress up in camouflage and show off his fresh game for victory shots.

When her son's body arrived back home Christy West Warner could not even see it.

The body has decomposed so much she said the family had to scramble to bury him Sunday afternoon.

""I didn't even get to pick the casket out. It was so immediate"" she said. ""We've been robbed of everything. Every last ounce of closure or peace that we could possibly get from saying goodbye we didn't get to do.""

Financial institutions are grabbing for a piece of the booming $2 trillion cryptocurrency market with 13 of the world's largest banks pushing roughly $3 billion in funding so far into cryptocurrency and blockchain companies according to analytics company Blockdata.

The data firm in an updated report this week published a list of 13 banks that lead in terms of size of funding rounds as a proxy of investment into the crypto space saying it used that measure as banks participated in funding rounds with multiple or many other investors.

London-based Standard Chartered leads the list with $380 million in valuation of the funding rounds in which it participated while its London-based rival Barclays ranked as the most active investor based on the number of investments in blockchain companies.

Blockdata found that 55% of the world's 100 biggest banks by assets under management are investing directly or indirectly in companies and projects related to digital currencies and blockchain.

The traditionally in-person relationships with banks have been permanently altered by the pandemic resulting in a hybrid future for the industry that looks more flexible – both for both customers and employees – than in the past.“We’ve been as agile as possible trying to adapt and put client safety and employee safety at the top of our priority list. But the pandemic has also allowed for us to really become more innovative on how we interact with our customers” Hamed Tavajohi Los Angeles market leader for U.S. Bank said. “I would say how we’ve evolved over the past 18 months at U.S. Bank that probably would have been a five-year process under normal circumstances.”The bank recently reopened a newly remodeled branch at 14500 Roscoe Blvd. in Panorama City. It features a “digital discovery center” where bankers can demonstrate the bank’s mobile app and a video capability to see the banker for Zoom-like interactions.“In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the branch incorporates design changes focused on protecting the health of customers and employees including plexiglass barriers anti-microbial surfaces and signage to encourage social distancing” the bank said in a statement.Seven additional remodels at other Los Angeles County branches including one in Sylmar are currently underway.Fintech upgradeU.S. Bank and Wells Fargo & Co. as well as other regional banks and credit unions have invested heavily in upgrading financial technology over the course of the pandemic. In addition to developing the capacity to host virtual consulting appointments and creating digital tools for sending cashiers checks major banks have worked to create hybrid work arrangements at local branches. For employees this means a portion of jobs will remain fully remote as some basic in-branch services shift to digital kiosks and online transactions. For consumers more services are available through apps and specialty advisors remain present in the office for drop-in and appointment consultations.“We have rolled out what we call the interactive teller machines which is think of a very enhanced ATM that allows you to pay bills to cash checks and to get multiple denominations” Tavajohi said. “So if somebody wants to come and do that transaction they can go to the ATM. If they’re looking for advice or guidance – from retirement to helping their small business to applying for a mortgage – having that one-on-one interaction and allowing space for that is really important to us.”At Wells Fargo as well as smaller financial institutions such as Premier America Credit Union headquartered in Chatsworth and Bank of Santa Clarita similar physical and digital improvements have been made over the last 18 months including multiple rounds of digital app updates.“We have continually invested in two key areas the first being our digital capabilities” said Robin Choi region bank president of Wells Fargo. “We’ve added functionalities that didn’t exist before simply because so many of our customers simply did not or could not come into our branches. … The second area where we’re investing a lot of energy is a lot of customers are still coming into the branches but they’re coming into branches for different things. For a lot of the transactional visits our mobile platform is able to address pretty much all of them but they are coming in for deeper conversations. So we’ve been spending a lot of time delivering new training new content that goes a little bit deeper into aspects of one’s financial future so that we can do a better job setting our customers up on a proper path that they can be successful.”Community outreachBoth Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank representatives said their institutions have invested significantly in programs to increase financial literacy and promote volunteerism among bank employees. U.S. Bank will make a $5000 donation to Plummer Elementary School to design and install murals throughout the North Hills campus at the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year. The bank also plans to collaborate with Plummer Elementary’s Parent Center to provide financial literacy courses in English and Spanish. The school donation program is in conjunction with the Panorama City branch reopening.Wells Fargo has launched its National Unbanked Advisory Taskforce as well as financial literacy courses in local communities to improve banking service for traditionally underserved populations.While the pandemic highlighted the role of banking professionals and the need for responsive service Choi said the last year has underscored the importance of community-focused banking and the strength of essential workers.“I’m sure that my colleagues at the banks will share the same sentiment but as a leader in a very essential role within the banking industry we were open throughout the pandemic. We remain open for our customers and our employees have been customer-facing the whole time” Choi said. “I don’t even know that the word inspiring can fully capture the sentiment that I have inside how employees across the service industry rose to the challenge of COVID-19 and everything else that has happened over the course of these last 18 months. To me it speaks to the best aspects of the human spirit.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdG9yeWxpbmVzLWZvci1maXJzdC1taW5uZXNvdGEtdmlraW5ncy1wcmVzZWFzb24tZ2FtZdIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdG9yeWxpbmVzLWZvci1maXJzdC1taW5uZXNvdGEtdmlraW5ncy1wcmVzZWFzb24tZ2FtZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Storylines for first Minnesota Vikings preseason game,"article

The Minnesota Vikings host the Denver Broncos Saturday afternoon in the first preseason game for both teams at U.S. Bank Stadium but it certainly won’t have the feel of an exhibition game.

For the first time since Dec. 29 2019 there will be thousands of football fans inside the home for Vikings football. The team played in front of no fans in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here are a few storylines to monitor as the Vikings enter the preseason. You can get ready for Saturday’s game by watching Vikings Gameday Live at 1:30 p.m. on Fox 9.

MINIMAL PLAYING TIME FOR STARTERS

Mike Zimmer made it clear earlier this week that starters will get minimal playing time if any in the first preseason game. Kirk Cousins may get one series but you likely won’t see Dalvin Cook or Justin Jefferson play against the Broncos. Starters who need live reps the most will likely get them in the second preseason game against Indianapolis. It’ll be a big day for Jake Browning who will get plenty of snaps to try and show he can be the No. 2 quarterback.

The Vikings released a list of players not expected to see the field Saturday about 90 minutes before kickoff and it was 31 players deep with mostly offensive and defensive starters.

OFFENSIVE LINE INJURIES

Christian Darrisaw won’t play Saturday after having a ""minor procedure"" done earlier this week on a core injury. The team still hopes he’ll be ready for Week 1 but that’s a major question mark with a month to go. Rashod Hill got banged up in Thursday’s practice so he’s unlikely to play. Look for Oli Udoh Dakota Dozier and others battling for offensive line spots to get significant playing time Saturday.

NO FAN RESTRICTIONS AT U.S. BANK STADIUM

After having no fans last year there are no fan limits or restrictions as U.S. Bank Stadium gets ready to unofficially kick off the NFL season. The Vikings had a little more than 5000 fans at last Saturday’s practice and there should be thousands more at the first preseason game. Fans in attendance are not required to wear face coverings but they are encouraged to do so when not eating or drinking per CDC guidelines. There are also sites outside the stadium for fans wanting to walk-up and get vaccinated for COVID-19. Fans are not required to be vaccinated to attend U.S. Bank Stadium.

FIRST LOOK AT REVAMPED DEFENSE

We don’t know how much the first-team defense will actually play but Saturday will provide the first potential look at it. Zimmer said this offseason there could be as many as eight new starters when Week 1 kicks off. Danielle Hunter is back healthy and Dalvin Tomlinson Michael Pierce and Sheldon Richardson have been added to the defensive line. There’s a battle for a third linebacker behind Anthony Barr and Eric Kendricks and the secondary will have a new look with Patrick Peterson Mackensie Alexander and Bashaud Breeland and Xavier Woods added at safety.

The Vikings and Broncos kickoff the preseason at 3:05 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcmtyYXBpZHNlbnRlcnByaXNlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvdmlraW5ncy1mYW5zLXJldHVybi1hbmQtbGVhdmUtbW9zdC1vZi10aGVpci1tYXNrcy1hdC1ob21l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vikings fans return and leave most of their masks at home,"MINNEAPOLIS -- If purple face paint could deter the spread of a virus there would be a few more Minnesota Vikings fans who are protected from COVID and its annoying cousin Delta after the team's preseason opener.

On a perfect sunny summer Saturday afternoon the Vikings reopened U.S. Bank Stadium -- including those massive glass doors that face the downtown Minneapolis skyline -- to a full contingent of fans for the first time since before the word “pandemic” entered the American lexicon.

While nearly all concessions and security personnel inside the glass-topped coliseum wore masks that was not at all the case for the actual crowd of maybe 40000 (they distributed 66000-plus tickets) who chose to spend this afternoon watching exhibition football in person. A lap of the stadium’s main-level concourse 90 minutes before kickoff revealed an unofficial unmasked-to-masked ratio of roughly 700-to-1.

With the Vikings getting blown out 33-6 on the field it looked like the only ones maintaining a six-foot distance were members of the home team's offensive line from the Denver defenders they were supposed to be blocking.

One of the rare masked fans asked about their face covering politely declined to talk about it or cough up their name and vaccination status. Ditto for one or two folks that were masked among the few hundred Broncos fans in attendance who look like they either belong in the Mile High City or in a northern Minnesota deer stand based on their bright orange apparel.

There were COVID warning posters encouraging distancing and stating that you should stay home if not feeling well. (If you are here reading this it’s too late.) There were a few of those purple “stand here” circles on the floor near concession stands which were thoroughly ignored by those waiting in line while seeking a $12 can of imported beer. At least one Vikings official once he slipped his mask off was all smiles.

""We've been looking to figure out a way to welcome back our fans for a little over a year now. Opening the gates today and having this kind of crowd come in for a preseason game is truly special and a reflection on what kind of passion Vikings fans have"" said Andrew Miller the team's chief operating officer.

Perhaps the most notable person in a mask on Saturday afternoon was Vikings star running back Dalvin Cook who did not play in the game but moseyed onto the field during warmups in his uniform (sans shoulder pads). His face was covered by a black mask and his abundant hair was up in what looked akin to a chef’s hat with a Vikings logo on it.

A few dozen rows of seats up from Cook beneath the stadium’s massive south video board one fan walking by wearing a mask looked to be about 12. He wore a Green Bay Packers T-shirt and he had a bright red cloth covering over his nose and mouth. It was a slightly odd sight at a Vikings-Broncos game but nothing we haven’t come to expect from that “interesting” NFL fan base in Wisconsin. The mask-free masses didn’t blink when the public address announcer issued a reminder that the CDC has encouraged mask wearing indoors regardless of vaccination status.

Asked about the relative dearth of masks among the audience Miller noted that the team is encouraging attendees to follow the CDC guidelines and that COVID vaccinations were available on the plaza outside the stadium before the game.

Unlike Texas and Florida in the north the vaccination rates are higher and while there are still reports of hospitalizations -- including very rarely among the vaccinated -- there seems to be a sense of getting back to “normal” life here. That maybe means more football fans in Minnesota willing to take a little risk to watch sports in the sunshine even if those UV rays are coming through a massive skylight.

""It's absolutely amazing to hear crowd noise again"" Miller said.

To be fair the biggest cheers of the day came for Olympic gold medal wrestler Gable Steveson when he was introduced before the game and for former Vikings star Teddy Bridgewater when he came in to play quarterback for Denver. But as the Broncos stampeded to a blowout win in a stadium that was maybe half full it felt like another step in the return to some kind of pre-pandemic life.

It was clear that the vast majority of fans both in orange and in purple were primarily thinking potential Super Bowl before thinking potential super-spreader.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9ncmVnLWpvc2VwaC1wcm92aWRlcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWZldy1icmlnaHQtc3BvdHMtZm9yLXZpa2luZ3MtaW4tcHJlc2Vhc29uLW9wZW5lci82MDAwODc5Njgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greg Joseph provides one of the few bright spots for Vikings in preseason opener,"At least the kicker didn't miss.

In an otherwise utterly awful Vikings preseason opener journeyman Greg Joseph didn't add to coach Mike Zimmer's considerable postgame angst. He nailed field goals from 34 and 25 yards as the Vikings — sans 21 starters and 31 players overall — were thumped by the Broncos 33-6 at U.S. Bank Stadium on Saturday.

Unfortunately for Zimmer's blood pressure the news wasn't all good on special teams. Trying to resurrect one of the league's worst units under new coordinator Ryan Ficken the Vikings gave up a 62-yard kickoff return struggled per usual in the return games and lost promising rookie fourth-round draft pick Kene Nwangwu to a knee injury after a game-opening 18-yard kickoff return.

Even veteran punter Britton Colquitt drew Zimmer's ire with duds of 35 and 36 yards and an ugly 44-yarder that had a fortunate roll.

""Three very poor punts"" Zimmer said of Colquitt's four attempts which also included a 48-yarder.

Asked if it was just a bad day for Colquitt or reason for concern Zimmer essentially put Colquitt's employment status on notice.

""It's cause for concern"" Zimmer said.

K.J. Osborn and rookie Ihmir Smith-Marsette each returned two kickoffs. Osborn had returns of 20 and 31 yards the latter of which came 6 yards deep in the end zone and didn't reach the 25. Smith-Marsette had an ugly 12-yard return in which he slipped and a decent 30-yarder to the 32.

Veteran Ameer Abdullah had the only punt return a 6-yarder reminiscent of last year's weak returns. He also had a fair catch.

Joseph with his sixth team in four years has played only 16 NFL games none since 2019 and his only field goal attempts came in 2018 when he made 17 of 20 for Cleveland.

Undrafted rookie kicker Riley Patterson did not play.

Mond needs to 'get moving'

Third-round draft pick Kellen Mond played like a rookie quarterback who missed 10 days of practice with COVID-19 and was in just his third day in pads since the Senior Bowl.

""He was OK"" Zimmer said. ""He used his legs a couple of times. He just has to get moving a little quicker. Everything is like in slow motion with him.""

Mond replaced starter Jake Browning and completed only six of 16 passes for 53 yards and a 47.1 passer rating. He also ran five times for 25 yards.

Mond led the Vikings to both field goals. At the end of the first half he ran for 8 yards on second-and-6 from the Denver 14.

The Vikings had a timeout left but didn't use it. It took Mond and the offense 24 seconds to get lined up. That left time for only two hurried throws before settling for the field goal.

""I think I heard a play in the huddle and we ended up changing it"" said Mond adding that it's the coaching staff's decision to call a timeout there.

Mond also said getting everyone lined up ""is one on me but our whole entire offense has to understand we have to get lined up quicker.""

Zimmer sits 21 starters

Zimmer sat every current starter on the roster except defensive end Stephen Weatherly. Weatherly jumped offsides on an incompletion on third-and-4. Later another veteran Jalyn Holmes lined up offsides on third-and-2.

Included in the 31 Vikings who sat out were the top three defensive tackles top three cornerbacks three of the top four receivers the top two left tackles top two running backs and top two tight ends.

Rose doesn't wilt

Nwangwu's injury put undrafted rookie running back A.J. Rose Jr. in a showcase position. With Dalvin Cook and Alexander Mattison being held out and the seven-year veteran Abdullah as the only other healthy running back Rose got 26 touches.

He had 25 carries for 100 yards. He also caught one pass for a team-leading 18 yards.

""I didn't see the 25 carries coming"" Rose said. ""The opportunity presented itself and you have to make the most of it. I believe I made plays when my number was called.""

As for Nwangwu Zimmer said he doesn't expect the injury to be serious.

Also injured was linebacker Cam Smith who suffered a concussion early in the second quarter and didn't return. Smith started and had one tackle in his first live action since open-heart surgery to repair a bicuspid aortic valve defect last August.

Teddy gets loudest cheer

It's not saying much but the loudest cheer of the day came when former Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater entered the game early in the second quarter.

Bridgewater locked in a battle for the starting position with Drew Lock completed seven of eight passes for 74 yards one touchdown no picks and a 144.8 passer rating. Lock completed five of seven passes for 151 yards two touchdowns no interceptions and a 153.3 rating."

Cutler best known for his eight seasons with the Chicago Bears and for his failed marriage to reality TV star Kristin Cavallari said the food delivery service pulled out of the deal because its “views aren’t aligned” with Cutler’s recent statements.

The former athlete teased a potential campaign to run for his school board in tweets as well.

“Lost a commercial with Uber eats partnering with the NFL. Was going to film in LA ‘views aren’t aligned.’ Guess they don’t like future School board members. Frees up my weekend” Cutler tweeted on Friday.

Cutler has tweeted in support of anti-mask protests by parents in Williams County Tennessee posted by Clay Travis of outkick.com.

Jay shrugged off the move by Uber Eats quipping “tend to cook at home anyway.”

He appears to be seriously considering a potential run for his local school board in Williamson County.

Uber in a statement to The Post on Sunday said it prefers to work with individuals who support its work in helping people get vaccinated.

“We are proud of all the work Uber has done over the last year to help get as many people vaccinated as possible. As such we prefer to partner with those who support that work” a spokeswoman said.

Uber has pledged 10 million free rides to individuals to vaccination sites.

Mask mandates have spurred debates and protests all over the country some of which have become violent including in Los Angeles when a clash between two groups left one victim stabbed outside city hall on Saturday.

Recently retired NFL quarterback Jay Cutler was fired from an Uber Eats ad campaign after his opposition to compulsory face mask rules for children in schools emerged.

The 39-year-old who played primarily for the Chicago Bears during his 12 seasons in the league had criticized school boards’ strict mask rules for children and claims they cost him a good job.

'Lost a commercial with Uber eats partnering with the NFL. Was going to film in LA 'views aren't aligned.' Guess they don't like future School board members. Frees up my weekend' Cutler's tweet read suggesting that he will use the time he'd have spent on his Uber deal researching how to join his local school board to push back against the face covering rule.

Cutler from Nashville in Tennessee has recently voiced his support of parents such as OutKick founder Clay Travis. He went viral with a video where he confronted the Williamson County School Board speaking of the 'absurdity of in schools' at a tense Tennessee school board meeting on Tuesday.

Travis cited CDC data that shows children are mostly safe from serious COVID effects Fox News reported on Thursday.

'The anti mask at schools revolution is underway in Tennessee. These are the people who couldn’t get in the meeting tonight. They’ve never seen a crowd this big before for a school board meeting' Travis' tweet read which Cutler had retweeted last week.

Cutler had originally been involved with the Uber Eats commercial which was a partnership with the NFL

'Let’s be clear. No one wants to go to a school board meeting. So this speaks volumes' the former NFL star had captioned the Travis retweet.

While Uber avoided specifically mentioning Cutler a spokesperson for the rideshare giant told DailyMail.com that they are only looking to work with those who are pro-vaccination and whose views on COVID-19 reflect those of the company.

'We are proud of all the work Uber has done over the last year to help get as many people vaccinated as possible. As such we prefer to partner with those who support that work' an Uber spokesperson told DailyMail.com.

Supporters and critics alike took to social media to comment on Cutler's firing from the Uber Eats/NFL ad campaign partnership.

'Isn’t that a form of discrimination?' Mark Panozzo questioned.

'Shouldn’t they be more tolerant of different views? Isn’t that what true tolerance is?' another person tweeted.

'Good riddance to Uber Eats!' another offered in support of Cutler.

Not everyone shared Cutler's stance on mask mandates in schools with some criticizing Cutler's 'anti-science' stance.

'Cry me a river. Maybe you can clutch your Mike Lindell pillow and scream about how unfair it is to be you. Enjoy your new found free time this weekend turn on the Bears game and see the guy we’ve been waiting for in Chicago forever' David Schultz tweeted to the former quarterback.

'It’s amazing that researchers who spend there whole career studying infectious disease and viruses say that wearing a mask helps but you know more than them and think that mask mandates in schools are 'ridiculous' because you did some googling and figured it all out. Go Bears!' one person tweeted to Cutler.

Let’s be clear. No one wants to go to a school board meeting. So this speaks volumes. https://t.co/MzeLKhdWor — Jay Cutler (@JayHasTweets) August 11 2021

A number of passionate parents who are battling with their local school boards have captured national attention over the last week.

Parents and anti-mask protesters have been filmed squaring up to those in favor of masks - including doctors and nurses called to offer expert guidance at these meetings - in hair-raising footage posted online.

Cutler a father of three has been vocal in his support against school mask mandates which caught the attention of his corporate sponsors who may or may not agree with his stance.

Uber's sacking of Cutler appears to fall in line with corporate efforts to keep conservative politics out of their orbit.

Pundits also noted the former NFL star's work with pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly which has worked with children struggling with diabetes since 2009.

Diabetics and children in particular have been especially impacted with increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Meanwhile Cutler didn't seem to mind parting ways with Uber Eats nor did he seem to pay any attention to critics.

'Doing school board research. Looks like a 2024 campaign for me' he posted in response to the backlash.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL21lZGlhLWFuYWx5c2lzL2pheS1jdXRsZXItZHJvcHBlZC1mcm9tLXViZXItcHJvbW8tb3Zlci1oaXMtc3RhbmNlLWFnYWluc3QtbWFza2luZy1jaGlsZHJlbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jay Cutler Dropped From Uber Promo Over His Stance Against Masking Children,"Jay Cutler retired from the NFL to embrace a new position: man of the people.

The unapologetic former quarterback — lauded for his strong arm and remarkable dude energy — announced that he has been pulled from an Uber-NFL promotional campaign after voicing his opinions on school boards' strict mask mandates on children.

Cutler has quoted videos of passionate parents — including OutKick founder Clay Travis' grilling of the Williamson County Board on Tuesday — fighting for their children's right to forego masks and additional PPE in the classroom setting. All based on the CDC data that supports children's safety from serious COVID effects.

This week has seen a number of fired up speeches on behalf of parents who are determined to battle science-less decisions from school boards. Cutler a father of three has been supportive in the fight against mask mandates landing him in some hot water with corporations that are monitoring behavior in order to retain their monopoly of opinions.

The decision from Uber was a clear play at keeping the right politics on board rather than allowing for a diversity of opinion across their promotions.

As talking heads critique Cutler for ""anti-science"" remarks his work alongside pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has helped support children struggling with diabetes — a demographic heavily impacted by COVID-19 — since 2009. Cutler has also participated in Dedicated to Diabetes and is the founder of the Jay Cutler Foundation which has aided at-risk youth struggling in and out of high schools.

As data surrounding the dangers of COVID among children prove that the virus and all of its iterations are less lethal when compared to typical flu seasons companies like Uber willingly avoid the data in order to make examples out of differing opinions. Which doesn't appear to be working.

Thankfully Cutler doesn't give an eff about Uber's opinions — also adding ""Future School board member"" to his Twitter bio.

Cutler's opinions on masking children were called out by Keith Olbermann meaning the former QB must have said something right.

Cutler's response:

The class action certified by Justin Paul Perell in a decision released late Thursday afternoon stems from a court filing made by Samfiru Tumarkin LLP and Uber Eats courier David Heller in 2017.

The law firm and the Ontario man's class action argues that Uber couriers should be entitled to minimum wage vacation pay and other protections because they meet the definition of employees under Ontario's Employment Standards Act.

""Uber has complete control over these drivers when they work how they work what they get paid for the work that they do"" said Samfiru Tumarkin lawyer Samara Belitzky who works in the firm's Ottawa office.

""I could go on and on but there are so many examples of how Uber has this control over these drivers yet the drivers don't have the benefits and the protections that employees would normally have in situations where the employer is in control.""

Uber has long refused to recognize couriers and drivers using its platform as employees and instead likened them to independent contractors because they have the flexibility to drive or deliver as little or as much as they want.

The San Francisco-based technology giant has been fighting the Heller case since it was brought to court five years ago.

It succeeded in getting the case stayed in 2018 because it required all disputes it is involved in go through mediation in the Netherlands where its business was once incorporated.

Uber's Canadian ride-hailing and food-delivery business has since shifted from being based in the Netherlands to Canada and in July started collecting sales tax that will be remitted to the government.

In 2019 the Ontario Court of Appeal reversed the stay Uber obtained so the company took its arguments to the Supreme Court of Canada where it lost later that year.

Class action could have far-reaching consequences

Thursday's certification allows the class action to proceed through Canadian courts again though Uber could appeal the case again on other grounds.

""We'll review the ruling more closely in the coming days"" the company said in a statement.

""We remain focused on creating a better future for app-based workers that provides the flexibility and independence they want with the benefits and protections they deserve.""

If the class action winds up with the drivers winning Belitzky said it will be a ""landmark decision.""

""There's nothing like it in Canada. It will be a first for Canada for sure"" she said.

""It will change the landscape of employment because a lot of these companies including Uber up until now have been able to get away with misclassifying their drivers and so they essentially reap all the benefits now.""

The class action stems from a court filing made by Samfiru Tumarkin LLP and Uber Eats courier David Heller shown here in 2017. (CBC)

Uber skirting Canadian labour law critics say

Uber has been pushing a labour model called Flexible Work+ in Canada in recent months.

The model it is proposing to provinces requires app-based gig employers to accrue self-directed benefit funds that can be dispersed to drivers for prescriptions dental and vision care and provide safety training and tools such as reflective vests.

Uber says it is pursuing the model because an October survey of more than 600 Uber couriers and drivers in Canada showed 65 per cent favoured Flexible Work+. Roughly 16 per cent still like the current independent contractor model and 18 per cent wanted to be classified as employees with benefits.

However many gig workers labour groups and employment lawyers are fighting the proposal because they say it allows Uber to keep treating couriers and drivers unfairly and keeps them in a state of precarity.

Canadian Labour Congress president Bea Bruske hailed the court ruling and said all workers should have workplace protections and benefits.

""For far too long Uber has dictated the terms of workers' employment but hasn't been accountable for providing a minimum wage and vacation pay"" she said in a release.

""Labour law — is the law — and it applies to all companies. Canada's unions support the decision to certify this class action and invite Uber drivers from coast-to-coast to unionize and collectively bargain their rights."""

Why Trust Us?

Nearly every fellow melanin-rich person is familiar with the (sometimes harsh) reality of being genetically predisposed to hyperpigmentation and acne scars.

To be clear acne scars texture and pigmentation are completely normal and natural—but that doesn't make it any more fun to experience. Though my fear of letting people see me without makeup on has faded my thirteen years of acne scars have not.

After about a decade of battling cystic acne-prone skin and the scarring that came with it I've had some help from years of chemical exfoliants retinol-based serums and Vitamin C-packed moisturizers.

The cleansing part of my routine has always been pretty basic. I'm really just looking for something to lightly cleanse or remove makeup without irritating my dry sensitive skin. I thought that's all a cleanser was until I tried the TikTok-viral Urban Skin Rx Cleansing Bar ( ). If the TikTok beauty community was right the cleansing bar was supposed to even out my skin tone for a brighter glowier complexion.

Usually I'm a bit nervous about trying anything in the skincare world that's trendy. As a South Asian woman a lot of brightening products on the mass market aren't catered towards my skin type. But when I saw that nearly every review of the TikTok-viral cleansing bar was by medium to dark-skinned beauty lovers and that Urban Skin Rx's tagline is ""Clinical skincare for diverse skin tones"" I jumped at the chance to try it out.

Here's my honest review:

It didn't strip my dry skin of its natural oils.

As someone with parched dry skin I have a hard time finding cleansers that clean my skin without leaving it parched or stripped of its natural oils. Because this cleanser is in a bar format it doesn't include a lot of added ingredients to make it liquid. In fact two of the first three ingredients in the bar are nourishing coconut oil and moisturizing safflower oil.

Usually I have to overcompensate with a heavy moisturizer after cleansing. But I didn't have that squeaky-dry feeling at all after using this cleansing bar. My skin felt perfectly moisturized and supple after using it.

My skin was glowing after just one use.

I know I know. You're reading that and thinking there's no way that any skincare product could actually work after just one use. As a massive skincare cynic myself I don't blame you. (But at just $15 you don't have much to lose by trying it yourself).

Even though I've been using this cleanser for a month and have been seeing consecutively more impressive results in my skin texture and tone since then I saw a big difference in my skin after just one use. The best part? The radiance (if I do say so myself) that I saw in my skin after the first time I used it one morning lasted the entire day.

Courtesy

Yes the change I saw was probably too subtle for anyone else to notice but I saw fresh acne scars along my jawline completely disappear and then stubborn pigmentation around my mouth brighten immediately. Now that I've been using the bar for a month I've seen some extremely stubborn pigmentation (some scars that I've had for years!) go away.

The bar was fun and easy to use.

If you've already fallen into a TikTok rabbit hole of the countless video reviews this bar has received you'll know that many of them are just of people foaming up the actual bar into an extremely satisfying lather. Essentially the cleanser is formatted in a jar filled with a solid Jell-O-esque substance with a circular sponge on top of it.

You simply run the sponge under water then rub it into the solid product to work up a lather. That part of the process was so calming I'd almost say it was an ASMR-like experience. Afterward rinse the sponge. You can even rinse the solid cleansing bar. (You're welcome germaphobes!).

I use the cleanser twice a day every day—in the morning as a light cleanser and at night after taking off my makeup. I used the Even Tone Cleansing Bar—it's gentle effective and fun to use for all skin types.

The partial reopening of key routes across the North Atlantic and vital transfer hubs in the Middle East is stirring predictions that inter-continental journeys are on their way back from the devastating slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Deutsche Lufthansa was the latest to predict a pickup alongside the loosening of Covid-19 curbs and a mounting vaccine take-up. The German flag carrier said on August 5 that North America could open from late summer with Asia following at the end of the year. On a conference call following second-quarter results chief executive officer Carsten Spohr said he’s encouraged by high levels of interest where travel is allowed.

“While we are waiting for the transatlantic to reopen for Europeans the US point of sale shows very high demand leading the recovery of our long-haul business” Spohr said. He cited visible acceleration in routes to Africa and Central and South America as well as progress fighting the pandemic in Asia. “Our bilateral talks with governments are going well – even India is going well.”

India UAE

In a positive development for long-distance travel the UK announced a further easing of its border curbs. India the United Arab Emirates and Qatar moved to medium-risk status from high risk meaning arrivals will no longer require a hotel quarantine.

India with deep ties to the UK is a major driver for international flights while the Gulf territories are home to major carriers including Dubai’s Emirates the world’s biggest long-haul airline prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Emirates said interest in travel picked up overnight while Qatar Airways said it expects a surge of bookings over coming days.

Air France-KLM chief financial officer Steven Zaat said last week that ticket sales had been “fantastic” in the second quarter while load factors are running at 60 per cent on North Atlantic routes after the European Union opened to American visitors. The group is adding more long-haul routes over the winter including services from Paris to Tanzania Sri Lanka and Oman.

While airlines agree that trends are headed in the right direction the pace of the recovery remains unclear. In contrast to Lufthansa and Air France-KLM British Airways owner IAG SA is keeping a lid on capacity while Rolls-Royce Holdings whose engines power long-haul planes said on August 6 that a cash flow goal for 2022 may be delayed as flying hours fail to rebound fast enough.

“The exact rate and timing of return is out of our control” Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East said on a media call. “We know the underlying demand is there and it’s just a question of when governments are going to put in place the schemes to protect populations but also allow for international travel.”

Delta Variant

The biggest challenge has been the rise of new Covid variants along with a cacophony of changing rules as governments try to stop their spread. This has confused passengers disrupting journeys at times or leaving them fighting for refunds on cancelled trips. The uncertainty has made it difficult for airlines and travellers alike to count on positive developments being sustained.

China for example has imposed new restrictions in a bid to slow a delta-driven outbreak that’s grown to more than 500 cases scattered across half the country. There as in many Asian nations the government has stuck to an aggressive containment playbook.

Nevertheless there is some evidence that governments are starting to coalesce around the common principle of allowing people who have been fully inoculated to enter.

The European Union has made rapid travel gains over summer with its vaccine passport system combined with accelerating shots. France is readying to extend the requirement to all airline travel and high-speed train trips after Air France-KLM said last week that transatlantic trade has picked up with load factors around 60 per cent.

Hong Kong said this week it will allow in vaccinated tourists from all but 10 places in the world from August 9 significantly easing of some of the tightest border curbs anywhere. Visitors from medium-risk nations including the US will be able to enter for the first time since the start of the pandemic – albeit with a stay in a quarantine hotel – while Hong Kong residents from places like the UK and India can return home.

Living with Covid

Just as the virus has become part of everyday life the challenge will be “learning to live with it with international travel as well” UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC radio adding that full vaccination will most likely become a requirement to enter countries in future.

Even the US which has banned most European visitors since last year when the first wave off the virus spread across the region appears to be more open to easing restrictions.

President Joe Biden’s administration may institute a system requiring foreigners to be fully vaccinated before entering the country White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said on Thursday – a move that would eventually replace the country bans started by Donald Trump.

“It seems that a path is opening” French Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said on France Info radio. “This is a happy development and we will continue to work with our US counterparts so it becomes a palpable reality.”

Growing optimism about a long-haul revival comes with shorter flights already on the road to recovery following the earlier easing of domestic and regional travel curbs.

Ryanair Holdings Europe’s biggest low-cost airline said in July it will pump more seats into the market as bookings pick up while rival Wizz Air Holdings aims to return capacity to pre-Covid levels this month becoming one of the first major operators to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,

FedEx



FedEx hit big shippers with a new round of surcharges ahead of the busy holiday season.

The surcharge cycle will start with hikes on the cost for special deliveries but continue with sweeping charges that extend in 2022.

The move comes days after USPS also rolled out holiday surcharges.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

FedEx is gearing up for a busy holiday season after a year of labor shortages and increased demand and to help deal with the rush the shipping and logistics company has rolled out a new round of delivery surcharges.

The main surcharge season kicks in on Nov. 1 with a $1.50-per-piece price hike for FedEx's Ground Economy deliveries. This applies to outbound residential deliveries for small and medium-sized businesses and covers low-weight low-value non urgent deliveries – the majority of typical consumer packages.

This first surcharge expires on November 28 but will be upped to $3 per package the following day and will last until Dec. 12 to compensate for Black Friday and Cyber Monday purchases. The surcharge will then return to the original $1.50 from Dec. 13 to Jan. 16.

The company also announced a 60-cents-per-piece charge starting Jan. 17 2022 for retailers whose shipment volumes qualified for holiday surcharges. So far there is no expected date for the end of this cycle.

The move comes days after the United States Postal Service announced similar price hikes to cover ""extra costs"" that occur during the holidays. FedEx's private carrier competitor United Parcel Service has also rolled out new ""peak"" surcharges.

The new delivery surcharges could add extra pressures to merchants and retailers' operating costs because businesses must either absorb the increases or pass them on to their customers. A spike in transportation costs have pushed consumer prices higher at stores and restaurants as major companies struggle to maintain their margins.

Delivery giants like UPS DHL FedEx and USPS have been slammed by a litany of issues since the start of the coronavirus pandemic last year. With people on lockdown ordering spiked. Meantime as the US economy began to reopen this year companies have dealt with labor shortages including a critical shortage of truck drivers as well as rising fuel and commodity costs.

FedEx has turned to offering pay raises and perks for its current logistics employees. Last year FedEx was forced to place daily package limits on some businesses as its shipping network faces capacity issues around the holidays.

""If we assume that labor's going to stay tight for a prolonged period of time it is absolutely going to be more expensive to ship"" Ravi Shanker a Morgan Stanley analyst previously told Insider.

FedEx did not respond to a request for further comment about the surcharges.

If passed the ballot measure would have paved the way for expanded rent control throughout the state. One leading landlord trade group called the ballot measure “nothing short of an existential threat to the multifamily [landlord] industry.” Worried about Prop 10’s reverberations in their own cities landlords from Chicago New York and elsewhere raised over $70 million to defeat the ballot measure. The landlords ultimately prevailed — after outspending tenant advocates threefold. Why did the prospect of rent control in California strike such expensive fear into the hearts of landlords across the country? For landlords buildings are investments. Sometimes those investments are enormous: the investment firm Blackstone has pivoted to real estate in recent years spending over $11 billion on it in the last three months of 2020 alone. But even on a smaller scale purchasing and maintaining residential property is expensive. Landlords have to pay their mortgages property tax and maintenance staff. Landlords expect a return on this investment and they generally get it. Rents steadily rise over time and generally outpace wages and inflation so owning residential property can be lucrative. Creative landlords can find income streams other than rent as well like selling to speculators when property values rise. Or usually at the lower end of the market they can burn their investment properties and collect the insurance money. Whatever strategy they use landlords turn significant profits on their investments. Since March 2020 sixty-one of America’s richest landlords saw their wealth increase by $24.4 billion. Landlords hate rent control because it interferes with this investment cycle. It limits the rent they can extract from tenants and it limits the control they wield over their properties. Not coincidentally that’s also why rent control is such a good thing for the rest of us.

Rent It’s easy to understand why landlords hate the regulation of rental amounts. In unregulated housing markets landlords can charge whatever they want for rent. When a tenant’s lease is up the landlord can increase the rent by as much as they like. They justify their capacious appetite for higher rents with the standard economics jargon: landlords only charge what the market will bear and housing supply and demand will ultimately balance out. Rent control is good for tenants who get to remain in their communities but bad for opportunistic landlords seeking the highest returns on their investments. The problem is with an essential commodity like housing the market will bear an awful lot. Rental housing in the United States is untenably expensive so much so that it is “literally impossible to afford the rent on minimum wage.” In 2014 almost half of all households paid more than 30 percent of their income (a standard measure of affordability) toward rent. After the economic fallout of the pandemic this figure is likely much higher. Tenants are routinely forced to choose between paying for food medical care or rent. Rent control prevents landlords from squeezing every penny possible from their tenants. It imposes limits on how much a landlord can increase the rent each year. In New York City for example the Rent Guidelines Board generally approves increases in the range of 1 to 2 percent for one-year leases. By ensuring small incremental increases rent control keeps rents lower over time. The median monthly rent in New York’s regulated housing is 31 percent lower than in unregulated housing. Landlords unsurprisingly hate this. “Rent control laws are complete bullshit in NY” one landlord at biggerpockets.com a popular landlord website recently wrote. “We have a tenant that moved in in the 80s and pays $680 a month because we are only allowed to increase her rent by 2% a year. . . . The rest of the apartments [in her building] get above $2200 a month.” Rent control is effective at keeping rents low and this is half the reason landlords want to do away with it.

Control But lower rent increases alone don’t explain the depths of landlord hatred. After all heavily regulated markets like those in New York City San Francisco and Santa Monica remain highly profitable places to own rental housing. Equally important is rent control’s second feature: eviction prevention. In unregulated housing a landlord can terminate a tenancy as soon as the tenant’s lease expires. Landlords do not need to give any reason for the termination and they have almost unlimited prerogative when it comes to eviction. They value this prerogative because it allows them to pivot toward more profitable uses of their investment properties. For instance the Bay Area has seen a massive infusion of real estate capital over the past two decades. Wall Street investors have purchased and renovated thousands of residential units developers have constructed new luxury towers and the city and state have subsidized megaprojects like Oracle Park the stadium where the San Francisco Giants play. Joining this infusion of capital is a glut of high-income families looking to rent or buy property in the city. San Francisco’s landlords can make huge profits by renting to high-income tenants or building luxury housing. The problem from the landlords’ perspective is that the buildings and land they own are not vacant. They are filled with longer-term often lower-income tenants. Without rent control landlords could simply evict those tenants making way for whatever higher-profit use they deem appropriate. Landlords perceive rent control as a threat to their ability to exploit the market for maximum profit — and they are right. Rent control limits this discretion. Tenants in rent-controlled housing are guaranteed renewal leases meaning that their landlords have to keep renting to them whether they want to or not. This guarantee leads to housing stability for tenants. San Francisco’s rent-controlled tenants are more likely to live at the same address long-term and more likely to continue living in the city despite the pressures of gentrification. Importantly this stabilizing effect disproportionately benefits San Francisco’s black Asian and Latino populations. For landlords tenant stability is a source of apprehension and resentment. Rent control prevents them from changing their business strategy as housing markets become more lucrative. Instead of renting to richer tenants landlords are compelled to continue providing housing to their current tenants. This is good for tenants who get to remain in their communities but bad for opportunistic landlords seeking the highest returns on their investments.",,,,,,,,,,,,

There appeared to be little effect of the PMM on other outcomes or across socio-economic strata of municipalities including programme prioritisation criteria.

The general absence of an impact of the PMM on aggregate corroborates previous studies on the PMM [17 18] yet is in contrast to evidence from the ESF in Brazil [10] that shows primary care doctor density is inversely associated with infant mortality. There are multiple reasons that could explain the lack of association. Firstly the health impacts of the PMM may take longer to be realized. The PMM was implemented in 2013 and only five years of post-implementation data are used in this analysis. Furthermore the additional number of doctors provided may have been too small to substantially impact infant health outcomes. Secondly there is evidence that the PMM doctors were allocated to non-priority municipalities likely limiting their effectiveness and potential to reduce IMR [14 15]. Many PMM doctors were allocated to areas with already low levels of IMR or where there were higher levels of non-PMM primary care doctors working. Diminishing returns from increasing doctor density may have also reduced the effectiveness of PMM doctors in decreasing IMR [10]. Thirdly PMM doctors may have been limited in their ability to improve infant health given the large roles other health professionals (such as nurses and community health workers) play in the Brazilian health system and also the reliance on hospitals for birth.

This study found a lack of association between the PMM and infant health outcomes across strata when stratifying by municipal socio-economic characteristics including poverty and urbanisation. This suggests despite poor targeting of PMM doctors to priority municipalities [14 15] the relationship between the PMM and IMR was not substantially affected by municipal socio-economic factors other than infant mortality. This is generally supported by other studies which report no association between PMM and infant mortality in municipality subgroups of mother’s education mother’s age and marital status [18]. However it does appear that baseline IMR is a determinant of the relationship between the PMM and IMR as there were IMR reductions associated with the PMM in municipalities with the highest IMR at baseline. This finding corroborates the results of research on the ESF [9] which found IMR reductions from ESF expansion were greatest in municipalities with the highest IMR. This finding suggests that PMM doctors may deliver health benefits where underlying health outcomes are poor and also programmes such as the PMM can contribute to improvements in health inequalities when targeting is based on health indicators rather than socio-economic factors.

The PMM was not associated with changes in prenatal care outcomes in most models. The PMM was associated with an increase in the proportion of expectant mothers receiving over seven prenatal care visits but only in municipalities with the lowest IMR at baseline and the highest density of CHWs and non-PMM doctors in 2012. This finding indicates wealthier municipalities with a higher density of HRH prior to the programme may have more effectively integrated PMM doctors to local health services allowing nurses and CHWs to focus on prenatal care provision. Therefore the PMM can introduce minor improvements to services and processes but in areas that are considered least in need of new doctors.

This study has several limitations. First the data collated from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and publicly available sources may have administrative errors—including possible underreporting of infant deaths in some municipalities. However the data was collated from established sources which have been used for several evaluations of the PMM programme [13 17 18]. Additionally statistical approaches employing time and municipal fixed effects would have likely accounted for some sources of bias. Second the absence of adequate reporting systems for maternal and health outcomes in some municipalities prior to PMM may have skewed findings. Evidence demonstrates the expansion of health services in Brazil has reduced under-reporting and therefore expansion of health professionals could be associated with increases in mortality rates [22]. This may have masked some of the associations between the PMM and reductions in IMR. Third although the data includes the entire five-year period of PMM implementation (2013–2018) the programme may have long-term impacts on infant health beyond 2018 which cannot be measured with this data. Fourth the ecological design of the study restricts causal inference and prevents the exploration of heterogeneity within municipalities. Fifthly there may have been systematic differences between PMM- recipient and non-recipient municipalities that could have biased the findings although the use of IPTW-RA aimed to minimize these biases and represent the most robust method for observational studies.

The impact of the PMM in municipalities with high IMR at baseline indicates that HRH programmes can deliver improvements where the health needs are the greatest. There are wider policy implications from this work. More comprehensive targeting arrangements are necessary to maximize the health gains of scarce resources—both in Brazil and in other settings. This includes up-to-date data on health outcomes and socio-economic characteristics of local populations. Evidence indicates the effectiveness of the PMM was diluted due to inappropriate targeting of PMM doctors to the most needed areas [14]. The results from this study also suggest that the targeting criteria that were in place were of limited benefit as no effect of the PMM was found when stratifying by criteria. Policymakers may need to balance different and conflicting health gains from different sub-populations (e.g. infant health gains versus morbidity improvements in older populations) when distributing resources. Additionally PMM doctors were often allocated to the most deprived regions within municipalities [14] implying that municipal-level health metrics and impact studies (including this one) are of only limited value for effective resource targeting. More detailed analyses on the sub-populations within municipalities most benefitting from the PMM is necessary to understand the complexity of the impact of PMM on a localised level.

In August 2019 President Jair Bolsonaro announced the creation of the Médicos pelo Brasil (Doctors for Brazil) Program to replace the PMM. However as of March 2021 the new program has not yet been implemented and longer-term strategies to address the lack of primary care doctors in underserved areas are absent. Furthermore the increased pressure on Brazil’s healthcare system due to COVID-19 led the federal government to publish new calls for PMM doctors in 2020 including in non-priority municipalities. Under the original PMM there was a planned expansion of 15000 extra medical schools places to train primary care doctors who in 2021 would be filling unserved positions in primary care. However these extra places were not fully expanded and coupled with the expansion of PMM positions into non-priority municipalities the challenges in the provision and distribution of primary care doctors in Brazil remain. Tackling the ongoing lack of doctors and their inappropriate distribution is key for further strengthening the health system providing access to high-quality care and tackling the large social inequalities that exist in the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzgxMTAyMTQvY2FuYWRhLWVsZWN0aW9uLWNvbXBsZXRlLWxpc3Qtb2YtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtcHJvbWlzZXMtbWFkZS1kdXJpbmctdGhlLTIwMjEtY2FtcGFpZ24v0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9nbG9iYWxuZXdzLmNhL25ld3MvODExMDIxNC9jYW5hZGEtZWxlY3Rpb24tY29tcGxldGUtbGlzdC1vZi1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1wcm9taXNlcy1tYWRlLWR1cmluZy10aGUtMjAyMS1jYW1wYWlnbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canada election: Complete list of health care promises made during the 2021 campaign,"Send this page to someone via email

Conservative Promises

Aug. 16: The Conservatives released an uncosted platform containing many promises regarding health care and pandemic response.

The Conservatives are promising to prioritize the signing of contracts for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to accelerate the development of homegrown vaccines by Canadian companies and to offer logistical support to the provinces to help with vaccine rollout.

Under the Conservative plan all passenger arrivals to Canada will be required to take a COVID-19 rapid test regardless of vaccine status. They also promise to make rapid tests easily available to Canadians for at-home use.

They will also close the border to travel from countries where new COVID-19 variants are detected.

They promise to work with pharmaceutical companies to increase the production of critical medicines and active pharmaceutical ingredients in Canada.

They promise to overhaul the Federal Emergency Response Stockpile system.

They promise to improve contact tracing at the Canadian border.

They promise to overhaul federal lab testing procedures to improve the consistency and scalability of lab testing across Canada.

They promise to prohibit the export of deadly viruses to foreign jurisdictions that don’t pass a national security assessment.

They promise to restore the Global Public Health Intelligence Network to help detect and assess threats to public health.

They promise to overhaul Canada’s Pandemic Plan to expand it beyond influenza. They also promise to give ultimate responsibility for the Public Health Agency of Canada to a physician with front-line experience.

They promise to strengthen Health Canada’s ability to rapidly review new innovations like tests treatments and vaccines. They also promise to work with the provinces to harmonize intensive care unit training so that qualified personnel can work in different jurisdictions during emergencies.

Within the first 100 days of taking office the Conservatives say they will meet with provinces to come to a new agreement on the Canada Health Transfer to raise its annual growth rate to at least six per cent. They will also propose that the provinces dedicate a significant part of that money to improving mental health care.

They also promise to create a tax credit for employers to encourage them to add mental health coverage to their benefits plans.

They also propose to create a national three-digit suicide prevention help line.

The Conservatives promise to invest $150 million over three years to create 1000 residential drug treatment beds and build 50 recovery community centres across the country.

On Medical Assistance in Dying the Conservatives promise to restore a 10-day waiting period and the requirement for two fully independent witnesses to be present. They also want to reverse recently added provisions under Bill C-7 that allowed people whose only medical condition was mental illness to seek it.

Aug. 22: During a campaign stop in Vancouver Erin O’Toole said the Conservatives would continue to allow supervised consumption sites.

Aug. 25: As part of a broader $60-billion pledge for more health transfers over the next decade O’Toole says that if elected his government will transfer enough funds to provinces for an additional one million Canadians to access mental health treatment each year. He also says his Canada Mental Health Action Plan would provide employers a 25 per cent tax credit for three years to encourage them to offer employees mental-health coverage.

Sept. 3: O’Toole promises to create a national system to prove Canadian residents as having been vaccinated against COVID-19.

Sept. 4: O’Toole pledged to cover the cost of time off for employees to get a COVID-19 vaccine shot free transportation to vaccine clinics and a national booster shot strategy that would initially target seniors and the immunocompromised.

He also pledged to:

Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email as it happens.

Aug. 18: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau doubled down on a plan for mandatory vaccination requirements to board a plane train or cruise ship. “Unless people have a medical exception they will not be able to board a plane or a train in Canada if they are unvaccinated” he said.

Aug. 19: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau promised to train up to 25000 new personal support workers and guarantee them a minimum wage of at least $25 per hour.

Aug. 19: Trudeau also promised that a Liberal government would give provinces and territories $3 billion to improve the quality and availability of long-term care beds and develop a Safe Long Term Care Act to ensure standards are upheld across the country.

Aug. 20: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau promised 10 days of paid sick leave for workers in federally regulated industries if elected.

Aug. 23: Trudeau says that if re-elected his government will immediately invest $6 billion in addition to the $4 billion committed in the spring budget to help eliminate wait-lists. He also says a Liberal government will spend $3 billion over four years to help hire 7500 family doctors nurses and nurse practitioners. The Liberals also promise to provide $400 million over four years to expand virtual health services.

Aug. 27: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau pledged to create a $1-billion fund for provinces that choose to implement vaccine passport systems for non-essential businesses. The money will be available on a per-capita basis only to provinces that implement this kind of program.

Trudeau also said his government would invest $100 million into studying the long-term effects of COVID-19.

Aug. 31: Trudeau says that if re-elected he will give provinces and territories $4.5 billion over five years in funding for mental health that will be delivered through a new permanent mental health transfer.

Sept. 1: The Liberals release a platform document with several health-related promises many of which were announced already earlier in the campaign.

New items include:

NDP Promises

Aug. 19: The NDP released an uncosted platform that comprised promises about access to better health care and food.

The party is promising to invest in health care and expand it to include pharmacare which would give coverage to everyone. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the party will partner and work together with any province and territory that wants to invest in health care.

Singh said if elected an NDP government would create a $250 million Critical Shortages Fund to address the shortage of nurses and health care workers across the country.

The party would ensure that provinces also commit funding “specifically for health care workers.” The federal fund would help train and hire 2000 nurses Singh said.

The NDP promise to “tackle homelessness fight poverty” and to make sure that everyone in the country has access to healthy affordable food.

Aug. 24: NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh promised an end to for-profit long-term care homes and committed to a “care guarantee” which would put in place standards for long-term care a living wage for workers in these facilities and “safe dignified care” for residents.

Aug. 27: Singh promises that an NDP government will implement a universal pharmacare program within one year.

Sept. 3: Singh says he will respond to the Quebec government’s call for an increase to health transfers and give Quebec the right to opt out of federal programs with compensation.

Sept. 4: Singh promises to implement a national dental care system which would provide coverage to families earning less than $90000.

Sept. 5: The NDP promised to commit $1 billion in targeted supports to ramp up vaccination programs to quickly implement a national vaccine passport and to extend pandemic supports.

Green Party Promises

Aug. 18: Green Leader Annamie Paul released her vision for Canada which included major reforms and changes to health care in the country such as universal Pharmacare and child care.

The Greens also promised a major overhaul of the country’s long-term care home system whose residents were devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sept. 7: The Green Party released its full platform with many specific promises on health care and pandemic recovery. These include:

Fully funding a universal pharmacare program to be launched in 2022 with a list of essential medicines to be expanded later

Creating a bulk drug purchasing agency and reducing drug patent protection periods

Invest in measures to limit the impact of extreme weather events caused by climate change

Halt and reverse biodiversity loss as a way to reduce further pandemics

Bloc Québécois Promises

Aug. 21: Bloc Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said that a new Moderna vaccine manufacturing plant would most likely be built in Quebec should voters choose his party over the Liberals.

Aug. 22: Under the Bloc Quebecois platform Blanchet’s government would increase health transfers to provinces and territories so the federal government covers at least 35 per cent of all health care spending.

The party would also increase paid sick leave through employment insurance for people with serious illnesses to from 15 weeks per year to 50.

The Bloc wants to increase the Canadian government’s contribution to the World Health Organization.

Blanchet is vowing to ensure a percentage of vital personal protective equipment is made in Quebec and in Canada.

The party also wants a permanent protocol of COVID-19 testing in place at the border.

If elected the Bloc will institute a program to increase health and safety protocols in workplaces across the country.

A Bloc government will also launch an inquest about how the pandemic has been dealt with with a specific focus on the federal government’s preparedness.

Following the novel coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 the Akufo-Addo government took heed of the severity of the pandemic’s impact on the many districts in Ghana which do not have a hospital.

To bridge the gap the government announced that it had decided to build hospitals in the left-out districts.

Bold step

In seeking to fulfil its promise to the nation and people of Ghana at this moment in our history the government is taking a bold step. By building these hospitals it will start to correct what has been a long-standing anomaly in distribution of health infrastructure across the country.

The 111 hospitals are a major infrastructure intervention. And when complete the programme will fulfil the government’s policy of maintaining at least one hospital for each district and region.

It will also improve geographical health-care coverage and access to health care for all Ghanaians wherever they reside in Ghana and transform health-care delivery in our local communities.

On completion the Agenda 111 venture will be the largest investment in health-care infrastructure in Ghana since independence. Never before in the annals of this country’s health infrastructure development has universal access to good and affordable health care been envisioned so strategically.

The project’s objectives

The objective of the project as set out by the president is to ensure that Ghanaians in every district and region in the country have access to quality health-care services.

The Agenda 111 project together with the National Health Insurance Scheme is expected to boost both provision of health-care infrastructure and financial accessibility of health care in line with the government’s commitment to ensure universal health care for all citizens and attainment of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3).

On completion the hospitals will fulfil the government’s health policy of a hospital in each district and region.

The process of making good on the deliverables will also create a model of accelerated construction for health facilities which can be developed for future health projects.

Scope of works

The Ministry of Health says the Agenda 111 project will cover the following deliverables: design procurement construction equipping and commissioning of 101 district hospitals six regional hospitals in the newly created regions (Bono Bono East North East Oti Savannah and Western North) as well as one new regional hospital in the Western Region two psychiatric hospitals (Kumasi and Tamale) and redevelopment of the Accra Psychiatric Hospital.

The Western Region will also benefit from rehabilitation of Effia Nkwanta Hospital.

All of the hospitals are expected to have a complement of staff accommodation for doctors nurses and other health workers.

Freedom is something that my Constitution guarantees me but why is it that 75 years after independence my fellow LGBTQIA citizens and I continue to have less rights than others? With Section 377 gone we are no longer considered ‘criminal’ but its abolition hasn’t allowed me to enjoy the rights and freedoms that other straight citizens enjoy in India.For instance we still don’t have LGBTQIA marriages that are recognised by our courts of law. Why is this so? We as queer citizens pay the same taxes are as patriotic as others and have contributed equally to nation-building over decades. So why this disparity? Marriage rights would help me honour the sanctity of my relationship with my partner with whom I’ve been for many years. Why should I not be allowed to honour our relationship with marriage the same way my straight friends can?It’s important legally as well. I’d like to leave whatever I have to my partner. I want my partner to make medical decisions on my behalf and not other family members. Because we’re not recognised my partner has no locus standi. Some years down the line we may also want to adopt children of our own like queer citizens do in other parts of the world. Marriage equality would be a step towards societal acceptance and freedom. My wish this Independence Day is to live in an inclusive Indian society where parents accept their queer children and all our other institutions are also inclusive — colleges workplaces and more. And I want to see this change in my lifetime because I’m tired of waiting!What does it mean to be free to talk about sex? For too long the definition of sexual freedom has been based on a stereotype of the sex-machine straight man. Speaking more freely about sex reveals the surprising and beautiful heterogeneity of human desire liberating us from many sexual myths templated behaviours and faltu moralities no matter what our gender or orientation. Sexual freedom means the possibility to understand one’s own sexual nature and craft a sexual journey true to that nature. How can we have that without a more wide-ranging conversation about sex?Most of the time acceptable conversation about sex is really about sexual violence or through abstract terms like sexuality or empowerment. To talk of sex freely means to talk about all its aspects pleasurable and painful abstract and experiential political and personal. Because sex is so tabooed everything related to sexuality becomes secret. We remain ignorant about safe sex hesitate to see doctors for sexual issues are inhibited about talking to partners about our preferences or hurts or even contraception.When sex and shame are intertwined we are always dragged down by a sense of shame about our most human selves. We may compensate for that with aggression or feel self-doubt in our consent. To speak freely about sex is a path to acceptance of one’s whole self an openness to love and sexual joy; and through that a generous respect for others’ privacies and choices.India’s wonderful democracy is a child of a risky political experiment in 1947; no country had ever given votes to all citizens at birth. But our democracy has not produced mass prosperity because of a reckless economic experiment in 1955; the Avadi resolution ensured that our capital became handicapped without labour and our labour became handicapped without capital. Consequently our 6.3 crore enterprises only translate to 22500 companies with a paid-up capital of Rs 10 crore.Poorna Swaraj 1.0 for employers came in 1991 when reforms ended the license raj. These reforms were impactful but incomplete; they deferred reforms to education urbanisation banking infrastructure and formalisation. Consequently unemployment has become a poor indicator of labour market strength or weakness; our problem is “employed poverty” or poor wages.Raising wages needs productive employers. Most economists obsess over the three factors of production of land labour and capital that employers need because they don’t truly understand the fourth factor of production of entrepreneurship innovation or what is called total factor productivity. Good employers — those with the productivity to pay good wages — are sabotaged by excessive regulatory cholesterol. The Indian state must revise its philosophy of prohibited till permitted writing laws for rogues and do less so it can do more. Poorna Swaraj 2.0 for employers will ensure that our 100th independence day in 2047 will celebrate both democracy and prosperity.It’s been 75 years since this country was created with dreams of an equal and just society but we still have a long way to go. It’s a truism to say the rich have got richer and the poor poorer but like all truisms it is based on reality. It’s not only that the rich have become richer but that they think it gives them the right to ride roughshod over others who are placed differently. I often look at the part of South Delhi where I live. Over time people who had modest homes have built palaces and their small cars have changed into SUVs and Jaguars. They now think they own the roads and are impatient with pedestrians and the roadside pheri walas. Sadly wealth has not brought with it compassion. This was so evident during Covid when it was assumed that domestic workers and kabadiwalas spread the disease.This sense of entitlement spills into human interactions. It’s when a man assumes a woman walking on a road is fair game. It’s what makes the rapist think he owns a woman’s body. It’s what makes the policeman be blatantly partisan — they know their entitlement (gained from being close to political power often) will protect them. Is this the freedom our forefathers and foremothers dreamt of when they thought up this country? Perhaps that is the question we should ask ourselves today.On this Independence Day I would like us to renew the commitment of the Radhakrishnan Education Commission 1948 for nurturing an atmosphere of freedom as the basis of democracy freedom of thought and inquiry for teachers and students for education that develops the courage and morality of mind to deliberate and debate even difficult controversial issues and strive for justice.I would like a child’s fundamental right to education recognised as an entitlement rather than a reluctant dismal dole. Our country has forgotten the Constitutional promises made to our children that education should be a transaction rather than transmission that it should allow for freedom to learn from peers from different backgrounds and where equity is closely tied to quality.The pandemic seems to have legitimised and deepened the divides in education. The national education policy was expected to build on the intent of the Right to Education Act but instead it completely contradicts it. An NCERT Alternative Curriculum for the pandemic says all children have phones.Which country are we talking about? The fact is that children and not a small minority but a very large number have been completely abandoned by the system and there is no concern to reimagine and reopen schools for the younger ones to rebuild their confidence and not heartlessly push them out. Online education is no education it is at best coaching for the privileged but that distance and isolation stunts the ability of learners to engage think relate with each other and deeply diminishes the quality of learning.In my childhood a troll was an ugly-cute creature from stories by Enid Blyton. In my teen years I was so in love with these mythical creatures from Scandinavian mythology that I owned a troll named Hidimbi my only stuffed toy till date. Since then trolls have gone on to mean abusive nasty people on social media who showcase the worst underbelly of humankind under the cloak of anonymity. Their targets are usually women who they want to shame and scare into silence. To expect freedom from all trolls would be like expecting society to turn into La La Land but there is no doubt that mass trolling and hate speech of any kind needs to be dealt with severely by social media platforms and as per the law of the land. Incidentally Hidimba was a rakshasi (demon) in Mahabharata and a rather nice one. Also my troll doll still lives with me and travels in my suitcase to concerts. She is my good luck charm!The other day I was messaging a friend. She is in her 40s and in the last year has moved in with her parents for caretaking like a lot of people have. The kind of messages we were exchanging weren’t about the immediate need for caretaking which is something you step up and you do even if it’s hard. We were discussing the ways in which the pandemic has accelerated this situation where you have to embrace responsibility for family members who in other circumstances don’t approve of you for whatever reason -- it might be your choice to be single or your sexuality or your employment. The freedom to be yourself in your own family is something that we keep fighting for no matter how old we are. The approval you get from your family is this mirage you keep walking towards thinking the oasis is around the corner but it doesn’t exist. The freedom that I think we need is if we could all switch off from our endless need of approval from our families.How old do we have to be to let go of that? The sooner you let go of it the easier it will be. You may be highly successful and well-loved among your friends but your family may not approve of you. The freedom to say I have to be myself even if I never get full family approval is liberating. If I could get a genie and make that wish I would make that wish for a lot of people I know. It’s very freeing because once you realise it doesn’t matter what you do you can be free of that and do what makes you happy. You can be kind to the other party and also to yourself.The idea that all human beings are equal is quite simple yet it has made little headway in India’s deeply hierarchical society. People continue to be sorted and graded everywhere like poultry eggs.The only place where all Indian citizens are more or less equal is the polling booth. In a democracy they are also supposed to be equal in other important areas like the police station the court room and administrative offices. In practice all these institutions function in one way for the privileged and some other way – often diametrically opposite – for the rest. The so-called justice system a fountain of injustice for poor people is a prime example.Active social policies make it possible in principle to enlarge the spheres of relative equality. In many countries for instance most children are in the same school boat – they attend government schools of fairly even quality. Similarly a National Health Service can help to ensure that we are all equal in times of illness. Here again India has missed the bus.The schooling system especially is stratified to no end defeating its purpose as a leveller of social inequality.India is saddled with a unique complex of entrenched inequalities from extreme income and wealth disparities to gender bias and the caste system. It will take decades of struggle to bring about a more egalitarian social order. On the way we can try to enlarge the domain of comparative equality.Universal quality education would be a good start.Freedom from the death penalty is ultimately the freedom from our own worst instincts. Our instinct for collective vengeance and retribution dehumanises us as a society. When something terrible happens to any of us as individuals we might experience that need for revenge and that is perfectly legitimate. But as a collective and as a society we should abandon this pursuit of vengeance. We tend to think of those who commit crimes as “bad people”.Of course they are responsible for what they did but so is society. Crime is a social phenomenon. To demonise offenders is a way to escape our collective responsibility. To abandon the death penalty is to free ourselves of the thought that more violence is the answer to complex social problems.Every comedian should have the freedom to make people laugh. It is possible that the joke might not seem funny to you and you have the freedom to get offended by it. How can I question that? So the way I respect your freedom you too should respect mine. As comics our intention is not to say bad things.Instead we want an audience to come to our shows to laugh and forget their life’s stresses and sorrows. This is our only job. Let us do it.Our lives have now been fundamentally transformed by our connection through the Internet to everyone else everywhere where no one needs to get permission to collaborate trade or create. At its best technology can be used to educate every brain on earth. At its worst it can be used to create an authoritarian society where every face is watched and every thought is monitored all the time. In the past few years Digital India has become synonymous with control instead of empowerment. Whether it’s shutting the Internet at the drop of a hat or weaponisation of social media by political parties or surveillance of citizens technology has been used to create more problems for citizens than solutions. My fellow citizens: You must not give it control of the Internet because somewhere in the inevitable future a bad government will use the Internet to destroy freedom in our society.Citizenship confers a right to health which can be realised only when society represented by the government ensures an efficient and equitable health system based on the principles of universal health care. A predominantly tax funded single payer system of pre-paid healthcare lowers the financial barrier to accessing needed care. Government should be the guarantor of accessible and affordable healthcare even if it is not the sole provider. Infrastructure health workforce equipment drugs and supplies and reliable data systems will create an efficient healthcare system while coherent policies on the social environmental and commercial determinants of health will promote population health. Freedom fulfils her promise when every person is assured of living conditions that protect health and services which promptly provide needed care without barriers of access and affordability. India must realise that goal soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY29uc3RydWN0aW9ucmV2aWV3b25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nla2dvbWEtbWVtb3JpYWwtcHJvamVjdC1pbi1ib3Rzd2FuYS1oYW5kZWQtb3Zlci1mb3ItdXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sekgoma Memorial project in Botswana handed over for use,"The Ministry of Infrastructure and Housing Development has handed over the Old Sekgoma Memorial refurbishment Project to the Ministry of Health and Wellness in Serowe.

Delivering quality universal health care

According to Sekgoma Memorial Hospital Acting superintendent Dr Malebogo Rauwe the completion of the Sekgoma Memorial Clinic is another encouraging contribution towards the ministry’s pursuit to deliver quality universal health care.

“The project demonstrates the government commitment towards promoting access to inclusive quality healthcare services in an effort to achieve sustainable development goal 3 of ‘ensuring healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages” he said when receiving the project and delivering the speech on behalf of the Minister of Health and wellness Dr. Edwin Dikoloti.

He further added that the ministry realized the urgent need to refurbish the Old hospital in order to ensure improved access to health care within Serowe and catchment areas. “We are pleased to announce that we will be occupying the facility as soon as possible and the opening ceremony will be organized when the hospital will be given to Batswana for utilization” he affirmed."

Luego de años de ver a Lionel Messi con el 10 en su camiseta la llegada al PSG revolucionó todo. El futbolista argentino eligió vestir el 30 en el conjunto parisino y dejarle el emblemático número a su amigo Neymar. A solo 48 horas de haber salido a la venta la camiseta del ídolo batió todos los récords.

Puede decirse que este es el primer golazo de Leo en su nuevo equipo tras la abrupta salida del FC Barcelona. Este 13 de agosto a solo dos días del lanzamiento oficial la camiseta del PSG con el 30 y Messi impresos en el dorsal superó el millón de ventas a nivel mundial según publica el diario deportivo Olé.

Es más ​​según las fuentes del club francés a las que tuvo acceso el medio durante los primeros siete minutos se vendieron 150.000 prendas con el 30 en la espalda. La cuenta de lo recaudado es relativamente sencilla: cada camiseta va de 90 a 180 dólares según modelo y tamaño por lo que lo recaudado supera ampliamente la abrumante cifra de 100.000.000 de dólares en apenas tres días.

La cifra que trascendió que desembolsó el PSG para firmar contrato con el flamante campeón de América es de 210.000.000 de euros —casi 250 millones de dólares por dos temporadas—. Si bien es cierto que lo recaudado por las camisetas se divide con Nike empresa que viste al club los cataríes dueños del PSG saben que la inversión se recuperará rápidamente más allá de las hazañas deportivas que buscan conseguir con el astro del fútbol… y de las ventas.

Otros números

Su desembarco en el equipo francés disparó el precio de la criptomoneda de la institución con la que el club recauda dinero a cambio de beneficios para sus poseedores. Este miércoles superó los u$s6360 justo en la jornada en la que Messi se presentó oficialmente a la prensa.

Estas criptomonedas llamadas por fanToken dan derecho a los usuarios a votar en decisiones del club a cambio de recompensas y experiencias exclusivas. Son varios los clubes que las tienen (Valencia Manchester City Barcelona Milan) son algunos de ellos.

Los fanToken se diferencian de una acción ya que no otorgan derechos de propiedad sobre las organizaciones pero sí permiten usufructuar una serie de beneficios como eventos exclusivos sorteos encuentros con los integrantes del equipo y algunas otras acciones de marketing.

El récord anterior había sido el 27 de abril cuando llegó a los u$s5891. El criptoactivo llegó a ese nivel justo antes del inicio de la semifinal de la Champions League ante Manchester City de Inglaterra en la que PSG quedó eliminado.

El impacto en Google y en las cuentas de redes sociales

Además de generar un impacto Messi alcanzó en Google el nivel máximo de popularidad en búsquedas. ""La gente elige saber de Messi antes que el clima la hora religión o Covid. El país que más lo buscó fue Guinea"" indicó un usuario en Twitter.

Los últimos días han sido los de mayor crecimiento en todas las plataformas de PSG. Una de ellas es Instagram. La cantidad de seguidores venía aumentando la semana pasada a un ritmo de 30 mil seguidores por día. La jornada en la que había tenido un mayor crecimiento fue el pasado jueves cuando se oficializó que Messi se iba de Barcelona y se empezaba a rumorear que podía llegar a Francia. Allí la cuenta creció en 153 mil seguidores informa El Observador de Uruguay.

Este martes cuando el argentino llegó a París la cuenta de PSG tuvo el récord en un día: hubo más 2.211.000 seguidores nuevos de la plataforma. Y este miércoles más de 15 millones se sumaron a la red social del equipo parisino. De hecho se ve a Messi en el vestuario con su celular empezando a seguir la cuenta de Instagram del PSG lo que incentiva aún más que la gente empiece a seguir esta cuenta.

Lo mismo ocurrió con su cuenta de YouTube. La semana pasada sus videos tenían una cifra que no superaba las 680 mil reproducciones en promedio. Ahora sus videos superaron los 25 millones de ""views"". La presentación de Messi en esta página que tuvo más de 2 horas y 46 minutos de duración fue visto por 46 millones de personas hasta el mediodía de Uruguay de este miércoles. Y si de suscriptores se trata entre el lunes y el miércoles la cantidad de personas que cliquearon ""suscribirme"" al canal del PSG fueron en el entorno de 500 mil.

Este martes cuando Messi llegó a París la cuenta de PSG de Instagram tuvo el récord en un día

Local Negocio de uniformes escolares lucha por mantenerse a flote

“La mercancía que actualmente estoy vendiendo son las cosas que desde hace dos años surtí por la pandemia el año pasado no vendí nada y me quede con todo mi dinero estancado y por como veo las cosas este año posiblemente tampoco la termino”.

“En años pasados para esta fechas ya estábamos surtiendo más ya que no nos dábamos abasto hasta tenía que contratar a otras tres personas para que me ayudaran y ahora sólo yo estoy aquí para que no me implique mayor gasto” expresó Carlos.

Para Carlos la pandemia le cayó como un balde de agua fría pues para poder sobrellevarla tuvo que dejar a un lado la venta de uniformes y comenzó con la venta online de ropa interior lo cual sólo le ayudó en lo mínimo a mantenerse así lo expresó de viva voz.

El comerciante añadió que después de tantos meses de haber cerrado por falta de escuelas presenciales el regresar de nueva cuenta a su negocio le da esperanza pese a que las ventas no han sido las esperadas pero espera que en los próximos días las personas comiencen a asistir a surtir su lista de útiles.

Productos como pantalones camisas suéteres calcetas largas conjuntos deportivos son algunos de los productos que Carlos comercia en su puesto que se encuentra ubicado fuera de la Plaza del Comercio Popular y estará hasta el ocho de septiembre.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjb25vbWlzdGEuY29tLm14L2VtcHJlc2FzL1ZlbnRhcy1kZS1hdXRvcy1kZS1sdWpvLWVuLU1leGljby1lc3Rhbi1lbi1zdS1uaXZlbC1tYXMtYWx0by1kZS0yMDIxLTIwMjEwODE0LTAwMTEuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjb25vbWlzdGEuY29tLm14L2FtcC9lbXByZXNhcy9WZW50YXMtZGUtYXV0b3MtZGUtbHVqby1lbi1NZXhpY28tZXN0YW4tZW4tc3Utbml2ZWwtbWFzLWFsdG8tZGUtMjAyMS0yMDIxMDgxNC0wMDExLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ventas de autos de lujo en México están en su nivel más alto de 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/empresas/Ventas-de-autos-de-lujo-en-Mexico-estan-en-su-nivel-mas-alto-de-2021-20210814-0011.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjb25vbWlzdGEuY29tLm14L2VtcHJlc2FzL1ZlbnRhcy1kZS1hdXRvcy1kZS1sdWpvLWVuLU1leGljby1lc3Rhbi1lbi1zdS1uaXZlbC1tYXMtYWx0by1kZS0yMDIxLTIwMjEwODE0LTAwMTEuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjb25vbWlzdGEuY29tLm14L2FtcC9lbXByZXNhcy9WZW50YXMtZGUtYXV0b3MtZGUtbHVqby1lbi1NZXhpY28tZXN0YW4tZW4tc3Utbml2ZWwtbWFzLWFsdG8tZGUtMjAyMS0yMDIxMDgxNC0wMDExLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaW5kZXBlbmRpZW50ZS5jb20vZWNvbm9taWEvMjAyMS8wOC8xNS9sb3MtaGVsYWRvcy1xdWUtc3VzdGl0dXllcm9uLWEtbGFzLXZhY2FjaW9uZXMtZHVyYW50ZS1sYS1wYW5kZW1pYS_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGluZGVwZW5kaWVudGUuY29tL2Vjb25vbWlhLzIwMjEvMDgvMTUvbG9zLWhlbGFkb3MtcXVlLXN1c3RpdHV5ZXJvbi1hLWxhcy12YWNhY2lvbmVzLWR1cmFudGUtbGEtcGFuZGVtaWEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los helados que sustituyeron a las vacaciones durante la pandemia,"Durante la crisis del 2000 en Estados Unidos las ventas de pintalabios se dispararon. En medio de una caída generalizada del mercado las barras de labios se despachaban mucho mejor que antes lo que llevó a Leonard Lauder presidente de la marca de maquillaje y cremas Estée Lauder a analizar el comportamiento de este cosmético durante recesiones anteriores descubriendo así que iba a contracorriente del resto de la economía.

Su teoría apuntaba a que en momentos en los que había que apretarse el cinturón las mujeres dejaban de lado sus caprichos más caros como bolsos y vestidos pero apostaban más que antes por las barras de labios pese a lo sorprendente que pueda parecer gastar en un producto como ese en plena crisis.

Laudeer acuñó así el lipstick index. Quiso convertirlo en un indicador económico en base a su análisis pero su hipótesis no ha resistido a posteriores depresiones: en la provocada por la pandemia del coronavirus por ejemplo las ventas de las barras de labios no crecieron sino que se desplomaron. Es algo con sentido teniendo en cuenta que las restricciones de movilidad el cierre de los lugares de ocio y la obligación de llevar mascarillas que han tapado las bocas de millones de personas en todo el mundo; pero también sucedió así en la de 2008 lo que llevó al descrédito de la idea aunque sin duda surtió efecto como campaña de marketing.

Pero hay productos que se han agotado en las tiendas más allá del papel higiénico durante las sucesivas recesiones. Y es que si algo perduró del índice de los carmines es que según el país el momento histórico y la crisis cuando la población hace frente a condiciones económicas menos favorables tiende a ahorrar en compras caras (como en vacaciones) y a gastar más que antes en productos que le hacen sentir bien pero son más asequibles... como ha sucedido con el helado en varios países durante crisis del Covid-19.

Los helados de la pandemia

Ni los confinamientos domiciliarios que restringieron los paseos que muchos acompañan de cucuruchos o tarrinas ni que estos productos resulten más difícil de llevar a domicilio por la necesidad de mantenerse a muy bajas temperaturas ni la propia sombra de la crisis del Covid han impedido a muchos europeos y americanos multiplicar su gasto en helados. Según las cifras del sector los comerciantes de helados polos y granizados de Estados Unidos Alemania Dinamarca Holanda Eslovaquia y Bélgica han visto crecer sus cifras durante todo el 2020 en plena pandemia.

En total y según datos de Eurostat la Unión Europea produjo en 2020 más de 2.900 millones de litros de helado un 9% menos que el año anterior pero exportó 232 millones de kilos por valor de 752 millones de euros un 5% más que en 2020. En EEUU las ventas de este ""lujo asequible"" crecieron un 6% durante el año del Covid como ha sucedido en un puñado de países europeos.

En Eslovaquia la producción de helado ha crecido en 2020 un 631% hasta los 16 millones de litros; en Dinamarca un 10% hasta los 20 millones de litros; en Holanda un 4% hasta los 118 millones y en Bélgica Alemania y Lituania ha aumentado alrededor de un 1%. Los mismos datos reflejan que en Alemania el litro de helado es más barato que en ningún otro país europeo a 13 euros mientras que el más alto es el de Francia a 22 euros seguido de cerca por Italia a 2 euros siendo los tres los mayores países productores de toda la unión monetaria.

Los otros pintalabios

Aunque los pintalabios de Lauder no hayan resistido a todas las crisis hay otros productos candidatos para ese trono. Parece que a la cabeza de esa carrera va la laca de uñas cuyas ventas crecieron a doble dígito durante la crisis de 2008 en países ricos e incluso aumentaron en la golpeada España.

Entre los nuevos ""top ventas"" que le hacen la competencia están los rímel de pestañas que en Estados Unidos y algunos países europeos vieron crecer sus cifras durante la Gran Depresión y mientras que las del resto de cosméticos caían. A la vez los tintes de supermercado se dispararon en Reino Unido y los champús lo hicieron en Italia.

Pero no todo es cuestión de maquillaje porque durante la crisis de 2008 los países desarrollados vieron incrementarse considerablemente las ventas de toda una serie de productos. La empresa de investigación de mercados Euromonitor International ha publicado que se multiplicaron las del whisky escocés (+4%) los cigarrillos (+2%) la laca de uñas (+59%) el rímel de pestañas (+35%) los productos para mascotas (+39%) y las cafeterías de batidos de frutas (+65%) entrando a formar parte de ese grupo de ""lujos asequibles"" para los economistas. Mientras cayeron las ventas de bebidas energéticas y para deportistas (-21%) los electrodomésticos (-56%) la ropa (-27%) los muebles (-58%) y los relojes (-45%).

En cuanto a los mayores éxitos por países concretos los productos azucarados como cupcakes y tartas crecieron 11% en Reino Unido durante la crisis anterior el chocolate premium lo hizo un 12% en Alemania y las colchas de cama los cojines las cortinas y los trapos de cocina hicieron las delicias de los italianos (+13%) sirviendo así de válvula de escape ante la presión de tener que sacrificar sus vacaciones todo frente a alzas en sus sectores respectivos de alrededor del 1%."

This Sunday the best in the Cup Series look to tame the famous road course at the Racing Capital of the World.

This marks the second week in a row that NASCAR is racing on a road course as they took the famous track at Watkins Glen in upstate New York. That checkered flag was grabbed by points leader Kyle Larson. The win gave the Hendrick Motorsports driver his fifth win of the season the most of any driver so far in 2021. It was also Larson’s first win since winning at Nashville back in June.

While they are not racing on the usual oval the active driver with most wins at IMS is Kevin Harvick who became the first driver since Jimmie Johnson in 2008 and 2009 to win back-to-back races at The Brickyard winning each of the last two years. Current drivers Brad Keselowski Ryan Newman and Kyle Busch have also won past races at Indy.

Choices are pro-competition and pro-innovation and would lower costs to merchants and ultimately prices to consumers. And isn’t “inconsistent” perhaps another way to say “against the law?”

U.S. PIRG supported the so-called “Durbin amendment” offered by Senator Dick Durbin (IL) to the Dodd Frank Act in 2010. The amendment capped debit card swipe fees imposed on merchants by big banks and required that merchants be given at least two choices to route their debit card transactions through an unaffiliated payment network. Of course we would have preferred that the amendment apply to both debit and credit card fees and rules but it was still a tremendous victory for competition and choice against an entrenched oligopoly Visa and Mastercard which is enabled by the powerful Wall Street mega-banks that issue the vast bulk of all debit and credit cards.

U.S. PIRG’s comment letter in the Debit Card Routing docket is available here. Excerpt from our comment:

“Much of the bank credit union and card network complaining about the Durbin amendment especially during the implementation of Regulation II had focused on its cap on certain debit card swipe fees. Now they defend their defiance of the Durbin amendment’s much more important routing requirements. The Durbin amendment was always about more than stopping excessive rent-seeking. It was also designed to promote the development of a competitive payment network marketplace. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking sends an important signal that conduct inconsistent with the Durbin amendment will not be tolerated.”

The Merchant Payment Coalition’s comment explains further:

“As merchants have adapted to serve their customers during the pandemic there has been a dramatic shift to e-commerce as well as mobile apps and wallets that have made the lack of routing options for merchants a more pressing issue than ever. Economists estimate that the lack of routing costs merchants and their customers billions of dollars each year with payments consulting firm CMSPI placing the amount at $2 to $3 billion annually. The very reason Congress passed the Durbin Amendment is because the U.S. payments market was broken and the largest banks and card networks are trying to keep it that way. It is imperative that the Board move forward and clarify its regulations in order to protect the competition and merchant routing choice that was intended by Congress.”

The FRB staff’s memo supporting the proposed rule points out that since passage of the Durbin amendment and Regulation II innovation by unaffiliated networks including “PINless debit” which is a new technology used in online (card-not-present) transactions has not been enabled by card-issuing banks:

“In the decade since the adoption of Regulation II spurred by the growth in online commerce card-not-present transactions have become an increasingly significant portion of all debit card transactions and technology has evolved to enable multiple networks for these transactions. Despite this two unaffiliated payment card networks are often not available to process card-not-present transactions such as online purchases because some issuers do not enable multiple networks for such transactions. Staff members view such an outcome as inconsistent with Regulation II’s requirement that at least two unaffiliated networks be available to process each debit card transaction.” [Emphasis added.]

Importantly the directors of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureaus of Consumer Protection Competition and Economics have also filed a supportive staff comment to the FRB’s docket. The FTC has authority over payment networks including Visa and Mastercard but not over the card-issuing banks:

“FTC staff applauds the Board’s proposed clarification which addresses some issuers’ failure to fully recognize that card-not-present (“CNP”) transactions are a “type of transaction” under the existing Regulation II. FTC staff submits this comment both to endorse the proposed clarification and to suggest additional revisions that will strengthen the rule. In particular the Board should adopt revisions that ensure that debit card networks do not create incentives for issuers to evade Regulation II’s clear mandate that there be two unaffiliated networks available for each type of debit transaction with each network a commercially reasonable alternative for merchants. We urge the Board to prohibit debit card networks from paying incentives to an issuer based on how electronic debit transactions are routed by merchants using that issuer’s debit cards.”

Most substantive comments are filed at the last minute and are not yet available on the FRB docket comment page. Visa and Visa Inc.’s comment filed 23 July is a notable exception. We comment on it in our PIRG comment:

“Visa’s filed comment in this docket asserts that “among some or all historically PIN-based debit networks the ability to support card-not-present transactions is relatively new and untested in the marketplace. […] Of course the actual claim here is belied by the fact that running a transaction without a PIN is not a new and untested practice. Signature-based debit transactions without a PIN are exactly what Visa does all the time. Visa simply doesn’t want competition from unaffiliated PIN debit networks that have developed competitive PINless transaction technology for online transactions.”

The payment networks pre-date BigTech’s Amazon and Google yet have many similarities as “multi-sided platforms.” Payment networks get revenue from both consumers (interest other fees) and merchants (swipe fees paid by merchants that accept cards are generally a small merchant’s second highest cost). Most of the merchant swipe fees are returned to card-issuing banks which then return most of the money to some cardholders as rewards. In other countries swipe fees are prohibited or strictly regulated. Only in the U.S. are swipe fees rising. That’s due to unchecked anti-competitive market power not innovation.

Although the Fed and FTC are independent agencies both the Fed’s proposed clarification and the FTC’s support of it are important steps to implement President Biden’s recent Executive Order on promoting competition in the economy. We look forward to working with the Fed the FTC and others on making the U.S. economy more competitive and more innovative. Let’s start with the big banks and their practices that are “inconsistent” with the competition laws.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMTUvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvcmVkLXZlbnR1cmVzLWRpZ2l0YWwtbWVkaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You've Never Heard of the Biggest Digital Media Company in America (Published 2021),"INDIAN LAND S.C. — Lindsey Turrentine first heard of Red Ventures last fall when it bought the venerable tech news site CNET where she is the senior vice president in charge of content.

Her experience wasn’t uncommon. People working at the tourism guide Lonely Planet the travel site The Points Guy and the health and medical information site Healthline were similarly blindsided in recent years when Red Ventures bought up special interest publications in a multibillion-dollar shopping spree.

Their Googling and mandatory corporate retreats led them to the company’s South Carolina headquarters a 180-acre campus with a cluster of modern buildings a fire pit a six-lane bowling alley spin room pickle ball courts and 264 residences for employees who choose to live where they work.

He spent the morning cleaning his players’ football uniforms because their parents often forgot and the afternoon hunting for second-hand helmets because the start of the season was looming.

And just as he was beginning his hourslong route collecting kids who would otherwise have no way to reach their 6 p.m. practice one of his former players calls for help.

“Coach Glen” comes a voice so soft it belies the 30-something-year-old man on the other end of the line. “I have a little problem.” He’s homeless sleeping in someone’s garage and needs a pump to blow up his air mattress.

“Brother I got you” Glen Yearling says shifting his van into drive. “Just give me until after practice. Around 10:30 p.m. Then I’ll see what I can do.”

He rolls past the highway intersection where his team spent Friday afternoons holding buckets trying to cajole loose change from drivers stuck at red lights. Past the funeral homes where some of his players had been laid to rest and the high schools he hoped they would attend long enough to get their diplomas.

Yearling pushes on through the south side of Norfolk in his decades-old passenger van creaking and groaning but like its driver not giving up.

For two decades he has run a youth sports nonprofit that offers football basketball and cheerleading to elementary and middle schoolers: the Berkley Timberwolves.

But he is less concerned with teaching them how to pass block and tackle than he is helping them succeed in a world where failure is easier. Long ago he made a promise to himself: Whatever it took no matter the financial or personal cost he would fight for his players.

So here he is on this early August evening beginning a journey he completes three days a week.

There are a dozen players to collect and when he finally arrives at Berkley Park 21/2 hours later there will be dozens more raring to play.

“I want these kids to believe in themselves” he murmurs over the hum of the engine “when so much around them tells them not to.”

A player with the Berkley Timberwolves watches out the window after being picked up by coach Glen Yearling prior to a practice on Thursday Aug. 5 2021. Before practice Yearling hitches a trailer of football equipment to his van and leaves his house in Norfolk’s Berkley neighborhood to pick up players who lack a consistent mode of transportation to the practice field.

A fixture

Glen Yearling has been Coach Glen for most of his 56 years. He has two children of his own but has had a hand in raising hundreds more. Teachers at local schools have his number in case they can’t reach the parents of misbehaving players.

He’s as much a fixture in these parts as the potholes in the road. A heavyset man Yearling always wears team colors — red white black. And a whistle around his neck even on days without practice.

He moves the van through the south side from house to house windows open and his arm perched on the door. He always drives this way to talk and wave and because the air conditioning is broken.

“Hi Coach Glen!” mothers call out from their porches.

Yearling nods his head and beeps his horn.

“Hey Coach love you” says a boy with a basketball under his arm.

“And Coach loves you” Yearling says back.

Glen Yearling coach of the Berkley Timberwolves drives around Norfolk Va. before a practice on Thursday Aug. 5 2021 picking up kids who lack transportation to the practice field in the Norfolk neighborhood of Berkley.

The miles pass and quicker than Yearling ever imagined so have the years.

These streets had tried to lure him as a youngster too. His mother wouldn’t let them.

He has been a volunteer coach in the city for four decades when a broken hip dashed his hopes of playing football for his high school team but a local coach Linwood Baker asked if he wanted to assist him. And so began his life’s work.

Yearling ran a landscaping and moving business until the mid-1990s when a slew of injuries pushed him out of work and onto disability benefits. The $900 or so that he receives from the government each month isn’t enough to get by.

Still he dips into his own pockets to make sure his players don’t go without. There were times when he took buckets to gas-station bathrooms filling them with water to bathe when he bought team jerseys instead of paying his bills.

Never married both kids grown it’s just him and his van. Sweat-soaked and chugging away 10 kids onboard and two more to fetch.

The sanctuary

Just before 6 o’clock and the van finally rolls on to Berkley Park a city-owned patch of green amid rows of clapboard and brown brick homes.

Framed by trees and a waist-high chain-link fence three nights a week the field comes alive in a wash of red and white football jerseys.

At one corner is a tennis court where the Timberwolves cheerleaders are now practicing shimmying on the baked tarmac.

At another a low-slung church that sometimes hands out popsicles to the players and where a few months ago the reverend discovered a bullet hole had caused the leaky roof.

On the grass parents are chatting. About work. About the weather. About how to keep the Timberwolves — the program and the players — alive. One of them mentions the most recent violence.

Less than a month ago — on a night just like this — another of Yearling’s players had been shot and killed. A rising ninth grader everyone knew as Be-Bop.

The parents look at the boys on the field all smiles and running and throwing. “They could be anywhere thank God they’re here” one said.

An older player of the Berkley Timberwolves leads a group run around Berkley Park on Thursday Aug. 5 2021 prior to a practice. The Timberwolves led by Glen Yearling have offered a space for children between age 6-14 to safely blow off steam through the sport of football while learning discipline patience and community.

A huddle of young men hang out at the benches. Among them is 27-year-old Harlequinn Waddell who played for the Timberwolves as a boy and stopped by to say hello to Yearling.

“This field is our safe haven” he says as the players warm up with jumping jacks.

“It’s more than just coaching. It’s somebody that actually cares” Waddell says. “It’s love.”

Still even this sanctuary has been punctured by the violent forces the coaches try so desperately to keep at bay.

There have been times when gunfire rang out lurking in the shadows beyond the field’s fluorescent lights. Yearling yells for everyone to get down. And the children lay still their faces smushed against the grass waiting for Coach Glen to tell them it’s safe to rise once more.

But tonight practice has only the soundtrack of cheers laughter and the blows of the whistle. Children being children running around in the buttery light of a late summer evening.

There was a time when Yearling thought he might never see this again. Last spring the pandemic canceled practice like so much else. In the summer he fell ill. With what he isn’t sure but it left him bedridden for months and sent him to the emergency room 13 times.

He didn’t tell anyone at first but before long they felt the absence of his van chugging through the streets. Calls and texts poured in. Coach Glen when are you coming back to the field? Coach Glen who is going to stop our kids running the streets? Coach Glen?

There were nights when wheezing and frail he would pray. “Please God put me back on my feet to keep fighting for the kids.”

And now here he was on this early August evening doling out high-fives and knocking kids for slacking on their warm-up laps. “You cut corners now you going to be cutting corners for the rest of your life.”

Here lessons for life and not just football are being taught. The coaches think that if they can instill a sense of discipline of belonging and hope on the field it will follow their players into high school and onward.

Antonio Sivels’ mother died when he was 11 and he moved in with his grandmother and his seven siblings. Trouble found him but so did football.

“He’s not going to make 18” people said.

“I’ll take him in” Yearling said.

And so Sivels stayed with Yearling sometimes for months at a time in the years that followed.

Yearling kept him busy sorting equipment fundraising schoolwork. Movie nights too. Sivels stopped getting in trouble and went on to graduate. Now he’s 32 and his sons played for Yearling. “He saved my life.”

Doing a lot with a little

A few days earlier the team was at the intersection of Campostella Road and East Indian Circle.

The first game of the season is less than a month away and the coaches wanted the players to look and feel like champions.

But there’s no sponsor or steady stream of donations so the players stretched along the sidewalk smiling and holding big black buckets containing snacks that they tried to sell to idling motorists.

“When it’s green I hydrate. Then when it’s red I go straight back to fundraising” said a 7-year-old boy lifting a bottle of water to his lips just as the light changed color and the cars came to a halt.

With that he approached the passenger side of a truck and stood on his tip-toes to reach scrunched dollar bills jutting out from the open window.

All told the team would make $450 in 41/2 hours.

Jahkari Allen age 7 stands on the sidewalk near the corner of Campostella and East Indian River Road in Norfolk Va. on Friday Aug. 6 2021 while working a donation drive for the Berkley Timberwolves. Without any sponsors the Timberwolves primary funding comes from donations which allow the purchase of uniforms pads and helmets.

That week Yearling and fellow Timberwolves coach Larry Williams had already visited a local sports shop three times trying to piece together the equipment and clothing their ever-growing team needed.

On one trip they walked straight to the far back corner of the store. They were hoping to find used cleats on the cheap.

Cleats are the one piece of equipment that the players’ families are supposed to pay for themselves. But there are always players who show up in Crocs or tennis shoes so here the coaches are rummaging through the shelves.

“Look” Williams said pulling a pair down that still had clumps of dirt on the soles.

“Pretty good deal” Yearling replied.

“Clean ’em up real good.”

“Make ’em look brand new.”

The coaches were experts at doing a lot with a little stretching their donation dollars as far as possible.

Yearling placed his carefully considered selection of goods down on the counter. Six water bottles four helmets three whistles and four pairs of cleats.

“That’ll be $662.42” the cashier said.

“It hurts but it’s got to be done” Yearling said.

Another day’s end

Eight o’clock at Berkley Park and the sky-blue evening is giving way to the ink-colored night.

The team chants have been said the equipment loaded into the van and loose trash picked up. A blow of his whistle brings the players running into a circle.

Glen Yearling coach of the Berkley Timberwolves high-fives players while they run laps before practice in Norfolk on Aug. 5.

“I’m proud of you all” he says before pausing letting a rare moment of calm wash over him.

His home is a six-minute walk away but it will be a couple hours until he steps across the threshold. He has a dozen players to drop off first.

And even then his day won’t be over. He will call his former player the man in need of an air pump. Just as he said he would.

Then morning will roll around bringing the hope and uncertainty of another day. He’ll resume worrying about how to get his players the supplies they need how to keep them safe and fed how to make his budget stretch as far as possible.

But that is later. For now there is nothing to do but hold his players tight as they huddle in the fading light.

It flopped in the ratings and ruined all semblance of continuity. None of the characters were slated to attend Cal U before the ill-fated series. So what colleges were they going to? They were dispersing across the country believe it or not.

Saved by the Bell wrapped up when its characters graduated high school. Zack Morris Kelly Kapowski Screech Powers A.C. Slater Lisa Turtle and Jessie Spano were all headed off to colleges around the country. That should have been the end of it but NBC brought some of the cast back for a spinoff. Saved by the Bell: The College Years not only flopped with fans of the original series but it created serious continuity issues. So what schools were everyone headed off to before NBC picked up the spinoff? You might have figured it out; no one was slated to attend the fictional Cal U depicted in the short-lived series.

Screech and Kelly were the only ‘Saved by the Bell’ characters headed off to California colleges

Screech and Kelly were the only two characters who planned to attend schools in California. Still neither intended to go to Cal U. Screech was among the smartest people at Bayside and even beat Jessie for class valedictorian. While writers rarely mentioned his grades during the show’s four-season run his college acceptances speak for themselves. He was accepted into nine different schools including the University of California-Berkeley Duke University Clemson University and USC. Based on a cast promotional photo his character initially picked Berkeley.

Kelly was also slated to attend a California college but not Cal U. the show’s writers highlighted the Kapowski family’s financial problems several times during the show’s run. She revealed she couldn’t go to an expensive college due to finances in one episode. Kelly seemed to settle on California State University Northridge although she popped up at Cal U during the spinoff without any explanation.

Zack Lisa and Jessie were all headed to east coast schools at the end of ‘Saved by the Bell’

Zack appeared at Cal U during Saved by the Bell: The College Years but when the original series ended he was going to a real and much more prestigious school. After scoring over 1500 on his SATs his mom pushed him to apply to Ivy League schools. He was accepted at Yale and planned to attend.

Lisa and Jessie presumably attended the schools they mentioned during the final season of Saved by the Bell. Lisa headed to New York to learn about fashion at the Fashion Institute of Technology. The Peacock reboot of the series revealed that Lisa went on to become a famous fashion designer. During the reboot she lives in Paris.

Jessie originally wanted to attend Stansbury College a fictitious school. When the series came to a close Jessie agreed to enroll at Columbia University. As the reboot revealed Jessie went on to earn a Ph.D. before settling back down in California. She is currently working at Bayside High as a guidance counselor.

Slater and Tori were off to midwestern universities

Slater spent most of his childhood moving around but he found his real home as a high school student at Bayside. If Saved by the Bell: The College Years never happened he wasn’t planning to stick around though. In “Wrestling with the Future” the ninth episode of season 4 Slater is offered a wrestling scholarship to the University of Iowa. Slater wanted to attend the school although his father wanted him in New York at West Point. To make the spinoff work Slater abandoned his scholarship to attend Cal U with his buddies.

Tori Scott’s inclusion on Saved by the Bell is a point of contention with fans of the series. She appeared briefly in season 4 to replace the character of Kelly. Tori’s arrival created continuity issues but the production team did reveal her college plans during her time at Bayside. According to a cast picture Tori went off to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. U.S. News ranks the school as the 47th best national university.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGRvb3JzZmlyc3QuY29tL3dhbGxleWUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLWJhc3MtcHJvLXNob3BzLWNhYmVsYXMtbWFzdGVycy13YWxsZXllLWNpcmN1aXQtc2NoZWR1bGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Bass Pro Shops/Cabela's Masters Walleye Circuit Schedule | WalleyeFIRST,"|

Long months of negotiations over minute contractual clauses had ended and a deal to sell Zeekit to the world’s largest retailer Walmart had been wrapped up. Its estimated sale price: no less than $200 million.

“I came out of the room” Vizel tells TheMarker in an interview “and I told my partner that the deal was done we had signed. He suggested that we go out for some air and drink a toast to the event. A minute later there was a missile-alert siren and we rushed to the security room. We did our celebrating there and also called astounded family members to tell them about the deal.”

Your parents didn’t know about this beforehand?

Vizel: “No. I didn’t share during the acquisition period I wanted to wait for things to become clear. But we knew that Walmart would report the purchase the next day and it was important for me that the family hear it from me. So we sat in the security room with our young son and called them.”

And what do you do on the day after?

“You keep working as usual.”

The Walmart deal makes Vizel 36 one of the few Israeli women who have led a company from its founding to a nine-figure exit. That’s no small accomplishment in an environment where women who hold key positions in high-tech and in the business sector as a whole in the country are still a rather shocking minority.

Contrary to what one might assume Vizel relates that she is actually not such a big fan of buying clothes. “It’s no simple matter to buy clothes on the internet because you don’t really know what you’ll get. For someone who doesn’t like buying clothes Zeekit solved a problem for me.”

But Vizel wasn’t looking for a simple way to acquire a new wardrobe – she was enthralled by entrepreneurship. With her business partners Nir Appleboim and Alon Kristal she established a company in 2013 and hoped that one day when they were ready they would get a good offer from a serious company and make an exit.

“A startup always has its ears tuned” she says when asked whether the company was “on the shelf” (waiting to be bought) “especially for good offers.” In July 2020 Zeekit (“chameleon” in Hebrew) was about to launch a second campaign to raise capital. Since 2016 the company had raised from private investors among them Israelis Yanki Margalit and Avner Stepak a total of about $15 million – a minuscule amount in the business climate of recent years. The goal was to raise another $20 million which was to be earmarked for the development of new products.

But instead of investments the company started to get offers of acquisition. “Good offers substantive strategically interesting too” Vizel recalls. In order to enter into agreements with any of the companies that were making offers she notes Zeekit was compelled to put a hold on contracts with some of the clothing chains she worked with and to which she provided services.

The clients in turn began wondering about the reason for the hold. “Everyone in the industry understood that something was happening with Zeekit that the company was about to disappear and they would no longer be able to make use of its services” she says. One company that realized something was going on and that quick action was needed was Walmart.

In real stores too

Zeekit developed a virtual fitting room that makes it possible to “dress” clients and mannequins in items from the catalogs of its clients – large chains – allowing them to get a precise impression of the clothes. How precise? Zeekit’s 2019 deal with Macy’s was signed following a three-month pilot during which the American company discovered that Zeekit’s technology increased online sales by 43 percent and that not a single item purchased with its assistance was returned. Clients use Zeekit by uploading a photograph to the retailer’s system and entering their height – that’s enough for the technology to calculate the body measurements by itself. For the present Zeekit supports only a front and rear display of the body but is currently developing additional angles to enable clients to have a 360-degree view of themselves.

Some chains including Macy’s Tommy Hilfiger and ModCloth (a virtual retailer of vintage apparel that was formerly owned by Walmart) also use Zeekit in their brick-and-mortar stores. They invite their clients to be photographed in the store and to try to get an impression of what’s on offer without having to stand in line for the fitting rooms. By scanning the item’s barcode in the chain’s application the clients can see themselves wearing the item.

Until now Zeekit’s business model was based on the sale of a license for the use of technology involving the SaaS (software as a service) model – to the tune of an annual rate of hundreds of thousands of dollars per brand – with that rate set partly by the number of uploaded items and the number of users.

Zeekit also has an independent app by means of which users can try on its clients’ apparel; if they want to buy something the app directs them to the purchase pages on the appropriate sites.

“For fashion buffs our app is a carnival” Vizel says. “You can dress digitally there in clothes from a few different brands – a Gap shirt and Adidas pants say – and buy the whole outfit. Even if you wander around in a mall that has a range of stores you have to pay to take the clothes out and then go to the store across the way to complete the look. That is compatible with the Walmart idea: of being a department store of brands. Today your experience on digital platforms is that every item is presented separately with one product per page. With Zeekit you can dress yourself in several items.”

The idea to create the startup came up when Vizel and Appleboim were working together at Elbit Systems a defense electronics company. “We were involved in developing computerized vision systems for fighter planes and helicopters. We extracted the topographical structure of the terrain from radar images and overlaid it on a three-dimensional surface that we created from intelligence images which we received from a different source. We called the process ‘dressing mountains’ and one day it suddenly came to us that we could dress people the same way” Vizel explained in a previous interview with TheMarker. Their first phone call was to Alon Kristal a childhood friend of Vizel’s who was then working as a web developer.

Zeekit’s 2019 deal with Macy’s was signed following a three-month pilot during which Zeekit’s technology increased online sales by 43 percent and not a single item purchased with its assistance was returned.

“With artificial intelligence we can take entire catalogs and let the machine run on them. It reads the text that describes each item of clothing looks for the best picture of the item in the catalog and uses a series of algorithms to divide it into 80000 tiny segments which allows us to dress virtually a photograph of a model or any client in the same item of clothing in a way that is faithful to reality” Vizel explained.

Selling clothes online doesn’t sound like something that should require highly sophisticated technology.

“Even though buying clothes on the web falls under the category of fun it requires a big range of technologies. These technologies are intended to bridge the gap between the scant information that is available about the item on the website and the client’s need to obtain as much individualized accurate information as possible.”

Meaning?

“Clothes come in a very wide range of colors shapes and sizes. There is a big difference between one item of apparel and another. ‘Small’ is not an identical size everywhere not all colors are the same and customers wonder what they will look like in the clothes they see on a site. Unlike the purchase of land or of a smartphone you don’t know in advance here how suitable something you’ve bought will really be for you. It’s a little like buying food in a restaurant you’ve never visited: Until you taste the food you won’t really know whether it’s to your liking.”

And what do you offer actually?

“We give personally adjusted recommendations. Through our site you will be able to understand how the item looks on your body or on the body of a model with your measurements. You won’t have to imagine. From the company’s point of view we replace the studio productions and allow the retailer to dress hundreds of virtual figures with millions of different clothes with just a push of a button.”

You can get lost in the sea of clothes.

“When you enter Walmart’s physical or virtual store the options are almost endless. In contrast to what we might think excess choice makes decision-making difficult. What we offer the client based on their preferences and data is a range that is narrower and adjusted to the individual. From a vast pool of 38 million items we will present you with 1000 or 2000 that may suit you.”

But even so – to pay something on the order of $200 million for this?

“I think the companies understand the depth of the technology we’ve created. But that’s not all. Besides understanding the merit they saw our people as constituting something like a commando unit that will enable them to preserve relative value and a degree of innovation in technology. It’s not something that can be copied relatively easily. To succeed in dressing people you need to be an expert in many broad technologies: analysis of the human body visual analysis of products. Maximum precision is required and accordingly the level of engineering we attained encapsulates a great many secondary capabilities which are in themselves worth a great deal of money to whoever acquires the team the knowhow and the technology.”

In a world where success is sometimes a zero-sum game your accomplishment could well harm brick-and-mortar stores and malls.

“The site does not eliminate the stores. The big chains like ASOS Levi’s Tommy Hilfiger and Bloomingdales have big catalogs and they want to provide the client with personal service because the client has no time. We’re all busy we live at a faster pace than the previous generation did. The ability to buy online offers a solution for those who can’t or don’t want to shop in a store.”

‘Two sales channels’

The coronavirus pandemic which revolutionized e-commerce has provided clear corroboration of Vizel’s approach: Under the auspices of the lockdowns and social isolation and perhaps also boredom and the desire for some sort of compensation online consumerism surged – and so did the retailers’ budgets for implementing technological advances.

Vizel: “The clothing market suffered a large decline in business because people went out less often to events and to work so there was less of a need for new clothes. But everyone who sells apparel had to come up with creative solutions to adjust themselves to the changing circumstances so they could keep their head above water.

“If up until then physical stores accounted for 80 percent of the budget and 20 percent went to online commerce the proportions changed thanks to the coronavirus. The pandemic was also an opportunity for businesses to expand the scale of their online sales where profit margins are higher than in physical stores that have to be maintained. Now people are continuing to buy online in higher volume than they did before. The shake-up caused by the virus made it possible for many businesses to expand their sales infrastructure and to enjoy two active sales channels.”

Demand for the services Zeekit supplies soared within weeks of the outbreak. The small Tel Aviv-based company with its 40 employees had to pick up the pace and provide a response to a rise of thousands of percent in orders for its services in the first months of the epidemic. At the same time separately an additional process is underway: The social networks are also starting to become more oriented toward electronic commerce and the economy of social media influencers is becoming more central. For example in May 2020 Facebook declared it was launching “Shops on Instagram.”

“The giant search engines understand that the ability to simulate wearing of different brands creates a new conversation and content. You try on a garment and share it on the web asking your friends ‘How is it?’ For the social networks that capability is worth gold” Vizel explains. “As part of the same big bang and the huge demand we were also approached by a representative of Walmart to buy our services and a regular sales process took place with him. At the same time we started to get acquisition offers from other giant companies.”

Retail giants or technological ones?

From the company’s point of view we replace the studio productions and allow the retailer to dress hundreds of virtual figures with millions of different clothes with just a push of a button. Yael Vizel

“I won’t go into the identities of those who made offers I will only say that the capability that we developed is a key element in social interaction. Instead of buying a Gucci dress for $2000 a client can share from home a photo of herself with a digital dress for $5 and no one will know the difference.”

And then Walmart entered the picture as a potential buyer.

“Yes. Walmart understood that something was happening and decided to make an offer of its own. That was the most interesting offer and it contained a great many elements that we felt were more beneficial for Zeekit. For example all of our company’s employees were hired by Walmart the company is staying in Israel and it’s becoming a base for a very large technological development center under my leadership.”

Does Walmart have any special affection for Israel?

“Walmart has been active in Israel for over five years including in a program called the Bridge which connects Israeli startups to nontechnological retailers. It acquired the Israeli startup Aspectiva which has some 15 employees but there was never a critical mass of Walmart in Israel. Doug McMillon the CEO was here for a visit three years ago and he was taken to Haifa to the Matam high-tech park. There’s a building there with all the logos of the world’s big companies. He saw Amazon Google and Yahoo and asked ‘Where’s Walmart? On my next visit I want to see Walmart.’ And since then Israel has been on their radar.

“There was a certain stage when Walmart was looking for the engine that would make the push toward fashion and they encountered us at that strategic point. The development center in Israel will expand beyond that category and will provide a solution for the whole [Walmart] organization in terms of technology investments and acquisitions.”

One of the reasons for Walmart’s interest in Zeekit is naturally related to the considerable information it can collect about consumers’ preferences and choices.

“Walmart’s challenge is to expand in the clothing sector. Many clients buy their bread and cheese as well as their vegetables and home products on the web but when it comes to clothing everyone goes to their favorite brand” Vizel says. “Like its competitors it too is not a star in the realm of apparel and understands that it’s missing money that’s lying on the table. There’s a category that is not appropriate because of branding or technology. Zeekit’s technology creates a new retail reality that is appropriate for the next generation. Beyond that there’s also a possibility for contextual purchases: In other words if the company sees that you have searched for yoga pants they will also be able to suggest supplementary products like a yoga mattress a towel or a water bottle. In the category of apparel the client effectively reveals their plans and that’s an invitation to a full basket of products.”

Vizel won’t say whether Walmart made the highest offer making do with noting that it obviously “was not one of the lower ones.” From that moment negotiations were conducted in a world in which the coronavirus has been carving out the path – as she puts it. “The Walmart team knows me from the work we did together before but like everywhere in the world in this period the acquisition process took place on Zoom.”

And does it work?

“The significant thing in the transaction was the feeling that there is compatibility between the Zeekit people and the Walmart people – that we can be one team. You have to remember that the acquisition includes our company’s personnel and its culture. When that matches people learn how to feel close even via Zoom. The Walmart people gave us the feeling that we are part of them even though it’s a conglomerate with 2.5 million employees.”

Part of the feeling of belonging has to do with the fact that Zeekit employees’ contracts will include grants and bonuses.

“Yes all the employees of Zeekit stand to benefit from the sale in one form or another.”

Katrina Lake the founder of Stitch Fix which developed a personal styling service and is now being traded at a value of $6 billion acknowledged two years ago that her company always suffered from under-appraisal. She said that she had to downplay certain aspects of her operations because she found it difficult to persuade male investors that women would want to use the service. There were some who said to her “You want $2 million to buy dresses?” What was your experience like?

“I said many times that Zeekit is an AI [artificial intelligence] company in which the number of data scientists wouldn’t shame a cyber firm yet we’re still called a fashion startup and not an AI startup. Maybe because I am myself very technological and the company’s character has always been technological and not ‘fashionable’ the attitude toward us was more serious both in fundraising and in the appraisals of the company but that meant seriously explaining the company’s narrative. I always felt that our starting point looked to investors that were more ‘low tech’ as compared to cyber fintech and so on.”

We are at the height of a wave of IPOs and huge fundraising of companies that claim they want to maintain their independence. What do you think to yourself when you see this happening?

“The ability to raise capital is also largely a function of market and trends not necessarily of achievements. Every initial seed-funding round today is higher than most of the [subsequent] Series A rounds of companies that were founded five years ago. In my view what an entrepreneur does with a company is a more meaningful indication than ‘entrepreneurial ability.’”

The Zeekit-Walmart deal was finalized 10 months after negotiations began. Betwixt and between Vizel also brought a child into the world. “The discussions took place as planned and also around the birth” she says offering a glimpse into the complexities faced by young women in key positions like this. “My son was born before Christmas so I had a few days of quiet. I took a two-week maternity leave but everything proceeded according to the timetable that was set in advance. Some of the meetings took place on Zoom while I was still in the hospital.”

Entrepreneurial urge

Vizel grew up in Ramat Gan and attended Ohel Shem high school. Her mother is a lawyer and her father an electrical engineer; she’s sandwiched between two sibling-physicians and is married to a physician. “Now I’m a little less the black sheep” she laughs.

I took a two-week maternity leave but everything proceeded according to the timetable that was set in advance. Some of the meetings took place on Zoom while I was still in the hospital. Yael Vizel

She is a “graduate” of the Israel Defense Forces’ prestigious Mamram (Center of Computing and Information Systems) unit and the first woman to serve as an officer in a serious command position combining technological expertise with work in the field. During her stint in the career army she fell in love with electrical engineering and afterward majored in it at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa.

From the outset she relates she was drawn to entrepreneurship. “I like competitions and at the Technion there are quite a few entrepreneurial competitions. That was my hobby. One time I signed up for a competition in ‘agricultural tools for the next generation’ in the Faculty of Agricultural Engineering.”

Did you win?

“I came in last but I competed and that’s something too.”

On a scale of 1 to 10 what was your feeling during the negotiations with Walmart?

“As an entrepreneur I have learned over the years not to celebrate successes before they happen or are signed and sealed. From my viewpoint until it happens it doesn’t exist. I went through the whole process in a totally businesslike way without an iota of sentimentality. I can say that along the way there was more apprehension than excitement because the entrepreneurial world is such that today you think you’re about to sign a deal and tomorrow it’s not signed and you have no choice but to keep going. So we develop a protective layer – you don’t celebrate excessively and you don’t crack. You’re no longer a leaf tossed in the wind. That’s the reason I almost didn’t think about the implications of the process.”

How did you feel personally the day after the sale?

“It wasn’t easy at the level of the entrepreneurial feeling. Zeekit is like a bodily organ it’s part of me and now it’s being sold. It’s also complicated at the practical level. We are used to working in a mode where everything happens very fast and creativity bursts out all the time. The team that works in Zeekit creates and builds capabilities at a dizzying pace.

“With an acquisition things change and take more time. You have to understand the [other] organization know whom you’re working with make adjustments reorient. On the other hand the door to a huge audience has now been opened for us. The influence that Zeekit’s capabilities have when they are assimilated into a corporation of this size is unparalleled.”

It’s not easy to work with a giant corporation.

“Walmart actually intends to maintain Zeekit as an independent company. We were not dismantled. We will have absolute independence in recruiting employees. In the life of a startup you can’t allow yourself to spread out because there isn’t always time or money. Now we have that.”

Throughout the interview Vizel carefully projects a business-as-usual attitude. Not to allow the fact that just two months ago she signed a huge deal that put tens of millions of dollars in her pocket to disrupt either her worldview or her agenda. “I believe in being a working woman. I haven’t changed anything in my life and I still drive my Hyundai i10.”

You’ve become a member of the multimillionaires’ club.

“I want to believe and I’m working with myself on this that things won’t change now either. Professional life is what interests me. I want to get up in the morning and go to work and I am happy in what i do. It’s exciting when one of the world’s biggest companies wants your technology too and also me as a manager.”

The money doesn’t blind you?

“There’s a sigh of relief. But that money arrives after years of living in a state of high tension in which entrepreneurs earn significantly less than the average certainly compared to the world of high-tech and plenty of personal costs are paid.”

Did you buy anything special after signing?

“No. Well actually I bought moisturizing cream that I’d always wanted but was expensive for me – 70 shekels [$22] a tube. After the acquisition I bought it for myself and for my mother my mother-in-law my sister and my son’s nanny.”

Wow you really went wild.

“Totally. I don’t think the money will change me. I don’t want that to happen. I will think very highly of myself if I remain a modest person.”

What’s next? Will you be a Walmart employee until retirement?

“The entrepreneurship feeling is still there and always will be. It hasn’t cooled and will certainly burst out. It’s only a matter of time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2JvbWItdGhyZWF0LWV2YWN1YXRlcy13YWxtYXJ0LXBvcnQtYW5nZWxlcy9CQklTQVpYWVVaQkNYREZHS05SMlRFV002TS_SAXZodHRwczovL3d3dy5raXJvNy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9ib21iLXRocmVhdC1ldmFjdWF0ZXMtd2FsbWFydC1wb3J0LWFuZ2VsZXMvQkJJU0FaWFlVWkJDWERGR0tOUjJURVdNNk0vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bomb threat evacuates Walmart in Port Angeles,"We’re Sorry!

I worked at Walt Disney World in Orlando Florida for two years and it was a total dream come true.

I often fondly look back at things that made it so special but like with any job there are also some things I'm glad to be done with.

Read on for the top things I miss and don't miss about working at Disney World.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

It was a pleasure making kids' dreams come true every day

The kids' faces would light up every show at Disney Junior Dance Party. Kayleigh Price

While I was at Disney I encountered little kids having the best day ever every shift.

Whether their day was magical because they ate an entirely too big ice-cream sundae met a beloved Disney character or rode one of their favorite rides I loved being able to see the purest smiles on their faces.

One of my favorite things about working at the Disney Junior Dance Party in Hollywood Studios was seeing the kids' eyes light up when they saw Mickey Mouse on stage. They would yell ""It's Mickey!"" and wave or jump up and down to get his attention.

It felt really full circle because it was amazing to be a small part of the same magic that I experienced going to the parks as a kid.

I totally felt like I was part of the Disney family

Every job I've had has always claimed to be a ""work family"" but I've never felt that as much as I did at Disney.

Advertisement

In each location I worked across the parks I felt like I was a part of a family. There's something so special about the Disney community and it was really easy for me to get along with and befriend my coworkers.

Since many of my coworkers like me moved away from their family and friends to work at the parks people were really eager to hang out outside of work and build a home away from home.

Even though I'm no longer working for the company those coworkers are still some of my closest friends.

I definitely miss the days when work didn't feel like work

I genuinely had fun most days I worked. Kayleigh Price

There were countless days when I would sit back and think ""Wow I'm getting paid to do this?""

Advertisement

When I worked at Disney Junior Dance Party I got paid to dance alongside kids and their favorite Disney characters. At Magic Kingdom there were some days I got paid to watch the fireworks or parades.

Whenever there was downtime at one of my locations our managers would tell us to go make ""magical moments"" which could include hula-hooping with kids blowing bubbles passing out stickers trading pins or letting the guests in through the FastPass lines.

Those were my favorite days and they always made me feel so lucky to be a Disney employee.

I witnessed so many life-changing moments on regular workdays

People go to Disney for all sorts of celebrations — proposals Make-A-Wish trips honeymoons family reunions baby announcements graduations birthdays — and as a park employee I was part of so many of them.

Advertisement

When I worked in Magic Kingdom I would see proposals happen in front of Cinderella Castle all the time. It was amazing to witness such a life-changing moment especially if I got to gift them with celebratory buttons treats or merchandise afterward.

When I worked at Disney Junior Dance Party I was there when a child communicated his first words to his parents during the show.

When I worked at Star Wars Launch Bay in Hollywood Studios I was able to see a child on his Make-A-Wish trip fulfill his dream of meeting all of his favorite ""Star Wars"" characters.

The list goes on and I loved that Disney was the place where all of these dreams came true.

There were perks to the job when it came to discounts and special privileges

I got to experiences some new lands and attractions early. Kayleigh Price

Outside of the job being fulfilling working at Walt Disney World came with a lot of benefits that I of course miss.

Related stories

This included free admission to the theme parks; merchandise discounts; free backstage tours; early previews to new rides resorts and movies; exclusive meet and greets; and resort discounts.

I used these as much as I could while I was working there but I definitely wish I still had some of those perks since I still visit the parks so frequently.

On the other hand I definitely don't miss the Florida weather

Calling Florida the ""Sunshine State"" is extremely deceiving.

Advertisement

Before moving there I only ever lived in Illinois so running away from the blustery Chicago winters to the seemingly sunny Orlando area seemed like the better option.

I was so wrong.

The Florida weather is unlike anything I've ever experienced. It rains every day. When it's not raining it's extremely humid so forget trying to have a good hair day.

When it came to working at Disney World I didn't enjoy getting wet almost every day. I always had to have a poncho and an extra pair of shoes and socks ready to go.

My head would spin explaining some difficult Disney concepts to guests

There's a lot that goes into planning a Disney vacation. For first-time visitors it can be very overwhelming so it's the park employees' jobs to explain everything the best they can — which isn't always easy.

For example while I was working at Disney's Hollywood Studios the park introduced a brand-new virtual-queue system for its popular ""Star Wars"" attraction Rise of the Resistance.

Everyone who came to the park wanted to ride it but there wouldn't be enough time in the day considering how many people were flocking to Hollywood Studios so Disney came up with the idea for guests to sign up for ""boarding groups"" so they could virtually hold their place in line while they did other things.

The system was confusing for us employees who'd never dealt with anything like it before so you can only imagine how confusing it was for the guests.

Advertisement

This was one of many complicated Disney concepts that I had to painstakingly explain throughout my day and I didn't even work at the ride.

Some of the other common concepts I was constantly explaining include the FastPass system that allows guests to wait in shorter lines and the Disney dining plan that allows people to prepay for meal packages.

Not every guest interaction was magical

When guests come to Disney they have high expectations — as they should Disney is marketed as the ""Most Magical Place on Earth"" after all.

But when these expectations aren't met all of the blame and responsibly seems to fall on the park employees who have to step in to solve it as best they can.

Advertisement

There were days when I'd get yelled at or belittled because something didn't work out the way the guest planned. This is definitely one of the things I miss the least about working at Disney because it really got to me.

I just wanted everyone to enjoy their trip but sometimes that's not possible.

Spending all your time in big crowds can take a lot out of you

I was around so many people every day at work. Kayleigh Price

The crowds definitely got overwhelming at Disney.

I worked three holiday seasons the opening of Galaxy's Edge in Hollywood Studios and the opening of Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway at Hollywood Studios so I was there during some of the parks' busiest times.

Advertisement

My job included a lot of crowd control and my coworkers and I would be in charge of trying to make sure guests were in the right spot. Sometimes this meant holding them in certain areas or trying to control the speed at which they entered others.

It was very hard to control the chaos. At times it could be fun but crowd control often led to negative guest situations which made my job harder.

It was the most physically exhausting job I've ever done

All of the different jobs I had at Disney involved long periods on my feet and a lot of walking.

My shifts were anywhere from six to 15 hours and after each one my feet were extremely sore. One of my jobs also involved dancing along with kids and I loved it but it felt like taking multiple Zumba classes every day.

I was probably in the best shape of my life and my daily step count had never been higher but it got exhausting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9mYW1pbHkvc2VjcmV0LXRoaW5ncy1kby13YWx0LWRpc25leS13b3JsZC00NDUyNjQ0N9IBU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2ZhbWlseS9zZWNyZXQtdGhpbmdzLWRvLXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLTQ0NTI2NDQ3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Secret Things to Do at Walt Disney World,"It's hard to imagine anyone getting bored of Walt Disney World.

One of the major protocols put in place when the Resorts reopened to Guests was a reduction in capacity.

However as we continue to move forward both Disney World and Disneyland have increased their capacity since first reopening all while still monitoring the ongoing pandemic and following recommendations from the CDC.

Now it seems that capacity will increase once again.

During the Walt Disney World Q3 earnings call earlier this week Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy touched on capacity at the Disney Parks indicating that capacity increase will be aggressive but also highly monitored as we continue to move through the pandemic.

McCarthy stated during the earnings call “This is an ever-changing landscape with COVID. We’re going to be particularly careful and also going to bring our capacity online aggressively but measured.”

With all of this being said we were curious as to how Guests and fans felt about Disney Parks increasing capacity again.

Inside the Magic reader J. commented on our article expressing:

I’m all for increasing capacity as another step toward normalcy but please open all the shows restaurants parades amenities etc. in order to spread the crowds back out so the lines aren’t as long.

And Facebook follower Grise T. said:

Too crowded right now. Imagine when this happens

Christy P. recently visited Disney World and shared their experience:

I was the a few weeks ago and sure felt like capacity had already been SIGNIFICANTLY increased! Long lines for everything at every park every day. Not just for rides but even 20 minutes to get a pretzel…

Lorri H. also recently visited Disney World and expressed it felt the theme parks were already at full capacity though it is important to keep in mind that Disney has not confirmed either Resort is operating at 100% capacity:

When we were there seemed to be already at capacity..

This is something another Inside the Magic fan Melissa A. echoed:

I’m here now and it feels like business as usual

John P. expressed some concerns writing;

Yeah increase capacity especially when there’s outbreaks of COVID-19 in Florida great job!!

And lastly Siobhan P. commented on our recent article expressing some of their concerns:

Glad I’m not going anytime soon. We went in December 2020 when the parks were still at 35% capacity. They had some trouble keeping tabs on masks and controlling things then and safety/belligerance incidents have only increased since then. Not sure that they can control the crowds’ safety with increased capacity.

Again please keep in mind that Walt Disney World Resort was given the “green light” to return to full capacity months ago when Florida Governor DeSantis allowed for it but Disney World has not yet confirmed it increased to operating at full capacity. At this time we do know that they have and will continue to increase their Park capacity and the last confirmed number released was 35% capacity though we do know Disney World has admitted to increasing its capacity since then and we are unsure of what the exact number is at this time.

In regards to Disneyland Resort we know the theme parks are also operating at a reduced capacity in California. On June 15 Governor Newsom lifted the state’s COVID-19 restrictions allowing Disneyland to operate as usual once again but like Disney World in Florida Disneyland is not yet operating at full capacity but they are gradually continuing to increase capacity.

If you are planning a visit to Walt Disney World or Disneyland Resort be sure to read the official rules and regulations prior to traveling. You can find Disney World’s safety rules here and Disneyland’s safety regulations here.

Located adjacent to Epcot's Mission: SPACE attraction Space 220 will offer guests ""amazing meals and a spectacular view"" with large picture windows providing a simulated vista similar to what astronauts see from aboard the International Space Station (the name of the restaurant comes from the altitude at which the ISS circles Earth).

""Space 220 is a perfect addition to EPCOT continuing our legacy of original storytelling — fantastical experiences rooted in real science and designed with a range of world-class experts that makes you wonder ""how'd they do that?!"" wrote Riddley.

The new table-service experience operated by the Patina Restaurant Group will feature internationally-inspired cuisine more than 1000 bottles of the world's finest wines and a wide selection of craft beer. But before guests can partake in the space food and drinks they have to be transported to orbit first.

""One of my first experiences as a kid was experiencing the Hydrolators — those magical conveyances in The Living Seas Pavilion that took you down to Sea Base Alpha. That experience moved me (quite literally) and sparked this magic of possibility we talk about with EPCOT"" recalled Riddley. ""This space elevator experience is our generation's entry into this rich legacy of inspiration that will define the future of EPCOT and a perfect addition to World Discovery!""

Space 220 was originally scheduled to open in 2019 but the pandemic delayed the debut until now. The opening in mid-September comes just weeks before Walt Disney World kicks off ""The World's Most Magical Celebration"" on Oct. 1 marking the resort's 50th anniversary.

Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani made a short speech to the nation in which he said he was putting all his focus on avoiding further instability as the Taliban makes rapid advances and circles in on the capital Kabul.

The future of his Ghani's government has come under doubt as the Taliban has seized control of major cities including Kandahar and Herat.

Here's his speech in full:

""In the name of Allah

Brothers and sisters Salam.

Our country Afghanistan is facing serious threats of instability. I am fully aware of the situation in the country.

I offer condolences to the families of fallen soldiers and civilians and wish quick recovery to the wounded ones.

We endeavor to reach all displaced people in the best way possible.

I praise the Afghan National Defense and Security Force (ANDSF) for their bravery and efforts for defending nations and also the nation for supporting their forces.

At the current situation our priority is coordination of ANDSF and this endeavor. We are taking serious steps.

I am aware of your concerns about your present and future I would like to assure you that as your president all my focus is to avoid further instability aggression and displacement.

As a historic responsibility I will endeavor not to allow the current war to further kill innocent people and to lose their 20-year gains and destroy public property.

UNDP GEF

The waste in Ha Long Bay an area which is known as the Dragon’s Jewels is generated mainly by the local tourism and fishing industries.

So far 1000 tonnes of plastic waste have been properly separated and 150 tonnes collected by freelance waste workers as part of a Global Environment Fund project which is implemented by the UN Development Programme (UNDP).

“Previously we didn’t know how to separate the waste how to compost or why we need to reduce plastic” says farmer Đinh Thị Luyến. “We have been provided with material and equipment; we are so thankful.”

He won the U.S. Junior Amateur in 2003 and competed on both the 2005 and 2009 Walker Cup teams. Harman played his first full PGA Tour season in 2012 and has been a steady contender ever since notching wins in 2014 at the John Deere Classic and in 2017 at the Wells Fargo Championship.

“It’s just hard to win” Harman told hosts Colt Knost and Drew Stoltz in this week’s episode of Subpar. “It’s really really hard to win because you have to beat a PGA Tour player that’s having the week of their life every week.”

To claim his first victory Harman had to beat local favorite Steve Stricker at the John Deere. For his second victory Harman had to hole an absolute bomb (28 feet!) for birdie on the 72nd hole to pull ahead of Dustin Johnson who was gunning for an historic fourth-straight victory and Pat Perez.

As Harman relived his winning moment for Knost and Stoltz he explained that Johnson and Perez were hanging around for a potential playoff and were watching the action on the final hole from the locker room.

“I hit kind of a marginal chip and both of them were getting ready to go out to the range” Harman said. “So I make the putt and Dustin looks at Pat and says ‘What happens now?’

“And Pat’s like “We go home! That’s what happens now!”

Harman’s impersonation of Johnson and Perez had the hosts rolling but according to Harman “Pat tells the story much better than I do.”

The traditionally in-person relationships with banks have been permanently altered by the pandemic resulting in a hybrid future for the industry that looks more flexible – both for both customers and employees – than in the past.“We’ve been as agile as possible trying to adapt and put client safety and employee safety at the top of our priority list. But the pandemic has also allowed for us to really become more innovative on how we interact with our customers” Hamed Tavajohi Los Angeles market leader for U.S. Bank said. “I would say how we’ve evolved over the past 18 months at U.S. Bank that probably would have been a five-year process under normal circumstances.”The bank recently reopened a newly remodeled branch at 14500 Roscoe Blvd. in Panorama City. It features a “digital discovery center” where bankers can demonstrate the bank’s mobile app and a video capability to see the banker for Zoom-like interactions.“In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the branch incorporates design changes focused on protecting the health of customers and employees including plexiglass barriers anti-microbial surfaces and signage to encourage social distancing” the bank said in a statement.Seven additional remodels at other Los Angeles County branches including one in Sylmar are currently underway.Fintech upgradeU.S. Bank and Wells Fargo & Co. as well as other regional banks and credit unions have invested heavily in upgrading financial technology over the course of the pandemic. In addition to developing the capacity to host virtual consulting appointments and creating digital tools for sending cashiers checks major banks have worked to create hybrid work arrangements at local branches. For employees this means a portion of jobs will remain fully remote as some basic in-branch services shift to digital kiosks and online transactions. For consumers more services are available through apps and specialty advisors remain present in the office for drop-in and appointment consultations.“We have rolled out what we call the interactive teller machines which is think of a very enhanced ATM that allows you to pay bills to cash checks and to get multiple denominations” Tavajohi said. “So if somebody wants to come and do that transaction they can go to the ATM. If they’re looking for advice or guidance – from retirement to helping their small business to applying for a mortgage – having that one-on-one interaction and allowing space for that is really important to us.”At Wells Fargo as well as smaller financial institutions such as Premier America Credit Union headquartered in Chatsworth and Bank of Santa Clarita similar physical and digital improvements have been made over the last 18 months including multiple rounds of digital app updates.“We have continually invested in two key areas the first being our digital capabilities” said Robin Choi region bank president of Wells Fargo. “We’ve added functionalities that didn’t exist before simply because so many of our customers simply did not or could not come into our branches. … The second area where we’re investing a lot of energy is a lot of customers are still coming into the branches but they’re coming into branches for different things. For a lot of the transactional visits our mobile platform is able to address pretty much all of them but they are coming in for deeper conversations. So we’ve been spending a lot of time delivering new training new content that goes a little bit deeper into aspects of one’s financial future so that we can do a better job setting our customers up on a proper path that they can be successful.”Community outreachBoth Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank representatives said their institutions have invested significantly in programs to increase financial literacy and promote volunteerism among bank employees. U.S. Bank will make a $5000 donation to Plummer Elementary School to design and install murals throughout the North Hills campus at the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year. The bank also plans to collaborate with Plummer Elementary’s Parent Center to provide financial literacy courses in English and Spanish. The school donation program is in conjunction with the Panorama City branch reopening.Wells Fargo has launched its National Unbanked Advisory Taskforce as well as financial literacy courses in local communities to improve banking service for traditionally underserved populations.While the pandemic highlighted the role of banking professionals and the need for responsive service Choi said the last year has underscored the importance of community-focused banking and the strength of essential workers.“I’m sure that my colleagues at the banks will share the same sentiment but as a leader in a very essential role within the banking industry we were open throughout the pandemic. We remain open for our customers and our employees have been customer-facing the whole time” Choi said. “I don’t even know that the word inspiring can fully capture the sentiment that I have inside how employees across the service industry rose to the challenge of COVID-19 and everything else that has happened over the course of these last 18 months. To me it speaks to the best aspects of the human spirit.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzcGVudGltZXMuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvb2JpdHVhcnktZGF2aWQtYy13b29kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: David C.

The S&P 500 is now hovering at 4468 while the Dow is now above 35515. For its part the Dow was buoyed by gains in Disney which rallied on the heels of its quarterly earnings results. The Nasdaq also climbed higher.

Investors pushed stocks into record territory despite data that reveals consumer sentiment is dropping. According to the University of Michigan’s preliminary data the consumer sentiment index fell to 70.2 in August its weakest point in about a decade and down from a reading of higher than 81 last month. Wells Fargo economists described the results as “disastrous.” Economists are blaming the rise of the delta variant for the dampened mood.

So far investors have managed to see the glass half full thanks to largely better than expected second-quarter earnings out of corporate America. While valuations are lofty Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni on CNBC likened the current environment to that of the “roaring twenties on Wall Street” suggesting that investors “buy a little bit of everything.”

On Sunday evening stock index futures are retreating across the board amid global unrest as Afghanistan falls to the Taliban. The U.S. Afghan embassy has since been relocated.

Stocks to Watch

SoFi Technologies sank 14% on Friday after the fintech company reported a wider-than-expected Q2 loss despite a doubling of net revenue. A lockup period on the stock for select shareholders is reportedly coming to a close in the coming days which could have pressured the stock. SoFi has been bolstering its crypto trading offering.

ContextLogic which runs the e-commerce platform Wish tumbled nearly 20% on Friday. Wish is being hit by a one-two punch weaker demand and rising costs.

Look Ahead

Earnings season is winding down with just over 10% of companies in the S&P 500 still waiting to report their results. Separately the bitcoin price is perched above the USD 47K level once again so investors might want to keep an eye on the cryptocurrency.

On Tuesday retail sales for the month of July will be released. Wells Fargo economists are predicting a slowdown in sales growth not least due to the delta variant which has thrown a wrench into plans for the economy to reopen more fully.

Meanwhile industrial production and housing starts for July come out on Tuesday and Thursday respectively.

Comparison Products

We put Gigabyte’s Aorus Gen4 7000s against a few other Phison E18-based competitors including the Corsair MP600 Pro and Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus. We also threw in the Samsung 980 Pro WD_Black SN850 and Crucial P5 Plus as well as a few high-end PCIe Gen3 performers the Samsung 970 EVO Plus and SK Hynix Gold P31.

Game Scene Loading - Final Fantasy XIV

Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers is a free real-world game benchmark that easily and accurately compares game load times without the inaccuracy of using a stopwatch.

Having scored similar to that of the Corsair and Sabrent the Aorus Gen4 7000s delivered average results for an E18-based SSD with Micron’s 96L TLC flash in this game loading benchmark. It isn’t quite as responsive as the WD_Black SN850 or the Samsung 980 Pro though.

We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom dataset. We copy a 50GB dataset including 31227 files of various types like pictures PDFs and videos to a new folder and then follow-up with a reading test of a newly-written 6.5GB zip file.

The Gen4 7000s delivered solid file copy results but its results weren’t quite as impressive due to a bit slower random performance than the WD_Black SN850 or Samsung 980 Pro. However the Gen4 7000s delivered one of the highest throughput results when tasked with reading back our large .zip file.

Trace Testing – PCMark 10 Storage Test

PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and everyday tasks to measure the performance of storage devices. The quick benchmark is more relatable to those who use their PCs for leisure or basic office work while the full benchmark relates more to power users.

The Gen4 7000s outperformed the Gen3 competitors but fell behind not only the Samsung 980 Pro and WD Black but also the Crucial P5 Plus in both the Quick System Drive and Full System Drive benchmarks. While it can deliver fast and responsive sequential speeds its average performance in random workloads holds it back in this application.

Synthetic Testing - ATTO / CrystalDiskMark

ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products. Both of these tools give us insight into how each device handles different file sizes.

Gigabyte’s Aorus Gen4 7000s followed the same performance pattern as the other Phison E18-based competitors when testing out various block sizes in ATTO. It also topped the charts in CDM in terms of sequential throughput. Random write performance is a strong suit of the Gen4 7000s but its random read speed could be improved.

Sustained Write Performance & Cache Recovery

Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache which is a fast area of (usually) pseudo-SLC programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the ""native"" TLC or QLC flash. We use iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds.

The Aorus Gen4 7000s delivered solid sequential write performance out of the gate but was no match for the Samsung 980 Pro or WD_Black SN850. After writing roughly 112GB of data at a rate of 5.6 GBps sustained write performance degraded to 1.1 GBps. Around the 670 second mark after writing just 831GB the Gen4 7000s degraded once more to a slower speed of 690 MBps for the remainder of the test. It did not recover any of the SLC cache in our idle rounds that range up to 30 minutes. Instead it continued to write at roughly 1.1GBps after each idle period.

Power Consumption and Temperature

We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade. Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly ultimately saving energy.

We also monitor the drive’s temperature via the S.M.A.R.T. data and an IR thermometer to see when (or if) thermal throttling kicks in and how it impacts performance. Bear in mind that results will vary based on the workload and ambient air temperature.

In terms of power efficiency the Gen4 7000s scores higher than the Crucial P5 Plus and Samsung 970 EVO Plus but isn’t quite as efficient as the best drives lagging by a large margin due to its heavy power consumption.

At least the 7000s didn’t consume too much power at idle. At idle in a 24 degree Celsius room the 7000s remained cool at around 30-33 degrees Celsius. Under load the peak temperature at the heatsink surface measured roughly 56 degrees Celsius after transferring 500GB to the SSD from another NVMe SSD.

Bureau of Land Management/Flickr

On a cool Monday morning in the Coast Range an excavator lodged in what seemed an impossible spot deftly set down massive Douglas fir logs into a creek bed to preserve fish habitat.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

It was a pretty impressive show.

Grahm Trask of Corvallis was at the controls of the excavator which had crunched a half-mile or so up a trail from the parking lot at Clemens Park southwest of Corvallis near Alsea.

The best viewing point was from a nearby bridge over Seeley Creek. Trask was working with a pile of logs donated to the project by Oregon State University’s research forests Weyerhaeuser Benton County and Lincoln County.

Circling and pivoting and ducking the streamside alders with his bucket Trask looked like he was playing a game of pick-up sticks. He started the pile with a log going straight across the bed aligned others with an adroitly placed stump tucked other logs underneath previously placed ones and produced a pile that looked like chaos.

“You made a mess. Good job man” said Paul Olmsted an assistant fish biologist with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Chaos it turns out is what you want for the coho salmon and other fish that use this tributary of the Alsea River.

""We're trying to improve stream complexity"" Olmsted told the Corvallis Gazette-Times. ""It's a good coho stream already. It's got good gravel but there is a lack of large wood. We'll be better off once the wood goes in. We want to force the water to move around scour and make ponds undercut a bank and add complexity.

“We want to create side channels and produce a lot more places for fish to rear and feed and hang out.”

“It’s a fun little puzzle that you are trying to put together” said Trask once he had exited the cab. “Every structure is a little bit different. You are trying to make it stable so the logs won’t move … you don’t want it to blow the bridge out.”

The drop Monday was the first of what will be more than 20 such placements of logs on Seeley Creek. More than 200 Doug fir logs will be placed along about a mile of streambed.

Some of the logs were charred and blackened in last fall’s Echo Mountain Fire in Lincoln County but Olmsted said they will still serve well for this work.

In addition to the stream drops the project also will include riparian plantings on the creek banks of cedar hemlock willow and big leaf maple. More than 400 of the trees will be planted in January and February Olmsted said “so they can get established by spring.”

The project uses Douglas firs for the stream drops said Adam Stebbins national resources coordinator for Benton County Parks because they “naturally degrade” over about a 25- to 30-year period.

“That’s how long it has been” Olmsted said of the need for the restoration. “So we go back in and re-treat. The more wood we’re leaving the better.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hochul promised on CNN that she will follow “ironclad policies” aimed at ensuring that her work and that of her husband — William Hochul Jr. an executive at Delaware North — will not create ethically problematic circumstances.

Since her spouse previously served as a prosecutor the Hochuls have had practice maintaining a framework in which their work is “very separate” she claimed.

“My husband was a federal prosecutor for 30 years so even when I was in Congress we were well-accustomed to keeping our work very separate” Hochul said on State of the Union.

“He served as Barack Obama’s US Attorney for eight years so no one can touch the integrity with which we brought to our positions in the past and currently.”

Still Hochul noted that she consulted “outside ethic experts” to form clear-cut rules separating her job and her husband’s.

“I understand concerns and I’ve reached out to outside ethics experts to come up with these ironclad policies so no one will ever question that there’s any involvement of my husband and anything pertaining to the state of New York” she said.

The lieutenant governor is slated to replace disgraced Gov. Andrew Cuomo amid his sex-harassment scandal. Her husband serves as general counsel and senior vice president at Delaware North.

The Buffalo-based company owns and operates casinos in New York state and elsewhere and manages government-contracted concessions at venues such as state parks.

Hochul as governor can choose who helms the New York State Gaming Commission which regulates gambling venues in the state.

She will also control the New York State Thruway Authority and New York’s Office of Parks and Recreation. Both entities have provided business to her husband’s employer though a representative for Delaware North previously told The Post that its contract with the New York State Thruway ended in July.

The potential conflict of interest should be at the “top of the list” of matters that Hochul addresses on her first days as governor said Richard Painter former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush previously to The Post.

“She’s got to have [a] recusal” Painter said. “She has to stay out of anything having to do with gaming. Not only she but she should make sure the governor’s office stays out of any issue that would affect this company.”

The Buffalo News subsequently reported that the lieutenant governor’s husband would keep his position — though the company said he’d recuse himself from matters that are potentially ethically murky for the pair.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMTQvaXBvLXVuZGVyd3JpdGluZy1td3ZiZS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWZpcm1zLWdldHRpbmctc2VhdC1hdC10aGUtdGFibGUuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzA4LzE0L2lwby11bmRlcndyaXRpbmctbXd2YmUtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1maXJtcy1nZXR0aW5nLXNlYXQtYXQtdGhlLXRhYmxlLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minorities and women are finally getting a seat at the IPO underwriting table,"Cynthia DiBartolo CEO Tigress Financial Partners at the New York Stock Exchange. Source: NYSE

Robinhood's highly anticipated IPO last month was led by Wall Street heavy hitters Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase . But the extensive list of underwriters also included boutique minority-owned firms Ramirez & Co. and Siebert Williams Shank. Of the 17 firms that helped underwrite the offering four were owned by minorities women or military veterans a category known as MWVBEs. It's becoming a trend: 13 of the 25 biggest IPOs of U.S. tech companies in the past year included two or more such firms according to FactSet. Tech companies and Wall Street banks long run and controlled predominantly by white men came under intense pressure in mid-2020 to improve their diversity after the police murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests that followed. Companies made promises to do better creating social justice philanthropic programs commiting to more diverse hiring practices and adding internships for minority candidates among other moves. At the time the IPO market was still mostly closed from the Covid-19 shutdowns and subsequent economic downturn. It slowly reopened in July and August and then flung open in September when Snowflake held the largest U.S. software offering on record. In Snowflake's IPO the cloud database vendor included four MWVBEs as underwriters — the same four that Robinhood later used. Unity's share sale which came right after Snowflake's had two of the firms. Airbnb 's IPO in December included a dozen.

Despite the progress Cynthia DiBartolo isn't ready to celebrate. Over 35 years after entering the finance industry and a decade after founding investment firm Tigress Financial Partners DiBartolo has emerged as a fierce advocate for women and minority participation in deal-making. Even though Robinhood added four firms to its roster of underwriters DiBartolo said that for a company touting its role in democratizing investing the opportunity was there to make a real splash. ""While we applaud what they did I think they could've brought in more firms to make it more inclusive and make an bigger statement"" DiBartolo said in an interview. ""Long before Robinhood existed long before anyone heard of that company diverse firms were fighting to bring equality of opportunity to diverse investors. We didn't have the balance sheet or fire power of a Robinhood."" In July Tigress became the first disabled- and woman-owned floor broker to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange. Previously her firm was among five MWVBEs that served as underwriters for cloud software vendor Monday.com's IPO. Now DiBartolo is working to make sure that the dozens of firms like hers get a regular seat at the table. DiBartolo created what she calls a diversity questionnaire or request for information (RFI) for participation in offerings. The objective she said is make it easier for companies selling stock issuing debt or doing share buybacks to vet minority and women-owned firms. American Airlines she said has already sent the RFI to firms in the category for future deals.

'Everyone has reputational risk'

JPMorgan is taking her work a step further DiBartolo said. The bank is collecting the data from the questionnaires filled out by MWVBEs to build a database that can automate the due diligence process for its clients. DiBartolo said she's talking to other Wall Street banks about doing something similar. A JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed the process is underway. ""JPMorgan's goal is to expand the opportunity for more minority- and women-led firms to be included in debt and equity capital markets issuances"" the company said in an email. ""We are building a searchable database based on a streamlined industry RFI which will allow us to evaluate better the strengths and capabilities each firm has to offer our issuer clients."" The RFI asks firms to fill out details about their principals the work they've done their expertise and whether there are any legal or regulatory issues that need to be disclosed. ""Everyone has reputational risk"" DiBartolo said. ""You want to know who the firms are who's behind them how much of the workforce is diverse what's the regulatory history and is there any pending litigation. These are all questions you should ask."" DiBartolo is part of other organizations taking different approaches to diversify deal making. At Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr.'s Rainbow PUSH Coalition an organization fighting for social justice DiBartolo is chairperson of the steering committee for financial services. Inside Rainbow PUSH is a 25-year-old group called The Wall Street Project which advocates for women- and minority-owned businesses in finance. Rebecca Cruz director of business development at the project said anytime she reads about a U.S. company that's raising $100 million or more in an IPO she sends a letter to the CEO and CFO. In the letter she encourages the companies to consider including some of the eight minority-owned firms that are members of the organization providing some detail on what the MWVBEs have accomplished. Cruz said she follows news clips and press releases about confidential IPO filings so she can reach companies before their prospectuses get published to get the conversations started earlier. ""We're not pressuring them we're saying it's good for business to include these firms on the transaction"" she said. ""The companies that we work with all have proven themselves on Wall Street in transactions. These aren't fly-by-night firms."" Many of the firms have been around for decades managing money for clients trading underwriting municipal bond sales and corporate debt deals and in some cases doing proprietary research. While they're a tiny fraction of the size of the Wall Street giants and are even much smaller than well-known mid-market firms like William Blair Raymond James and Piper Jaffray Cruz is out to show companies that it's not just a good public relations decision to add diversity to their underwriter list. It's also good business that brings opportunities to reach different classes of investors.

Siebert Williams Shank was formed in a 2019 merger of two firms founded in the 1990s Siebert Cisneros Shank the Williams Capital Group. The firm has been very active over the past 12 months helping underwrite IPOs for Robinhood Krispy Kreme  Marqeta  Oatly  Bumble  Affirm  Airbnb and many others. Sobani Warner is the head of equities at Siebert Williams Shank and was director of equity at Williams starting in 2000. She said that while the firm in its various parts has been underwriting equity deals for two decades there's been a clear sea-change in the past year and a half as shareholders and activist groups have been demanding stronger action towards diversity. ""The tech companies along with companies in a variety of industries perhaps all industries are seeking to play their part in this really positive transition we're going through"" Warner said in an interview.

Improving economics

Still firms like Siebert Williams Shank tend to get a tiny combined sliver of the overall IPO. An analysis of fee data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and CNBC published last year showed that between 2016 and the first half of 2020 MWVBEs each made about $167620 per IPO and secondary offering compared to $1.4 million per deal for middle-market firms. Warner said there has been ""positive movement"" in deal economics recently though she didn't provide specifics. More important than the revenue from any specific offering she said is the opportunity to show what these firms can offer a company so the relationship is there when its time for debt financing strategic advisory help and even share buybacks. ""This is a good way for us to get to know them and for them to understand our capabilities"" Warner said. ""The IPO is perhaps the first transaction we do but the expectation is that the IPO will be the first of many.""

Marqeta celebrates IPO at the Nasdaq on June 9th 2021. Source: The Nasdaq

Payment-tech company Marqeta based in Oakland California provides one potential example. When Marqeta was gearing up for its public market debut earlier this year the company turned to Lise Buyer an adviser to pre-IPO companies for help in navigating the expansive universe of potential underwriters. Seth Weissman Marqeta's chief legal officer said he and finance chief Tripp Faix asked Buyer for the top 10 minority and women-owned firms. From there they did some research and narrowed the list to six. In the bakeoff among those firms Marqeta chose two: Siebert Williams Shank and Seelaus a woman-owned firm based in New Jersey. ""You can actually reach different investors and give people who otherwise might not get a shot at the opportunity to get in on an IPO"" Weissman said. ""What you're counting on is they don't bring the same set of investors to the table every single time."" Weissman said that location played a big role in its choice of Siebert Williams Shank which is co-headquartered in Oakland. Early in the pandemic Marqeta launched an initiative to help small businesses in Oakland that were hurt by the Covid-19 shutdowns. For Seelaus the Marqeta deal is one of eight billion-dollar-plus tech IPOs the firm has been part of in the past year according to FactSet. Prior to that it was only involved in two of that size: Lyft and Peloton  both in 2019. ""We have a much bigger seat at the table in the equity capital market which is really exiting"" said Annie Seelaus whose father founded the firm in 1984. She joined in 2009 and was named CEO in 2015. Seelaus said a confluence of events in 2020 started to turn the tide. The push for diversity and inclusion alongside the broader social justice movement was clearly important she said. Last week the SEC approved new Nasdaq rules that will require companies listing on the exchange to meet gender and racial diversity requirement for their boards or explain in writing why they haven't. Meanwhile Seelaus said the emergence of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) created a whole new market for a different type of IPO. SPACs raised a record $83.4 billion in 2020 and exceeded that number in the first three months of this year. So far in 2021 they've raised $121.2 billion almost nine times the amount for all of 2019 according to SPAC Research. In a SPAC a blank-check company goes public through an IPO and then hunts for a target to buy eventually turning the acquired business into the operating entity. SPAC IPOs tend to use a different set of underwriters than traditional IPOs and in some cases have handed over much better economics to the alternative firms. Most notably in July 2020 Bill Ackman paid a group of six MWVBEs a total of 20% of the underwriting fees for the IPO of Pershing Square Tontine Holdings. He told Yahoo Finance in an interview that the number was 10 to 20 times the normal rate and said the firms were ""going to do the work you're going to be part of the team.""

Rainbow PUSH's Wall Street Project is urging companies to pay MWVBEs at least 5% of the fees with stock allocation in the 10% to 15% range said Cruz. Seelaus wasn't on the Pershing Square IPO but her firm has been involved with several others including the Belong Acquisition Corp. IPO and Freedom Acquisition Corp. 1 offering both this year. She said one things SPACs are doing better than traditional IPOs is bringing the firms in early in the process. ""We never want to be a box-checking exercise at the last moment"" Seelaus said. ""We want to be treated like a real player and have the opportunity to add value to the transaction."" The trend has still not become ubiquitous. On the day before Robinhood's IPO foreign language learning app Duolingo raised more than $500 million in its share sale. The offering was led by Goldman Sachs and included nine other firms. None were owned by women or minorities. In an interview after its Nasdaq debut on July 28 Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn said the roster of underwriters ""is not something we concentrated on."" Von Ahn highlighted the importance of diversity among its workforce and on its board which is 50% women. But he said the possibility of adding diverse underwriters didn't come up in discussions.

The One Percent deserve much of the blame,"One way to avoid the crowds is to build your own golf course. That's what Albert Lord did in Harwood near the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland about 30 miles east of Washington DC.

Lord built his course around a 1831 plantation house which he restored and stands near the 11th and 12th holes. It is also within driving distance of the Capitol convenient for doing student loan business.

Lord made his fortune as an executive for Sallie Mae taking home more than $200 million from 1999 through 2004. That doesn't include stock options which were estimated at nearly $400 million in 2007. As CEO chairman and in other roles at the company he was a prime mover in taking Sallie Mae private and making it the predominant college student loan company handling about a quarter of all federal student loans. Since its founding in the late 1960s Sallie Mae had been a government-run enterprise to administer student loans; but through the 1990s with the wave of deregulation and privatization of governmental services under the Bill Clinton presidency it became a privately-held corporation. Since then it has spawned a web of interlocking entities such as SLM Corp. General Revenue Corp. Navient and other spin-offs.

Sallie Mae first handled federal student loans but spun off Navient in the early 2000s to continue that contract with Sallie Mae focusing on private loans and SLM handling collections. From the early 2000s through 2019 SLM Corp. averaged around $2 billion gross profit and $347 million net income a year and from 2014-2019 Navient averaged $2.6 billion in gross profits and $683 million net income and Sallie Mae $350 million in net income per year. After overseeing the expansion of the company Lord retired as chairman in 2013 although he has continued on the board and also is a partner in a private equity company and a new student loan company.

By most conventional measures Albert Lord is an American success story and he has led a productive life. He was not born with a silver spoon but attended a land-grant university Penn State to which he has given significant donations and served as trustee (although he had to step down after making insensitive remarks about the victims of the Sandusky child abuse case becoming millionaires). After college he worked as an accountant coming to Sallie Mae in 1981 first as controller and moving up through the ranks. The exact amount of his total wealth is obscure but it is not unreasonable to assume that he is a centi-millionaire—or his family is. Despite his wealth he is reportedly plain-spoken and without pretense and just goes by ""Al"" to people he meets.

From the late 1990s through the early 2000s another Al Alan from Washington state had a very different experience with Sallie Mae. He had originally borrowed $38000 while earning degrees as an aerospace and an industrial engineer but even with a job at a prestigious institute he had to take a second job to pay his monthly debt. Then after 9/11 he had trouble getting a job that paid well enough to cover his loans so he sold most of his belongings and moved to Alaska working 92 hours a week in food service in an effort to pay down the debt which had grown exponentially. Because he had missed a payment early on Sallie Mae had regularly added fees and penalties so that by 2003 the total debt had ballooned to $80000 even though he had paid off about $4000 of the principal. He sums it up: ""Sallie Mae—who had already profited at least $25000 (this doesn't include interest subsidies paid to them by the federal government while I was in school)—was demanding more than double what I originally borrowed."" ""My life has been paralyzed"" Al says listing other travails that he has suffered as a consequence of his debt. For instance he struggled to obtain a good job that required a security clearance because of his poor credit.

There are a lot of other Als. Or Ellens. Ellen from South Dakota for instance tells of her student debt (originally $27000) nearly doubling due to fees. Ellen subsequently received a cascade of threatening telephone calls from collection companies put on the trail by Sallie Mae — not only to her but to her grandmother and other relatives. ""There have been times when I've thought that I should just kill myself so my family can have some peace"" she confesses.

Because of federal laws uniquely applying to student loans none of these debts could be absolved in bankruptcy and lenders can charge substantial fees and raise interest rates with any missed payment. These cases among more than 500 accounts gathered by an archive from studentloanjustice.org show the other side of the balance sheet of Sallie Mae. (It was founded by Alan Collinge who tells his own story in his book ""The Student Loan Scam"") They offer testimony to the harm that student loan debt has caused.

By now we all know the basic data about college student loan debt—that it totals more than $1.7 trillion encumbers around 40 million people at present and cannot be absolved in bankruptcy. And we probably know about it anecdotally hearing stories from a son or daughter niece or nephew friend friend's child or someone behind the counter making our coffee. Or we may have experienced it ourselves. (For myself I joined the debt club in the late 1980s while in graduate school and only paid it off in 2008 struggling to make the monthly nut while working as a professor since 1990.) Though college student loan debt began its precipitous rise in the 1980s it only became an everyday news item after the 2007-8 financial crisis and impetuses like the Occupy movement and Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.

Despite being a familiar issue in contemporary American life and politics we don't tend to think about where all the money has gone who has profited and how they have done so. Obviously much of the money has gone to colleges: tuitions and fees have risen at three times the rate of inflation since the 1980s. Sometimes people blame colleges for that but in many cases those raises replaced state funding as higher education was reconceived more as an individual good for one's private benefit and thus to be paid individually rather than a public good for societal benefit and paid from public coffers. (For instance Al Lord paid only around $500 tuition per year or $3900 in current dollars as the state footed a large part of the bill.) Beyond tuition a substantial portion of student loan debt money has gone to profit Sallie Mae Navient and the web of other financial institutions and services that handle student loans—or more exactly to those who own and control them. Humble Al Lord's hundreds of millions of dollars came fairly directly from those debtors enabled by the system of policy law regulations and banking that he helped develop.

In my own case for nearly twenty years I filled out a check for $660 each month to Sallie Mae. It would require a forensic accountant to adduce the amount extracted but how much did Al Lord make from my payments? $.10 a month? $50 total? $20? It wasn't nothing. You'd think I might at least have gotten to play a hole of golf at his golf course.

Al Lord likes to say that he wanted to help people go to college and have the same chance he had. As he put it to his Alumni Association ""Penn State was one of the few schools that I could afford…. Today I help others gain their education…. giving every teenager a shot at the American Dream—even kids from the humblest circumstances."" If questioned about the problems befalling those with student debt he blames the federal government and colleges themselves rather than loan companies. That fits the framework of economic thinking prevalent now: those who take loans make a rational choice to go to college presumably to advance their careers and financial prospects. And they make a fair deal: they sign their student loan forms freely so are rightly responsible for their loans and the market operates without prejudice according to the simple rule of supply and demand.

But is the deal really fair? Student loans are hardly a natural entity or unbiased exchange; rather the arrangement through which Lord got his money was created deliberately through a web of policies regulations and laws which he and Sallie Mae lobbied heavily to enact paying millions a year to officeholders. For instance Lord had a close relation with Congressman John Boehner taking him on golf outings to Florida on a Sallie Mae jet and contributing heavily to his campaigns. The policies and laws that gave us SLM and the quagmire of college student loan debt were put in place by the conscious planning and maintenance of people like Lord and Boehner. And while benefiting some they have harmed many people. As the subheading of an article in Fortune not known to be a leftist magazine puts it ""Sallie Mae's buyers may make a ton of profit. But taxpayers and students will be paying the bill.""

How do we finally adjudicate this harm? One way to think of student debt is in terms of liability. Ironically as an opulently remunerated CEO and chairman of the board responsible for many decisions Lord had no personal liability for the actions of Sallie Mae which is a ""limited liability"" corporation whereas the other Al had full liability for his student debt indeed for the length of his life if he cannot pay with no ordinary recourse to declare bankruptcy as a corporation has. Furthermore he has no power to negotiate better rates as companies often do and banks accommodate when necessary. Instead he has been subjected to exorbitant penalties and fees accruing yet more debt.

So rather than a fair exchange moderated by the Invisible Hand of the market wasn't the scale tilted by the hands of people like Al Lord and Boehner? According to free market principles shouldn't debtors be able to absolve their debt through bankruptcy as other kinds of debtors are or companies are? Or if loans are a governmentally subsidized service shouldn't there be regulations to prevent exorbitant fees loan-shark level rates and extraordinary profits? Or simply they be zero profit?

Moreover shouldn't those who rigged the scale be liable for the harms that result from their actions?

At first it might seem a stretch to think of student loans in terms of liability for companies who issue and handle them but consider a few analogies. One comes from medicine: the case of OxyContin and other problematic pharmaceuticals. Medicine is presumably a good addressing a human need parallel to education in that regard rather than a conventional consumer good or luxury service. Like loans drugs often have good uses but as recently has become known OxyContin was exploited by Purdue Pharma for the sake of their own profit and the personal gain of the Sackler family. Even if what they did was not illegal at the time did it cause harm? Are they responsible for the harm they caused morally if not legally?

Granted with student loans not all borrowers have experienced harm or they have simply experienced the unpleasant effects of a necessary bill like paying taxes. No doubt many graduates benefitted from student loans and paid their amounts in a timely way. Still is it not a wrong if some experience difficulty causing undue harm? And the issuer extracts undue benefit?

Liability is a central issue in civil law particularly in torts (from the Latin tortum a tort simply means a wrong). Criminal law obviously addresses wrongs as well but those wrongs like murder or robbery are conceived of as offenses to the body politic so the state prosecutes them whereas civil law instead adjudicates other wrongs which often bear on property damage or personal injury. And they have different ends: criminal cases assess guilt and mete out punishment whereas civil cases usually assess liability and mete out compensation in a corrective or reparative judgment. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines it: ""the underlying concern of tort law is to address the costs suffering or more generally the losses that victims suffer as a result.""

Judgments take into account several criteria to establish the degree of liability notably intention reasonable care and foresight and negligence. Actual consequence is more determinative than conscious intention; even if an act is unintentional in the everyday sense one might still have liability for instance if a tree on one's property falls on a neighbor's fence and damages it. Another factor is foreseeing a consequence or risk and taking or not taking precautions. Thus one might be responsible not only for an action but for lack of action and negligent.

In the philosophy of law this taps into an economic rationale: ""In order for injurers to have an incentive to take appropriate precautions each must face costs of his activity in full"" (""Theories""). Negligence is judged on a spectrum the most extreme form being recklessness although one still has responsibility for reasonable attention or ""duty of care."" As Alan R. White explains in his standard text ""Grounds of Liability"" ""failure to give attention to to look out for or even to notice—and hence take precautions against—the risks and dangers inherent in one's conduct"" (105) constitutes ""carelessness.""

This I think bears most on college student lenders like Sallie Mae and their creators like Al Lord: they should have known foreseen the results better. Or maybe they did and ignored the possible harms or calculated them as a risk worth taking. Even if they would protest that they did not personally wish for the bad consequences that many experienced they were careless and showed indifference to them.

Much of the current debate about student loans rightly focuses on making college free or tuition minimal thus eliminating most loans. That would no doubt help protect future generations but would not redress the harm many have already experienced. Some proposals focus on forgiving loan debt which would alleviate much of the burden for current debtors. In addition to those proposals we should also consider liability and how to repair the harm that many over several generations by now have experienced.

The people who brought us college student loan debt did so legally at the time but gamed the laws despite the harmful results for some. How might those responsible compensate for the harm they caused? Those who exhibited carelessness and indifference to the consequences of their machinations? Civil cases aim less at punishment than repair. Now is the time to talk about a reparative policy that aims for corrective justice for those who have suffered as well as mandating restitution from those who so carelessly gained."

I'm thinking along the lines of severance pay health benefits guarantee of jobs etc. I will most likely use this kind of info to decide where I spend my money when I get back to Vegas. From what I heard about TI early on I will not be spending any time or money there. Now that we're near the end I'm sure there's a better overall picture of how employees were treated.

A:

We got ""no comment"" responses from Wynn Resorts and Boyd Gaming. At least Boyd was polite about it and we expected more from the Wynn since they were very good to their employees.

The Culinary Union sent back four paragraphs of self-congratulations for the passage of the “right to return” law that gives displaced casino workers first dibs on their old jobs.

Las Vegas Sands was altogether more helpful. “At the insistence of [Sheldon] Adelson the company conducted no furloughs or layoffs” wrote spokesman Ron Reese. “We continued paying and providing benefits for team members throughout shutdowns and slowdowns.” Reese was being too modest. Las Vegas Sands also paid the wages including averaged tips to workers at its restaurants that weren't actual employees of the company. We'd say that per your criteria Venetian/Palazzo should be at or at least near the top of your list.

Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli recently tracked workforce changes at MGM Resorts International and found that 40 percent of its nationwide employee base had been pink-slipped of whom only a fourth or a fifth would be returning to their jobs. At present the company has gone from 70000 to 42000 employees. Speaking generically he wrote “We would note that at present we think Strip labor costs are down 40%-50% versus 2019 levels.” Part of the reason for that is a scenario at Caesars Entertainment that's similar to MGM Resorts'.)

Still to give you an idea of what happened in Las Vegas we’ve constructed the following timeline of employee relations during the Great Shutdown (culled mostly from our own coverage of the issue in Vegas News):

March 17: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas closes but keeps all of its employees on payroll.

April 2: Wynn Resorts discloses that it is cutting executive pay from 30% to 100% to help underwrite 30 days of pay and benefits for its employees later extended to 60 days.

April 4: Las Vegas Sands announces that it is paying the salaries of 1200 indirect employees who work in restaurants that are tenants in The Venetian and Palazzo. Hourly and part-time workers are to receive a stipend.

April 7: Cirque du Soleil sacks 4700 workers 95 percent of its total employee base.

April 10: Boyd Gaming lays off most of its nationwide workforce although it extends health-care benefits through June 30.

April 11: Station Casinos extends pay and benefits to furloughed workers through May 15. The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas meanwhile has laid off workers but will carry their health benefits through June 30.

April 27: Caesars Entertainment initiates an employee-assistance program for individuals facing “unusual hardships.” The program is funded by donations from Caesars execs and board members. Caesars also commits to extend pay and benefits through June 30.

May 2: MGM Resorts International is reported to have termed four hotel presidents as the number of furloughed employees at the company reaches 63000.

May 3: South Point lays off its employees for an “indefinite period.” Owner Michael Gaughan tells the workers they will “be better off” applying for unemployment benefits than looking to the casino for assistance. Health benefits are extended through July 31.

May 7: MGM extends health-care subsidies through August 31 but warns that six-month furloughs could become permanent. Wynn Resorts extends pay and benefits for idled workers by an additional 15 days.

May 14: Rampart Casino gives all its employees the boot via a pre-recorded phone message.

May 19: Colorado Belle in Laughlin closes for good throwing 400 workers onto the unemployment rolls.

July 23: A dark day. Wynncore announces additional layoffs although benefits are extended through October 31. Circus Circus owner Phil Ruffin pink-slips 252 workers but Tropicana Las Vegas outdoes him by eliminating 620 positions.

July 28: MGM lays off most of its entertainment staff.

July 30: Las Vegas Sands extends pay and benefits an additional 90 days.

That covers the worst of it. We’ll leave it to you to decide which casinos to patronize or to avoid.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDQ5NzYvbW92ZS1vdmVyLXBhcmlzLTExLXBpY2Fzc28td29ya3Mtd29ydGgtMTA0LW1pbGxpb27SAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbmV3cy10cmVuZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQ0OTc2L21vdmUtb3Zlci1wYXJpcy0xMS1waWNhc3NvLXdvcmtzLXdvcnRoLTEwNC1taWxsaW9u?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Picasso works are being auctioned off in Las Vegas,"The 11 Picasso paintings sculptures and drawings were originally collected by former casino mogul Steve Wynn. He sold his Mirage Resorts business to MGM in 2000 and later exited the casino industry (and his second venture Wynn Resorts) in 2018 following allegations of sexual assault and harassment – which he denies – and has kept a low profile ever since.

One of the most anticipated art sales of the season won’t take place in a fusty Parisian auction house or Manhattan’s Upper East Side – instead MGM Resorts will auction off a collection of Picasso works valued up to US$104 million in a Las Vegas casino.

Sotheby’s one of the world’s largest brokers of fine art  will travel to Las Vegas for the event. The Wall Street Journal reported that this will be the first time Sotheby’s has hosted an auction outside of major art hubs such as London and New York.

MGM told the Journal that the auction is part of the resort’s shift toward contemporary art and works “by women and artists of colour”.

The Picassos originally bought by Wynn are on display in the Bellagio Hotel & Casino’s themed restaurant Picasso where the average meal costs around US$132.

The auction’s most expensive works include a 1938 portrait of Picasso’s mistress called Femme au Béret Rouge-Orange which is expected to bring in at least US$20 million. A six-foot (1.8-metre) portrait titled Homme et Enfant is projected to sell for a similarly high price.

MGM told the Journal that the auction may demonstrate whether collectors are willing to associate themselves with Wynn’s collection. However the resort said it is not intentionally severing itself from Wynn adding that the former exec “played a pivotal role” in curating the resort’s artwork.

MGM Resorts and Wynn Fine Art did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Xcel Energy improving Dalhart power grid

Xcel Energy is investing $600000 in a multi-phase grid improvement project that is converting the electrical facilities serving Dalhart to a higher voltage according to a news release.

“Dalhart has been successful in expanding its economy around core industries such as agriculture and transportation and strengthening the power grid that supports this growth and job creation is vital not only to this one city but to the whole region” said Jesse Shuffield Xcel Energy manager for Community and Economic Development for the Dalhart area. “These improvement projects are aimed at updating aging infrastructure and providing the reliability and capacity necessary to sustain economic growth for years to come.”

Conversion work has already started in alleys west of downtown Dalhart. Once this work is completed crews will start work on areas north of downtown according to the release.

At the same time Xcel Energy is surveying customer locations to ensure they are accurately recorded in the system. This data verification will be critical as the company prepares to invest in advanced meters in the coming years. Xcel Energy anticipates four distinct phases of conversion work in Dalhart that could take several years to complete. The company expects minimal interruptions to customers but when outages are necessary Xcel Energy field personnel will notify customers in advance through phone messages or door-to-door visits.

Once the Dalhart conversion project is complete crews will have installed 200 new transformers and 10000 feet of new wire. Shuffield pointed out that Xcel Energy is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade and modernize the power grid not just in Dalhart but around the region. A $3 billion initiative to upgrade and expand the high-voltage transmission network started 10 years ago and Dalhart-area transmission lines were among the first to be improved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMTQvcnVlZGktcmVzZXJ2b2lyLXdhdGVyLWZvcmVjYXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Low water forecast for Ruedi Reservoir near Aspen threatens hydropower water deliveries,"By Heather Sackett Aspen Journalism

Water levels at Ruedi Reservoir could fall so low this winter that the city of Aspen could have difficulty making hydro-electric power and those who own water in the reservoir could see shortages.

That’s according to projections by the Bureau of Reclamation which operates the reservoir near the headwaters of the Fryingpan River. At the annual Ruedi operations meeting on Aug. 5 officials estimated the reservoir will fall to around 55000 acre-feet this winter what’s known as carry-over storage. According to Tim Miller a hydrologist with the Bureau of Reclamation who manages operations at Ruedi the lowest-ever carry-over storage for the reservoir was just over 47000 acre-feet in 2002 one of the driest years on record. Last year’s carry-over was about 64000 acre-feet.

At 55000 acre-feet the elevation of the water is about 7709 feet. That’s about two feet lower than Aspen officials would like.

“We don’t like being below 7711” said Robert Covington water resources/hydroelectric supervisor for the city.

That’s because the hydro plant needs a certain amount of water pressure to operate. The higher the water elevation the more water pressure there is.

According to Covington power providers Xcel Energy and Holy Cross Energy sometimes temporarily and quickly shut down the hydro-electric plant when there are problems with transmission lines or they need to do repairs.

“It’s very common for these types of plants to automatically shut down” Covington said.

The problem is that restarting the plant requires a larger amount of water than the 40 cubic feet per second that is roughly the minimum amount required to operate the plant efficiently.

“It’s very difficult for us to get back online so we end up pushing more water through for a very short period of time” he said.

If Aspen has to shut down the plant because flows are too low the city could purchase more wind power to maintain its 100% renewable portfolio.

“When we go lower on hydro we go with wind which is generally the most cost-effective” said Steve Hunter utilities resource manager with the city.

Shortages to contract holders

Another consequence of low carry-over storage means that Ruedi will start out even lower next spring when the snow begins to melt and the reservoir begins to fill again. That means if there is below-average runoff again some contract holders who own water in Ruedi could have to take shortages something that has never happened before Miller said.

There are 32 entities that have “contract water” in Ruedi which the bureau releases at their request. This is water that has been sold by the bureau to recover the costs of building and operating the reservoir. The contract pool is separated into two rounds and contract holders will take a previously agreed upon shortage amount depending on which round they are in.

“If we get another similar type of runoff this year there will be shortages most likely to the contract pool” Miller said.

But there are still uncertainties in predicting how low the reservoir will go. The biggest of these is how much water will be released for the benefit of the endangered fish in the 15-mile reach of the Colorado River near Grand Junction.

There is a 10412 acre-foot pool available for the fish but in dry years entities that store water in Ruedi will sometimes coordinate to release more fish water in the late summer and fall. This would draw down the reservoir even further. It’s still not clear how much water will be released this fall for the four species of endangered fish.

“The release defines the carry-over” Miller said.

Despite initial bureau forecasts in April that projected Ruedi could probably fill to its entire 102373 acre-foot capacity Ruedi ended up only about 80% full this year. July 11 was the peak fill date at 83256 acre-feet and an elevation of 7745 feet.

“It was probably a little over-optimistic” Miller said of the April forecast. “But at the time our snowpack was average. It was a reasonable forecast given the conditions.”

As climate change worsens the drought in the Western U.S. Ruedi is not the only reservoir to face water levels so low that they threaten the ability to produce hydroelectric power. Last month the bureau began emergency releases from Upper Basin reservoirs including Blue Mesa on the Gunnison River to prop up levels in Lake Powell and preserve the ability to produce hydropower at Glen Canyon Dam.

It safeguards Minneapolis' water supply and helps ensure the river doesn't undermine bridges or other infrastructure.

But the wall's condition is largely a mystery. Now some river experts and politicians are calling for a closer examination fearing that a failure of the aging structure could prove catastrophic.

""There's a dramatic threat to the Twin Cities — water supply upstream infrastructure downstream navigation billions in central riverfront development"" said John Anfinson a leading Mississippi River historian who has been calling attention to the issue. ""How serious is it? We don't know.""

The problem is the wall is largely inaccessible lodged in sandstone beneath the riverbed. And it is unclear who is responsible for it; none of the entities most closely associated with the falls believes they are the owner.

Roughly the height of a three-story building the wall helps prevent the collapse of a thick limestone riverbed slab by stopping flowing water from eroding soft sandstone underneath it. It was constructed after one of the biggest disasters in Minneapolis history when a tunneling project went awry and nearly destroyed the falls in 1869.

There is no firm evidence that the wall often called the cutoff wall is in danger. But the vast majority of it can't be seen except for an area where it intersects with old tunnels.

Anfinson has been trying to alert public officials about the issue before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers — which built the wall — exits the area after the lock and dam closed to navigation in 2015.

The issue has piqued the interest of officials ranging from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar both of whom want the Army Corps to conduct a closer examination.

""If history's taught us anything it's that we need to be proactive when it comes to critical pieces of infrastructure like the cutoff wall"" Frey said.

The Congressional Research Service is investigating the legal process that would need to occur for the corps to analyze the wall's condition.

Anfinson has written extensively about the history of the riverfront. He says he felt obligated to speak out as someone well-versed in the wall's history. And he's thought about the questions now being asked after the Florida condominium collapse in June.

""Who knew what and when? And what did they do about it?"" Anfinson said. ""This wall may last another 144 years. But how do we know if we haven't done a good study of it?""

Anfinson once worked for the corps though he is not an engineer. He later joined the National Park Service where he became superintendent of the national park spanning most of the Mississippi River in the Twin Cities. He retired in January.

Nan Bischoff a corps project manager said people are raising a lot of concerns over something that is not actively threatening. Bischoff said the wall is effectively insulated by all the material and infrastructure that surrounds it.

""It's not going anywhere"" Bischoff said. ""There's no place for it to go.""

St. Anthony Falls in 1863 prior to the Eastman disaster and construction of a spillway. Sandstone erosion left chunks of broken limestone in the Mississippi River.

A disastrous lesson

The falls likely wouldn't exist today without the man-made infrastructure designed to halt erosion. In its natural state the falls inched upstream roughly 4 feet per year because water tumbling over the edge of the limestone riverbed would wash away the exposed sandstone at the foot of the falls. This caused the limestone on top to collapse and the falls to recede. White settlement took root in Minneapolis just before the gradually moving falls ran out of limestone upstream. The falls soon fueled a booming riverfront milling industry.

Attempting to generate power on Nicollet Island in the 1860s industrialist William Eastman and partners bored a deep tunnel through the sandstone. But it flooded during construction washing away large amounts of sandstone and causing portions of the limestone above it to collapse. The city's natural power source was suddenly in jeopardy. It took the corps about two years to erect a concrete barrier in the sandstone to halt further erosion. Completed in 1876 the wall is 6 feet thick at its base roughly 40 feet tall and spans 1850 feet across the river.

Upon Eastman's death in 1902 the Minneapolis Journal wrote that his mistake had taught the city a valuable lesson about the fragility of the falls. ""Until he made that excavation no one knew of the percolating rivulets that were waiting only the slightest invitation to become gushing torrents and vent the waters of the whole river through the soft sandstone"" and destroy the falls the paper wrote.

The condition of the underground wall spanning a portion of this area upstream from St. Anthony falls concerns riverfront historian John Anfinson.

Sporadic monitoring

The wall is now an integral but invisible component of St. Anthony Falls — standing deep below the horseshoe-shaped dam visible from the Stone Arch Bridge.

There have been sporadic attempts over the years to assess the wall's condition. Xcel Energy began monitoring water pressure above and below the wall in the late 1980s for example to assess its performance. But that stopped in 2001 — with the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) — after data revealed the equipment was not working correctly.

Two of the Eastman-era tunnels one man-made and the other scoured by water in the disaster intersect with the cutoff wall. The man-made Eastman Tunnel contains so much sediment that inspectors in 2009 could not reach the wall. The other known as the West Branch Tunnel is still passable. Xcel which owns a lot of infrastructure at the falls now inspects the tunnels downstream of the wall every 10 years — the upstream areas are not accessible. The power utility inspected them annually in the early 2000s but ultimately persuaded FERC to reduce the required frequency according to public correspondence between the entities.

FERC spokeswoman Celeste Miller wrote in an e-mail that the last tunnel inspection in 2019 showed ""the wall was in good condition."" The agency later clarified that only a sliver of the wall was visible.

But representatives for Xcel said their engineers do not inspect the cutoff wall. ""Our engineers have not seen anything of concern that would impact the safety of our hydroelectric generation"" Xcel spokeswoman Julie Borgen wrote in an e-mail.

The public cannot see the dam safety reports containing those inspections however because FERC classifies it as Critical Energy/Electric Infrastructure Information. FERC requested that the Star Tribune sign a nondisclosure agreement to see them something the paper generally does not do.

The corps in a 2015 report assessed more than 30 ways that the falls could be compromised four of which were considered ""risk-drivers"" warranting further analysis. One of those risk-driver scenarios involved water eroding tunnel walls causing a break in the limestone above and then damage to the cutoff wall. This accelerates the erosion and undermines a key nearby dam leading to further problems.

The report concluded that the likelihood of this scenario was ""remote"" and that it would happen slowly enough for the problem to be fixed. But the confidence in that assessment was low in part because there is limited information about the condition of the wall and the tunnels. University of Minnesota Civil Engineering Prof. Joseph Labuz who examined the 2015 report at the Star Tribune's request said more data about water pressure around the wall would help assess its condition. Concrete is strong under compression he noted.

""The wall is surrounded by sandstone"" Labuz said. ""And you have to have a lot of removal of the sandstone for this wall to be compromised.""

Worst-case scenarios

If key infrastructure at the falls were compromised Minneapolis could find itself without access to water — at least temporarily. The dams at St. Anthony Falls raise water levels upstream where Minneapolis draws its drinking water. The city has roughly three days of water in reserve.

More than drinking water is at stake. Anfinson noted that corps documents say an undermining of the falls would turn that steep drop into rapids extending far upstream of downtown — putting bridges and dams at risk.

""A worst-case scenario for the cutoff wall would be catastrophic for the roads and bridges surrounding it for countless residents and businesses on the riverbanks and for the drinking water supply of nearly a million people"" Omar said in a statement.

The main floor and roof of Xcel Energy's 90-year-old hydroelectric plant downstream of the Stone Arch Bridge collapsed in Nov. 1987.

Residents got a glimpse of the river's destructive power in 1987 when water eroded the sandstone beneath an Xcel Energy hydroelectric plant downstream of the Stone Arch Bridge. It washed away the plant's foundation and the 90-year-old plant collapsed.

Anfinson credits the corps for building a wall that has lasted for nearly 145 years. But nature is persistent he added.

""For 12000 years nature was trying to end St. Anthony Falls — slowly backing it up the river"" Anfinson said. ""It got so close and we stopped it. Do you think nature has surrendered to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers? I don't think so.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MxMzg1ODk0NzIxMDEwMDA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic wastes in a continuous microwave assisted pyrolysis system for fuel production,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385894721010007 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MxMzg1ODk0NzIxMDEwMDA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Bloomberg





Big data is helping create your pizza — at least in Taiwan where the latest nontraditional topping features a mash of pig’s blood cake and century eggs.

As demand for Western fast food boomed during Taiwan’s recent COVID-19 outbreak Pizza Hut Holdings LLC scraped social media posts for the most talked about foods and created word clouds of potential new ingredients.

“We leveraged social listening to understand customers’ preferences” Pizza Hut Taiwan general manager Antony Leung (梁家俊) said. “Online data also told us that Taiwan customers value local flavors and a food sensation.”

It is not the first time Taiwan has seen an unconventional blend of Western and local ingredients. In 2019 Domino’s Pizza Inc created the boba — a pizza served with sweet tapioca pearls in homage to the popular bubble milk tea.

The fusion stirred a buzz on social media and Pizza Hut came up with its own toppings including ramen and spicy hot pot. It even made a pizza topped with durian — a thorny fruit with creamy custard-like flesh and a powerful odor.

The latest concoction coincided with growing demand for Western takeaways after the government imposed a nationwide level 3 COVID-19 alert on May 19. While the nation’s food and beverages sector suffered a near 40 percent slump in sales in June US chains such as Pizza Hut Domino’s and KFC outperformed with a 3.6 percent rise data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed.

“During the lockdown consumers preferred meals that are clean convenient and cheap” said Ken Chen (程開佑) cofounder of iCHEF a Taipei-based company that provides analytical marketing for Taiwan’s food and beverages industry. “That all worked in favor for American fast food chains.”

The flurry of demand for nontraditional pizzas also reflects the tendency of Taiwanese to follow trends said Sungjun Park an assistant professor at National Chengchi University’s business administration department.

“Taiwan’s Generation Z are constantly looking for attention-grabbing materials to post on Instagram” he said.

Yum! Brands Inc which franchises Pizza Hut KFC and Taco Bell in more than 150 countries and territories worldwide has followed an “adopt and adapt” strategy also known as “localization” in several Asian nations. South Korea has the bulgogi pizza with marinaded BBQ beef; India has butter chicken; while Japan has experimented with natto — a traditional food made from fermented soybeans.

“When international chains want to stabilize market power in a foreign location this is the go-to method” Hong Kong-based Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Angela Hanlee said.

The data-generated approach seems to have worked in Taiwan. The latest invention — featuring a street delicacy made of sticky rice and pig’s blood and preserved eggs — broke Pizza Hut’s previous sales record set by the durian pizza in 2019 Leung said.

One was bought every eight seconds and the creation was sold out just four days after the launch in late June the company said.

Like previous toppings it aksi swiftly trended on social media.

Aaron Yan (炎亞綸) a popular Taiwanese singer and actor with more than 1.6 million followers on Facebook said in a post the pizza was delicious.

Sandra Chuang a Twitter user in Taichung said it was a “very Taiwanese taste.”

“Every now and then Taiwanese will go crazy over a new popular well-talked about food” said Clarissa Wei (瀏覽者) a writer and film maker focusing on food and culture. “Taste does not seem to be their top priority.”

That seemed to be the case for Henry Hung who works in the information-technology industry in Taipei and turned to Pizza Hut’s latest creation to spice up an “online hangout” with friends during lockdown.

“I only bought the pig’s blood pizza out of curiosity and the temptation to try something weird and new” he said.

While the “overall taste was acceptable and flavors were balanced” Hung said he would not order it again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29kaG9yc2UuY29tL2hvcnNlLXJhY2luZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNTI0MDkvbWF2ZXJpY2stbGFuZHMtMzAway1hcm15LW11bGUtaGFsZi10by13ZWxscy1iYXlvddIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maverick Lands $300K Army Mule Half to Wells Bayou,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvY29ucy1wcm9kdWN0cy9mb29kL2RpbC1leHRlbmRzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtY29zdGEtY29mZmVlLWdldHMtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRhbC1yaWdodHMtZm9yLTUteWVhcnMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODUzNTA4NjEuY21z0gGkAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9jb25zLXByb2R1Y3RzL2Zvb2QvZGlsLWV4dGVuZHMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1jb3N0YS1jb2ZmZWUtZ2V0cy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudGFsLXJpZ2h0cy1mb3ItNS15ZWFycy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODUzNTA4NjEuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DIL extends partnership with Costa Coffee; gets developmental rights for 5 years:,"

Devyani International Ltd (DIL) largest franchisee of Yum Brands in India has formalised an extension of its partnership with UK-based cafe chain Costa Coffee. DIL entered into a revised development agreement for its existing Costa Coffee business on August 14 2021 following which DIL has been granted development rights across India in a phased manner.This agreement has initially granted DIL development rights for a period of five years and extendable from time to time subject to meeting of development and contractual obligations a company spokesperson said in a statement.While Coca-Cola acquired Costa Coffee globally three years back in India Costa Coffee has been operated by rival PepsiCo’s exclusive and biggest bottling partner RJ Corp-owned DIL since 2005. India is among the few markets where Costa Coffee is aligned directly with a PepsiCo bottling partner.However in India Costa Coffee remains a small business unlike scale players such as Starbucks and Cafe Coffee Day. The number of Costa Coffee stores in India also reduced from about 70 in 2018 to 44 as on June this year. DIL presently runs two formats of Costa Coffee stores—full retail at high-street locations and malls and branded kiosks at airports hospitals and food courts at highways.Coca-Cola had bought out Whitbread Plc-owned UK cafe chain Costa Coffee in a global $5.1-billion buyout in 2018. Costa Coffee is UK’s biggest coffee chain and Coca-Cola’s global buyout of the cafe chain set it in direct competition with rivals such as Starbucks and is seen as a bid to hedge its risks in a sluggish soft drinks market and broaden its portfolio beyond sugary drinks.DIL is also among the largest operators of chain quick service restaurants KFC and Pizza Hut and operates 735 stores across India Nepal and Nigeria as of June 30 2021. Its business is broadly classified into three verticals that includes stores of KFC Pizza Hut and Costa Coffee. DIL’s other businesses include Vaango and Food Street.DIL will be listing on the stock exchange on Monday following its initial public offer (IPO) earlier this month to raise ₹1838 crore.For the year ended March 2021 DIL reported revenue of ₹1135 crore which was 25% lower compared to the previous year.In an interview last fortnight RJ Corp chairman Ravi Jaipuria said DIL expects to turn profitable this financial year if there is no third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The quick service restaurant chain operator is betting on bullish consumer sentiment and strong brand pull to turn profitable. An India Foodservice Delivery Report (IFDR) released last week estimated that by 2024-25 the gross merchandise value (GMV) of the food services delivery market would increase to $36 billion from $5.3 billion in 2019-20 riding on an increase in average order value frequency and penetration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvZGV2eWFuaS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWV4dGVuZHMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1jb3N0YS1jb2ZmZWUvYXJ0aWNsZTM1OTI5MjE3LmVjZdIBgwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2RldnlhbmktaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1leHRlbmRzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtY29zdGEtY29mZmVlL2FydGljbGUzNTkyOTIxNy5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Devyani International extends partnership with Costa Coffee,"New Delhi August 15

Yum Brands Inc. operates brands such as KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and has a presence globally with more than 50000 restaurants in over 150 countries. In addition the company is also a franchisee for the Costa Coffee brand and stores in India.

Currently the Costa Coffee chain operator's shares are trading at Rs 145 in the grey market a premium of Rs 55 or 61.1 percent over the final issue price of Rs 90 per share the IPO Watch and IPO Central data showed.

""The grey market premium is quite justified. With the past few IPOs hitting the exchanges with stellar listing gains it is only natural for investors to be so optimistic. The QSR business model has a huge potential in the country with a growing working population changing tastes and preferences of the consumers"" said Gaurav Garg said.

""The company is valued at 9.54 times on price/sales front which is quite reasonable when compared to its peers and the IPO is valued at around 62.8 times EV/EBITDA (enterprise value - earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) which looks reasonable when looked together with its peers. The growth potential of this industry is quite high once it can operate at full capacity and is expected to generate good return on equity."" he added.

Amarjeet Maurya - AVP - Mid Caps at Angel Broking also expects strong listing gain on the back of lower EV/Sales (FY21) valuation which is 9.9x compared to peers (Jubilant Foodworks - 15.4x Burger King India - 14.8x Westlife Development – 10x).
