Between January and August 1964 a research programme was held to investigate the possibility of maximum-range flights of Tu-95 and 3M bombers at 50-200 m (164-660 ft.) in the daytime and at 200-300 m (660-980 ft.) at night.

When the Myasishchev design bureau was reborn in 1951 it was immediately tasked with creating a high-speed strategic bomber to balance the threat posed by NATO’s heavy bombers notably the B-52.

Designated M-4 and code-named “Bison” by NATO the new four-turbojet bomber was developed within an incredibly short time—just one year. It made use of many innovative features including a bicycle landing gear and was designed around the most powerful jet engine of the day. It became the progenitor of a small family of bombers and refueling tankers including the much-improved 3M and its versions.

Could the Bison penetrate the air defence system of the ‘potential adversary’ (NATO)? As explained by Yefim Gordon & Dmitriy Komissarov in their book Myasishchev M-4 and 3M: The First Soviet Strategic Jet Bomber the numerous radar pickets SAM sites and supersonic interceptors stationed in western Europe and North America left few chances getting through even in a first-strike scenario. The six cannons the M-4 would hardly give it enough protection. The only hope the bomber’s crew had lay in the ECM suite and the armour plating protecting the crew against shell fragments.

The notorious shoot-down of Francis Gary Powers‘s high-flying Lockheed U-2A spy plane (56-6689) by an S-75 SAM (NATO code name SA-2 Guideline) near Sverdlovsk on May 1 1960 had made it obvious that strategic bombers were no longer invulnerable at high altitudes. However it soon became clear that their perceived extreme vulnerability to enemy air defences was somewhat exaggerated. The US quickly devised an ‘anti-SAM tactic’ — from 1962 onward the B-52s were supposed to penetrate the enemy’s SAM barriers at low altitude where the missile guidance radars could not track them. Exercises showed that low-level/ultra-low-level penetration could give a fair chance of success. The Soviet Union answered in kind; between January and August 1964 a research programme was held to investigate the possibility of maximum-range flights of Tu-95 and 3M bombers at 50-200 m (164-660 ft.) in the daytime when obstacles and terrain were visible and at 200-300 m (660-980 ft.) at night. This low-level tactic significantly increased the chances of air defence penetration by single aircraft (formation flying at low level was ruled out – for safety reasons if nothing else). Of course the turbulence at low altitudes imposed additional strain on the airframe and this was where the Myasishchev bomber had an advantage over the Tu-95 thanks to its flexible wings which could cope better with the turbulence. Another important advantage was the Bison’s lower radar cross-section in the frontal aspect because it was jet powered; the Tu-95’s propellers markedly increased its radar signature.

However these low-level flights never got further than the experimental stage; operational use of this tactic required the aircraft (including the 3M) to be modified in order to withstand the turbulence at low altitude. The Ministry of Aircraft Industry (MAP) declined to undertake this work which eventually had to be performed by the Ministry of General Machinery (MOM). The Council of Ministers tasked Viktor N. Bugaiskiy who headed Branch 1 of MOM’s OKB-52 with getting the 3M low-level combat operations programme included into the task list of KB-90 headed by V. Gusarov; the work was to proceed in January—February 1966. The bomber’s range on a ‘hi-lo-hi’ mission profile decreased dramatically but this was an acceptable price for the reduced vulnerability during air defence penetration.

Another point to be considered is that even though the M-4 and 3M had their reliability issues they were far more reliable than contemporaneous intercontinental ballistic missiles. Also unlike ICBMs strategic bombers were highly mobile having greater mobility than the ballistic missile submarines that were just coming on the scene; not only could they be rapidly redeployed but they could be assigned a new target in midmission if the need arose.

Well actually the Bisons were initially authorised to use only a handful of bases with long runways – Engels-2 AB Ookrainka AB Dyagilevo AB (near Ryazan’ in central Russia) Siauliai (pronounced `Shaooliay’; in Lithuania) and Chagan AB (in Kazakhstan). A technique was devised of taking off with a reduced fuel load that allowed the bombers to be dispersed to virtually any Soviet air base if the possibility of a preemptive strike loomed. The service pilots quickly discovered that with a reduced TOW the M-4 really leapt into the air.

""Slow down-School ahead"" reads a sign outside a top private school in Bengaluru  which has converted the area outside its premises into a 'Safe School Zone' to ensure road safety for children and improve pedestrian access.St Joseph's High School in Bengaluru is among a few schools in five cities of the country where such zones have been set up on trial basis.A Safe School Zone includes designated roadways located near a school where additional care is needed due to an increase in school-related pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The zone extends up to 300 feet from the border of the school property or at least 300 feet from a school crossing.Standard ' school speed limit ' signs mark the beginning of a school zone and 'end school zone' signs indicate the end of a school zone. The zones include only areas of active school use.While the initiative is a popular road safety concept in countries like the United States  Philippines Indonesia South Korea and some parts of Europe it is yet to take off in India.Globally schools fall under the vulnerable road user zone and according to statistics road traffic injuries account for 37-38 per cent of deaths among 0-14-year-old category and 62-64 per cent among children in the age group of 14-18.In India there has been a consistent increase in the fatalities of school children below the age of 18 -- 6.4 per cent in 2017 6.6 per cent in 2018 and 7.4 per cent in 2019 -- as per official statistics of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.The numbers translate to the death of one child in India every 45 minutes in a road accident or 31 children losing their lives daily.The 'National Study on Safe Commute to School' a report by SaveLIFE Foundation and Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India has pointed out that nearly 30 per cent of children have witnessed a road crash during their travel to school while 6 per cent of them were involved in such accidents.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in partnership with the World Resources Institute (WRI) India have initiated and designed a Safe School Zone at Byculla's Mirza Ghalib Road on a pilot basis.""The initiative started over three weeks ago was aimed at identifying ways of providing students safer access to school. Mirza Ghalib Road in the city's E-ward (Byculla) is home to two schools -- Christ Church School and St Agnes High School. We initiated the trial using paint barricades and cones"" said Dhawal Ashar Senior Manager Sustainable Cities and Transport WRI India.""The design solutions we tested included demarcation using signage road markings providing designated areas for walking and waiting multi-utility zones including pick-up and drop-off areas child-friendly spaces with playful elements and a vibrant pedestrian crossing. The trial using low-cost material will aid in undertaking feedback from the neighbourhood before making it permanent on-ground"" he said.A similar setup tested at St Joseph's High School in Bengaluru was the result of multinational conglomerate 3M's initiative 'Young Change Agents for Road Safety' in partnership with Concern for Road and Pedestrian Safety (CoRPS) and United Way of Bengaluru.""In most countries around the world vehicle drivers are sensitive to vulnerable road users. Someone driving at very high speed would stop when he or she sees a pedestrian or cyclist crossing the road. Unfortunately we lack that road etiquette in India. As mature citizens we must realise that having a license to drive does not mean a license to harm"" Pawan Kumar Singh Executive Director Transportation and Electronics Business Group 3M India told PTI.Among the schools where safe zones have been created or initiated so far are 116-year-old Fort High School Chamrajpet in Bengaluru; NP Boys Senior Secondary School in Delhi's Mandir Marg; Jnana Prabodhini Prashala Silver Crest School in Pune and a school in Gurugram.The stakeholders on board plan to take the initiative to at least 100 schools across the country next year before proposing it to the government to make it a full-fledged programme.""We involve the students by getting their inputs on how their school zones could be made safer with respect to road safety. We then try to translate their suggestions with minimum changes on ground and our global experience and expertise. All physical enhancements and installations are carried out through CSR"" Singh said.Chetan Umapathy Programme Manager at CoRPS explained that under the programme students start with a safety audit around their schools to ascertain the problems such as potholes.""They then take a video simulation module where they view the problems of the road through a driver's perspective. They plot problem areas or mark safe zones around their schools on maps and suggest other measures such as signage or speed breakers in appropriate points"" he said.These inputs are implemented using safety techniques such as raised pavement markers road studs fluorescent reflective signages and reflective bollards among others Umapathy added.According to K K Kapila President Emeritus International Road Federation (IRF) the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs needs to include School Safety Zone as one of the components of the Smart Cities Mission."

It was exciting to see last Sunday's front page piece on the two leading Republican governors who may be vying for The White House. However the comments of the obviously left-leaning writers based their Ron DeSantis-Greg Abbott comparisons on the misguided notion that they were merely Trump wannabes. That is too simplistic.

There are many qualities personal and political that made Trump wildly popular among conservatives not the least being his combativeness. Both governors have that trait. Trump also never took a knee to Washington posturing having never been an insider. Both governors share that quality. Lastly Trump related to “the little guy” to whom both governors appeal. What was not featured was the that the governors’ key issues; immigration race and mask mandates are terrible weaknesses for President Biden.

In addition no mention was made of the governors’ appeal to independents and centrists who happen to share their views on these and other issues. Any future Republican face-offs would best be served by a greater dose of objectivity on Biden. It seems that Govs. DeSantis and Abbott are unapologetically clean.

The fringe has a master tailor in Trump

No doubt Trump was and continues to be a master tailor. Only he could take the raw material from the ugly underbelly of America and turn it inside out. Only he could weave a vast net of lies threats insults and paranoia into a conspiracy against what America should truly be. Only he could equate white supremacy with goodness and make “science” and “scientists” dirty words. Only he could mistake our allies for our enemies and defame the ambassadors and the fallen heroes who served the United States so nobly. Only he could inspire a mob to subvert the will of the American people and clothe democracy in authoritarianism. Only he could mend it and that’s how he could make the fringe the new fabric of America.

Florida needs better surgeon general

Dr. Joseph Ladapo should not be confirmed as Florida's surgeon general. The fast-tracking of his Florida medical license seems to have been done to avoid proper vetting and for political purposes. His association with a fringe group called ""America's Frontline Doctors"" shows a more political view of COVID-19 than actually preventing the spread of this virus. Not the right person for the job plain and simple.

OXFORD Miss. – Gate 11 at the University of Mississippi‘s Vaught-Hemingway Stadium represents past and future generations.

The William Abbott Windham Family Gate memorializes the life of an Ole Miss graduate while also honoring his great-grandchildren and namesakes: siblings William Abbott and Windham.

“My dad lived and breathed Ole Miss and taught us to do the same so I wanted this gift to honor him” said Bill Windham of Bossier City Louisiana referring to his recent gift to Ole Miss athletics that secured the gate naming. “I also want the gate to honor my dad’s grandchildren who are Ole Miss graduates and his great-grandsons who will someday also be Rebels.

“I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a lot of good loving people who’ve helped me and blessed me in a way that allows me to be able to make a gift like this. Dad would be very pleased to know this gift was made in his memory – and more so in honor of him.”

The elder Windham a resident of Tallulah Louisiana died in April 2016. Born in Bastrop Louisiana he grew up in Georgetown South Carolina and served in the U.S. Air Force from 1951 to 1954.

A Korean War veteran Windham graduated from Northeast Louisiana State University with a bachelor’s degree in education. Then as a classmate of Rebel legends Robert Khayat and Jake Gibbs Windham earned a master’s degree in school administration from Ole Miss in 1959.

Also extending the footprint on the Oxford campus is his lifelong best friend Denny Blomquist who played Rebel baseball and still holds two school pitching records.

After graduation Windham returned to Louisiana where he worked as a math teacher and assistant principal at Tallulah High School for nine years before serving as principal of the school.

“Dad’s passion for education and care for children made him a strong supportive leader for so many of his students Bill Windham said. “That’s why I felt that this gift was so appropriate. It stands at a university representing a man who loved education and it honors young people – his grandchildren great-grandchildren and the students at Ole Miss who will be helped by the gift.”

Keith Carter vice chancellor for intercollegiate athletics expressed gratitude for Windham’s generosity which will bolster facilities and programs for student-athletes.

“Gifts like these are inspiring to others who may be considering whether the timing is right to give back to Ole Miss” Carter said. “Other potential donors will see Bill’s support and hopefully feel that they want to contribute too.”

Bill Windham grew up south of Tallulah on his family’s farm the first catfish operation in Louisiana. They also raised cattle cotton corn soybeans and rice.

A graduate of Louisiana Tech University journalism school Windham said attending Ole Miss was never really an option.

“But Ole Miss was in my blood and still is” said Windham an investor in real estate casinos health care and oil and gas. “When Ole Miss played Louisiana Tech during the Coach O years I wore an Ole Miss shirt and a Louisiana Tech hat.”

Windham and his wife Carol have a home in Oxford and enjoy attending Rebel sporting events together. Their daughter Summer Adams and her husband Drake graduated from the university in 2006. Her brother Carter is also an Ole Miss graduate in the Class of 2020; another brother William graduated from Duke University.

The elder Windham also has two other grandchildren Kristen Patrick and Reagan Nosser both Ole Miss graduates in the classes of 2006 and 2014 respectively as well as UM freshman Rob Mahaffey.

The Ole Miss Athletics Foundation recognized the Windhams’ gift by placing the family name on an entrance gate to Vaught-Hemingway Stadium.

“We are thrilled to be able to honor the Windham family and their philanthropy by having their name on such a significant part of Ole Miss athletics” said Fowler Staines CEO of the Ole Miss Athletics Foundation. “We are grateful to Bill and Carol for the support they continuously give to our programs.”

But will the spending continue?

As the residents of Sydney and then Melbourne exited protracted lock-downs last month a subsequent consumer-spending frenzy might have been expected with people rushing back to retail shops and hospitality venues as a release from pent-up desire. According to the consumer-spending tracker developed by professional services firm Accenture and data and credit bureau illion October saw some mild rebound but the longer-term question remains.

The online index a part of the e61 Institute for economic research co-directed by Accenture managing partner and growth markets sustainability leader Andrew Charlton draws its wealth of data from hundreds of thousands of anonymised customer-consented bank transactions made in Australia every week weighted to be representative and presented relative to average weekly spending in January of 2020.

Naturally the economic disruption of Covid-19 and public health response measures coupled with government stimulus and support payments have had an impact on top of and sometimes counter to the common consumer-spending peaks and troughs of a standard calendar year. With the 2020 post-Christmas period being one of a natural downturn and gradual climb all of a sudden the pandemic hits and the consumer graph goes haywire.

Leaving aside the shifting categories of consumption over the past eighteen months the initial public shut-downs and stay-at-home orders saw total spending plummet before a huge mid-year bounce in sync with stimulus measures followed by a bumper Christmas. Fast-forward to October 2021 as Australia’s two most populous cities emerge from yet another longer lock-down and could it be that we’re sitting at the foot of another hefty spike?

In writing for the Age in August Charlton asked the question as to whether the bounce-back following the lockdowns brought about by the Delta variant would be as dramatic as last year noting both the continuation of the primary contributing factors and the differing circumstances this time around. In 2020 the virus had been contained yet the vaccination roll-out was still moving at a glacial pace. Those elements are now effectively reversed.

Here the ongoing presence of Covid in the community may put a clamp on consumer confidence as well as cause a reluctance to engage in public activities such as dining and entertainment. But as Charlton points out even if confidence grows more slowly it’s now starting from a higher base; employment and job security is up and spending had showed resilience through the later lockdowns. Then there are the overarching conditions.

Coming frenzy

Interest rates remain incredibly low government stimulus spending is still moving through the economy and the consumer cash-pile due to the lock-downs is even greater than before indeed may be at its highest level ever in exceeding an estimated $200 billion. For Charlton all signs now point to another Christmas shopping bonanza with consumers already indicating they plan to spend more this year than during last year’s record holiday season.

And it could all start now. Coincidentally Melbourne emerged from its extended 2020 lock-down in the final days of October (in-store retail also didn’t recommence this year until the end of the month) – right before the index sky-rocketed with November’s peak eclipsing those of December. In addition to the Black Friday sales another factor may also contribute to pushing November through the roof – predictions of shortages due to supply-chain disruption.

According to Accenture’s 2021 Consumer Shopping report which predicts average consumers will spend $246 more than the $819 outlayed on gifts last year some 42 percent of shoppers are concerned about short supply and intend to get their Christmas shopping done early – such that Charlton in his most recent column writes; “The toilet paper frenzy of 2020 was merely a dress rehearsal for what is about to take place in Australia over the next two months.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9lZHVjYXRpb24vYWZ0ZXItaWltcy1ub3ctaWl0cy1iZWdpbi13b3JrLWZvci1xdW90YS1iYXNlZC1mYWN1bHR5LWhpcmluZy0xMjExMTIwMDA1NjVfMS5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9lZHVjYXRpb24vYWZ0ZXItaWltcy1ub3ctaWl0cy1iZWdpbi13b3JrLWZvci1xdW90YS1iYXNlZC1mYWN1bHR5LWhpcmluZy0xMjExMTIwMDA1NjVfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After IIMs now IITs begin work for quota-based faculty hiring,"After the Indian Institute of Management (IIMs) it is now the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) that have begun quota-based faculty hiring by placing advertisements.

Indeed say experts hiring them is advisable.

With more government incentives encouraging employers to tap the under-utilised workforce of individuals with disabilities organisations from a wider range of industries now see greater value from having disability-inclusive workplaces.

""Employment is an important avenue for integration and gives people including people with disabilities a sense of identity purpose and social connectedness"" says Mr Tan Eng Tat director of Employment and Employability at government-linked agency SG Enable.

""Over the years we have seen an increase in the number of organisations keen on disability inclusion.""

Each successive edition of the five Enabling Employers Awards a biennial event held since 2011 has seen more employers qualifying. It was renamed the Enabling Mark Awards this year with the launch of national-level accreditation to benchmark employers for their inclusive hiring practices.

A total of 88 organisations were accredited. They are from a mix of multinational and small and medium-sized enterprises from sectors such as F&B financial services hospitality logistics and transport.

The pandemic effect

There were initial concerns that the Covid-19 pandemic could set back years of gradual progress for employees with disabilities.

SG Enable's Mr Tan notes: ""Some employers may have negative perceptions about employees with disabilities such as them being less productive. They may also think that supporting an employee with disabilities would require too much money and effort.""

Mr Shaun Tan co-founder of Inclus a social enterprise serving people with disabilities and employers seeking to be disability-inclusive says that before the pandemic most jobs for differently abled individuals were in F&B retail and hospitality. These sectors had long grappled with manpower shortages and tightened foreign worker quotas.

But those jobs also tended to be ""less mission critical"" required fewer qualifications and thus paid less so job seekers with disabilities were at times under-employed.

When the pandemic struck those very sectors were hardest hit by travel and social restrictions. Consequently many businesses hiring workers with disabilities had to trim operations and pare down manpower says Mr Tan.

Supporting workers with disabilities

Job placements fell as a result of the pandemic said SPD a Singapore-based charity serving people with disabilities in its latest annual report. But the good news is that the charity has found fresh opportunities in emerging industries including urban farming.

Similarly Inclus' Mr Tan has noticed an uptick in labour demand from sectors such as logistics IT and healthcare.

""Disability employment does move with market trends so as demand grows for cybersecurity healthcare and administrative workers we have found opportunities to place people with disabilities in such roles"" he says.

The unemployment rate of working-age PWD residents with disabilities is at 11.7 per cent - above Singapore's current resident unemployment rate of 3.5 per cent.

To nudge employers to consider hiring from this under-tapped local talent pool the government has enhanced incentives in the wake of the pandemic. This is on top of training and job redesign grants under the government's Open Door Programme.

The Manpower Ministry (MOM) said its Jobs Growth Initiative (JGI) launched in September 2020 has supported the hiring of more than 1600 employees with disabilities as at February.

The JGI gives eligible employers wage support of up to 50 per cent of the first $6000 of gross monthly income for new hires with disabilities. It has been extended till March next year.

Employers of Singaporeans with disabilities earning less than $4000 a month also receive the Enabling Employment Credit wage offset.

The combination of market demand and incentives has helped hold the employment rate among working-age residents with disabilities steady at 29 per cent according to an April update from MOM.",,,,,,

Some would argue Adobe Lightroom is the very best photo editing app for smartphones and there are plenty of reasons to agree. If you are like me you will need more than the previous sentence to be convinced so let’s give you 10 reasons why Lightroom is the best mobile photo editor around. Of course the app isn’t without flaws so we will also talk about its shortcomings. Also read: 15 best photo editing apps for Android

First let’s talk money

Adobe Lightroom as it is labeled in the Google Play Store is simply the mobile version of Lightroom CC (where CC stands for “Creative Cloud”). While you can use the mobile Adobe Lightroom app for free using this software to its full extent requires an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.

Adobe Creative Cloud prices: Photography plan ($9.99/mo): Lightroom Lightroom Classic Photoshop and 20GB of cloud storage.

With all that in mind you will have to decide whether a subscription is worth the cash or not. Just be mindful that we will be including some of these paid features in this list of the best Lightroom for Android features.

Before we get started: Here are some photography terms you should know

1. Cloud syncing across devices

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

This is easily one of Lightroom’s greatest strengths. Because files and edits are stored in the cloud you can access images from any device. This makes it easy to start working on your computer then pick up where you left off using your smartphone or tablet. You can also access Lightroom from a browser so you don’t even need software installed to use the app!

Cloud syncing is also helpful if you ever want to export an image but aren’t within your primary device’s reach. The transitions are seamless and your edits sync immediately so images are always up to date.

2. RAW support

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

A RAW image is an uncompressed unedited image file. It keeps all data captured by the sensor making it a much larger file with no quality loss and more editing power. These allow you to tweak your pictures’ full exposure and color settings bypassing the camera’s default image processing.

Some of us like the freedom RAW images offer and very few mobile photo editors support these larger more complex files. Lightroom is one of the few that do and it does so marvelously. Not only can you use your phone’s RAW images (given that your device supports it) but you can also use shots taken with any other camera including pro-grade DSLRs.

3. Full editing freedom

Lightroom for mobile doesn’t skimp out when it comes to editing capabilities and this mobile app competes against full desktop software. You can control exposure contrast highlights shadows whites blacks colors tint color temperature saturation vibrance sharpening noise reduction cropping geometry grain and much more. Of course there is also an auto edit button and cool profiles for easy automated editing.

The Lightroom mobile app is nearly as complete as the full desktop one which automatically puts it in high ranks. It even has advanced editing features like selective adjustments healing brushes perspective control and gradients.

4. Mobile friendly UI

Most photo editing smartphone apps have a mobile-optimized UI (user interface) but Lightroom’s is especially cool because they managed to find a balance between pro-grade editing and a nice touch-friendly design.

Lightroom was designed to work across multiple operating systems screen sizes and device types so the UI has been planned accordingly. Sliders respond well to the touch but don’t look out of place on a computer screen when using a mouse. Buttons are large and the image layout is well organized and sized.

5. Performance is amazing!

Running Photoshop Lightroom Classic or any photo editor worth its salt requires plenty of processing power. Lightroom seems to be different as it runs so much smoother across the board. I have used it in low-end handsets like the Moto E5 Plus and while it isn’t as fast as with more powerful phones it is not slow. My regular 9.7-inch iPad runs it without a single hiccup as do my Pixel 3 XL or HUAWEI Mate 20 Pro.

Lightroom runs faster than Lightroom Classic on my computer which goes to show the software itself is superior. It could be that the cloud is offloading much of the work or maybe Lightroom is simply better optimized.

6. Batch editing

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Images taken under the same lighting conditions and with similar aesthetics shouldn’t need to be worked on as much. Batch editing saves you time by allowing you to copy and paste edits. You can then jump into each image and make quick adjustments to fine-tune each image.

7. Web sharing

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Exporting my images in Adobe Lightroom from any device is great but I don’t even need to export them most times. Adobe makes it easy to share photos through its web sharing system. One can share albums by adding specific people or sharing a link. Images and edits are already saved in the cloud so why not take advantage of that?

After sharing my albums people can like or comment on my images. It’s great for getting tips from fellow photographers or requests from clients.

8. Lightroom has a camera app!

Most people tend to ignore it and I will agree that it is not the best camera app out there but many of you will love it for one main reason. The app happens to come with a manual mode something some phones don’t support. Popular devices without manual camera mode include iPhones and Google Pixel handsets. There are plenty of great third-party manual camera apps but you can kill two birds with one stone if you are already using Adobe Lightroom.

9. Keeping photos organized

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Most other photo editing apps are messy to be honest. Lightroom since its inception was not only planned to be an editing tool but also a photo organization hub. The same applies to the mobile version which neatly organizes photos in folders and albums.

Most other photo editing apps are messy to be honest. Edgar Cervantes

In addition Adobe Sensei will recognize objects in images and properly tag them. You can also manually tag your pictures making it easier to find them through the search bar. In addition the People section organizes images by person through facial recognition.

10. Photos are always backed up

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Because the cloud is Lightroom’s backbone you need not worry about hard drives failing losing memory cards accidental deletes or any other downsides that come with using only local storage. Your photos are in Adobe’s servers. Of course this also comes with some downsides which we will cover in the next section.

Lightroom for mobile downsides No app is perfect and Adobe Lightroom for mobile is not the exception. Here are some things we don’t like about this app. Cloud storage: Keeping data in servers costs money. Your subscription allows for either 20GB or 1TB of data. Extra cloud storage can get pricey depending on your needs.

Keeping data in servers costs money. Your subscription allows for either 20GB or 1TB of data. Extra cloud storage can get pricey depending on your needs. Limited watermarking: While the feature to export watermarked images is available it only supports text. You can’t upload logos or images to be used as watermarks.

While you can use Lightroom for free many of its most exciting features are only accessible to subscription holders. $10 a month isn’t exactly cheap. No heavy editing: Montages layers and other complex editing tools are still not available. You will still need a desktop app like Photoshop or Gimp for that. I have entirely abandoned Lightroom Classic by now and use only Lightroom for all my photo editing needs save for the few times I need heavier editing and go to Photoshop.

As a coalition of cycling groups community members city employees and company representatives gathered on the east Baylands side of the new bridge over U.S. Highway 101 officials from the city county and state couldn’t help but repeat one message in their speeches before they opened the path with a ribbon cutting: Finally.

“After a year and a half of construction that included 13 million pounds of concrete 1 million pounds of structural steel and 7000 feet of electrical and fiber optic cable … we can definitely say now that the bridge is tangible and real” Palo Alto Public Works director Brad Eggleston said.

The new overpass that will provide year-round access to the Baylands the new Adobe Reach trail and other outdoor amenities opened Saturday to a crowd of pedestrians and cyclists just a day after construction and cleanup were completed.

Spanning 1400 feet long between the West and East Bayshore Road landings with a 12-foot-wide pathway the bridge replaces the Benjamin Lefkowitz underpass which was only open six months a year on average due to seasonal flooding.

“I’ve been looking forward to this since last year” said Jeff Shusterman a Mountain View resident and longtime cyclist who brought his bike for the occasion.

That anticipation was tenfold for the former and current city council members who came including former Mayor Liz Kniss and Alison Cormack to witness the city’s decadelong work finally come to fruition.

In his speech Mayor Tom Dubois recognized that many years went into planning and gathering the funds — so much so that the bridge has gone through a few City Council transitions he noted.

“We actually approved this four years ago next week when we finally gave it the final go-ahead” Dubois said Saturday. “That was back when we had nine council members.”

Josh Becker former Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss Palo Alto Mayor Tom Dubois Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian and representatives from other agencies involved with the bike bridge project cut the ribbon to open the new overpass on Nov. 20 2021. Photo by Lloyd Lee.

For Eggleston he recalled when Kniss a strong proponent of the project at the time she was mayor once dubbed the overpass the “mythical bridge.”

State Sen. Josh Becker D-Menlo Park and Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian also shared their own anecdotes that in jest poked at the 10-year timeline for the bridge. Simitian proposed to extend the timeframe 10 more years since the county provided a $5.5 million grant from its Stanford Recreation Mitigation Fund that dates back to the year 2000.

“You’ve heard this described as a 10-year effort in the making” Simitian said. “What I would say is that it’s actually a 20-year effort in the making because those mitigation funds go all the way back to the year 2000 and they were set aside for a then not yet determined purpose.”

The final price tag of the bridge was $23.1 million which became a sore point for some residents and the Weekly’s editorial board. Funding came from several sources including a $1 million grant from Google and a $4.35 million investment the city is expected to receive from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s One Bay Area Grant Program.

Along with the higher-than-anticipated costs some residents also began to view the bridge as yet another emblem of the bureaucratic nightmare many developers have come to expect in Palo Alto. In 2015 the city scrapped a design by Moffatt and Nichol and eventually ended up with a new firm Biggs Cardosa Associates Inc.

Some of those frustrations may be palpable even for Megha Bansal the city’s senior engineer since 2015 and the project manager of the bridge. Most recently she had to deal with the construction delays stemming from material transport issues and supply shortages due to the pandemic.

“Before COVID the only thing we did was the removal of vegetation” she said.

But Bansal also elucidated that the overpass came with many constraints beyond the city’s since it touched upon multiple jurisdictions. That point was made clear just by the ceremony’s attendees on Saturday. Representatives from the county CalTrans Santa Clara Valley Water District Valley Transportation Authority and even employees from Google made an appearance since part of the construction fell on the company’s property.

“There were all these requirements from all the agencies” she said. “It was a multijurisdictional process.”

During broad daylight the bridge’s most distinctive feature is the rust-brown steel trusses above the highway and Adobe Creek. According to Roy Schanbel managing principal at Biggs Cardosa the color can be attributed to the self-weathering steel. The material is intended to rust over time he said so that a protective coating is created and prevents the bridge from further rusting.

“It’s supposed to look like that and it’s supposed to rust” Schanbel said. “It’s earthy.”

But at night the frame of the bridge blends into the night sky and mostly appears as a crisscross of faint dotted lights. Eggleston said that LED lights were installed in a way to reduce the amount of light pollution and avoid disturbing the surrounding wildlife. Throughout the walkway for example the LED lights are pointed downward so that they will only serve to light up a pedestrian or cyclist’s path and nowhere else Eggleston said.

The overpass will be a convenient access point for south Palo Altans but its use will certainly extend to residents throughout the Bay Area. Multiple cycling groups including Bike Palo Alto Western Wheelers Bicycle Club and Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition whose memberships span across the Midpeninsula and south bay came to witness the opening Saturday.

Diana Crumedy a member of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition and a San Jose resident described how it’s always a mental feat to “retrain” the mind to not be afraid of passing cars after participating in bike marathons with blocked-off roads or having protected bike lanes. But with the new bridge she and many other cyclists from San Jose will have a safe route to look forward to in Palo Alto.

“This is the opportunity for people to have that same experience — to feel that safety of being able to ride their bike without being concerned with being hit by a car” Crumedy said.

With the fanfare of the opening ceremony which also came with free ice cream the bridge became packed with pedestrians. Many cyclists had to resort to walking their bikes. Robert Neff chair of the Palo Alto Pedestrian and Bicycle Advisory Committee said the real test will be July 4 after the fireworks show in Mountain View.

But as the afternoon approached and the crowds died down the bridge became a serene destination for pedestrians to take in the view of the Baylands and for cyclists to swiftly cross the highway.

In Sunday’s episode of Dexter: New Blood the town remains on the hunt for Matt Caldwell who we know became Dexter’s first kill after breaking his abstention from murder. But the pressure and the stakes are raised when a bit of found footage reveals a second figure lurking about the scene of the crime. Can Dexter continue weaseling his way out of this one and where’s he going to stash Matt’s body parts? Let’s find out by recapping “Smoke Signals.”

More from TVLine

Dexter’s “one tiny mistake” continues to haunt him. As the search party carries on he’s balancing his efforts between trying to parent Harrison and concealing the body hidden directly underneath the cops’ feet. And that’s when Angela announces there’s been a break in the case: Reservation land management unearthed footage of Matt shooting down that deer. Of course the word “footage” immediately sends “Jim” into a panic. Luckily for Dexter the video is geothermal so all that can be seen are colorful silhouettes. However it does reveal a second figure in the woods which officially turns this missing persons case into a criminal investigation.

—

Dexter shadows the investigator hired to review the blood at the scene and he determines some of it is human. He then takes a stab at what he thinks happened and the guy is right on the money. He even determines there was foul play involved based on the removal of a rock that likely caused a head injury. (“I’ve gotten rusty in my abstinence” Dexter tells himself.)

Dexter New Blood Harrison Audrey

Angela orders a DNA test on Kurt and confirms that the blood found was indeed Matt’s. She deduces that someone probably saw Matt kill the protected buck on Seneca land and he or she wasn’t too happy about it. She tells Dex later that she’s ordered search dogs to sweep the woods so that night he takes Matt’s clothing and spreads the scent aaaall over the area.

At school Harrison is accused of cheating on his placement test but the boy is miffed when Dexter doesn’t immediately back him. Harrison retakes the test and actually scores higher than he did the first time.

Meanwhile Lily is still petrified in her cage of an apartment. But suddenly the door unlocks and she bolts down the hall and out of her basement confines. She takes off running but doesn’t get far: A masked assailant shoots her dead with a sniper rifle.

Dexter still can’t figure out how to dispose of Matt’s body. The ground’s too frozen to bury it and the lake is too shallow to risk it being found by fishermen. Deb suggests a wood chipper which gives us a hilarious (and bloody) little scene where Jennifer Carpenter gleefully destroys various body parts but Dex finds that to be “a little Fargo.” Then he considers the old iron mine. It’s remote humungous and filled with twisty tunnels which may be just what he needs. He straps on snow shoes and makes the trek to the mine where he finds what looks to be the perfect hiding spot… until he awakens a hibernating bear and is forced to flee.

Dexter New Blood Episode 3 Michael C. Hall

At dinner with Angela Audrey and Harrison Dexter tells us he doesn’t want to lose his new “family.” He’s very aware that his impulsive kill almost cost him his small semblance of happiness. After he apologizes to Harrison for not having his back at school. “I was wrong” he tells the boy. “From now on this is me on your side.” Harrison responds: “Thanks Dad” which Dexter tells us is now his new favorite word.

Ultimately Dex decides to toss the body into the town’s incinerator and promises himself he’ll go back to abstaining. “But what if it’s not the killing that got me in trouble?” he wonders. “What if it’s the not killing?”

At the close of the episode he sees a drunken Kurt on the street who says Matt not only called him but they Facetimed. We know the mourning father is lying… but why?

When done right fucking incredible (re: The Dollar Shave Club) when done wrong cringe and humiliating (re: Musk and Cybertruck’s ‘indestructible armor glass demo’).

This one with Airbnb and Owen Wright’s ‘Paradiso Property Deal’ is kinda genius (and confusing). Here’s the presser below.

Olympic bronze medallist Owen Wright is right in the thick of training for his 2022 WSL Championship Tour Wildcard debut in January where the The Tour is set to begin in Hawaii at Pipeline on O’ahu’s North Shore – where Owen had his traumatic brain injury back in 2015.

Off the back of the Olympics and heading into the 2022 WSL season he’s been spending a lot of time surfing here in Australia and looking to inspire the next generation of Aussie stars this summer. Airbnb has partnered with Surfing Australia and Owen Wright to find the best beach holidays with availability over the summer for those looking for a last minute getaway.

To help kick off the campaign Olympic medalist pro surfer Airbnb Superhost and all around Aussie legend Owen Wright is offering one family an unforgettable summer getaway with a special four-night family beach stay at his luxury Byron Bay surf shack Paradiso Property from the 4-8th January.

Best part of all the stay includes a once-in-a-lifetime surf session at one of Owen’s favourite local surf spots with the big man himself. The absolute dream for young surfers looking to meet one of their idols.

In regards to the competition It opens at 12 midday on the 24th November. The first person to book will only pay $40 for the entire 4 night stay at Owen’s airbnb beach house and surfing lesson with Owen himself.

Three siblings in Co. Cork Ireland have shared the quirky renovation they undertook on a double-decker bus.

The McCarthy siblings – Anna 28 Thomas 26 and Rachel 24 – bought the vehicle for €2500 (£2100) in September 2020 after being inspired by a friend who carried out a similar project.

‘When we bought the bus we left it untouched for a couple of months and by December we were well stuck in’ Thomas sayid.

‘We gutted the whole bus as a start and planned out our site then we moved her onto the site where the real fun began.

‘We started with insulating and putting down new floorings and planning what rooms go where.

;Stud walls went up and we wanted to keep all the windows so we had a lot of sealing to do on the exterior windows.

‘Plumbing and electrical soon came into it and then before we knew it we were planning our kitchen units and picking out tiles and wooden floorings.

‘We kept the interior very colourful and playful throughout and we got the outside graffitied and chose a farm theme.’

Not only did the siblings revamp the inside of the bus the outside was modernised too.

Anna’s partner Aiden created a tiled patio and installed a makeshift bar made of pallets. A hot tub finished off the area and they covered it using sails from a boat.

‘We love improvising and trying to use second-hand materials as much as possible and come up with quirky ideas’ Thomas added.

Alongside the bus renovation the siblings had another project on their hands too – a renovation of their father’s 170-year-old farmhouse after he sadly passed away.

The trio planned to spend €20000 (£16800) but went over budget and had to use some of their savings.

Overall the renovation took a total of six months and cost around €30000 (£25000) for the bus site preparation electrics and work inside.

‘We got a lot of sponsorship from companies in return for exposure on our social media so that helped reduce cost’ Thomas explained. ‘Upstairs probably costs us about €7000.

‘The biggest cost was the kitchen the outside area and electricity.

The bedroom in the bus (Picture: Jam Press)

‘Plumbing was about €1000. It’s a big investment but it will pay off so we’re delighted!

‘We also had loads of help from family and friends and did a lot of the work ourselves which helped massively to reduce cost.’

Inside the bus has a spacious master bedroom complete with a double bed on the top deck. Meanwhile there is a room with four single beds two of which are pull out. This bedroom comes with a full panoramic view of the farm and courtyard.

On the bottom deck is a living room with a U-shaped seating area a kitchen and a toilet.

A start-of-art ventilation system has also been installed to circulate fresh air throughout the space.

‘I think we were in a state of shock that it was finished we couldn’t believe how amazing it turned out. It was better than we ever expected’ Thomas recalled.

The outdoor area also has a bathtub (Picture: Jam Press)

When the renovation was finished the siblings listed the bus on Airbnb at a cost of €180 per couple. The bus can hold six guests at any one time.

Since going live the bus has been completely booked out.

Finally Thomas has some important advice for future renovators.

‘Just do it be patient and definitely look into inspirational pages on Instagram or Pinterest’ he advises.

‘There are fantastic informative pages out there now that will show you step by step what you can do.’

Thankfully there’s a whole industry just for that sort of thing. There are two main types of hotel apps. The first are your classic big companies like Priceline or Kayak and the second are more independent operations like Airbnb. We looked at both types for this list so you can have as many options as possible. You can find cheap hotels expensive hotels or whatever else you want. Here are the best hotel apps for Android to help find your next place to sleep tonight.

The best hotel apps for Android

Airbnb Price: Free / Prices vary

Airbnb is one of the more alternative types of hotel apps. You rent out rooms from individuals rather than established hotel or motel chains. Airbnb functions in over 190 countries and boasts over four million places to stay. It’s great for large or small groups and it’s a bit more personable than the colder and more commercial feeling of the hotel industry. The app and experience is far from perfect but millions of people use Airbnb every year. The app is free and rentals differ based on location size and other factors.

Booking.com Price: Free

Joe Hindy / Android Authority

Booking.com is one of the largest and most popular hotel apps on mobile. You can do the usual stuff like find and surf hotels based on things like price and availability. You can also do things like compare hotels sort for budget and read the many many hotel reviews. Additionally there are hotels apartments hostels vacation rentals and other types of accommodations. The search filters are also quite good. You can do a lot worse than this one.

Expedia Hotels Price: Free / Prices vary

Expedia is one of many all-in-one travel apps with a bunch of features. You can find hotels motels car rentals airplane flights hostels B&Bs resorts and all kinds of lodgings. It’s mostly useful for planning whole trips from the flight to the hotel and down to the car rental. There are some hiccups like most hotel apps and several Google Play reviews cite problems with booking and confirmation emails. However by and large the app works rather well and it’s a big name that people tend to trust. The app is completely free but of course the stuff you get in the app costs money.

Google Maps Price: Free

Google Maps is an interesting idea for hotel apps. It can show you all of the lodgings in your general vicinity with quick access to things like phone numbers and websites. Many all-in-one style travel sites can suffer issues like over-booking or inconsistent pricing and it may just be easier to call the lodging directly and ask for a room. Google Maps is probably your best bet for something like that. You probably know how Google Maps works so we’ll spare you the explanations. You can also check out Google Assistant an app that can remember your bookings and stuff for you.

Hotels.com Price: Free / Prices vary

Hotels.com is a decent option for frequent travelers. It supports both cheap hotels and higher end stuff depending on your needs. In addition you can book quickly and on the same day that you need the room if you want to. Some other features include a membership program with free stays after so many bookings various ways to pay and a comparison tool for you money crunchers out there. The app has a decent UI and we noticed no outstanding bugs or issues with it. Just keep an eye out for cancellation policies and other such things just in case.

HotelTonight Price: Free / Prices vary

HotelTonight does a lot of the same things as other hotel apps but in a slightly different way. They organize hotels with simple categories like basic luxe and hip in addition to other stuff like a concierge service decent rates on hotel rooms and the ability to book rooms on the same day. There is also a rewards program for frequent travelers as well as ratings and reviews for various hotels and motels. Most of the complaints we found were for HotelTonight’s customer service but that’s basically true for all hotel apps.

Kayak Price: Free / Prices vary

Kayak is another all-in-one travel planner type app. You can book flights hotels and rental cars all in the same place. The app works like most of the others in this category. You can compare rates for various flights hotels and motels and car rentals to find the best prices for you. Kayak also helps with a lot of smaller things like where the chargers are at the airport and complete offline support for your itinerary. The app layout is relatively simple and people seem to really like this one.

Orbitz Price: Free / Prices vary

Orbitz is another all-in-one app for hotels flights and other various travel amenities and it shouldn’t be confused with the gum company with the hilarious dirty mouth commercials. This app does all of the basics including booking flight and hotel accommodations finding a rental car and the usual comparison tool for you budget folks out there. In addition there is a rewards program that saves you some money over time if you travel often enough. We saw some complaints when travelers had to make more difficult or unusual travel accommodations but otherwise everything seemed to work fine.

Priceline Price: Free / Prices vary

You have likely seen Priceline commercials before so you know what this app is all about. Like most travel apps it’s an all-in-one style app with flights car rentals hotels motels and other accommodations. It boasts over 800000 hotels along with 28000 car rental facilities in its data banks. In addition they have plenty of budget options for those looking for cheap hotels. It’s a solid overall experience although we did see plenty of complaints about customer service and non-refundable deposits on stuff that made us a little weary.

TripAdvisor Price: Free / Prices vary

TripAdvisor is one of the most popular travel apps on the list. However it doesn’t work quite the same as all of the others. The app shows you listings for tons of hotels car rental places and other places of interest. You have to do the legwork yourself though. It boasts over 700 million reviews across its website and it scours over 200 booking sites for hotel prices. You simply pick the one you want and proceed through that individual booking site’s process for the hotel. Other apps that work well for this include Google Maps (listed above) Yelp and other review sites like that. However we like TripAdvisor because it focuses solely on travel stuff and that’s probably why you’re here to begin with.

Or follow us on Google News

This is a short section of our new free 2021–2022 EV Chargers Guide. More sections of the report will be published shortly or you can just download the full report now. The report is free thanks to sponsorship from NeoCharge and EV Connect.

Level 1 charging stations operate on 120V circuits which are the electricity outlets most common in homes and businesses in the United States. Level 1 charging stations can be hardwired or plug-in capable depending on the model. They provide slower charging than a Level 2 (240V) option but this can be an affordable and effective solution for long-duration parking in such places as homes workplaces airports hotels and universities. (Note: I use simple Level 1 home charging for my vehicle electricity needs. This is in a single-car family with a Tesla Model 3 SR+.)

Level 2 chargers are designed for quicker (1–3 hour) charging stops at parks gyms stores and restaurants. Level 2 chargers can be “smart”/ connected chargers with information tracked and certain controls available through an app or they can be simple unconnected devices that do not have WiFi-enabled access and “smart” features.

While Level 2 chargers offer quicker charging than Level 1 chargers in the grand scheme of electric vehicle charging both are considered “slow chargers.” There are many high-level benefits of low-power EV charging solutions such as relatively low upfront and operational costs and flexibility of the installations and use. We will be publishing a separate report on “fast”/Level 3 charging soon.

ClipperCreek’s ACS Series electric vehicle charging stations can be hardwired into existing infrastructure eliminating the need for a ground fault outlet and reducing the upfront investment. These 120V units provide reliable charge with 12A to 20A power levels. They come with 25 ft of charging cable and one or two mount pedestals. These small charging stations feature rugged fully sealed NEMA 4 enclosures for installation anywhere. The prices range from $379 to $469.

Plugzio pioneered the use of 120V outlets (Level 1) as the most cost-effective approach to adding smart EV charging to parking garages apartments and condominium properties. One of the Level 1 charging options is Plugzio Integrated which is an electricity access control platform for existing outlets that allows any individual or property to monitor control manage and monetize access to electricity. It installs just like a regular outlet on a 4 by 4 device box and doesn’t require any training for an electrician to install and set up. There is also Plugzio Universal available which works just like a smart electrical junction box that measures electricity flowing through it. Plugzio Universal allows access control monitoring and usage monetization of any device that gets installed in- line. All Plugzio devices can communicate with Plugzio Cloud through a cellular network WiFi or Bluetooth to maximize your power and control. For most vehicles an additional 50 miles can be added to their existing battery range from overnight low-power efficient charging or work- hour charging sessions. The Plugzio platform is often used to recoup the electricity cost consumed by EVs in shared spaces.

Core features of Plugzio platform:

+ Generating Revenues

Payment plans can be easily assigned to particular users and/or devices. Rates can be set per hour per kWh or fixed monthly.

+ Consumption Tracking

Consumption (voltage current and power) can be tracked in a cloud-based dashboard. Data can be extracted in Excel format for reporting and analytics.

+ Access Control

Access to charge can be granted based on the scanning of the code to a specific unit. Usage policies and quotas can be set for each user and/ or device.

Low Power EV Charging (LPEVC) is the exclusive distributor of Plugzio Smart 120V Outlet technology. This option can provide a low-cost solution for apartment owners and managers at multifamily properties to offer 120V smart outlets dedicated to tenants with electric vehicles to use for Level 1 charging. EV charging is a complex process including many factors such as electrical infrastructure codes ADA and parking management tenant support and utility payments. LPEVC makes adding charging options to the property simple by maximizing available electrical capacity without expensive upgrade costs and with no operating costs. 120V outlets provide up to 4x more charging plugs than Level 2 using the same electrical capacity. Tenants can charge at assigned outlets and add 40–50 miles of range overnight which is plenty for average daily commuting trips. LPEVC offers an end-to-end outsourced charging solution that includes installation user fees management owner reimbursement and customer support through the entire process.

Plugzio offers two models with the current output shown below:

On average a vehicle is plugged in for 10 hours overnight or at work. In such a scenario Plugzio will provide 70 km (43 miles) of range a day.

Orange offers other cost-effective electric vehicle charging solutions for multi-unit properties. It provides a smart energy meter access control internet connectivity and a software platform for easy maintenance. Orange Outlet (technical specification below) was designed to offer EV charging access to a larger number of tenants and locations. With the Orange Mobile App you can easily set up and manage your charging through your phone. Orange cooperates with local power companies through Orange Juice API which allows you to track changes in pricing and ensures charges and automatic monthly reimbursements at the right price.

Core features of the Orange platform:

+ Access control standard

Access to specific Orange chargers can be granted or unlocked for public access through the phone.

+ Professional design affordable price

Thanks to research and cooperation with local energy commissions clean transportation can be offered at a cost-effective level for everyone

+ Easy to use and customize

Everything is designed to work together seamlessly including the payment system offering easy access to electricity at low cost.

Adding in a work shift on Thanksgiving Hanukkah Christmas or New Year's Day can take a toll on one's mental state experts say.

Millions of Americans will have to work on those holidays this year. A 2014 poll conducted by Allstate and the National Journal estimated that a quarter of the U.S. population was scheduled to work on at least one of Thanksgiving Christmas or New Year's Day.

On top of any winter stress that someone may already feel the negative thoughts brought on by working on a holiday can put a damper on what's built up as a generally happy and festive time of the year.

""There’s this certain picture you have of the holidays that is reinforced on TV and everywhere you go that this is the time to spend with your spouse or your family or your children"" said Dr. Lata McGinn professor of psychology at Yeshiva University and co-founder of Cognitive and Behavioral Consultants.

""And if you’re not part of that ... then that can bring up feelings of despair and loneliness for people.”

The end of the year can already be a stressful time for some. About 38% of people said their stress increases during the holidays compared to 8% who said it decreases according to an American Psychological Association study conducted in 2006.

The Great Resignation:Americans quit their jobs at a record pace in September as openings remain steady

Work remote after COVID? Nearly 50% of US workers would take a pay cut for it survey says

For someone who enjoys celebrating the holidays the disparity between being glued to a computer screen or stuck at a workplace while others spend time with loved ones harkens back to a commonly studied term in economic political and social circles.

“It’s feeling relatively deprived” McGinn said.

Relative deprivation – the perception that a person is in a less-desirable position or receiving worse treatment than others in their situation – has been associated with feelings of anger and resentment.

The topic has been extensively studied in the contexts of social movements. Research has sought to examine the link between relative deprivation and the various pushes for civil rights gay rights and feminism. But McGinn argues it can be applied here as well.

For someone slammed with work on a holiday they were hoping to celebrate it can be easy for them to contrast their situation with friends family or coworkers who are seemingly having a good time.

""You feel like everybody else is enjoying it and I’m the only one stuck here"" McGinn told USA TODAY.

'It's hard to not isolate':People are already bracing for seasonal depression. How to cope.

The 'psychological contract'

On the whole not taking enough time off from work can contribute to larger issues of work-life imbalance and burnout which can have mental physical and occupational consequences.

Burnout can also increase risk of health problems such as coronary heart disease according to a 2017 peer-reviewed study.

So-called ""workaholism"" can have negative impacts on an individual's personal life as well says Malissa Clark an associate professor of industrial and organizational psychology at the University of Georgia. She said she's conducted dozens of interviews with spouses of ""workaholics.""

""Working all the time including on holidays really just has a detrimental effect across the board on their relationship but also on (their) children as well"" Clark said.

Clark says requiring certain employees – particularly those in a non-emergency field – to work on a holiday against their wishes could be considered a breach of a ""psychological contract"" which she describes as an unspoken expectation between employee and employer.

She says the idea of a psychological contract which was brought to light in a 1989 study by Denise Rousseau hinges on the employee's expectation that they will eventually be rewarded for hard work with things like time off promotions or raises. When those rewards don't materialize employees can feel more dissatisfied or less committed to the organization she said.

Drug overdoses surged amid COVID lockdowns:More deaths in one year than ever before

Can't avoid working holidays? 'Radically accept it'

Of course not everyone will be able to evade holiday work. And not everyone will necessarily feel saddened by missing out on the festivities either.

But for those who will be working when they wish they were celebrating the first thing they can do is to ""radically accept it"" McGinn says.

She says it's important for those people to create other ways to mark the holiday season but it can be counterproductive to fight something that may be out of their control.

“It’s that mental battle that can create stress.”

He joined Barings LLC in 1994 as a financial analyst and managed its Eastern Europe and Emerging Europe trust funds.

A significant time in Taylor’s career was when he sold Russian stocks in 1997 after noticing that Russian investors were moving their money around in anticipation of the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Barings LLC purchased their Russian portfolio back at a significant discount as a result. Taylor switched to Thames River Capital LLP in 2000 where he specialized in identifying price inefficiencies. Management of Thames River Capital LLP was transferred to Nevsky Capital LLP a fund that Taylor owned 2007 onwards. He primarily focused on Russian stocks but then widened his investment horizons to accommodate stocks from all emerging markets including Asia and Latin America and eventually moved on to developed markets such as the US and European Union.

In 2015 Taylor shut down Nevsky Capital LLP due to uncertain market conditions leading to fund performance that wasn’t up to Taylor’s past track record. He once again stepped into the investment field by joining Crake Asset Management in 2019.

Here is what L1 Capital has to say about Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:

“Wells Fargo (Long +16%) was the strongest contributor to portfolio performance over the quarter. Wells Fargo shares rallied given a better outlook for bad debts driven by improving employment and house price trends. The company had been very undervalued due to excessive fears around likely bad debts due to the pandemic the continued regulatory “asset cap” (a punishment that was put in place in 2017 for numerous compliance failures) and an inability to commence buybacks. The share price has subsequently recovered strongly in recent months as the company has progressed its turnaround program under the leadership of the well-regarded CEO Charles Scharf (former CEO of Visa and BNY Mellon). Wells Fargo is now closer to getting the asset cap lifted and has announced a huge cost out program (US$8b+) as well as an $18b buyback program to be completed over the next 12 months. Wells Fargo shares have rallied more than 50% since we initiated the position in late 2020. Given the strong rally we elected to exit our position and rotate into stocks with larger valuation upside.”

Here is what Nomadic Value Partners has to say about Anthem Inc. (NYSE:ANTM) in their Q4 2020 investor letter:

“In mid-December we sold our position in Anthem (NYSE: ANTM). At the end of Q3 the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) the umbrella organization for “blues” across the country made a preliminary proposal to settle a multi-year antitrust case for $2.67 billion. This payment is to be made proportionate by each BCBSA health plan. The BCBSA covers about 100 million members nationwide and ANTM represents about 40% of total BCBSA membership. ANTM’s proportionate payment could be a $1 billion charge nearly 25% of its expected 2020 earnings. Interestingly the share price rallied on the news because included in the settlement proposal was BCBSA agreeing to lift restrictions on local BCBS plan geographic boundaries. BCBS plans can begin to horizontally integrate and compete in markets historically excluded from reach.” The more I’ve thought about ANTM’s position in this hypothetical marketplace the more I’ve become less optimistic on them. While consolidation certainly brings better economics to the surviving health plan I think it is only realistically available to much smaller companies. Looking back at anti-trust cases within healthcare over the last decade the large health insurance companies are generally blocked from major horizontal acquisitions. Why would this change? This leaves ANTM competing in an increasingly crowded marketplace and the only strategy left to grow is to supercharge their vertical integration. ANTM is behind in integration and I don’t like situations where a company is being forced to play catch up.”

Airbnb acts as a “System of Trust” in the private rental accommodations market removing a considerable amount of friction so hosts can trust unknown guests and guests can trust unknown hosts/properties. We believe Airbnb has an attractive growth runway given its unique inventory powerful platform and system enhancements that further reduce user friction. We see Airbnb as well-positioned to benefit from secular growth in travel the increasingly mainstream nature of private rentals and as hybrid work/travel can lead to more frequent and longer stays. Unlike traditional online travel agencies like Booking.com and Expedia Airbnb’s user traffic comes almost entirely directly which speaks to the brand’s strength. This also means that Airbnb does not need to pay Google or other meta-search engines nearly as much money for generating booking leads which is a favorable structural business model advantage in our view.

“Alphabet a U.S. communication services provider was once again a top contributor for the quarter solidifying its rank as a top contributing stock for the one-year period. The company’s financial results repeatedly exceeded expectations. In particular its revenue grew faster than expected and its margin trends improved across all segments. In addition management has executed $24.4 billion of stock repurchases so far in 2021. After further examination we recently increased our estimate of Alphabet’s intrinsic value based on the company’s better than expected operating leverage and its notable efficiency improvements. As a result we continue to believe that Alphabet is trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic value.”

Here is what Nomadic Value Partners has to say about Anthem Inc. (NYSE:ANTM) in their Q4 2020 investor letter:

“In mid-December we sold our position in Anthem (NYSE: ANTM). At the end of Q3 the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) the umbrella organization for “blues” across the country made a preliminary proposal to settle a multi-year antitrust case for $2.67 billion. This payment is to be made proportionate by each BCBSA health plan. The BCBSA covers about 100 million members nationwide and ANTM represents about 40% of total BCBSA membership. ANTM’s proportionate payment could be a $1 billion charge nearly 25% of its expected 2020 earnings. Interestingly the share price rallied on the news because included in the settlement proposal was BCBSA agreeing to lift restrictions on local BCBS plan geographic boundaries. BCBS plans can begin to horizontally integrate and compete in markets historically excluded from reach.” The more I’ve thought about ANTM’s position in this hypothetical marketplace the more I’ve become less optimistic on them. While consolidation certainly brings better economics to the surviving health plan I think it is only realistically available to much smaller companies. Looking back at anti-trust cases within healthcare over the last decade the large health insurance companies are generally blocked from major horizontal acquisitions. Why would this change? This leaves ANTM competing in an increasingly crowded marketplace and the only strategy left to grow is to supercharge their vertical integration. ANTM is behind in integration and I don’t like situations where a company is being forced to play catch up.”

Here is what Polen Capital has to say about Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:

“We believe Airbnb has substantial competitive advantages in a large fast-growing and global market. Airbnb acts as a “System of Trust” in the private rental accommodations market removing a considerable amount of friction so hosts can trust unknown guests and guests can trust unknown hosts/properties. We believe Airbnb has an attractive growth runway given its unique inventory powerful platform and system enhancements that further reduce user friction. We see Airbnb as well-positioned to benefit from secular growth in travel the increasingly mainstream nature of private rentals and as hybrid work/travel can lead to more frequent and longer stays. Unlike traditional online travel agencies like Booking.com and Expedia Airbnb’s user traffic comes almost entirely directly which speaks to the brand’s strength. This also means that Airbnb does not need to pay Google or other meta-search engines nearly as much money for generating booking leads which is a favorable structural business model advantage in our view. We expect the company’s bookings and revenue to compound at a high-teens rate or better over the next five years and margins to expand by thousands of basis points as it scales its fixed costs base leading to 40%+ earnings per share growth over that period.”

Raging inflation could do more than just erode the purchasing power of the dollar.

According to Peter Schiff CEO of equity fund Euro Pacific Capital who’s famous for publicly predicting the 2008 housing crisis spiking price levels will help “push the economy into recession.”

“A strong economy doesn't produce inflation” Fox Business reported earlier this month. “It actually produces the reverse because a strong economy means that your economy is productive you're producing more goods and services and you're growing the supply.”

The good news? Schiff also knows a thing or two about hedging against inflation. In fact we can clearly see that theme in Euro Pacific's latest 13F filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.

So here’s a look at three ways Schiff’s investment firm is preparing for a downturn — one of them might be worth purchasing with some of your extra nickels and dimes.

Gold miners

Mark Agnor/Shutterstock

Schiff has long been a fan of the yellow metal.

“The problem with the dollar is it has no intrinsic value” he once said. “Gold will store its value and you'll always be able to buy more food with your gold.""

As always he’s putting his money where his mouth is.

As of Sept. 30 Euro Pacific held 519095 shares of Newmont and 1.528 million shares of Barrick Gold.

In fact the two gold mining giants were the firm’s top two holdings representing 7.4% and 7.3% of its portfolio respectively.

In Q3 Newmont produced 1.45 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1120 per ounce — the current price of gold sits above $1800. Meanwhile Barrick Gold produced 1.09 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1034 per ounce.

Gold can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and its status as a safe haven means demand typically increases during times of uncertainty.

If gold prices go up miners like Newmont and Barrick will likely enjoy bigger profits.

These days you can build your own recession-proof portfolio just by using your own digital nickels and dimes.

Recession-proof income stocks

Dividend stocks offer investors a great way to earn a passive income stream but some can also be used as a hedge against inflation — and even recessions.

Case in point: The third-largest holding at Euro Pacific is cigarette giant British American Tobacco accounting for 4.5% of the portfolio.

The maker of Kent and Dunhill cigarettes pays quarterly dividends of 75 cents per share giving the stock an attractive annual yield of 8.6%.

Schiff’s fund also owns over 160000 shares of Philip Morris International another tobacco king with a dividend yield of 5.4%. The Marlboro cigarette producer is Euro Pacific’s fourth-largest holding with a portfolio weighting of 4%.

Story continues

The demand for cigarettes is highly inelastic meaning large price changes only induce small changes in demand — and that demand is largely immune to economic shocks.

If you’re comfortable with investing in so-called sin stocks British American and Philip Morris might be worth researching further.

Agriculture

Mark Agnor/Shutterstock

When it comes to playing defence there’s one recession-proof sector that shouldn’t be overlooked: agriculture.

It’s simple. Whatever happens people still need to eat.

Schiff doesn’t talk about agriculture as much as precious metals but the fifth-largest holding of Euro Pacific is fertilizer producer Nutrien.

As one of the world’s largest providers of crop inputs and services Nutrien is positioned solidly even if the economy enters a major downturn. Its shares are already up about 39% in 2021.

Another way to play the agricultural boom is to invest in U.S. farmland.

Farmland could be an effective hedge because it’s intrinsically valuable and has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market.

The NCREIF Farmland Total Return Index has increased more than five times over the past 15 years 10 times over the past 20 years and 20 times over the past 30 years.

The best part? You don’t need to get your hands dirty to get a piece of the action.

New platforms allow you to invest in U.S. farmland by taking a stake in the farm of your choice.

You’ll earn cash income from the leasing fees and crop sales. And of course you’ll benefit from any long-term appreciation on top of that.

The company revealed the top five servants during an FGO panel at Anime NYC 2021. Kenji Akabane and Chiaki Kobayashi the voices of Kadoc Zemlupus and Bartholomew Roberts respectively shared some notable facts about the top picks. Interestingly the list excludes Mash Kyrielight due to the fact that a significant portion of players uses the character.

Kobayashi notes that players can obtain all of the top five servants from the 4-star guaranteed summons at the start of the game. In addition to their useful abilities he adds that this is likely the reason why the servants are the most used in the game. Akabane recalls how he was told to go forward with the game if he pulled Hercules at the beginning due to the character’s powerful abilities.

The two voice actors also offered their own servant recommendations. Akabane recommends Saber Musashi as well as Caster Anastasia one of the servants of character he voices. He also highlights Avenger Space Ishtar one of the servants that appeared in the new Saber Wars 2 event. On other hand Kobayashi recommends the Saber Altria Pendragon as well as his own character Bartholomew.

By Meena Thandavarayan Sr. AI/ML Partner Solutions Architect – AWS

Dataiku

Approximately 80% of an organization’s data is semi-structured or unstructured according to Gartner. Unlocking the value from unstructured data can help organizations stay competitive and make smarter business decisions.

Many businesses have started to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to derive insights from unstructured data such as text images and videos. Building a model for such use cases however often remains a challenge for citizen data scientists and analysts due to resource constraints.

With deeper integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools from Amazon Web Services (AWS) Dataiku enables citizen data scientists and analysts to augment their analytics workflow with pretrained NLP and computer vision models.

In this post we’ll explore how you can use Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Rekognition plugins on Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS) to build a simple workflow of NLP and computer vision use cases respectively.

Dataiku is an AWS Partner with the Machine Learning Competency that orchestrates the entire machine learning (ML) lifecycle and makes it accessible to data scientists and analysts alike.

An AI and analytics production platform Dataiku was named a Leader in both the Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms and the Forrester Wave: Multimodal Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning Solutions Q3 2020.

AWS AI Services

Amazon Comprehend is a fully managed NLP service that enables you to extract insights from the content of documents. It supports custom classification and enables you to build custom classifiers that are specific to your requirements without requiring machine learning expertise.

Amazon Rekognition is a fully managed service that provides computer vision capabilities for analyzing images and video at scale using deep learning technology without requiring ML expertise

Use Cases

Unstructured data is ubiquitous across all industries and (generally speaking) images and videos are used for computer vision use cases and text data is used for natural language processing.

You want to start from a business problem and then look for the machine learning use cases that partially or fully addresses the problem. For example NLP could be used to improve customer satisfaction by finding out a sentiment of the conversation happened between the customer and sales support representative.

Computer vision meanwhile can be used to solve production management or quality control in manufacturing.

Here are some other use cases for NLP and computer vision:

Medical data as images like scan reports and MRIs patients’ medical history and text records and other types of imagery or videos for diagnosis.

Product and customer sentiment is revealed from service center calls online reviews social media references and survey questions.

Financial sector processes often deal with paper-based invoices quotes orders and receipts such as procure to pay or order to cash processes.

Energy companies have a wealth of information in well files pipeline and instrumentation diagrams (PIDs) and images.

Utility companies rely on manual inspections of captured images of utility infrastructure and their surrounding environments.

By enabling Amazon Comprehend or Amazon Rekognition as plugins in Dataiku citizen data science teams are enabled with intuitive tools for data wrangling analyzing and visualizing unstructured datasets without building own models from scratch. Business analysts meanwhile can reveal new insights and make the right decisions based on data.

Solution Architecture

The architecture diagram in Figure 1 highlights how Dataiku integrates with AWS. There are multiple AWS services plugins available through Dataiku DSS. In this post we are going to talk specifically about the Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Comprehend plugins.

There are three categories of how AWS services integrate with Dataiku DSS:

DSS ML platform: Design node automation node and API deployer hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

Design node automation node and API deployer hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Data lake: AWS Glue as a meta store and Amazon Athena for SQL queries against Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data.

Figure 1 – Dataiku DSS reference architecture.

Predict Customer Sentiment Using Amazon Comprehend Plugin

Let’s first look at how you can leverage Amazon Comprehend in Dataiku. We’ll be using the Amazon product review dataset where the business goal is to predict customer sentiment so marketing or customer teams can take the best preventative action.

The dataset consists of over 130 million consumer reviews from Amazon.com marketplace over a period of 1995-2015. The dataset includes metadata but only the review text is needed for this use case.

Amazon Comprehend capabilities in Dataiku allow users to analyze unstructured text content for language detection named entity recognition key phrase extraction and sentiment analysis.

Note that plugins are enabled for Dataiku projects by a Dataiku administrator. If you’re unable to find the plugin in your project ask your admin to enable the same.

Once installed the Amazon Comprehend plugin is configured to call the Amazon Comprehend API through your AWS account.

The preset information required to enable this connection from the Amazon Comprehend plugin includes your AWS credentials; namely access key secret key and region and Amazon Comprehend configurations like API quotas and parallelization settings.

Figure 2 – AWS AI services plugin setup.

Once the configuration is complete you can implement the use case.

Figure 3 – Amazon Comprehend workflow.

Next load the dataset onto your Dataiku project. Our interest for this use case is the “Text Column” feature of the dataset. This feature has all of the customer comments for the products.

Data preparation is an optional step for this use case. You can choose to filter the products of interest and remove any unwanted columns.

You can now drag and drop Amazon Comprehend to the workflow. For our use case we’ll use the “Sentiment Analysis” option.

Note that Amazon Comprehend provides capabilities to create custom entity detection and custom classifiers. The initial release of the Amazon Comprehend plugin for Dataiku supports only the built-in classifiers. Future upgrades will include custom classifiers.

Run the workflow and capture the results. The Amazon Comprehend plugin provides the sentiment prediction (“Positive” “Negative” “Neutral”) and a sentiment score for every review of the product.

Figure 4 – Amazon Comprehend results.

The sentiment prediction can be charted for every product to identify your business strategy around retire retain replace or re-engineer.

Predicting Unsafe Content Using Amazon Rekognition Plugin

Now let’s look at how to leverage Amazon Rekognition in Dataiku. We’ll be using COCO dataset where the business goal is to detect objects and moderate unsafe content so customer teams can take action and filter the images.

COCO is a large-scale object detection segmentation and captioning dataset. It features 330000 images and among that more than 200000 are labeled. It has 80 object categories with 1.5 million object instances and 250000 people with key points.

The Amazon Rekognition plugin for Dataiku allows users to analyze images and videos for object detection and labelling text detection and unsafe content moderation.

Install the Amazon Rekognition plugin in your Dataiku project and load the dataset onto your Dataiku project. Our interest for this use case is detecting the objects in the image and identifying if any are unsafe.

You can now drag and drop Amazon Rekognition to the workflow. For our use case we’ll use the object detection and unsafe content moderation options.

An illustration of an Amazon Rekognition pipeline is shown below. Load the dataset and add the Amazon Rekognition plugin to the workflow; one for object detection and one for unsafe content moderation.

Figure 5 – Amazon Rekognition workflow.

The EU aims to take a stand with an import ban.

Despite recent headline-grabbing promises to protect its rainforest before the end of the decade Brazil has once again seen a jump in deforestation.

The latest figures released by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) which tracks the state of the Amazon rainforest showed a 22% increase from last year. Some 13235 square kilometers (5110 square miles) disappearing between August 1 2020 and July 31 2021. The new statistics were dated October 27 — before the start of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow — prompting environmental organizations like Greenpeace to accuse the Brazilian government of trying to clean up its image during the crucial talks.

""There is no amount of greenwashing that can hide what [President Jair] Bolsonaro is doing to destroy the Amazon. If anyone believed Bolsonaro's government's empty promises at COP the truth is in these numbers. Unlike Bolsonaro the satellites don't lie"" the group said in a press statement.

A pledge to save the rainforest?

Brazil along with more than 100 other global leaders pledged during the UN climate conference in Glasgow to stop and reverse deforestation by 2030. Its Amazon rainforest represents about a third of all the tropical forests left on Earth.

This huge biologically rich region is key to helping absorb planet-warming CO2; forests absorb roughly 30% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions according to the World Resources Institute.

But despite a significant drop in deforestation from a high of 27700 square kilometers (10700 square miles) in 2004 to just over 4500 square kilometers in 2012 illegal logging agricultural expansion and damaging wildfires have slowly pushed that rate back up over the last decade — especially since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019.

""The environmental track record of Brazil's federal government is appalling and multiple lines of evidence show that they have been simultaneously encouraging deforestation whilst reducing investment in environmental enforcement"" said Jos Barlow a British conservation science professor based at Lancaster University who has worked in Brazil since 1998.

""Without a dramatic change in their approach the commitments made at COP should be seen in this context — at least until the election in a year's time"" he told DW.

Amazon has 'already changed beyond all recognition'

The Brazilian rainforest plays a key role in mitigating climate change but Bolsonaro is primarily concerned with its economic possibilities. Under his government environmental authorities have been defunded and land protections loosened. This has encouraged loggers farmers and cattle ranchers to further develop the Amazon region some 60% of which — about the size of western Europe — is found in Brazil.

""The Amazon is in the center of the global debate on climate change"" said Andre Guimaraes executive director of Brazilian think tank Amazon Environmental Research Institute in an email to DW. ""It stocks carbon and it is a source of rain to agriculture and energy. But nothing seems to echo [with] the federal administration that has chosen wrong expensive and inefficient ways to deal with deforestation.""

Some observers believe parts of the world's largest remaining rainforest may be nearing a tipping point beyond which its ecosystem could collapse and substantially weaken any efforts to limit global heating.

Barlow a co-founder of the Sustainable Amazon Network research group has noticed significant changes in the Santarem region in the eastern part of the Amazon. Since the 1980s he said the region has seen a 34% decrease in rainfall during the dry season a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and an increase in huge wildfires that have wiped out more than 1 million hectares of forest.

""The forests and the landscapes have already changed beyond all recognition in the past 20 years and the rate of change is speeding up. So yes it is very close to a tipping point. But I like to hope we can still avert it even in these regions"" he told DW.

EU takes steps to limit deforestation

Barlow was encouraged by the actions of state-level governments in the Amazon region some of which have made their own commitments to stop deforestation. ""There is also increasing international pressure with Europe and the UK committing to deforestation-free commodity imports"" he said.

On Wednesday the European Commission presented a proposal to restrict imports on goods linked to deforestation among them soybeans palm oil beef wood and products made from them. Brazil which produces many of these products would be hit particularly hard.

""These initiatives show that the European Union is serious about the green transition"" said Frans Timmermans the European Commission vice president in charge of the EU's Green Deal adding that this would help ""promote sustainable consumption.""

""This is an important step in the right direction and it provides a powerful incentive for business to adapt and regulate itself"" said Barlow. But he added it wasn't enough: implementation would be a ""huge challenge"" as would compliance. And he pointed out much of Brazil's beef is exported to places outside of the EU like Egypt and more generally the Middle East. ""We need all countries to agree to this.""

The measure which could still undergo changes before coming into force will still need approval from EU member states and the European Parliament.

Barlow also said measures to limit forest degradation and support the livelihoods of local Amazonians were crucial a stance echoed by Giulia Bondi an EU forest campaigner with transparency group Global Witness.

""The European Parliament and EU member states must now strengthen this law to uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities stop EU financiers bankrolling and profiting from global deforestation and associated abuses and include key commodities like rubber and maize"" she said in a statement.

INPE’s Prodes monitoring system has shown that 5110 square miles of rainforest was destroyed from August 2002 to July 2021.

These findings undermine Brazil’s attempts to increase their environmental credibility at the COP26 climate change summit earlier this month when they promised to end and reverse deforestation by as early as 2030.

The Amazon rainforest is home to over three million species of plants and animals as well as one million indigenous people. Furthermore it has long acted as a vital carbon sink that helped mitigate global warming.

During the past decade the rainforest lost over 3860 square miles to deforestation each year with the annual average leaping up to 4400 square miles since 2019. The total extent of deforestation over the past three years covers an area larger than the US state of Maryland.

“It is a shame. It is a crime” said Márcio Astrini the executive secretary of the environmental non-profit group Climate Observatory. “We are seeing the Amazon rainforest being destroyed by a government which made environmental destruction its public policy.”

Due to deforestation huge areas of the Amazon rainforest are now producing more carbon than they absorb. Through a combination of fires and logging many regions recently switched from being carbon sinks to being carbon emitters particularly in the south-eastern Amazonia thus fueling global warming and producing more frequent and intense extreme weather events.

Although Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro recently declared that 90 percent of the Amazon remain pristine and that international attacks on Brazil for deforestation are unfounded and unfair the recent data appears to paint a much grimmer picture.

“This is the real Brazil that the Bolsonaro government tries to hide with fantastical speeches and actions of greenwashing abroad” said Mauricio Voivodic the executive director of the World Wildlife Fund in a statement following the release of the Prodes data.

“The reality shows that the Bolsonaro government accelerated the path of Amazon destruction” he concluded.

If measures to stop and reverse deforestation in the Amazon are not urgently taken this vital region – as well as our entire planet- will have much to suffer.

A survey commissioned by IATA of 4700 respondents in 11 markets in September demonstrated confidence that the risks of COVID-19 can be effectively managed and that the freedom to travel should be restored. With more markets starting to open to travel an area that needs to be addressed is the COVID-related travel rules and requirements.

73% of those who have traveled since June 2020 found it challenging to understand what rules applied for a trip (up from 70% in June)

73% felt the COVID-19 paperwork was challenging to arrange (also up from 70% in June)

At this point it’s becoming evident that COVID-19 is not going to disappear and that it will keep posing challenges for international air travel. As a result everyone in the air transport industry and from other industries that require international travel have been learning to operate with the new travel restrictions.

However it has been difficult for these companies or passengers to keep up with the constant changes in government travel document requirements. Non standardized documents different COVID-19 test requirements various timeframes for testing vaccinations etc. have created much confusion and incredible pressure on airlines travel agents airport staff corporate travel departments and leisure travelers to ensure that they have the correct documentation for their upcoming trip.

Where to find the accurate passenger travel document requirements?

A key solution to ensure compliance with COVID-19 travel rule changes is IATA Timatic. IATA Timatic is a one-stop shop for the air travel’s industry most reliable and up-to-date travel and health document rules information for anywhere in the world. It lets travelers and businesses know if a passenger’s documentation meets the requirements of their itinerary with certainty.



Where can individual travelers find travel and health document requirements?





Individuals and families planning a trip can use the IATA Travel Centre to get personalised passport visa and health requirements advice based on their personal details and itinerary. IATA has also made available a COVID-19 travel regulations map designed to guide individual travelers through the process of identifying requirements. The data is made available to the general public for information purposes only.



Where can companies find travel and health document requirements for their business needs?





For over 50 years the air travel industry has trusted IATA Timatic to provide accurate and reliable travel document information. USA Today named Timatic the most reliable non-government source of travel documents information. In 2019 alone Timatic helped airlines to ensure that the travel documentation of 700 million travelers met government entry requirements. Today it powers the entry requirements functions of IATA’s Travel Pass a key to re-opening borders and restarting aviation. No matter your business size you can also have access to this trusted source of information to advise passengers accurately and avoid fines.

Why do airlines check passengers’ travel documents?

Have you ever wondered why airlines check your passport? After all it is not as if they really mind what nationality you have. In short it is the airline’s responsibility to ensure that every passenger has the required travel documents for their destination and any transit points. Where airlines do not perform this task or mistakenly carry a passenger with insufficient travel documents they will normally be fined by the Immigration Department with such fines reaching into the thousands of dollars not to mention the customer inconvenience. And as you can imagine the new COVID-19 related restrictions have made this a very challenging task.





Why should travel agents and booking websites check passenger travel documents?



It’s also important for travel agencies and online booking sites to incorporate such checks when clients plan their trips. As a travel agent the last thing you want is to provide wrong travel regulation information to one of your clients and then have them get refused to board their flight. This could have severe consequences on your reputation and you could potentially lose repeat business.



What are the main reasons for a passenger to be rejected from boarding their flight?





The vast majority of rejections are for three reasons:

Passport validity

Each country demands that travelers' travel documents must be valid for a certain length of time and in many cases it will vary by the nationality of the passenger One-way tickets

Most countries have regulations that non-nationals must have a return or onward ticket showing that they do not intend to stay in the destination country; however few actually enforce this Visa

Passengers do not have a visa or it is invalid. This is becoming an increasingly complex area as many countries are starting to accept visas issued by other countries e.g. Mexico will accept US visas

In recent months you could add a fourth item to this list and it’s the COVID-19 related restrictions. Given the number of rule changes and confusing information available online many passengers arrive at the airport with insufficient or incorrect health document which forces airlines to refuse passengers.

Lastly airlines are also protecting their travelers from taking a flight where they will not be admitted to the destination country. Can you imagine a couple going on a long-awaited vacation and being refused entry to their holiday destination as their passports expire in five months whereas the destination country requires them to be valid for six months? Or traveling with a rapid antigen test when a PCR test is needed?

Where and how does IATA collect the travel regulations in Timatic?

Before the COVID-19 pandemic on average 72 immigration regulations updates were made to the Timatic database every day. At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic more than 200 updates were made per day. The reason why Timatic is the trusted solution in the air travel industry is the quality and reliability of its data. Should the immigration regulations contained within Timatic be incorrect this would lead to passengers not being informed of the correct travel documents necessary as well as airlines carrying improperly documented passengers and paying the resulting fines.

A good example of how Timatic is updated was the US Presidential Executive Order in 2017 which banned certain nationalities from entering the US. As the order was implemented the regulations were updated in the Timatic database and were instantly applied to passenger check-ins around the world. Similarly as the situation developed and the courts ruled the ban illegal the regulations changes were reversed in Timatic. The same applies to all the COVID-19 rule changes as soon as an update is made within seconds the database is updated and can be accessed by Timatic users around the globe. During the COVID crises we have seen a country change their regulations in a day as much as seven times. All of this is captured reviewed validated and updated by the Timatic team.

Another key feature of the data is that it represents the actual immigration regulations as they are enforced. In many cases there may be a difference between the regulations published by the immigration authorities and their interpretation or enforcement. While the Timatic team works very closely with the immigration and border control authorities in nearly all countries in the world their role is to represent the airline members and not just to be a publishing vehicle for immigration authorities. A good example of the divergence between regulations and actual enforcement is the rules surrounding one-way tickets. The majority of countries regulate that foreign passengers must hold a return or onward ticket; however in practice few countries actively enforce this regulation. Such regulations are typically only enforced where there are suspicions as to the passenger’s intentions. Should such regulations be enforced airlines would in practice not be able to carry passengers on one-way tickets. A differentiation is made in the Timatic rules engine so that the check-in is only stopped where the passenger has a one-way ticket and the regulation is being actively enforced.





Who provides the travel and health document requirements?





In order to collect and publish the immigration regulations and actual enforcement policies IATA relies on over 2000 information sources around the world. These sources can be divided between government sources and airline sources. Government sources can be categorized into several different types including border control immigration consular departments of foreign affairs and ministries of health. There is no more reliable source of worldwide up-to-date immigration rules in force than Timatic which contributes to the reliability and transparency of the Quality of Nationality Index which is based in large part on the Timatic data processed by IATA Timatic team members.





How are the travel and health document requirements collected?



The IATA Compliance Requirements Network is responsible for developing and maintaining relations with airlines as well as immigration authorities ministries of foreign affairs and other government departments to ensure the advice provided by Timatic to its users is accurate.

Keeping Timatic updated during the constantly changing crisis has not been easy however. The IATA Timatic team is in constant communication with governments and airlines around the world to ensure all travel documentation as well as health restriction checks requirements and rules are kept up to date on a real-time basis. At a recent set of webinars organized by the Timatic team many government authorities participated and openly shared their challenges and opportunities.

Martin Banz Head of Border Policy Unit in Switzerland says his government has been collaborating with IATA Timatic for over ten years. “The more complex the regulations the higher the risk that passengers will be refused entry on arrival” he says. “Rules can only be complied with if they are known. We need a dedicated communication channel to process our rules and make them available centrally available. And this is exactly what IATA Timatic does. We make sure every rule change is forwarded to IATA Timatic by default if possible before it comes into force.”

Help improve Timatic If you are a government official or an airline station manager please consider joining the IATA Compliance Network. Better information means a better travel experience.



Why are travel and health document requirements validated by the Timatic team?





Updates to Timatic are done in real-time and can be shared around the globe within seconds however all changes are validated by the Timatic Sourcing team and confirmed by local government officials before being updated in the system. As a result when you use Timatic you get information sourced from over 2000 government and airline officials from all over the world. And our team of experts verify conflicting reports and make updates only when we’re 100% sure they’re accurate.

“If IATA Timatic is not up to date it can have negative consequences” Lionel Mathias Global Airports Network and Cargo Operations Department Etihad Airways says. “I would request all government regulators and border authorities reach out to IATA Timatic and provide carriers notice [of regulation changes] well in time so we can prepare and inform our customers.”

American Airlines has used Timatic since 2013. The tool is integrated into their in-house systems at airports online and their reservation call center. And it has been crucial to the carrier maintaining its cost containment regime. “Our fines were approximately $1.3 million per year” says Alison Anderson Senior Analyst International Operations American Airlines. “We had them down approximately to $250000.” She also adds “We’re 100% confident in the data provided by Timatic”.

What type of documents and information is included in Timatic?





Since 1963 Timatic has been providing the latest travel document and regulation rules for over 220 countries collected from over 2000 sources and updated in real-time up to 200 times a day. The database covers the following areas:

passport requirements and recommendations

Last year analysts valued the scheme at around $18bn-30bn eclipsing the company’s current market capitalisation of $12.9bn. Such programmes have proved a boon to American carriers in the pandemic. Firms including American Airlines have raised $30bn in debt backed by the schemes.

Airlines once hoped simply to foster loyalty by offering customers freebies. Passengers collected miles as they travelled and were awarded a free flight once they racked up enough of them. But schemes today are far more sophisticated. Airlines profit by selling miles to credit-card firms at a price that exceeds the cost of providing reward flights and dishing out other perks such as hotel stays. They also gain when miles expire unused or are cashed in for something of poor value. According to McKinsey a consultancy 15-30% of miles expired unused before the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9henVsLWRpdmVyc2UtZmxlZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside The Diverse Fleet Of Azul In 2021,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9henVsLWRpdmVyc2UtZmxlZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3Njb3R0LWtpcmJ5LXdhbGwtc3RyZWV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines CEO Stands Up To Wall Street Bets On Quality,"This week was Leadership Week at United Airlines with a number of addresses from top-level leadership about the future of United.

In an extended conversation with Walter Isaacson a member of the United Airlines Board of Directors CEO Scott Kirby pitted United against Wall Street and explained why United will focus on the quality of the passenger experience in the months ahead.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby Vs. Wall Street

Kirby frames the conversation as United Airlines against Wall Street saying United will no longer give into short-term demand for numbers and performance.

“One of the mistakes United made over the years was giving into Wall Street who is very short-term focused and I think it’s really important we do the right thing for the long-term. “The good news is doing the right thing even if costs you something in the short-term is almost always the right answer in the long-term.”

Specifically this was implicated by the recent order of up to 500 new aircraft. But Kirby insists that rather that kowtowing to demand to cut capacity the airline must think long-term:

“People on Wall Street got mad at us. Still are mad at us about an aircraft order… “We’ve underutilized our hubs and we’ve tried to fly 50 seat regional jets up against Delta or American or Southwest flying mainline jets and we lose that battle. It’s a higher cost airplane. It’s a worse product. We just lose the battle and you get on this negative flywheel…”

Kirby is right about using the right-sized jets though I’m not sure Wall Street was actually that angry at United for its new aircraft order. Still the fact that Kirby is thinking long-term is an important point of distinction from two of his recent predecessors Jeff Smisek and Glenn Tilton.

Kirby: Customers Care About Quality. That’s What We Are Betting On

Kirby pivots from the aircraft order to the onboard product noting that central to his growth plan is offering the best product and best customer service.

“We’ve always had the most potential of any airline in the world so this is really about realizing our potential. And part of that means we have the right airplanes and we have to have a market share that’s equivalent to what our bills are but it’s also about the product. “To me the most important thing at United Next is not the 500 airplanes. That’s exciting that’s important but it’s about getting the entire product to be a great product that makes a difference to customers. “And the people on Wall Street have said ‘Oh you’re making a big bet on recovery in business demand or recovery and demand’ and what I see is that’s not the bet we’ve made. We’re making a bet that customers care about quality that people will fly us because we’ve got the best product and the best customer service. “Some people care only about price but there are a lot of people out there that care about more than just saving $2 on their airline ticket and that’s the bet we’re making is that quality will bring us loyal customers.”

There’s still a disconnect between that rhetoric and the onboard product. Kirby as much as admits that when he speak about the importance of brining glassware back onboard in another part of his conversation with Isaacson. But it’s so much more than glassware or the current unbelievably miserly catering offered on longhaul flights in all three cabins: it is about creating a door-to-door quality experience that passengers are willing to pay a premium for. Seamless check-in on the app. Ground experience. Wi-Fi onboard. A compelling MileagePlus program.

In other meetings this week United leadership talked about replacing Sodexo at United Clubs with the same team that is responsible for catering for American Express Centurion Lounges. It talked about a new flight test kitchen in ORD that eventually will transform the onboard catering experience. Stay tuned for more details on that.

There’s a lot of talk right now and it’s all music to the ears of every frequent Untied flyer…but it will come down as it always does to execution.

CONCLUSION

Kirby is saying all the right things…he has for months. United Airlines has also positioned itself very well to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever especially when international traffic rebounds. But Kirby must inspire employees to provide uniformly good service and offer a soft product that rivals or exceeds any of its U.S. competitors. That remains a work in progress but all sources indicate United is working on it.

Technology Writer

Rivian is an American electric vehicle manufacturer that was founded in 2009 and is based out of California. They specifically specialize in electric SUVs and pickup trucks with great off-road capabilities. Rivian is set to be releasing its electric vehicles to the public by December of 2021 with the help of Ford – which owns 12% of the company and Amazon – which owns 20%. In addition Amazon has also placed an order for 100000 electric vans by 2030 which are still in development. Rivian is currently producing two vehicles the “R1T” which is their pickup truck model and the “R1S” SUV model. Both of these vehicles are forecasted to have two front motors producing 415 horsepower and 413 lb.-ft of torque while the two rear motors will produce 420 horsepower and 495 lb.-ft of torque. They also produce a various selection of batteries ranging from 230 miles to over 400 miles. Rivian claims the vehicles will be able to go from 0–60 MPH in 3 seconds flat something that is sure to make headlines. These types of vehicles are currently in high demand by consumers across America and although electric cars aren’t that prominent in the car market they are beginning to take over the roads more and more. Electric Cars are actually projected to make up more than 50 percent of the car market within the next decade. As they inch closer to being ready to start rolling out its innovative electric trucks to consumers the company officially went public and it caught the attention of many due to the great success they have experienced so far.

Rivian has been in the spotlight ever since it made its highly anticipated stock market debut all due to the intense interest from investors looking to capitalize on the fast-growing EV market. The company has been public only since November 9th and is already competing with some of the top vehicle manufacturers. The company opened with a stock price of $78 per share and has risen to $106.75 per share as of market open on November 10th only one day later.

However despite Rivian’s great market debut they have a long way to go if they want to catch up to its competitors such as Tesla which has a strong dominant grasp on the electric vehicles market. Tesla currently has a market cap of over one trillion dollars however one thing that sets Rivian apart from Tesla is that it specializes in electric trucks something which Tesla does not have any set plans of producing. This makes Rivian an interesting stock to potentially invest in due to its rapidly growing market.

No silver bullet solves this problem yet Washington can kill multiple birds with one stone. As a new report from the Jewish Institute for National Security of America explains the Eastern Mediterranean increasingly offers unique strategic opportunities to bolster U.S. forward presence; move forces quickly and efficiently into neighboring regions; and reassure partners without breaking the bank creating new power vacuums or pulling focus from great power competition.

As the literal “sea between the lands” the Eastern Mediterranean is a natural geostrategic link between Europe Africa and the Middle East. For that same reason it is becoming a crucial arena for expansionist forces seeking to undermine U.S. interests.

Most notably Turkey’s transformation under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan — from a reliable ally into an unpredictable unilateral and interventionist actor — is playing out on all three continents and among the waters in between where Ankara threatens peaceful development of some of the world’s largest recent energy finds by U.S. partners Greece Cyprus Israel and Egypt.

Great powers increasingly call the region home as well. Russia’s military bases in Syria and Libya and the return of its naval forces to the Mediterranean imperil NATO’s southeastern flank. By acquiring ownership stakes and operating rights for ports and other critical infrastructure China’s Belt and Road Initiative is expanding into the Eastern Mediterranean. Though not a great power Iran is entrenching its militias with their increasingly capable missiles and drones that can target shipping along Lebanese and Syrian shores.

America’s current regional force posture struggles to address these challenges. The United States only home ports a single logistics ship in the region. And as the Pentagon refocuses on competing with China in the Indo-Pacific U.S. presence is receding from hot spots adjacent to the Eastern Mediterranean. U.S. bases and troop levels are contracting in the Middle East and Africa while doubts persist in the trans-Atlantic alliance and in Moscow about America’s concrete commitments to collective defense. These developments could create voids to be filled and fought over by great powers Turkey Iran and terrorist groups — and America’s allies are caught in the middle.

The United States can mitigate the problematic effects of this broader retrenchment and compensate for drawdowns in adjacent regions by re-envisioning the Eastern Mediterranean as a multi-theater power projection platform. This will require modest enhancement to U.S. force presence. From a few strategic locations in the region U.S. ground air and naval assets could rotate or rapidly deploy into nearby Eastern Europe the Black Sea the Middle East the Red Sea the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.

Greece is a particularly appealing location and partner. Its position at the region’s nexus including its deep-water port at Souda Bay on Crete is ideal for projecting power in all directions. Athens also enthusiastically supports America by being a regional security provider and diplomatic leader.

Having just signed an upgraded bilateral defense agreement the United States should explore forward-deploying additional air wings and home porting two guided-missile destroyers — which are currently in Spain — in Greece.

In addition to stationing more expeditionary and sealift capabilities at Souda Bay Washington should boost rotational deployments through underutilized Greek bases like Alexandroupoli which is well-suited for surging NATO forces into Eastern Europe. This could include littoral combat ships amphibious command ships guided-missile destroyers and cruisers and dock-landing ships.

Paralleling Task Force 59 in Middle Eastern waters U.S. 6th Fleet should use unmanned systems to strengthen America’s intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance network in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Congress can help Greece grow its complementary role to the United States. Based on provisions initially spelled out in 2019 lawmakers should ensure sustained and predictable amounts of foreign military financing excess defense articles and military education and training for Greece.

In tandem the United States should deepen engagement with evolving diplomatic coalitions which while anchored in the Eastern Mediterranean increasingly overlap with neighboring security architectures. Building on its participation in the Greek-Cypriot-Israeli “trilateral” forum Washington should extend this “3+1″ model to other Greek-Cypriot trilaterals with Egypt the United Arab Emirates and India — and coordinate them with similar frameworks in the Indo-Pacific. Diplomacy should be underpinned by regular expanded military exercises with these countries plus others with rising regional ties and roles like France Italy Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

By ensuring continued U.S. power projection even amid larger drawdowns and uncertainties these steps can help simplify American strategists’ unenviable task of putting the correct number of troops in the correct places.

The deal first reported by the Washington Free Beacon during the 2020 presidential campaign was spotlighted by the New York Times Saturday as Congress inches closer to approving President Biden’s $2 trillion social spending plan which earmarks billions of dollars to promote electric vehicles.

In 2016 an investment firm founded by Hunter Biden with several Chinese partners was cut into a complex $3.8 billion transaction that transferred 80 percent of Congo’s Tenke Fungurum mine from an American company to Beijing-backed China Molybdenum.

President Joe Biden Hunter Biden’s father was the sitting vice president when the deal was struck.

The mine is one of the world’s largest sources of cobalt — and China’s control of the mineral “presents a critical vulnerability to the future of the U.S. domestic auto industry” Biden’s White House reported in June.

A White House spokesman said that Joe Biden had no knowledge of his son’s involvement with the sale the Times reported."

Brian Netzel a 62-year-old former client manager in Arizona filed the complaint late last month with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He entered mediation with American Express on Thursday.

“On October 30 2020 AmEx unceremoniously terminated my employment as part of a ‘diversity’ policy that rewarded company executives for making their departments less ‘white’’ his EEOC complaint states. “My termination was the direct result of me being an older white male a demographic the company specifically sought to reduce in managerial positions like my own and in direct retaliation for my stated opposition to AmEx’s racially discriminatory and hostile policies.”

Mr. Netzel said he was fired by a higher ranking executive who profited from his termination because the company is awarding bonus points for having more people of color.

American Express initiated training based on critical race theory and subsequently fired Mr. Nextel after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May 2020 according to Mr. Netzel and company documents made public by Christopher Rufo of the Manhattan Institute.

Developed in graduate and law schools in the 1970s critical race theory is an analytical tool based on Marxist critical studies. It posits that racism is a foundational element of American society and government and is important in understanding and evaluating U.S. laws policies and programs.

American Express said Mr. Netzel’s claim is “without merit.”

“We have a longstanding commitment to living our company values which includes fostering a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues feel welcome and heard and have equal opportunities to thrive” company spokeswoman Leah Gerstner said.

“Our diversity equity and inclusion programs are singularly about upholding this commitment and are not based on any specific theory nor are they targeted to a specific group of employees” Ms. Gerstner said. “Advancement and compensation within our company is based solely on individual business and leadership performance. Any characterization of our company and culture to the contrary is just wrong.”

According to company records American Express ordered employees to undergo “anti-racist” training sessions in which they were compelled to identify their “privilege” and define themselves by “race sexual orientation body type religion disability status age gender identity [and] citizenship.”

In addition American Express paid Harvard Kennedy School professor Khalil Muhammad to lecture company employees. Mr. Muhammad the great-grandson of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad spoke on the topic of race in corporate America and excoriated capitalism and American Express for alleged evils visited on people of color.

According to his EEOC complaint Mr. Netzel objected to internal pressure to align with left-wing positions which he said offered a distorted view of American Express’ core credit business.

“Our members were being burned out of their business” he said of riots that erupted amid racial justice protests after the Floyd murder. “It seemed a bizarre position based on the company.”

Mr. Netzel also said he would have run afoul of the law had he followed Mr. Muhammad’s advice. “He insisted in his speech that we treat Black people differently than Whites which in the credit business is illegal” Mr. Netzel said. “I was floored.”

Mr. Netzel voiced concerns about the training and asked why conservative Blacks like Thomas Sowell or Robert Woodson were excluded. He also posted on his individual Facebook page memes mocking people like social justice advocate Shaun King whose fundraising has drawn criticism and Rachel Dolezal a White woman who pretended to be Black and ran the Seattle NAACP chapter.

In terminating him American Express cited his social media posts and even a private text discussion he had with a friend over whether Popeye’s or Chick-fil-A had superior fried chicken according to Mr. Netzel’s attorney David Pivtorak.

“I had posted jokes critical of the ‘woke-ism’ taking over the country and also been critical of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for painting ‘Black Lives Matter’ on the street in Manhattan outside of Trump Tower” Mr. Netzel said.

Mr. Netzel’s position was eliminated not by his direct supervisor for cause but by another executive who would profit by dismissing White employees Mr. Pivtorak said.

“There was an extremely shady procedural aspect to all this” the attorney said. “It wasn’t the usual chain of command …”

The EEOC complaint says the company ignored anti-discrimination laws in trying to achieve the newly ordered equity.

“AmEx made it clear that the demographics in … positions must be changed to reflect their proportionate representation in the general population” the complaint states. “The announcement was made without any explanation or reassurance that the company would still follow applicable anti-discrimination laws in achieving its objective.”

American Express Opens Centurion Lounges Reduces Access and Increases Fees

Over the last decade American Express has opened more than 40 Centurion Lounges located across the globe for its Platinum and Centurion cardholders. These lounges help customers who may not qualify for an airline lounge based on their ticket find a premium seat outside of the terminal crowds. The American Express Centurion Lounge has delivered a consistently elevated product with better food and drink options updated decor and design better lounge features like kids rooms massages or manicures and consistently better service.

Whether the home-grown lounge network fueled the popularity of the American Express Platinum card or the popularity of the eligible American Express cards has created more demand for the lounges is less relevant than the result that there are lines snaking around the outside of most Centurion facilities. They are so busy in fact that American Express posts just how busy each lounge is inside of the AMEX app.

COVID protocols compounded crowding issues with reduced lounge access for fewer guests due to distancing guidelines and the closure of airline clubs that may have absorbed some eligible AMEX travelers in the past.

In response to the popularity of both the credit cards and the lounges American Express has adjusted its offerings and starting in February of 2023 will reduce Platinum card members’ ability to bring guests with them inside Centurion lounges. They have also increased the annual fees of both their personal and business Platinum cards from $450/year a few years ago to now $695/year – a 54% increase.

Chase Adds Lounges to Premium Offering

Chase has a mixed relationship with its Sapphire Reserve card and its customers. It is disincentivizing sign-ups through lower new sign-up bonuses than the Chase Sapphire Preferred for example as well as paying a points dividend on spend for Preferred customers. At the same time Chase has added some perks to the revamped Sapphire Reserve offering more earnings when booking through the Chase travel portal and rolling out lounges.

The first four Chase Sapphire lounges (in partnership with airport lounge company The Club) will be offered in:

Boston

Hong Kong

New York (Laguardia); and

San Diego

By offering its own lounge network customers that hold both cards traveling through these cities will have their choice though AMEX has not announced any plans to build a location in San Diego yet opting instead for larger markets like Las Vegas and hub cities like Charlotte Philadelphia and Seattle.

Chase has not yet indicated just how many lounges it intends to offer within the network though Centurion lounges started with the same limited rollout. Whether the Chase offering will rival Centurion Lounges or even a Delta Sky Club remains to be seen as does its global reach. JPMorgan Chase Bank (NA) is primarily focused on the US domestic market as that’s where its credit cards are offered. Their customers travel globally (hence the Hong Kong location) but without local Chase accounts and clients global need will be limited.

Nevertheless with access to the Centurion lounge becoming harder to come by even for cardholders meeting all required entry criteria Chase’s alternatives will relieve some congestion in the three key markets of the first four offered.

Capital One Joining The Mix

Plenty of digital ink has been spilled about the Capital One X and its premium offerings this week; Matthew had some salient points to add as well. I’ll leave comments about that product to Matthew who did a fantastic job and while this is not a credit card pitch if you’re going to sign up for one of the cards anyway we would appreciate your support.

Ben from One Mile At A Time and Gary from View From The Wing both reviewed the new Captial One lounge at Dallas/Fort Worth this week and it looks stunning.

I frequent “The Club” in Pittsburgh and while it’s nice and – dare I say – better than the American Airlines Admirals Club at my home airport it’s not nearly the level of its rivals. Centurion Lounges’ commitment to premium food and beverage and Capital One’s impressive initial offering suggest that Capital One is serious about the premium traveler credit card market.

With an annual fee for the “X” card of $395 it’s substantially less than American Express and even Chase’s Reserve card ($550) though relief from crowds limitations and refusal of service due to capacity constraints from Centurion Lounges will only be available at Dallas/Fort Worth for the foreseeable future. Washington-Dulles and Denver International are both slated to open in 2022 but no further plans have been disclosed.

What might be the biggest differentiator for Capital One is that they grant two free visits for Venture and Spark cardholders ($45/visit for guests) as well as selling access for $65/visit to anyone. As a new entrant to the space this might encourage those who already hold the Venture card (competes at the same price point as the Sapphire Preferred and just below the American Express Gold) to try the offering and if they see value upgrade their current card for unlimited access.

Another note about airport lounges generally and where Capital One succeeds is that their commitment to the things lounge customers value is what will set them apart. I mused about the United Club and its pitiful breakfast selection that they wanted to charge $50 for on a recent trip Capital One makes food and drink (La Colombe draft coffee is reason enough to visit) a priority not secondary to free wifi (offered in airports anyway) and a seat. They open with showers available (some American Express Centurion lounges have not reopened showers following the pandemic) and offer food to-go which is not an option at many others.

Conclusion

American Express Centurion Lounges are head and shoulders above almost all other airport lounges without question. However their success may have created a problem of too many cardholders seeking to use the lounge despite their many locations. Prohibitive annual fee increases and new restrictions may seem like a good solution but with real competitors opening for customers that may already have a card with other banks lounge crowding relief may come from Capital One and Chase. Whether that eats into American Express profits is yet to be seen but I for one welcome the alternatives.

What do you think? Will Chase and Capital One lounges give some relief to crowded American Express lounges? Will customers convert or cancel AMEX products in favor of these alternatives?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhbWRhbnppZ2VyLzIwMjEvMTEvMjAvcGVvcGxlLXNob3Atc21hbGwtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc2F0dXJkYXktZm9yLXRoZS1tb3N0LXVuaXF1ZS1naWZ0cy1hbmQtZmFpcmUtaGVscHMtcmV0YWlsZXJzLWZpbmQtdGhlbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People Shop Small Business Saturday For The Most Unique Gifts And Faire Helps Retailers Find Them,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2021/11/20/people-shop-small-business-saturday-for-the-most-unique-gifts-and-faire-helps-retailers-find-them/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhbWRhbnppZ2VyLzIwMjEvMTEvMjAvcGVvcGxlLXNob3Atc21hbGwtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc2F0dXJkYXktZm9yLXRoZS1tb3N0LXVuaXF1ZS1naWZ0cy1hbmQtZmFpcmUtaGVscHMtcmV0YWlsZXJzLWZpbmQtdGhlbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob3RlbGllcmluZGlhLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8xODQ0My1hbWVyaWNhbi1leHByZXNzLWdsb2JhbC1idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwtYWRkcy1uZW8tZXhwZW5zZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXRvLWl0cy1tb2JpbGUtYXBw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Express Global Business Travel adds Neo expense management to its mobile app,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hotelierindia.com/business/18443-american-express-global-business-travel-adds-neo-expense-management-to-its-mobile-app on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob3RlbGllcmluZGlhLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8xODQ0My1hbWVyaWNhbi1leHByZXNzLWdsb2JhbC1idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwtYWRkcy1uZW8tZXhwZW5zZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXRvLWl0cy1tb2JpbGUtYXBw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Michael Y. Cheng from Wynnewood Pennsylvania is a joint concentrator in history and mathematics who is also completing a master’s degree in computer science. He was recently elected president of the Undergraduate Council and was a walk-on member of the Harvard varsity men’s lightweight crew team. At Oxford Cheng will work toward a master of science (M.Sc.) in energy systems and a M.Sc. in political theory.

Samantha C.W. O’Sullivan from Washington D.C. is a joint concentrator in physics and African American Studies. O’Sullivan founded the Generational African American Students Association at Harvard and has conducted advanced research on the atomic structure of high-temperature superconductors as a member of the Hoffman Lab. O’Sullivan plans to pursue a master of studies (M.St.) in philosophy of physics and a M.Sc. in applied linguistics at Oxford.

Physics concentrator Elizabeth Guo will pursue an M.Sc. in mathematical and theoretical physics and an M.Sc. in social science of the internet at Oxford. Guo who is from Plano Texas is also a researcher in the Hoffman Lab. She is on the staff of The Harvard Crimson and a member of the Harvard College Honor Council.

Trisha N. Prabhu is a government concentrator from Naperville Illinois. Prabhu recently served as a Civic Digital Fellow at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and is the former president of Harvard Undergraduate South Asian Americans in Public Service initiative. A holder of several U.S. patents Prabhu plans to pursue an M.Sc. in social science of the internet and a master’s of public policy at Oxford.

Created in 1902 through the will of Cecil Rhodes Rhodes Scholarships cover all expenses for two or three years of study at Oxford. The 32 students selected from the United States this year represent 24 colleges and include 22 women the most in the scholarship’s history. Harvard’s American Rhodes Scholars now number 379.

This year’s honorees will begin their graduate studies next October. The U.S. Rhodes Scholars will join an international group chosen from more than 60 countries and two winners from any country in the world without its own scholarship. Those awards will be announced in the coming days. A full list of U.S. winners can be viewed on the Rhodes Trust website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlYW11c2EuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9ub3ZlbWJlci8yMi9tZWV0LXRoZS11cy1tZW5zLWFuZC13b21lbnMtb2x5bXBpYy1jdXJsaW5nLXRlYW1z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet The U.S. Men's And Women's Olympic Curling Teams,"The old saying goes the more things change the more they stay the same. When it comes to the 2022 U.S. Olympic curling team that’s a good thing in terms of Team USA's medal hopes.



On the men’s side there’s Team Shuster that won the first Olympic curling gold medal in Team USA history four years ago in PyeongChang. On the women’s side there’s Team Peterson returning most of their athletes from PyeongChang 2018 and fresh off a bronze medal at the most recent world championships. Both teams are at the top of their game reflected in their respective runs to the gold medal in Omaha Nebraska at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials for Curling.



While these teams may look similar there are a few key differences from PyeongChang. Chris Plys previously an alternate on Shuster’s team at the 2010 Games in Vancouver replaced Tyler George. Adding an experienced familiar teammate has made the team even stronger they believe.



“I think we have just built off of the success that the three of us had before getting Chris and then adding Chris I think we’ve only gotten stronger” said lead John Landsteiner. “We’re ready to go and defend the medal.”



Team Peterson was known as Team Roth four years ago when current third Nina Roth was the skip. The team has also added skip Tabitha Peterson’s younger sister Tara to the mix. Their team is playing as well as any in the world evidenced by their world championship medal the first for a U.S. women’s team in 15 years. That momentum carried over into Olympic Trials.



“We knew what we were capable of” said second Becca Hamilton. “We knew going into worlds we wanted to come away with a medal so we’re just excited to move forward towards the Olympics now and hopefully get on the podium there too.”



Here’s a closer look at the 2022 U.S. Olympic Curling Team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByaW5jZXRvbi5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExLzIxL3ByaW5jZXRvbi1zZW5pb3JzLWpvc2h1YS1iYWJ1LWFuZC13YWZhLXpha2Etd2luLXJob2Rlcy1zY2hvbGFyc2hpcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATED: Princeton seniors Joshua Babu and Wafa Zaka and alumna Emma O'Donnell win Rhodes Scholarships,"Princeton University seniors Joshua Babu and Wafa Zaka and 2021 graduate Emma O’Donnell have been awarded Rhodes Scholarships for graduate study at the University of Oxford.

Babu is among 32 American recipients of the prestigious fellowships which fund two to three years of graduate study at Oxford. In a statement Elliot Gerson American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust said of this year’s Rhodes Scholars representing the United States: “They are inspiring young leaders already and we are confident that their contributions to public welfare nationally and globally will expand exponentially over the course of their careers in varied sectors and disciplines.”

O’Donnell and Zaka will join an international group of more than 100 Rhodes Scholars chosen from more than 60 countries and they are among several winners who have attended American colleges and universities. Individual countries announce their recipients on different schedules; O'Donnell now joins Babu and Zaka whose Rhodes Scholarships were announced on Nov. 21.

The students will begin their studies at Oxford in October 2022.

Joshua Babu

Joshua Babu

Babu of Scottsdale Arizona is concentrating in molecular biology and is also pursuing a certificate in gender and sexuality studies. At Oxford he will pursue an MSc Comparative Social Policy and MSc Evidence-Based Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation. He is a member of Forbes College one of Princeton’s six residential colleges.

Babu’s independent research has centered on the transgender experience in healthcare. His senior thesis is titled “Puberty suppression and gender-affirming hormone therapy for transgender youth: Effects on psychological health and telomere homeostasis.”



In his Rhodes application he wrote “Research like this was woefully in demand as legislation was being drafted across the globe banning puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans minors because they were ‘experimental treatments’ with ‘questionable efficacy.’”

""With the guidance of my adviser Dan Notterman [professor of the practice in molecular biology and senior adviser to the provost for biomedical affairs] I’ve spent the past two years conducting a clinical study on the psychological wellbeing and biological health of trans youth undergoing gender-affirming care"" Babu said. ""I hope to identify methods for quantifying the benefits of this sort of care on both the molecular and macroscopic levels.”

“Josh believes fiercely that science is best when it serves to inform policy and attenuate inequity in healthcare” said Notterman. “His dedication to the needs and rights of marginalized people in medicine is really an example of a broader passion for serving those who have been traditionally overlooked. He is one of those rare individuals who combines decency and compassion with unlimited energy and deep brilliance. A wonderful person Josh is one of Princeton’s very best.”

Babu has developed his passion for LGBTQ+ advocacy in medicine and social policy at Princeton. He received the Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence for the years 2018-19 and 2019-20 and was elected to Princeton's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in October 2021.

He conducted bioinformatics research focused on gender-specific markers for lung cancer survival at the Mayo Clinic’s Center for Individualized Medicine during summer 2020 and was awarded the fellowship again for 2021. In summer 2021 he was a research assistant in Princeton’s School for Public and International Affairs on a project focused on comparative right-wing LGBTQ+ policy. In spring semester 2020 he conducted research with a team of two undergraduates examining the effects of drug treatment on ovarian stem cell development. He also serves as an undergraduate teaching assistant for organic chemistry.

Dannelle Gutarra Cordero lecturer in gender and sexuality studies and African American studies has mentored Babu since his first semester at Princeton. He has taken three of her courses: “From Latin Lovers to Tiger Mothers: Ideas of Emotions in the History of Racism” “Scientific Racism Then and Now” and “Institutional Anti-Blackness and the Power of Naming.”

“In his scholarly and extracurricular work Josh consistently demonstrates his outstanding commitment to scholarship restorative justice and global health” Gutarra Cordero said. “I have been lucky to witness his remarkable development as a scholar and his activist work for curricular reform and as a contributor of the Archival Justice for the Enslaved Project which I direct. I am so happy for Josh and know that he will vastly contribute to the scholarship and advocacy against medical discrimination.”

Babu has developed a deep commitment to service and advocacy during his time at Princeton.

This fall he became a volunteer at the Cherry Hill Women’s Center supporting patients and advocating for reproductive justice. Since Feb. 2021 he has been involved in several aspects of LGBTQI advocacy including drafting proposals on how state representatives can rectify legislation that discriminates against LGBTQ+ people in healthcare. He is a voter-engagement team leader for the Princeton Vote 100 Initiative and an activist for anti-racist initiatives at Princeton including helping to establish a committee to promote racial literacy in pre-med courses particularly in genetics and evolutionary biology and working for more inclusion in the audition process at the Lewis Center for the Arts.

He has also served as a delivery driver for St. Mary’s Food Bank in Phoenix; an emergency room volunteer in Scottsdale Arizona and Princeton; an English literacy tutor for elderly refugees in Phoenix a hospice volunteer in Phoenix; and a migrant outreach volunteer at the US-Mexico border with the Kino Border Initiative in Nogales Mexico.

Babu said living and learning in the time of COVID-19 has changed his perspective in many ways.

“For me the pandemic underscored the importance of having a strong network of loved ones to rely on during times of stress and the immense power of empathy when it comes to public health. These are lessons that I’ll take with me to Oxford and far beyond!”

Outside the classroom he is the a cappella group president and tenor section leader of the Princeton Footnotes and represented the Footnotes during its first equity diversity and inclusion initiative to make the ensemble’s audition process more equitable. He is also an avid screenwriter where he has “found a passion for writing screenplays that depict the trials and triumphs of my closest queer friends allowing me to explore themes of queerness family and loss in a way that highlights the complexity of the gay experience.” He is a multi-instrumentalist who plays alto saxophone guitar piano ukulele cajon and harmonica.

This is the second year American Rhodes Scholars were elected entirely virtually with all candidates and selectors participating digitally. They were elected by 16 committees around the country meeting simultaneously.

Babu was in Frist Campus Center when he received the news over Zoom from his district committee: Upon learning he had won the Rhodes Scholarship he said: “I'm not going to lie — I immediately started sobbing as soon as they read out my name as one of the winners.” He then ran across campus to meet his parents who were visiting for the weekend. “Easily one of the most emotional moments of my life” he added.

About going to Oxford Babu said: “What excites me most is the opportunity to connect with so many astounding people from all corners of the globe and diversify my outlook on the world.”

After the Rhodes Scholarship he hopes to attend medical school and pursue a career in health policy to advocate for the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ individuals.

Emma O’Donnell

Emma O'Donnell

O’Donnell of Pembroke Bermuda was a concentrator in ecology and evolutionary biology. At Oxford she hopes to pursue her interest in sustainability.

Her academic studies at Princeton focused on marine conservation and ecology. Her passion for Bermuda’s reefs started as a child when she would spend countless afternoons snorkeling; when she turned 13 she earned her SCUBA license. “I was hooked” she wrote in her Rhodes application. “I found the beauty of the surrounding corals serene and meditative …. When I learned about the threats the reefs were under I felt driven to conserve our reef fish biodiversity.”

Stephen Pacala the Frederick D. Petrie Professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and O’Donnell’s senior thesis adviser said that when he first heard O’Donnell’s thesis proposal — to census coral reef fish species in Bermuda by analyzing DNA from the water they swim in — he was wary. He quickly realized he needn’t have been.

“This sounded crazy to me given that no one had ever done it before and that the volume of water is so vast and the diversity of the fish so high” Pacala said. “But Emma succeeded despite COVID-19 restrictions international red tape and technical challenges. In so doing she uncovered patterns that will help conserve Bermuda’s reef communities.”

O’Donnell received the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology’s Prize for the Best Thesis in Ecology.

Her international research experience includes serving as an intern from 2016 to 2020 with the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences in St. George’s Bermuda which included research for her senior thesis. In summer 2019 she was an intern for the Coral Reef Research Foundation in Palau a country with one of the most successful marine conservation policies in the world she said.

Her international experience during her time at Princeton also includes serving as a conservation volunteer for Reef Conservation International in Placencia Belize in 2019 in which she participated in an invasive lionfish culling program on Belize’s coral reefs to aid in conservation and eradication efforts. In 2018 she completed an internship with Aquabyte in Bergen Norway where she designed an algorithm to evaluate the accuracy of a machine learning program at detecting salmon biomass to optimize food supply for aquaculture farms.

She said her favorite classes at Princeton were interdisciplinary courses that allowed her to explore the interconnectedness of biodiversity with agriculture economics and epidemiology.

Outside of her studies she taught barre classes with Princeton’s Campus Recreation Program and she was a member of Expressions Dance Company and the Butler College Council.



Since September 2021 she has been working in London as a reinsurance climate change strategy trainee with Aon. Her final Rhodes interview took place virtually. When she received the news that she had been selected during a video call it was almost midnight in London due to the time difference.



“My sister happened to be visiting me during her college break and we were headed off to bed when I got the call” O’Donnell said. “My first reaction was shock and a little confusion — I couldn’t believe it! I was glad my sister was there to share the news in person. I also called my parents to tell them and they were so excited and proud.”



She said the challenges of pursuing her academic studies and research during the pandemic both at Princeton and after graduation have been transformative for her.



“The pandemic has taught me the importance of surrounding yourself with people who support you as well as offering that support to others even when struggling yourself” O’Donnell said. “It has helped me to grow as I learned to face uncertainty and handle the circumstances outside of my control. It has also served as a stark reminder of how lucky I am which has heightened my resolve to use this opportunity to give back and serve the broader community.”



As a Rhodes Scholar she is looking forward to expanding her worldview. “I am most excited about the chance to join a community of driven and passionate people with such varied backgrounds and perspectives to make long-lasting connections and to learn from each other” she said.



After Oxford she hopes to continue her focus on protecting Bermuda’s environment. “I plan to advocate for and to develop solutions for sustainability and climate change mitigation and resilience in the private sector” she said.



In her Rhodes application she wrote: “Long-term I hope to move into the field of corporate sustainability or sustainable investing because I believe there is enormous potential for the private sector to drive important and necessary environmental change.”

Wafa Zaka

Wafa Zaka

Zaka of Lahore Pakistan is concentrating in politics and is also pursuing a certificate in history and practice of diplomacy. At Oxford Zaka will pursue an MSt in Global and Imperial History and an MSc in Modern South Asian Studies. She is a member of Mathey College.

In her academic work Zaka has delved deep into world history with a focus on Pakistan India and Bangladesh. Her interest in this area was sparked in one of her courses at Princeton when a Bangladeshi student presented on the 1971 war and the creation of Bangladesh. In her Rhodes application she wrote “My high school textbook [in Pakistan] summarized the entire war into two paragraphs but I had done independent reading on the topic … Still as my class fellow spoke about the experiences of Bangladeshis I felt I had not fully grasped the importance of those events.”

This experience spurred Zaka to embark a research project on the perceptions of the 1971 war among Pakistanis Bangladeshis and their diasporic communities conducting dozens of interviews to study the impact of statist narratives on how people look back on the war.

Her senior thesis is about ungoverned spaces in Pakistan particularly the Federally Administered Tribal Area. “To understand state capacity and nation-building process I will be analyzing the efforts at integration by the Pakistani state and why these efforts were ineffectual in some of these areas” she said.

“Wafa is the kind of student we love to teach; smart curious and thoughtful about the significance of what she is learning” said Jeremy Adelman the Henry Charles Lea Professor of History who established Princeton’s Global History Lab.

Zaka took Adelman’s course “A History of the World” then joined the Global History Lab’s History Dialogues Project which builds upon the work of “A History of the World” and provides students with training in additional historical research methods to embark on independent research projects.

“Wafa was an important voice in my ‘History of the World’ course committed to sharing her knowledge and raising the level of our debates” Adelman said. “After that she joined the History Dialogues project in the middle of the pandemic and conducted pioneering oral histories of South Asia’s long history of decolonization. She is going to make remarkable and important contributions to global knowledge.”

Zaka also created the History Dialogues Coronavirus Archive with the Global History Lab. She said the pandemic heightened her awareness of the immense inequalities in society. “I observed the mainstream coverage of the pandemic to see the kind of systems of knowledge we are producing in these historic times. I was thrilled to build this archive to document pandemic experiences that explain the virus's diverse implications and include voices generally excluded and historically marginalized.”

In fall 2020 when she was studying remotely from Pakistan she took a journalism course on migration with Ferris Professor of Journalism Deborah Amos and found another medium to capture marginalized voices writing several pieces about Afghan refugees' unique experiences in Pakistan during COVID-19.

Her international experience at Princeton also included a Princeton International Internship (virtually) with the Russian International Affairs Council.

She has served as a researcher for Princeton’s Empirical Studies of Conflict Lab coding and archiving more than 200 disinformation stories about COVID-19 from various countries specifically focusing on South Asia. She was also a fellow for the UN/ORL Women Faith and Gender Fellowship focusing on topics such as multilayered inclusion and intersectionality intergenerational dialogues and youth activism.

She received the Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence for the year 2019-20.

As a first-generation lower-income student Zaka wrote in her Rhodes statement “I have experienced some of the struggles that go behind succeeding in an unequal society.”

Outside of her studies Zaka has served as president of the Princeton University Pakistani Student Association (Pehchaan) interview editor and social media chair for The Nassau Literary Review and president of the Rotaract Club of Lahore Pakistan including working with and leading 20 Rotaract members for Rotary International’s End Polio Campaign in Pakistan.

Zaka’s final Rhodes interview took place in person in Pakistan. Upon learning she had won she said she was overwhelmed and grateful and called her family who were waiting in the car outside. “The tears would not stop. After meeting the committee I ran to meet my family. It was an exceptionally joyous moment. I owe everything to the love and mentorship of my family friends and professors.”

Zaka said she lost three people close to her during the pandemic: her grandmother; Zoya Shoaib a member of the Class of 2020; and Imam Sohaib Sultan Princeton’s longtime Muslim chaplain who died in April at the age of 40. “All the social distancing and isolation made grief a lot more challenging. I want to dedicate my success to them — they were some of my biggest supporters and if they were alive they would have been thrilled to hear about my selection as a Rhodes Scholar.”

She is excited to explore the wide range of archival resources in the UK and deepen her studies of South Asian history. “Oxford has some of the world's foremost historians and I cannot wait to work with them. I am also looking forward to building new friendships and enjoying the green spaces at Oxford.”

After the Rhodes Scholarship she hopes to pursue a career in academia as a historian. “As a brown girl from South Asia I want to contribute to broader social change” she said. “My presence in the professoriate will make space possible for people like me to initiate other kinds of knowledge and political projects that get snuffed out before they even have the opportunity to start.” She is also interested in working outside academia to make historically marginalized narratives accessible to the wider public in Pakistan by directing documentaries writing books and organizing workshops.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yMC91cy9hbmdyeS13aGl0ZS1tZW4tdHJpYWxzLWJsYWtlLWNlYy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8xMS8yMC91cy9hbmdyeS13aGl0ZS1tZW4tdHJpYWxzLWJsYWtlLWNlYw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man,"CNN —

The Brute. The Buck. And of course the Thug.

Those are just some of the names for a racial stereotype that has haunted the collective imagination of White America since the nation’s inception.

The specter of the angry Black man has been evoked in politics and popular culture to convince White folks that a big bad Black man is coming to get them and their daughters.

I’ve seen viral videos of innocent Black men losing their lives because of this stereotype. I’ve watched White people lock their car doors or clutch their purses when men who look like me approach. I’ve been racially profiled.

It’s part of the psychological tax you pay for being a Black man in America – learning to accept that you are seen by many as Public Enemy No. 1.

But as I’ve watched three separate trials about White male violence unfold across the US these past few weeks – the Kyle Rittenhouse trial the Ahmaud Arbery death trial and the civil case against organizers of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville – I’ve come to a sobering conclusion:

There is nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man.

It’s not the “radical Islamic terrorist” that I fear the most. Nor is it the brown immigrant or the fiery Black Lives Matter protester or whatever the latest bogeyman is that some politician tells me I should dread.

It’s encountering an armed White man in public who has been inspired by the White men on trial in these three cases.

Here’s what legal experts say helped acquit Kyle Rittenhouse

The US’ legacy of White male violence

I’m not suggesting we start racially profiling White men. The vast majority of White men are no menace to society.

Countless White men swallowed tear gas and braved rubber bullets while marching with demonstrators during last year’s protests over the murder of George Floyd. Plenty of White men – like the Rev. James Reeb a White Unitarian minister – died for Black people during the civil rights movement.

There is nothing inherently violent about White men or any human being.

But recent events have convinced me it’s time to put another character on trial: A vision of White masculinity that allows some White men to feel as if they “can rule and brutalize without consequence.”

This angry White man has been a major character throughout US history. He gave the country slavery the slaughter of Native Americans and Jim Crow laws. His anger also helped fuel the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.

It’s this angry White man – not the Black or brown man you see approaching on the street at night – who poses the most dangerous threat to democracy in America.

That’s a sweeping claim. But these trials represent something bigger than questions of individual guilt or innocence. They offer a disturbing vision of the future and a choice about what kind of country we want to live in.

The facts of the trials are well known to many Americans.

In Wisconsin a jury found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty of all charges in the shooting deaths of two men and the wounding of another during a racial protest last year. Rittenhouse who was 17 at the time said he was in Kenosha during the protests after the police shooting of Jacob Blake to help protect property. He said he shot the men in self-defense.

In Georgia three White men are accused of chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery a 25-year-old Black man last year while he was jogging. The men say they were trying to conduct a lawful citizen’s arrest and the man who shot Arbery says he acted in self-defense.

And in Virginia a civil trial is underway to determine if organizers of the “Unite the Right” rally intended to incite racial violence. One person was killed and dozens injured there after White supremacists clashed with counter-demonstrators.

Race is an inescapable theme that runs through all the trials. At the center of each are White men who are accused of using unjustified violence either against an unarmed Black man or during racial protests. In Rittenhouse’s case a jury cleared him of criminal wrongdoing.

It’s what’s happening outside these courtrooms though that is most frightening. It suggests these trials are a symptom of a dangerous shift.

Our politics are becoming more menacing

If there was an Exhibit A to describe this shift it might be an animé video. Earlier this month Republican Rep. Paul Gosar posted a photoshopped animé video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him attacking President Joe Biden and appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword.

The House voted this week to censure Gosar with virtually no Republicans backing the resolution. Gosar took down the video after facing criticism but did not apologize and later retweeted a post that contained the video.

Gosar’s video wasn’t an isolated incident. Violent political rhetoric has been escalating among some members of the Republican Party. And while not all of it is fueled by White men much of it starts at the top – with former President Donald Trump.

Trump’s violent and sexist rhetoric has been well-documented. More White men now identify as Republican and the gender gap between both major parties is as large as it’s ever been in the last two decades.

One New York Times columnist under the headline “The Angry White Male Caucus” said this anger is driven by White men who fear a changing America “in which the privilege of being a white man isn’t what it used to be.”

The anger also seems to be getting worse. After President Joe Biden signed an infrastructure bill into law this month some House Republicans who voted for it reported receiving death threats. Election officials and school board members across the country are also reporting escalating threats. A recent poll revealed that 30% of Republicans believe that violence is justified to save the country.

Political violence is not limited to the GOP. A Bernie Sanders supporter who publicly declared his hatred of conservatives shot five people at a Republican baseball practice in 2017.

But talking about assaulting and killing political enemies has become so normal – and seemingly acceptable – in conservative circles today that a White man felt comfortable enough to ask a right-wing activist at a public forum in Idaho last month:

“When do we get to use the guns? … How many elections are they going to steal before we kill these people?”

Add to this toxic political atmosphere another element: Laws that not only protect White vigilante violence but in some cases seem to embolden vigilantes.

Activists hoped that widely seen videos showing White police officers and White men shooting Black men like Arbery would inspire the courts and state legislatures to revisit laws that made such actions possible.

But even after nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer little has changed. A growing number of Americans now want police funding increased. And though Georgia overhauled its citizen’s arrest law a reform bill called the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act died in Congress two months ago.

We could see more guns on the streets

The conservative-leaning US Supreme Court now seems poised to make it easier for people to carry guns in public based on recent oral arguments over a New York gun control law.

The US’ civilian population is already the most heavily armed in the world. And our streets could soon become even more violent.

“A significant portion of the gun safety movement’s current agenda is likely to come under attack in the coming years” Adam Winkler a UCLA law professor and author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America” recently told Newsweek. “I think bans on assault weapons and bans on high-capacity magazines are ripe for the new Supreme Court with its newly invigorated Second Amendment to strike down.”

The Supreme Court has also recently ruled once again in favor of “qualified immunity” the legal doctrine that shields police officers accused of misconduct. There’s been little national movement on reforming “stand your ground laws” some of which allow people who believe they’re facing an imminent threat to use lethal force without first trying to escape. At least 25 states have such laws according to the National Conference of State Legislators.

And despite the shocking nature of the Arbery video there’s been little progress on reforming citizen’s arrest laws which allow private citizens to detain or arrest someone they suspect in a crime.

The White men on trial in the Rittenhouse and Arbery cases both said they acted in self-defense. One of the men in the Arbery case testified that the unarmed Black jogger tried to take his gun and his life was at risk.

But consider the potential danger of other White men – or any person wielding a gun in public – feeling emboldened to use deadly force against even an unarmed person by evoking the logic in those defenses said Eric Ruben a Second Amendment expert.

“In other words their own decision to carry a gun became a justification to use it lest it be wrested away from them” Ruben recently told the New York Times.

While prosecutors didn’t show that Rittenhouse was angry that night there is a perception – fair or not – that he went to Kenosha for reasons more than simply maintaining public safety.

The comedian Trevor Noah reflected this sentiment in a comment that became a meme: “No one has ever thought ‘Oh it’s my solemn duty to pick up a rifle and protect that TJ Maxx.”

And finally there’s a growing fear that no one will be severely punished for the January 6 insurrection because most of the rioters were White. The trials of various defendants are winding their way through the courts now. Jacob Chansley the so-called “QAnon Shaman” was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the US Capitol riot.

But many believe the punishment will never match the severity of the crime. What if say a mob of Black Lives Matter protesters attacked the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election of a Republican president? How do you think conservative lawmakers would react?

We are seeing more threats more guns and more suspicion that the courts will go easy on White people who employ violence. This is the combustible mix that makes more violence almost inevitable.

Angry White men have damaged democracy

We have enough problems with White male violence as it is. Mass shootings in the US are committed more often by White men than by any other group. Top law enforcement officials now say the nation’s biggest domestic terror threat comes from White supremacists. And many of the most indelible news images of recent years include angry red-faced White men often armed with guns.

Consider scenes from the US Capitol riot which were filled with angry White men wielding crude weapons and pummeling police. Or the snarling faces of young White men holding tiki torches during the 2017 rally in Charlottesville. Or the angry White men who clashed with anti-racist protesters across the US last year.

White male anger has become one of the most potent political forces in contemporary America. That anger helped a White man win the White House. Trump’s rise to power is inconceivable without his ability to tap into White male anger and embody it.

Has there ever been an angrier modern president? He is the White male id unleashed.

This White male anger is causing many people – including other White men – to look over their shoulder when they go out in public. The two men who were shot and killed by Rittenhouse in Wisconsin were White as was the man he wounded.

Ijeoma Oluo author of “Mediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America” wrote that she lives with the constant fear that angry White men will turn violent toward her and “countless other black people brown people disabled people queer people trans people and women of every demographic.”

White male anger could prove to be one of the biggest roadblocks we face in building a successful multiracial democracy.

Lee Drutman a scholar who has studied political violence recently told the New York Times: “I have a hard time seeing how we have a peaceful 2024 election after everything that’s happened now. I don’t see the rhetoric turning down I don’t see the conflicts going away. I really do think it’s hard to see how it gets better before it gets worse.”

This isn’t hyperbole. It’s history. It happened before.

After the Civil War the US attempted to build the first biracial democracy by incorporating formerly enslaved people into the country’s political and economic life. That period known as Reconstruction was destroyed primarily by the violence of White men who used terrorist and vigilante groups like the KKK to assassinate elected officials prevent Blacks from voting and overthrow state governments.

In 1898 for example a mob of primarily White men staged a coup against the city government of Wilmington North Carolina which had elected a multiracial coalition of leaders. More than 60 Black people were killed and Black residents of the city were barred from voting and from elected office for decades afterward.

The January 6 insurrection wasn’t unprecedented. In many ways it was a sequel.

No more lectures about Black ‘thugs’

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warned the GOP that “We’re not generating enough angry White guys to stay in business for the long term.”

He was wrong. The angry White guy business is booming. Yet no matter how obvious it becomes that the country has a problem with White male violence most Americans will escape what Black and brown men experience on a weekly basis.

Not many drivers will lock their doors when White men approach at a stoplight. Few women will clutch their purse when they pass a White man on the street.

Someone recently posted a meme about this double standard by evoking the memory of Tamir Rice the 12-year-old Black boy who was killed in Cleveland by a police officer who authorities said mistook his toy pistol for a real firearm.

“Tamir Rice was 12 and killed for having a fake toy gun. Kyle Rittenhouse 17 killed two people. Walked by police after killing two people. Got to go home and sleep.”

That meme is why it’s hard for me for to tolerate hearing another lecture about “Black thug culture” or a “Black culture of violence.”

My response to the White men who use these tired phrases: Look in the mirror.

And look at these three trials because they point to one frightening future. This is what that future looks like: More angry White men emboldened by “stand your ground” and citizen’s arrest laws inspired by a conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment.

And more dead Americans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjEyMTY4NC9lbW1hbnVlbC1mYWJlci1kYW5vbmUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emmanuel Faber Was Ousted From Danone. Now He's Speaking Out | TIME,"(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

The battle within Danone—producer of Activia and Oikos yogurts Silk soy milk and Evian water among others—might have been dubbed a “food fight” had it not erupted in such serious times. But it was no laughing matter. Months of tension within the executive board of the $36-billion global food giant exploded in March 2021 just as the world began easing its lockdowns and launching mass vaccination campaigns. In a gloves-off power struggle two small stakeholders maneuvered a coup ousting the company’s CEO and chairman Emmanuel Faber whose four-year leadership had made him a star among environmentalists and climate activists.

Faber had turned Danone into an “enterprise à mission” France’s new category similar to an American B-Corp whose purpose was far broader than profits and growth. He named his strategy “One Planet One Health” and created a carbon adjusted earnings per share indicator pegging Danone’s success directly to its environmental performance. While that brought applause from climate activists the company’s shares lagged behind peers like Nestlé and Unilever during the pandemic as sales of some key Danone products like Evian water plummeted.

Amid the shock of Faber’s ouster there were roiling questions over what it all meant. Do CEOs now face an impossible dilemma: Either to please their shareholders or to join the fight for climate justice and social equity? Faber had placed those issues at the core of the company. And outside it he threw himself into activist CEO coalitions like the B Team and Business for Inclusive Growth or B4IG. Little wonder then that his firing left palpable distress in some circles from Paris to the U.N. “Are these two objectives environmental and economic irreconcilable?” asked France’s liberal Le Monde of Faber’s ouster. “It plunges us into a confusion of emotions over the ethics of capitalism” the paper said.

Faber for his part was more sanguine. At 57 he escaped to his beloved Alps where he was born and raised and climbed the peaks reflecting on what to do after a 24-year career at Danone. In October he took a partnership at agritech impact fund Astanor Ventures. Far from irreconcilable environment and economic objectives are he believes becoming inexorably aligned.

Over green tea and Perrier in Paris on Nov. 16 Faber spoke with TIME about the role business leaders must play in solving the world’s urgent crises. Fresh off the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow he believes companies will be key—perhaps the key—to fighting climate change and inequity.

(This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.)

It’s been a very strange year for you. Did you feel sideswiped by what happened at Danone?

Danone had grown to become my family so it’s like leaving your family. I didn’t choose that. But I suddenly discovered that I was totally free to reinvent myself in terms of where I do want to spend time and with whom and how. Which is a privilege really. What happened was a few people that saw a window of opportunity and for personal reasons pursued that opportunity at the moment where it was easy to destabilize the governance of the company.

The outside world believed you wanted to create a climate-driven company and were punished for it.

You know they had voted the equivalent of public Benefit Corporation [B-Corp] status 99% not even a year before they had agreed with the €3 billion climate and digital acceleration plan that we had announced a year before. … None of them were opposed to what we were doing.

You need to read the end of the story which is unfortunately on the 29th of July. The whole board had to resign. They said they would not seek any reappointment and all of them would step down with one year in advance. The board had lost total credibility to shareholders.

How should corporate boards be changed? What needs to happen in this new generation of corporate leaders?

Climate change is there. I don’t think you would find one CEO in the business ecosystem that would say it is not there. That is behind us different from five years ago…

Five years ago that recently?

Oh yeah. I think the pandemic has also taught us lessons about the fact that there were elements in our supposedly well-controlled and old system that we did just not control. This virus is only half a living organism and yet it played havoc with the health system. Suddenly we discovered that our food systems were entangled in such a complex web that food sovereignty became huge in the agenda.

We suddenly learned that what we felt was a predictable model and a safe model wasn’t that we hadn’t been super good at being efficient but we were tested in our resilience in the system.

The other thing is I think last summer’s extreme weather events fires all over the place floods all over the place brought to the public attention that climate change was not in five or 10 years it was not for remote countries. It is here now. Agriculture is the first victim of climate change warming. The yields are declining water stress all over the place soils are eroded.

We see a number of situations where civil society and citizens are going after governments for action or inaction against climate change. Governments will have no other way than turning to companies and corporations to do the job because governments are not doing the job themselves. The private sector will be front and center of the climate transition.

So that’s one. Employees collectives are asking questions about ESG [Environmental Social and Corporate Governance] big time. More and more the war for talent is there for the larger companies. So many of the highly educated talents don’t want to work for these large companies. More and more employers are asking the new generation what they want: Meaning they want impact.

And then you have the shareholders. Already now it’s harder for the most carbon-emitting companies to find the right appeal from shareholders. I’ll just give you one example. Anglo American [Corporation] wanted to spin off their coal-mining operations Thungela. Typically the market would be ready to pay you 20 years of your current earnings because they believe these earnings have great potential to grow in the future. In the case of Thungela when they spun it off they got four months of EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization] multiple.

They couldn’t find enough investors that would be willing to pay the cost on their reputation to consciously in 2021 choose to invest in the business which is purely coal mining.

So how do you even keep a business like that going?

Well that’s exactly my point. The global financial markets are increasingly reluctant to finance these assets.

So far ESG has been sort of an easy path for CEOs and boards that wanted to look good but weren’t ready to really walk the talk. That’s the whole question of greenwashing. I think there will always be greenwashing.

All this greenwashing noise is paralyzing everybody. It’s penalizing the people that are doing the real stuff because they can’t prove that and it’s favoring the people that are not doing the real stuff because they can claim without being challenged on the reality of this stuff because there are no metrics.

The big announcement at COP26 for me was when the IFRS [International Financial Reporting Standards which sets rules for public companies] said that they have prepared a prototype for a climate standard that is going to be transparent comparable and reliable and audited. It’s huge news. What they are essentially saying is by 2023 all companies will be able to—and in some cases compelled to—report under these new standards.

Essentially 140 countries already agreed to be part of the IFRS metrics in the past so they would take the additional metric on climate and adopt it as part of their IFRS. Each company will have to report on its targets on CO2 emissions and its pathway to reduce that. If a company is ahead of its plan the market will look at this positively. If you’re late it means that there are some capital expenditures that you need to do in the future. That will mean additional debt. So immediately the valuation of companies in the stock market will be impacted.

Which means as for profits when you are ahead of your forecast you get a bump on your share price and a bump down if you’re super late on your emissions trajectory.

Suddenly you can be compared within peers within an industry. And you start having a situation where the capital allocation can be based not only on profit but also on carbon. So it’s a huge change.

How many companies followed your model of using a carbon-adjusted earnings per share metric to show the financial cost of the company’s carbon emissions?

Zero. Because it takes time. There was a whole journey for those shareholders to understand where I was coming from. We took them into the fields. We had food scientists coming to speak to them. We had been constantly and consistently over years speaking about this to our shareholders.

When we decided to become a B-Corp we were puzzled about how to explain that to our shareholders. I received a short note from my friend Doug McMillon CEO of Walmart and he said “Emmanuel that’s so great.” So I call him and say “Would you shoot a short video saying why you think it’s great? You’re my biggest customer.” So he he did that. It was 2017. The Investor Day started with a video of my biggest customer saying why it was great. It cut 80% of the questions.

So when like two years later we come up with this CO2 adjusted metric they knew that this carbon charge was not just here to save the planet it was to save the business because we needed that carbon in the soil not in the air.

Beyond the food and agriculture system you don’t have the same magic of telling a story that it’s actually good for the business to put carbon back into the soil. The absence of metrics on carbon made it very difficult to do this. I think the day you have those climate metrics it will become obvious. Maybe we were just ahead by a few years. … The metrics may not be the ones that we had but there will be one which will make it a market conversation instead of just one company that had this crazy idea.

What got a lot of people’s attention from COP26 in Glasgow was Greta Thunberg’s protests. I think maybe most people will remember her saying “It’s all blah blah blah.” Is that just cynical? And what’s the impact of that on the real work being done? Is it just a sideshow?

Unfortunately it’s a combination of all of that. I don’t think this is only cynicism. I think there has been blah blah. I have myself said that we had not moved either fast or far enough. But I can see many things moving fast. We’re still behind the curve but we have never been as close as coming to a tipping point.

CEOs are held back in talking by their legal teams by their comms teams by their PR teams. They have this polished you know sometimes bullshit kind of communication. Shareholders were not so interested in all these discussions three years ago but now they got very interested and so everyone is super nervous. But in themselves [CEOs] know that there is a problem and they know that there is an opportunity.

The food industry your industry is a big carbon business.

We started the journey on carbon emissions in 2008. By 2009 all the team managers at Danone had a significant incentive [to reduce our] carbon footprint. An incentive bonus. A third [of the bonus] was on social and environmental issues among which was carbon. The EBITDA level of the company and the carbon footprint had an equal weight in my bonus. So that’s how far we and I went into walking the talk and putting our money where our mouth was.

More from TIME

Were you losing some money because that was part of the equation?

No I was making money. We established in 2009 a trajectory that said our peak carbon emissions would be in 2025. And the result of the hard work of 15000 team leaders incentivized in their bonuses led us to reach peak carbon six years in advance in 2019. So we have constantly been ahead of our plan and the reduction of the intensity of carbon.

When you speak about agriculture carbon is 60% of the organic matter of the soils. And the intensive agriculture the monoculture kind of agriculture that is the dominant food system is actually extracting carbon from the soil. Danone was the first—Patagonia and ourselves—to start a regenerative organic certification in the U.S. in 2015. When we started no one understood what that was. It started by saying we need to regenerate the soil health by going from intensive agricultural practices to practices that actually put carbon back into the soil. We know how to do that.

How big has the idea of putting carbon back in the soil become?

In 2019 I gathered 30 of the largest companies in the world that that are using resources from the soil: Textile companies fashion companies cosmetics food retailers some data companies Microsoft Google joined…. So we are now two years after we have a set of indicators a framework for what regenerative agriculture stands for. And you find these huge companies. After Danone you have Nestlé that this year said by 2030 we will supply from regenerative agriculture. These people needed a safe place where they could incubate and think and work and get their teams to meet together and discuss as an ecosystem.

You talk about monoculture agriculture—growing only one type of crop at a time as is popular at large American farms—ruining soils and the need to put carbon back into the soil so they’re actually seeing the effects in terms of the quality of their crops?

The International Union for Nature Conservation which is a UN agency on biodiversity ran a big study. They looked at the wild relatives of the varieties that are being used in the fields. Wild vanilla. Wild coffee etc. They found out that a third of all the wild relatives in beans are under threat of extinction. They found out that 100% of the sample they used on vanilla’s wild relatives are under the threat of extinction.

The seeds of those wild varieties they constantly adapt to the climate conditions to the water availability to the shades or no shades to the temperature to the sun to everything. They mutate naturally.

So with climate change these wild varietals are going to be just way more able to deal with things and it is so important that we bring them on board. If you are a Cargill or others or the big coffee companies or the big cocoa companies that are directly dealing with this reality with the farmers who see their yields declining and the water scarcity more and more they have either the choice of going up in altitudes—meaning lower lands at lower volumes more expensive to adapt—or to find alternatives.

This is one of these topics on which I see CEOs’ minds just opening when they realize that there is this opportunity. Because climate change is knocking on the door saying “Here is the huge problem we have.” But also nature is saying “Here are the huge abilities that I have to solve your problems.”

In your new role in Astanor Ventures are you going to be putting investments in the future of agriculture?

I think at the juncture of technology and nature-based solutions.

I’ll say something which is terribly unpopular but which I’ve been saying for 10 years: We are not paying the true cost of food. We are just not.

Do you think that should be reflected when we go to the supermarket?

Yes it should be more expensive. Because it’s not sustainable in terms of farmer income in terms of animal welfare in terms of your health sometimes.

When we walk into a supermarket in 10 years’ time is it going to look different? Will there be different products on the shelves? What do you think and what would you like to see?

I hope it is going to be different. There is one aspect that I think I am absolutely convinced about: The food system will relocalize. The second biggest topic for governments through the pandemic has been to make sure that there would be enough food. And they suddenly realized that with the complexity of the food system there were these bottlenecks. The reduction of the food system carbon emissions will also come from the fact that the ingredients will travel less.

In 20 years from now you will have much more local food. I would like to see more diverse local food and more expensive than you have today. Some subsidies should be redirected in order to make sure that the people that cannot afford to pay are being given the possibility to do that.

At the end of the day we know where the food systems have led us: About two billion people that are overweight in the world about 700 million people that have diabetes. Instead of dealing with these obesity and diabetes issues by providing better food aid and supporting people that need to be supported you’d actually save money for the future.

This is the whole theory of where I think we can gradually move. And climate change will force us to move there.

I want to get back to the original thing we were talking about: What we call “conscious capitalism.” You sound almost kind of optimistic that there are really big changes to come out of this pandemic. And yet inequality is worse and the profit motivation seems as strong as ever. What makes you so hopeful that people are going to act in the common good rather than in their own self interest?

I’m not sure they will. I’ve seen the worst and the best in this pandemic. We see all over the place that growing inequalities are a danger for democracies. So I’m not optimistic. But we’ve seen solidarity social bonding people changing their behaviors in many ways again for the worse and for the best.

I see climate change as such a huge frontier for us as a species that I’m sure it will bring the worst. And I see signs that it can also bring the best. It would be illogical to blame capitalism and the global financial markets for ruining the resilience of our species.

I’ve defined myself as a business activist. I’m an activist of business being part of the solution being the fundamental solution the solution.

I saw you said that when you were 33 you thought of leaving business. Now you think it is the place to be.

Yes I really think so.

Do you think the next generation of CEOs is going to be quite different?

The next I don’t know. But the next-next? I think yes. Maybe they will not join the companies. That’s the point. And this is why CEOs are paying a lot of attention to these collectives of employees that have started all around the world. They are highly educated talented managers. And they will be candidates for CEOs.

They are part of a generation that was born with these questions already. So it’s not a cultural shift [for them]. We were talking about this climate skilling and upskilling. How to make people aware of [climate change]. This is not a problem for that generation. They’re entirely into it already sometimes too much with climate anxiety and everything.

So they will leave these large companies in which case I think these large companies will simply not survive because they will not have the skills.

Put it this way if you’re not able to lead climate strategy 10 years from now you should not be a CEO. It’s as simple as that. Your company will not find capital. I’m pretty clear on that."

Much was made of the tragedy of her death because she was the fourth child of the family’s four to die. Her bereft parents and the local community were told initially that the others’ deaths had been caused by diphtheria. With Ann Amelia’s illness however a doctor questioned that diagnosis: diphtheria was hugely contagious yet none of the neighbours had been ill. Soon it became apparent that all four children had died from arsenic poisoning caused by green wallpaper in the Turner home.

Journalists were soon on a crusade to expose the health problems experienced by workers in wallpaper factories – but the problem continued to be ignored. Customers wanted arsenical-green paper hangings and designers were happy to oblige. Not everyone living with such wallpaper was affected and those who did become ill weren’t necessarily affected in the same way as other sufferers. It took a long time for scientists to discover that – aside from the risk of children licking the walls – the main danger lay in an invisible arsenious gas that emanated from wallpaper in damp and especially mouldy conditions.

Both Morris and his business partner Edward Burne-Jones decorated their homes with arsenic wallpaper and neither they nor their families suffered obvious ill effects. Morris became furious about the clamour for wallpaper to be free of arsenic – but when the public began talking with their wallets he was smart enough to listen. The very first arsenic-free wallpaper to be produced in Britain was made by the forward-thinking William Woollams & Co in 1859; in 1875 Morris & Co proudly proclaimed on its new catalogues that all its wallpapers were free of arsenic too.

No legislation was ever passed in the British Isles to prevent the use of arsenic in the manufacture of wallpaper. The extinction of arsenic wallpaper here was achieved entirely by campaigning doctors and journalists and a consequent change in public opinion. Yet in private Morris compared the furore to the historic witch-hunts in Salem Massachusetts. In 1885 he would write to his friend Thomas Wardle: “As to the arsenic scare a greater folly it is hardly possible to imagine: the doctors were bitten as people were bitten by the witch fever.”

Edison’s Anti-Gravitation Under-Clothing by Bob Nicholson

In December 1878 Punch forecast that the coming year would bring a surprising invention: “Edison’s Anti-Gravitation Under-Clothing” would soon “enable the Wearer thereof to suspend at will the Force of Gravity”. Anybody who donned a set of this high-tech American underwear would be granted the power to fly effortlessly around a room propelled only by the gentle wafting of a handheld fan. The accompanying cartoon by George Du Maurier depicted fashionable Victorians floating gracefully towards the ceiling of the Royal Academy.

This was of course a joke: anti-grav undies existed only in the imagination. It was one of many fanciful contraptions dreamed up by Victorian humorists in the late 1870s a period in which the world seemed to be caught in the grip of “discovery mania”. At the heart of this cultural moment was the American inventor Thomas Edison. He rose to prominence following the invention in 1877 of the phonograph the first device capable of capturing and replaying sound. Within months news of this breakthrough had made its creator a global household name.",,,,,,,,,,,,

All prices were up to date at the time of publication.

Nikole Hannah-Jones’ Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project first published as an issue of the New York Times Magazine in August 2019 argues for a reframe of American history dating the story of the country from the arrival of a group of enslaved people in the ship White Lion on Virginia’s stolen shores rather than from the signing of the Declaration of Independence. And that is the story told in The 1619 Project: Born on the Water a new picture book in verse for young readers in grades 2 through 5 based on the Project which was published alongside an expanded book-length version of the original magazine issue this week. Joining Hannah-Jones in producing this volume for kids are children’s book author Renée Watson and “artivist” Nikkolas Smith.

Born on the Water opens with a familiar classroom assignment: making a family tree. A young Black girl is depicted with a look of dismay on her face. In the background faint sketches of children holding up their ancestors’ countries’ flags with big smiles can be seen. The contrast of their glee with her distress is a testament to the evocative nature of Smith’s paintings. “Most of my classmates can count back many generations” the girl reflects “and learn about the countries where their families came from. They draw their flags but I leave my paper blank. I do not know where I begin what my story is.”

This is an appropriate place to begin telling the story of slavery for young readers. Long before they learn about slavery in a formal way in history classes (where instructors as we know sometimes struggle to teach about the topic) children are informally introduced to slavery from other sources such as picture books television programs and conversations with family. Hannah-Jones Watson and Smith begin Born on the Water in a contemporary elementary school classroom with a lesson on family that many students will find familiar but that this girl’s teacher didn’t intend to use as a way into the topic of slavery. Like many younger kids in real life the fictional protagonist has come up against the history of slavery in a roundabout way.

How should this little girl begin her project? What’s her family background and identity? She asks her grandmother to tell her the story of their beginnings. One page turn later we’re transported back in time.

“They say our people were born on the water but our people had a home a place a land before they were sold” the grandmother says. This evocative reference to the Black Atlantic reframes where the story of Black America truly begins. It is neither in our African origins nor on the slave ships auction blocks and plantations. It’s somewhere in between as Canadian poet Dionne Brand reminds adult readers in A Map to the Door of No Return.

The idea of being “born on the water” is beautifully reparative after centuries of the topic being depicted problematically in children’s books and textbooks that deal with slavery. Black child readers as well as their teachers families and communities occupy a unique place when it comes to the importance of stories for children about slavery. The collective trauma of enslavement—what scholar Saidiya Hartman has called the afterlife of slavery—has continuing implications for the descendants of enslaved people living today.

Three sections follow the little girl’s grandmother’s opening. We are transported to the early 17th century Kingdom of the Kongo in three sections: “They Had a Language” “Their Hands Had a Knowing” “And They Danced.” These double-page spreads showcase the brilliance of Hannah-Jones Watson and Smith working together as journalist author and artist to shift the story. Rather than being born in children’s readerly imagination first as slaves in this book Black people have a different origin.

Instead of the more familiar West African setting for such origins (think Roots) Born on the Water correctly shows where the first enslaved Africans were taken from—a Portuguese-speaking syncretic Christian kingdom whose rulers were in dialogue with leaders in post-reconquista Portugal. The early contexts of New World slavery are rarely touched upon in most K-12 curricula nor do they show up often in children’s stories. The origins of slavery are traced here in a few pages rendered deftly through colorful brushstrokes and delightful verse.

It is difficult to imagine anyone subjecting another human being to the conditions of chattel enslavement. The question of how to depict such trauma and violence for young readers is always challenging. Born on the Water walks this line in the sections “Stolen” and “The White Lion.” Smith’s art here is reminiscent of Tom Feelings’ masterpiece for teenage readers The Middle Passage while Hannah-Jones and Watson’s refrain in verse reminds young readers “ours is no immigration story.”

The middle of the book deals with the conditions that the first enslaved Africans in Virginia found themselves facing from the tobacco plantations to the slave quarters. The concluding pages leap from the 17th century to the 21st showing how far we’ve come since then. While some experts may take issue with the book’s focus on the earliest era of American slavery when the experience of enslaved people was very different than it was later on as well as with the omission of indentured servants and Native slavery in Born on the Water Smith Watson and Hannah-Jones provide a nice architecture for later instructors to fill in.

If as Toni Morrison reminds us “the subject of the dream is the dreamer” Born on the Water recasts the American Dream narrative through the Black gaze and it wants to leaves the young reader with a feeling of pride. This highlights a common dilemma among those who write and illustrate younger children’s books about slavery. One of the key functions of children’s literature is to teach each successive generation of kids about history even when it is complicated. This can prove difficult in light of the other functions of children’s literature: to transmit values to convey a sense of nostalgia and wonder to spark young imaginations and to provide a predictable “happily ever after” at the end of each story. The conundrum is especially present when authors try to present this history to younger kids.

The result is often that Black history for children is retold in ways that reinforce the message that principles of liberty and equality always prevailed over slavery Jim Crow and racism. Many authors and illustrators have provided this uplifting message in creative and inspiring ways. However the takeaway for young people may be that no matter how traumatic and violent our collective national past might have been the United States has always been a land of freedom opportunity and equality under the law for everyone if they just work hard enough.

But there’s another argument one I find persuasive for the inclusion of nuance in stories about slavery for young readers. Stories about slavery for children must do more than transmit information about the past. These stories have a reparative function—they must also humanize and liberate. These stories must uplift hope and heal while presenting the truth of slavery’s echoes in the present. Children’s stories about slavery provide a potential space for both liberating and humanizing Black people just like poetry and narratives written by those enslaved in childhood from Phillis Wheatley and Olaudah Equiano in the 18th century to Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs in the 19th century once did.

Born on the Water is part of a long storytelling tradition that has been carried on by Black creatives concerned with “how the word is passed” (to quote Clint Smith) to our children. Tonya Bolden Carole Boston Weatherford Lesa Cline-Ransome Tracey Baptiste Kelly Starling Lyons and the authors and illustrators of the Brown Bookshelf collective have been creating incredible nonfiction books about Black history for decades. Their stories are used in classrooms and school libraries and provide the foundation for what kids know about not only the past but our fractured present.

All of these stories are necessary for not only Black children but all children. Stories like Born in the Water help them understand an important dimension of how the United States came to be. Given the multitude of challenges that diverse books for young readers face in today’s anti-critical race theory political environment it feels more important than ever to ensure all children receive accurate stories about our past so that we can move into a shared future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hlbGF0aW5kZXJhLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEvaG93LW11Y2gtaXMtd2F0ZXItd29ydGgtd2h5LWEtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtb3duZWQtc3Rha2UtaW4tYS1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLXdhdGVyLWJhbmstY291bGQtYmUtd29ydGgtbW9yZS10aGFuLTEtYmlsbGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Much Is Water Worth?

Can I visit Round Valley Reservoir today?

Yes -- today Round Valley Reservoir is managed by the New Jersey State Park Service. The Round Valley Reservoir swimming area was created by the construction of an earth dam across a narrow waterway on the west side of the reservoir separating it from the main part of the reservoir. The reservoir covers about 2350 acres and is approximately 180 feet deep the second deepest lake in New Jersey. It has a water capacity of 55 billion gallons. The reservoir is stocked with lake trout. Today Round Valley is the only New Jersey state park that offers wilderness camping. The campsites on the eastern side of the reservoir are accessible only by hiking or boating. The campers' parking lot is three miles away from the nearest site reachable by a steep and rugged trail. Cross-country skiers and sledding enthusiasts congregate at Round Valley in the winter months. You can learn more about this New Jersey state park here.

Are there any other ghost towns in New Jersey?

There are although New Jersey’s most notorious ghost town isn’t really much of a town at all anymore. While we love visiting Garden State ghost towns like Batsto Village Waterloo Village and Raritan Landing all preserved and open for the public to enjoy there is one abandoned town in the Garden State that is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. If you’re feeling brave pay a visit to Ong’s Hat the creepiest abandoned town in New Jersey. Ong's Hat is an unincorporated community in Pemberton Township. Located in the Pine Barrens there are several stories about how this town got its name. Some say a man named Jacob Ong threw his hat into the air out of frustration at which point it became stuck in a tree. More likely the town was originally named Ong's Hut after a way station/rest area along a grain transportation route. The area can be seen on maps dating back centuries; pictured is a map from 1778. Legend says that the town had just a handful of houses along with a thriving dance hall. However industry left the area and Ong's Hut/Ong's Hat slowly became the creepiest abandoned town in New Jersey. The last resident left the town in 1936 but not before some strange disappearances. Curious? You can learn more here...

What are some abandoned places in New Jersey?

In addition to the abandoned town of Ong's Hat (see above) there are a variety of abandoned places in New Jersey offering a unique (and often eerie) picture of what once was.

Is it working?,"Pharma companies vying for a piece of the lucrative migraine market have gone all-in on marketing. They've turned to Olympic athletes and Hollywood stars to pitch recently approved brands in TV commercials and on social media.

But is the message sinking in with patients? Apparently not yet a new survey from Phreesia Life Sciences suggests.

Nearly half of the more than 4000 migraine patients polled in July 2021 said they couldn’t recall a single brand name when asked about preventive migraine drugs. The most recognized brand? Topamax which won FDA approval for migraine way back in 2004.

While slightly more than a quarter of patients (26%) recognized the older Johnson & Johnson drug fewer than 1 in 10 patients remembered the newer brands which have entered the market in recent years.

Leading the pack among these newer meds which target CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is Amgen’s Aimovig with 8% of patients recalling the brand followed by Eli Lilly’s Emgality and Biohaven’s Nurtec ODT (both 7%) and Teva’s Ajovy (3%).

RELATED: Eli Lilly under pressure from Biohaven launches head-to-head migraine trial between Emgality and Nurtec

Although the survey shows migraine drug marketers have work to do when it comes to brand recognition it also reveals a large untapped market said Liz Hebert senior research manager at Phreesia which surveyed patients checking in for doctors' appointments through its digital patient intake platform.

For example nearly three-quarters of patients said migraine has had a moderate to great impact on their daily lives but only 37% had tried a preventive treatment. (The figure jumps to 52% for acute meds.)

That doesn’t mean they’re not willing. In fact 40% of patients who have never taken a preventive med—and nearly 60% of those who have—said they were likely to try a new preventive treatment in the next year according to the survey.

“What that tells me is they just need an additional push” said Joyce Wang Phreesia’s associate director of research.

One way pharma companies can provide that push is with more detailed information about how their meds work and how they can help the report suggests. In some cases patients aren’t even aware their migraines are serious enough to warrant a prescription so stronger messaging is needed Wang and Hebert said.

“They haven’t been given the information to understand that ‘Hey you don’t need to suffer’” Wang explained.

What else do migraine patients want from drug companies? Information about side effects is high on the list Wang and Hebert said with 36% saying it would increase their interest in a new preventive brand.

Almost a third of patients (32%) said “tips to manage side effects” would rank among the top three most helpful resources pharma companies could give them about their migraine care. And among those who are no longer taking a preventive medication 28% said they stopped because of side effects compared to only 15% who said the treatment didn’t work.

“That tells a really strong story” said Wang. “They really need some more detailed guidance on how to best manage those [side effects].”

Pharma also needs to continue its outreach to doctors—particularly primary care physicians who may be more likely to recommend over-the-counter meds the report recommends. More than half of patients (53%) said a doctor’s recommendation would boost their interest in a new migraine treatment.

“Patients are talking about their migraines all the time and they’re not just talking about their migraines to their specialty doctors” Wang said. “We really need to broaden the horizons and get more people involved in the treatment process.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s only four and a half years since the national senior women’s side had to threaten strike outside Liberty Hall to be treated with due respect.

Now the team is sponsored by Sky its World Cup qualifiers are live on RTÉ TG4 has begun covering the WNL and Sunday’s FAI Cup final between double-chasing Shelbourne and Wexford Youths (5.30pm) is also live on TV.

But the decision to bring the women’s cup final in from the shadows and play it annually at the Aviva’ in a televised double-header with the men’s decider was first done only eight years ago.

Truth is two generations of Ireland’s best female footballers went unseen especially its pioneers.

There’s some debate about when the ‘first’ women’s cup final took place but official records place it firmly in Limerick’s legendary Markets Field in 1975 under the auspices of the first Women’s Football Association of Ireland (WFAI).

The locals won it beating CSO Dublin (a Civil Service team) 2-1 but like so much in women’s team sport back then it went largely unrecorded and unheralded nationally much like the contribution of Limerick women to Irish soccer.

Track down local trailblazers and they all point to Frank ‘Junior’ Keane.

He started girls’ football in Ballynanty set up the Limerick Ladies Soccer League (LLSL) in 1973 and also ensured that Limerick were one of the 12 teams that contested the first Women’s League of Ireland in 1973 coaching them to win the first two WNL titles (1973-74) and the first cup.

“He had a shop where I lived and it was he who really started ladies soccer locally” says Mary Joyce who won that first cup final at 17.

She recalls a 100-game unbeaten run with Junior’s Ballynanty kids how Mary Gavin’s aunt literally hand-made their first set of gear and Keane borrowed kit from Wembley Rovers boys for them before they got their own white and blue strip.

Factory teams were another big driver of women’s football locally in the 1970s where clubs and inter- firms combined in a thriving local league.

Joyce worked and played for Analog Devices and companies like Krupps EI Electronics and De Beers also fielded strong teams.

Grainne Cross from a famous football family of eight sisters starred for De Beers.

She missed out Limerick’s first cup final (she was just 11 at the time) but her sisters Ann and Catherine were involved.

Grainne was a senior international at 15 and once played senior and U18 for Ireland in one day. She also spent a season in Italy with Flaminia Ambrosiana in Monza.

“Ann O’Brien was playing in Italy so I wrote to the Italian association to see if anyone was interested.

“This club wrote back they’d done some research on me and brought me over for a week’s trial.

“I ended up staying six months and they wanted me back the next season but to be honest coming from a family of 12 I was very homesick it just wasn’t for me” recalls Cross.

Mary Joyce’s Ireland debut was against Scotland in April 1976 and she’s not even sure how many internationals she played but she literally got her first cap (which credited her with 11) in the post 14 years ago.

“Ireland were playing in Limerick and someone gave us a ticket for the VIP area and my husband went over to John Delaney and said I’d never got any of my caps.

“He said a lot of their records had gone missing after a fire and then my cap just arrived in the post one day! My husband got it for me for my 50th birthday.”

Of Limerick’s historic first WFAI Cup winners Joyce her best friend Marion Slattery Geraldine Grace Mary Gavin Marion Leahy and Pauline Maher all played for Ireland though not all at the same time.

Joyce played football until her early 30s and Grainne Cross lined out for Mungret into her early 40s. She also remarkably took up rugby with Old Crescent in the mid-90s and was a late call-up for Ireland in the 1998 World Cup.

Her sister Tracy (now Tracy Hoza) went to America on scholarship and still coaches soccer at Austin Peay University in Clarksville Tennessee.

And when Treaty United beat Peamount to win their historic U17 girls’ national league title a week ago their backroom team included another Cross sister and Irish international — Rose Benson — who is still keeping the flame burning at home.

The Limerick team that day was: Fiona Skelly Geraldine Grace Catherine Brown Marion Slattery Majella Reddin Bridget Darcy Freda Noonan; Pauline Maher Martha O’Reilly Marion Leahy Mary Joyce Ann Cross Mary Gavin.

FAI Women's Cup final preview: Wexford bid to halt Shels’ dream double

John Fallon

Joey Malone denied Noel King an FAI Cup triumph as manager but they’ll be unified on the Shelbourne bench tomorrow in pursuit of the women’s FAI Cup against Wexford Youths (Tallaght Stadium 5.30pm Live RTÉ 2).

The old sparring partners — opposing bosses when Galway shocked Shamrock Rovers in the 1991 decider — teamed up at the start of the season in a bid to break Peamount United’s dominance.

They’ve got halfway there by denying Peas a three-in-a-row of titles in last Saturday’s final day. Wexford stand in their way of a double at Tallaght Stadium.

This season Wexford won 1-0 at Ferrycarrig Park in August before King’s Shels last week produced a narrow 3-2 win to seal their first title since 2016.

The FAI are expecting a bumper crowd at the 7000-capacity venue. Shels beat Wexford 5-0 in the 2016 final but Wexford bounced back to win back-to-back Cups in 2018 and 2019.

Their boss Stephen Quinn is hoping to have Ciamh Gray back from injury to solve their goalkeeper crisis. Wexford will need to be defensively tight to repel Shels’ striker Noelle Murray and her partner Saoirse Noonan who has thrived since joining from last year’s runners-up Cork City.",,,,,,,,,

Green will walk away from Tiburon Golf Club with a $1 million check as the winner of the Aon Risk Reward Challenge for 2021.

“I haven’t even made that much money over two seasons” said Green “so it’s still not quite sunk in yet.”

The Aon Risk Reward Challenge is a season-long competition on both the LPGA and PGA Tours (Matthew Wolff won the men’s competition) where Aon selects risk-reward holes at each tournament and the lowest cumulative score in relation to par wins the top prize.

Green who won the 2019 KPMG Women’s PGA Championship birdied 72 percent of the Aon Risk Reward Challenge Holes and didn’t make bogey on any of the Challenge Holes throughout the season.

“I try to be aggressive when I’m on the golf course. I feel like that’s where I can show that side of me” Green said. “I just thought this was a great concept and to be able to have the opportunity to showcase it every week was really cool.

“It was just something I really wanted to win especially coming down the crunch.”

Ally Whittaker was doing commentary at the AIG Women’s Open in August and told Green she was leading the standings. Whittaker is a friend of Green’s and at that point Green ramped up the focus on winning the $1 million.

She pivoted her schedule and did not tee it up at last week’s Pelican Women’s Championship.

""Just shows how important it is to us LPGA players to sacrifice an event"" Green said.

With her winnings (Green’s career-earnings are $2262361 with more than a quarter of that coming when she won the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship in 2019) Green said she’s planning to purchase a home. She had in her plans for the off-season to make that big-time purchase in Australia which she said was very difficult to do as someone who plays a sport for a living.

Although Green won’t win the record $1.5-million prize at this week’s LPGA Tour season finale (she said earlier in the week with a laugh that if she did win she’d just buy a bigger house) she’s already looking forward to reaping the reward of navigating the biggest challenges the LPGA Tour had to offer in 2021.

“In a way for me” said Green “it will be life-changing.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple posted a statement to its employees Friday evening reminding them of their rights to speak up about their pay and working conditions. The move comes after months of employee organizing in a movement that’s come to be known as #AppleToo.

“Apple is deeply committed to providing employees with a workplace where they feel safe respected and inspired to do their best work” the company said in the statement posted to an internal employee portal which was obtained by CNN Business. “Our policies do not restrict employees from speaking freely about their wages hours or working conditions.”

The statement added that employees are welcome to raise concerns “in the way they feel most comfortable internally or externally.” NBC first reported the memo Friday.

In recent months Apple (AAPL) employees have broken with the company’s historic culture of secrecy to speak out on controversial hiring decisions alleged pay disparities and remote work policies.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

Two Apple employees Janneke Parrish and Cher Scarlett started #AppleToo in August to help the company’s workers “organize and protect ourselves” according to the movement’s website. They called on coworkers to share stories of issues they may have faced including incidents of racism sexism and discrimination in order to outline “changes we expect to see Apple make.”

Parrish told CNN Business last month that they received hundreds of reports from employees within weeks about alleged incidents that “range the gamut from sexism and ageism to disclosures of rape and suicide” she said.

Parrish filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board earlier this month alleging that she was fired from her job as an Apple program manager in October in retaliation for her organizing efforts. (At the time Apple said it does not discuss specific employee matters but that “we take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised.” For her part Scarlett said on Twitter last week that Friday was her last day at Apple.

Friday’s statement by Apple is a win for the #AppleToo movement Parrish told CNN Business.

“It’s something that we’ve wanted Apple to communicate for the entirety of #AppleToo” Parrish said. “It’s definitely not the end of the road but it’s a really big first step and it shows what workers speaking in unison can achieve.”

She added that one common theme in the stories that employees have submitted to #AppleToo is that workers don’t know that they’re allowed to speak up when issues arise.

Apple this week informed employees that they have a right to discuss wages and pay-related complaints externally but the company faces mounting pressure over its employee policies including a recently filed Securities and Exchange Commission complaint.

Staff in the U.S. were made aware of their express rights in a memo posted to Apple's people site reports NBC News. The memo marks a noted shift in policy for a company that has over the past months worked to tamp down attempts to organize over similar matters.

""Our policies do not restrict employees from speaking freely about their wages hours or working conditions"" the memo reads according to the report. ""We encourage any employee with concerns to raise them in the way they feel most comfortable internally or externally including through their manager any Apple manager People Support People Business Partner or Business Conduct.""

The internal communique does not express entitlements unique to Apple employees as rights to organize and speak out about wages are covered by the National Labor Relations Act. The page itself is a new post that underscores text from Apple's public Business Conduct Policy document.

While it is being hailed by the press and some employee rights advocates as a win for workers it is unclear what impact the memo will have if any on Apple staff at large.

Company workers have been pushing for more transparency on pay equity issues with some creating surveys for the purpose. Apple squashed those attempts and shut down an internal Slack channel dedicated to discussion of the issue in August.

In September SVP of Retail and People Deirdre O'Brien issued a memo to address chatter over pay equity and workplace issues saying Apple's approach to the former is ""best in class."" O'Brien also urged staff to reach out to managers or human resources about wage and workplace concerns.

Today's memo arrives as Apple faces increased scrutiny over its employee policies. Now-former employees Cher Scarlett and Janneke Parrish helped form the so-called #AppleToo movement which gathered and publicly shared stories about alleged racism sexism inequality and other workplace issues. Scarlett also filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint claiming Apple retaliated against workers who attempted to discuss pay.

Parrish was fired in October for deleting files off a work phone during an investigation. Scarlett this week said she was leaving Apple and would drop her NLRB complaint after settling with the company.

The NLRB is investigating seven other labor charges against Apple including multiple complaints from former software engineering manager Ashley Gjovik. Gjovik who earlier this year aired concerns over workplace safety issues sexism and discrimination was fired in September for allegedly leaking intellectual property.

In October Gjovik filed an SEC complaint targeting Apple's statements in response to a shareholder resolution that sought to exempt instances of workplace harassment and discrimination from employee nondisclosure agreements. At the time Apple refused to consider the proposal saying it had contingencies in place for such exceptions.

From Gjovik's SEC filing reported here for the first time:

The statements made by Apple Inc. to response to the Shareholder Resolution introduced by Nia Impact Capital includes false & misleading statements of material importance. With the SEC's recent prioritization of enforcing ESG commitments and verifying disclosures Apple Inc. must be investigated for making false statements to its shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Apple continues to deny its now well-known and public issues with discrimination retaliation work conditions labor compliance and intimidation of employees. Apple's response ignored the numerous open government investigations into its labor practices and the active use of over-broad confidentiality agreement to terminate employees speaking out about labor conditions and/or reporting unlawful activity by Apple to authorities.

""Apple has a very long history of labor offenses both civil and criminal"" Gjovik said in a statement to AppleInsider. ""They are also facing a major investigation by the NLRB into their internal employee policies and the threatening memo Tim Cook sent Apple employees in September. Apple is the biggest company in the world and has more money and power than some nations. We must hold it accountable we must demand transparency and we must not look the other way just because we like its gadgets.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXBwbGUtbWVtby1lbXBsb3llZXMtZGlzY3Vzcy1wYXktd29ya2luZy1jb25kaXRpb25zLWFwcGxldG9vLTIwMjEtMTHSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FwcGxlLW1lbW8tZW1wbG95ZWVzLWRpc2N1c3MtcGF5LXdvcmtpbmctY29uZGl0aW9ucy1hcHBsZXRvby0yMDIxLTExP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple memo claims employees can openly discuss pay working conditions,"Tim Cook. Apple

Apple posted a new memo saying workers have the right to speak out about working conditions and pay.

NBC reported that the internal memo was shared with the company's 80000 US employees.

It comes months after Apple workers went public with allegations of harassment and discrimination.

Apple has been plagued with claims of harassment and discrimination since 15 employees launched the Apple Too website in August. The allegations mainly came from the company's retail staff.

Cher Scarlett a former AppleToo organizer and engineer at the company told the Insider at the time that she believed the HR department ""didn't really consider anything they complained about to be an issue.""

Now in an internal memo obtained by NBC News Apple has announced its employees have the right to openly voice any concerns about pay equality or working conditions.

According to the outlet the memo was published on the company's internal people site on Saturday. It was accessible to all 80000 salaried and hourly US employees the outlet added.

Per NBC's report the memo states: ""Our policies do not restrict employees from speaking freely about their wages hours or working conditions.""

It continues: ""We encourage any employee with concerns to raise them in the way they feel most comfortable internally or externally including through their manager any Apple manager People Support People Business Partner or Business Conduct.""

Since the #AppleToo movement began eight unfair labor charges have been filed against Apple although one has since been dismissed NBC News reported.

Earlier this week Scarlett announced that she had reached a settlement with Apple and was leaving the company.

Insider reported earlier this month that another ex-employee Janneke Parrish accused the company of retaliating after she tried to highlight problems of discrimination and harassment.

In a statement to Reuters which was issued in response to the report about Parrish Apple said it didn't discuss matters pertaining to individual employees. It added that it was ""deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace.""

Prior to posting Saturday's memo Apple claimed that the language in their business conduct policy already covered this sentiment The Verge reported.

The policy states that no part of their NDA policies should restrict their employees' free speech with regard to workplace conditions or equal pay.







The #AppleToo open letter to Tim Cook and the senior leadership team published in August called into question the extent that the policy has been enforced. ""Apple prides itself on its commitment to diversity equity and an environment where every person is able to do their best work; however in practice this is far from the case"" it stated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExLzIwL2J1c2luZXNzL3RlY2gvYXBwbGUtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLWdvYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple accelerates work on car as it aims for fully autonomous vehicle,"Apple Inc. is pushing to accelerate development of its electric car and is refocusing the project around full self-driving capabilities according to people familiar with the matter aiming to solve a technical challenge that has bedeviled the auto industry.

Around the year 1603 Italian shoemaker and amateur alchemist Vincenzo Casciarolo tried smelting some especially dense stone he had found on the slopes of Mount Paderno near Bologna. No gold silver or other precious metals resulted as he had hoped. But after the stone had cooled Casciarolo discovered something interesting: If he exposed the material to sunlight and then took it into a dark room the stone would glow.

That “Bologna Stone” was the first artificially prepared persistently luminescent substance. Many more were to follow — and today persistent luminescent materials are used for decorations emergency lighting pavement markings and medical imaging.

Someday they might give us glowing cities that stay cooler and use less electricity.

A new generation of luminescent materials has the potential to cool cities by re-emitting light that would otherwise be converted into heat. They might also cut down on energy use since luminescent sidewalks glowing road markers or even glowing buildings could replace some street lighting. Already some cities in Europe have installed glowing bicycle lanes and some researchers have studied using glowing paint for road markings.

“It’s better for the environment” says Paul Berdahl an environmental physicist now retired from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley California. “If the technology can be improved we can use less energy.… It’s a worthwhile thing to do.”

The Bologna Stone a form of the mineral baryte fascinated natural philosophers at the time but was never especially useful. But in the 1990s chemists developed new types of persistent photoluminescent materials such as strontium aluminate that maintained a strong glow for hours after exposure to light. Most of these new materials give off a blue or green glow although a few glow yellow red or orange.

Such photoluminescent materials work by “trapping” the energy of a photon and then re-emitting that energy as lower-wavelength light. Sometimes the light is emitted immediately such as in a fluorescent light bulb. Other materials which are called persistently luminescent store the energy longer and emit it more slowly.

More than 250 kinds of luminescent materials have been identified. Above they are grouped by a) the trace materials that act as the luminescent center; b) the host compound; and c) the color the material emits.

These materials that glow strongly for hours open possibilities such as “glow-in-the-dark” cities lighted by luminescent pavements and buildings. Since 19 percent of all global energy use is for lighting and in Europe about 1.6 percent specifically for street lighting the potential energy savings are large write building engineer Anna Laura Pisello and colleagues in the 2021 Annual Review of Materials Research.

One problem with the approach is that most luminescent material won’t glow all the way through the night. Better materials could help solve that problem says Pisello of the University of Perugia who studies energy-efficient building materials. In the meantime existing materials could be combined with electric lighting that would come on long enough to recharge the road markings before switching off again.

Luminescent paint could also provide outdoor area lighting. Pisello’s lab developed such a glow-in-the-dark paint and in a 2019 report simulated what would happen if they painted a public path near a railway station with it. By glowing throughout the night the paint would reduce energy needed for lighting by about 27 percent in the immediate area the scientists found.

If this conjures worries of entire cities glaring throughout the night and adding to harmful light pollution Pisello says that is unlikely. Luminescent materials would likely only replace existing lighting not add to it. The color of the glowing materials could be chosen to avoid the blue frequencies that have been found especially harmful to wildlife.

Luminescent materials could also help fight what is known as the urban heat island effect. Rooftops and pavements absorb energy from the sun and emit it as heat driving city summer temperatures an average of 7.7 degrees Celsius higher than in the surrounding countryside. The high temperatures are a potential health hazard and also result in more energy being used to cool buildings.

One increasingly common solution is to use “cool” materials that reflect light such as white paint and light-colored asphalt. It turns out that adding luminescent materials can help even more.

Anna Laura Pisello and colleagues at the University of Perugia are trying to create practical pavements that glow in the dark. They are experimenting with different luminescent substances and testing how to add them to pavement material to get the best performance and durability. Above are samples of luminescent materials and a paving stone in which they have been embedded. Image courtesy of Anna Laura Pisello.

At the Lawrence Berkeley Lab Berdahl and his team experimented with synthetic ruby a material that is luminescent while in sunlight to make colored coatings that stayed cool. In an early experiment they reported that a ruby-pigmented surface stayed cooler in the sun than a similarly colored material without the special pigment.

Pisello’s lab went one step further and added several persistently luminescent materials — ones that stored light energy and gave it off slowly — to concrete. Compared with non-luminescent surfaces of the same color the best of them lowered the surrounding air temperature on sunny days by up to 3.3°C.

“You can make [a surface] as reflective as possible. But can you go beyond that? The idea is that maybe you can go a little bit beyond that using persistent luminescence as another way to transfer energy out.... It is interesting” says Patrick E. Phelan a mechanical engineer at Arizona State University who coauthored a paper on the urban heat island effect in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2dyZWVuLWJheS1wYWNrZXJzLXNoYXJlcy1hcmUtd29ydGhsZXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green Bay Packers (Shares) Are Worthless,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/green-bay-packers-shares-are-worthless on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2dyZWVuLWJheS1wYWNrZXJzLXNoYXJlcy1hcmUtd29ydGhsZXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

C’est dans le cadre de la loi de programmation de la recherche autour de la thématique «recherche partenariale et innovation» que l’Université Clermont Auvergne a obtenu le label Pôle Universitaire d’Innovation. Cela permet d’engager une démarche de valorisation du potentiel des acteurs de la recherche sur diverses thématiques comme l’invention l’innovation la formation le transfert de technologie ou l’accompagnement des start-up.

Former des étudiants à l’entrepreneuriat

Concrètement le label devra permettre de réunir les forces pour élaborer des stratégies d’innovation partagées tout en assurant la coordination des actions avec en ligne de mire le développement des retombées économiques et sociales de la recherche. Pour cela les programmes devront renforcer la sensibilisation et la formation des étudiants à l’entrepreneuriat tout en s’assurant que les projets innovants portés par les étudiants les enseignants-chercheurs ou les chercheurs soient traités avec un niveau d’excellence. Il convient de rappeler que l’ensemble des composantes de l’Université est fédéré autour du fameux thème «concevoir des modèles de vie et de production durables» en lien avec les enjeux sociétaux actuels.

Une dotation de 25M€

Le label PUI permet d’obtenir une dotation financière de 2.5M€ une aide indispensable pour mener le projet qui s’inscrit dans une trajectoire déjà bien engagée. L’innovation est en effet un enjeu stratégique pour l’UCA qui mène une politique volontariste de rapprochement avec le monde socio-économique mais aussi de valorisation de la recherche par une mise en réseau des acteurs. Pour assurer l’interface entre les laboratoires de recherche et les partenaires l’Université dispose depuis fin 2019 d’une filiale dédiée à l’innovation le transfert et l’entreprenariat Deeptech : Clermont Auvergne Innovation.

He was 98.

Corman died May 9 at his home in Santa Monica Calif. surrounded by family members the family confirmed to Variety.

“His films were revolutionary and iconoclastic and captured the spirit of an age. When asked how he would like to be remembered he said ‘I was a filmmaker just that'” the family said in a statement.

Corman’s empire which existed in several incarnations including New World Pictures and Concorde/New Horizons was as active as any major studio and he boasted always profitable. He specialized in fast-paced low-budget genre movies — horror action science fiction even some family fare — and his company became a work-in-training ground for a wide variety of major talents from actors like Nicholson (“Little Shop of Horrors”) and De Niro (“Boxcar Bertha”) to directors like Francis Ford Coppola (“Dementia 13”) and Scorsese (“Boxcar Bertha”).

When Corman was awarded an Oscar at the AMPAS’ first Governors Awards ceremony in November 2009 Ron Howard saluted him for hiring women in key exec and creative jobs as well as for giving them big roles and Walter Moseley was quoted as saying Corman offered “one of the few open doors” looking beyond age race and gender.

Popular on Variety

Corman hailed film as “the only truly modern art form.” But he pointed out that the need of cast and crew payments mean a constant compromise between art and business.

Howard also joked that when he directed his first film “Eat My Dust” he complained to Corman about the low budget and the sparse extras for a crowd scene only to be told “If you do a good job on this film you won’t ever have to work for me again!”

Quentin Tarantino toasted him with “the movie lovers of planet Earth thank you.” Jonathan Demme praised his acting saying Corman gave “tremendous value at a really affordable price.” In several movies for Demme Corman wanted the same fee he gave actors in the 50-plus films he’d directed: scale plus 10%.

Over almost half a century he took over the B-movie market which had largely disappeared in the wake of television and kept it alive almost single-handedly (along with Sam Arkoff of American Intl. Pictures who financed most of Corman’s early directing/producing efforts). Well into his nineties he was producing Bs for $5 million and under and rolling them out for video and television release.

After he left off directing in the late ’60s (to return only briefly in the mid-’80s with “Frankenstein Unbound”) he formed New World Pictures which also imported foreign art films like Ingmar Bergman’s “Cries and Whispers” and taught the industry how to effectively market and distribute such rarefied films.

Born in Detroit Corman moved with his family in 1940 to Los Angeles. He attended Beverly Hills High School and then Stanford U. majoring in engineering. He admitted to being infatuated by movies from the time he came to California. “There was no way I couldn’t be interested in movies growing up where I did” he once said.

Service in WWII and his education (he also attended Oxford for a term studying English literature) slowed him down. After Stanford he worked for four days at U.S. Electric Motors and then tried to break into the business by working as a messenger at 20th Century Fox. When he returned from Oxford (and a short stay in Paris) he became in his own words “a bum.” From 1951-53 he did odd jobs and collected unemployment. He briefly worked as a script reader; convinced he could do better he wrote “Highway Dragnet” and sold it to Allied Artists for $4000.

With the money he made from the 1954 release and contributions from family and friends he produced “The Monster From the Ocean Floor” and struck a deal with Arkoff’s AIP. In return for cash advances Corman agreed to make a series of movies.

From 1955-60 Corman produced or directed more than 30 films for AIP all budgeted at less than $100000 and produced in two weeks or less. There were Westerns (“Five Guns West” “The Gunslinger”); horror and science fiction (“The Day the World Ended” “The Undead” in 1956 and 1957); as well as teen movies like “Carnival Rock” and “Rock All Night.”

Soon he was the hero of the drive-ins.

Critically it wasn’t until “Machine Gun Kelly” in 1958 that Corman was noticed. That pic was followed by a studio film “I Mobster” for Fox. After “Little Shop of Horrors” in 1960 Corman convinced Arkoff to bankroll some more ambitious projects in particular a series of films based on the works of one of Corman’s favorite authors Edgar Allan Poe. The horror series which starting with “The Fall of the House of Usher” in 1960 spawned eight low-budget hits including “The Tomb of Ligeia” and “The Masque of Red Death.” They revived the careers of Boris Karloff Vincent Price Basil Rathbone and Peter Lorre and became classics of a kind.

During the same period he was giving unknown actors like Ellen Burstyn Nicholson and De Niro screenwriters like Robert Towne and directors like Scorsese Demme Joe Dante and Peter Bogdanovich their starts.

His one and only “message” film 1962’s “The Intruder” starring William Shatner was about racism. Reviews were good but because the film used the “N” word it was denied the Production Code Seal so bookings were few. “I decided then and there I would never again make a movie that would be so obviously a personal statement” he once told a New York Times interviewer.

Nor was he satisfied with his venture into “big” movies for Columbia Pictures when execs there tried to stint on his budgets. Back at AIP he made “The Wild Angels” a biker movie with Peter Fonda that cost $360000 and grossed more than $25 million.

It was followed by “The Trip” about LSD and other youth-oriented hits. But he started to run out of steam around the time of “Bloody Mama” in 1970 and withdrew from directing after “Von Richthofen and Brown.” In 1970 he formed New World Pictures to produce and distribute the kinds of films Arkoff had once bankrolled. By the end of his first year with releases like “Women in Cages” and “Night Call Nurses” he was in the black. Later he would produce such films as “Piranha” “Eat My Dust” and “Death Race 2000.”

His hunger for art films began in 1972 with Bergman’s “Cries and Whispers” and continued with “Autumn Sonata” “The Story of Adele H” “Amarcord” and “Fitzcarraldo.” He reinvented their marketing and distribution booking them in a wider variety of venues and giving audiences outsides the major cities a taste of world cinema they had not previously enjoyed.

Foreign films were one fifth of New World’s $55 million annual revenue by 1980. He also added family films like “A Hero Ain’t Nothin’ but a Sandwich” to his mix and higher-priced (as in $5 million) projects like the sci-fier “Battle Beyond the Stars.” In 1983 he sold New World for $16.5 million and started Concorde/New Horizons. He continued to unearth new talent like director Luis Llosa and by 1989 was boasting in Variety of a string of 40 consecutive profitmakers. But the market had changed and his profits never reached the heights of the AIP or early New World days. Fortunately for Corman the ever-burgeoning foreign market took up some of the slack — it came to represent half or more of his business — and CNH came about at the perfect time to capitalize on the new home video market. With his massive back catalog he was perfectly positioned to bring out his old pics on video while making new ones specifically targeted to that market.

Returning to the director’s chair for the first time in two decades for 1990’s “Frankenstein Unbound” Corman disappointed genre fans and did not direct again.

There is no question however that his high volume for homevideo strategy was financially successful. Corman renamed the business New Concorde in 2000 and reorganized to form New Concorde Home Entertainment.

Corman had produced a movie called “The Fast and the Furious” in 1955 and when producer Neal Moritz discovered the film back when he was launching a car-fueled franchise of his own starring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker Moritz decided that he had to have that title for the movie. The two men came to an agreement under which Moritz swapped stock footage for name rights to the 2001 film and its successors.

Corman also found a new outlets for his pics on Showtime and the Sci Fi Channel (now Syfy). CNH produced a “Roger Corman Presents” series of science fiction horror and fantasy films for the pay cabler. The 2001 Sci Fi Channel “Black Scorpion” series was based on two of his more popular straight-to-vid films. Telepics for Syfy included “Dinoshark” “Dinocroc vs. Supergator” and “Sharktopus.”

In 2005 Concorde signed a 12-year deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment giving the latter distribution rights to the more than 400 Corman-produced pics then in 2010 Corman signed a deal with Shout Factory giving the latter exclusive North American homevid rights to 50 Corman-produced films.

Together they launched a home entertainment series called Roger Corman’s Cult Classics. The first titles made available were “Piranha” “Humanoids From the Deep” “Up From the Depths” and “Demon of Paradise.”

In 1990 Corman published his memoirs “Maverick: How I Made 200 Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime.”

He frequently made cameos in the pics of the successful filmmakers who got their start with him appearing for example in Demme’s “Philadelphia” Howard’s “Apollo 13” Coppola’s “The Godfather: Part II” and Dante’s “Looney Tunes: Back in Action.”

In 1998 he received the first Producers Award ever presented by the Cannes Film Festival.

In 2006 Corman received the David O. Selznick Award from the Producers Guild of America. The same year his film “Fall of the House of Usher” was among the 25 pics selected for the National Film Registry a compilation of significant films to be preserved by the Library of Congress.

Alex Stapleton’s 2011 feature documentary “Corman’s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel” explored the filmmaker’s activities. Last year Corman was honored by the Los Angeles Press Club with its Distinguished Storyteller Award recognizing his contributions to the film industry.

Corman is survived by his wife producer Julie Corman and daughters Catherine and Mary.

But because she was a stunt double galloping on horseback crashing cars and kicking down doors for the stars of films and television shows hers was not a household name.

In her heyday however Ms. Epper was ubiquitous. She hurtled through the air most weeks as Lynda Carter’s stunt double on the hit television series “Wonder Woman” and mimed Ms. Carter’s leggy lope. She tumbled through a scrum of mud and rocks as Kathleen Turner’s double in the 1984 comedy-adventure film “Romancing the Stone” which also starred Michael Douglas. She threw punches for Linda Evans in one of her many ballyhooed cat fights with Joan Collins on the frothy long-running 1980s nighttime soap opera “Dynasty.”

And in what she often said was her favorite stunt — or gag to use the industry term — Ms. Epper skidded a Corvette into a 180-degree turn as Shirley MacLaine’s character in “Terms of Endearment” (1983) neatly hurling Jack Nicholson’s double into the Gulf of Mexico.

Ms. Epper whose bruising career spanned 70 years died on Sunday at her home in Simi Valley Calif. She was 83.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC9tYXkvMTEvc2VjcmV0LWxpc3QtYWJ1c2Vycy1jYW5uZXMtZmlsbS1mZXN0aXZhbNIBXWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC9tYXkvMTEvc2VjcmV0LWxpc3QtYWJ1c2Vycy1jYW5uZXMtZmlsbS1mZXN0aXZhbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Explosive’ secret list of abusers set to upstage women’s big week at Cannes film festival,"For good and bad reasons on and off the red carpet the spotlight is trained on women in the run-up to the Cannes film festival this week. As the cream of female film talent including Hollywood’s Meryl Streep and Britain’s Andrea Arnold prepare to receive significant career awards a dark cloud is threatening. It is expected that new allegations of the abuse of women in the European entertainment industry will be made public which may overshadow the sparkle of a feminist Croisette.

Streep’s screen achievements will be celebrated with an honorary Palme d’Or at the opening ceremony while a day later Arnold the acclaimed British film director will receive the prestigious Carosse d’Or from the French director’s guild. And on Sunday another influential British film personality will be saluted when diversity champion Dame Donna Langley the chairman and chief content officer at NBCUniversal is to be honoured with the Women in Motion Award at a lavish dinner. All this comes in a year that also sees the American director Greta Gerwig best known for last summer’s Barbie presiding over a jury that features the campaigning stars Eva Green and Lily Gladstone. But the story of the 77th festival will not be all positive for women.

In the run-up to the annual gathering on the Côte d’Azur rumours have been widespread in France of the existence of a secret list of 10 men in the industry including leading actors and directors who have been abusive to women. The names described as “explosive” are believed to have been sent anonymously to the National Centre for Cinema in Paris along with other leading film finance companies in France.

According to reports in Le Figaro and the satirical magazine Le Canard enchaîné festival organisers have set up a crisis management team to respond to the accusations. Films might have to be dropped from the screening timetable if they involve implicated names.

The impending revelations may prove an apt curtain-raiser for the Wednesday premiere of a short French film Moi Aussi about abuse in the industry. The film which was added to the festival’s Un Certain Regard programme at the last minute is predicted to prove just as incendiary as the list owing to its emotive content.

Made by actor Judith Godrèche dubbed the “ambassador of #MeToo” in France it draws on the words of many female contributors and takes the form of a choral piece uniting different personal accounts. “Suddenly before me was a crowd of victims a reality that also represented France so many stories from all social backgrounds and generations” Godrèche has explained. “Then the question was what I was going to do with them? What do you do when you’re overwhelmed by what you hear by the sheer volume of testimonies?”

The 52-year-old actor first shook up French cinema in February when she accused the directors Jacques Doillon and Benoît Jacquot of having raped her in the 1980s when she was a teenager. Jacquot 77 Godrèche said had a relationship with her when she was under the age of consent. He denies committing any offences and has said that he was “under her spell”. She claims Doillon 80 forced her to take part in a gratuitous sex scene on his 1989 film La Fille de 15 ans (The 15-year-old Girl). He says she agreed to take part in the scene in which he also acted and he denies rape or assault. Godrèche followed up her accusations a month later with a speech at France’s high-profile Cesar awards in which she claimed the film industry had been a cover for exploiting underaged actors.

The effect of new abuse allegations and all the honours being heaped on influential women will certainly mean the opening of the 2024 festival is in strong contrast to last year. Last May demonstrators on the Croisette opposed Johnny Depp’s appearance in the opening film Jeanne du Barry. They were angry about recent abuse allegations against him involving his ex-wife Amber Heard that led to his defeat in a British libel trial although a month later he won a similar libel trial in an American court.

A more progressive tone should be set by Streep’s opening honour made in recognition of “countless masterpieces” over 50 years of cinema. “To stand in the shadow of those who have previously been honoured is humbling and thrilling in equal part” said Streep on hearing of the award.

London-born Langley a “trailblazing” studio chief is also being rewarded next weekend for fostering “a more inclusive industry” over two decades with films that “provide a platform for women”. Away from film sets Langley has also campaigned as a board member of Vital Voices and is a founder of the Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Film mentorship programme. Previous winners of the Women In Motion award include Jane Fonda Salma Hayek Viola Davis and last year Michelle Yeoh.

Arnold whose new film Bird is showing in the main competition this year will receive her award after a Wednesday screening of her 2006 film Red Road. Set in Glasgow it tells of a false accusation of rape made vengefully by a female CCTV operator.

Jury-member Green is one of the more prominent actors to have accused Harvey Weinstein of making inappropriate advances. In 2017 the actor said she had to push away the disgraced producer during a business meeting in Paris. “I got away without it going further but the experience left me shocked and disgusted” she said.

The reaction to the #MeToo movement in France has been slower and more nuanced than in America. The legendary actor Catherine Deneuve was among those to initially play down the importance of prosecuting the bad behaviour of men defending their so-called “right to pester”. But last week French legislators agreed to a government inquiry into sexual and gender-based violence across the country’s performing arts and fashion sectors. And in the autumn French actor Gérard Depardieu stands trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on the set of The Green Shutters. He faces rape charges in another case and is under investigation over allegations of assault.

A federal judge in Fort Worth Texas on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.

US District Judge Mark T. Pittman an appointee of former President Donald Trump granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.

These organizations led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule which was set to go into effect Tuesday would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32 the CFPB estimated.

A preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.

“The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”

The US Chamber of Commerce has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.

“It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week” said Chuck Bell advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”

The rule first proposed in February 2023 is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.

The new rule would apply to large credit card issuers — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt according to the CFPB.

The push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers especially millennials and those with lower incomes have fallen behind on their credit card debt following more than two years of high inflation.

The new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.

According to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzExL2xpZmVzdHlsZS93aGF0LXRvLW9yZGVyLWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy13aGVuLXlvdXJlLXRyeWluZy10by1sb3NlLXdlaWdodC_SAWhodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMS9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2hhdC10by1vcmRlci1hdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtd2hlbi15b3VyZS10cnlpbmctdG8tbG9zZS13ZWlnaHQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm a dietitian — here's what to order at McDonald's when you're trying to lose weight,"When trying to lose weight conventional wisdom might dictate that the first thing to do is stop going to fast food restaurants but let’s be realistic — we’re Americans we’re out on the road and what’s out along those roads?

Burger chains chicken chains taco chains — all with their irresistible nobody-has-to-know drive-thru options.

And out of all those options the one we’re likely to be most frequently presented with is but of course McDonald’s.

3 Drive-thrus are a part of daily life and McDonald’s more than most — why avoid when you can make fast food work for you? Eric BVD – stock.adobe.com

And while the Golden Arches might seem like more of a hindrance than a help in the battle against excess pounds informed diners don’t have to be afraid to visit one of the world’s most ubiquitous restaurants — they just have to know how to order from the menu.

By using the same rules you’d use anywhere else — yes to lean proteins yes to veggies and don’t overeat — you’d be amazed how well you can do one expert explained.

Dietitian Kristen Carli owner of Camelback Nutrition & Wellness shared her go-to order with the fast food experts at Eat This Not That! — here are her picks for the best lunch order at McDonald’s for weight loss.

What to order at McDonald’s when you’re trying to lose weight

3 Keep it simple with a classic all-beef hamburger hold the high-calorie frills. McDonald's

“The best lunch order for weight loss is the McDonald’s Classic Burger with a side of apple slices and an unsweetened iced tea” Carli wrote.

“Opting for a basic burger such as a McDonald’s hamburger or cheeseburger provides protein and some carbohydrates without excess calories from cheese or mayo” she said.

“Choosing apple slices as a side adds fiber and natural sweetness without added sugars or fat. Selecting unsweetened tea keeps your drink calorie-free and helps you stay hydrated. This meal provides a great balance of protein carbohydrates and fiber which can help keep you satisfied while managing your calorie intake” the pro explained.

The meal tops off at just 250 calories believe it or not and packs a healthy 12 grams of protein — what Carli calls “your BFF for weight loss” and the “superhero of nutrients” for the way it fills you up helping you to avoid eating snacks between meals.

The apple slices instead of fries — and the unsweet tea instead of soda — makes this meal seem downright healthy.

Just make sure not to load the hamburger up with cheese and mayo and the like Carli warned — content yourself with onions pickle and ketchup."

Analysts predict a correction is unlikely in the near term.

According to the USDA's Illinois Production Cost Report in October the average price for urea was $810 per metric ton compared to $352 per metric ton in 2020. Diammonium phosphate (DAP) prices were at $814 per metric ton nearly double what they were in 2020 at $427 per metric ton.

The report also noted the price of liquid 28% nitrogen saw a significant jump in 2021 with the average at $475 per metric ton compared to $222 the previous year. Potash prices were $775 per metric ton an increase of almost $400 per metric ton from the previous year.

""With increases this dramatic in fertilizer prices we are starting to see growers turn toward or gain interest in tools like scripting that allow them to be more efficient and cost effective with their inputs"" says Matthew Lau global product manager of scripting for The Climate Corp.

Variable-rate prescriptions have been available for several years yet the technology is still not widely used.

""Approximately 20% of our current FieldView customers in the U.S. are using seed fertilizer and crop protection scripts"" Lau says. ""Our products that help farmers variable-rate have been in the marketplace for about five years. In that time we've been able to identify the pain points preventing farmers from creating more prescriptions and adopting more variable-rate activities.""

Ease of use is at the top of the list. With the introduction of Automatic Zone Creation Climate is working to make the process more automated.

""We were always hearing from growers how much time it took to create and manage prescriptions. Previously the tool for manual scripting had little to zero automatic capabilities with it and it required the user to pull up an image or a yield layer as a background layer and manually draw out the parts of the field they would like to begin managing"" he says. ""We're trying to get to a point where we are able to take the grower's data that has been collected and provide him with a fast easy solution to optimize the subfield areas in his operation.""

Automatically creating field zones using satellite imagery from any scouting map saves the farmer time. This tool also enables farmers to more easily and confidently write variable-rate fertilizer prescriptions to optimize their fertilizer investment and meet performance goals.

""The changes we've made give users the ability to easily see between all of their scouting layers and see the variability in their field using those layers and then make adjustments"" Lau says.

Users can set a zone count from two to 12 zones in a field allowing them to easily manage field variability and tailor it to the activity they're creating a script for.

""Automatic zone creation gives growers a much higher level of flexibility and accuracy to optimize inputs. It also allows growers to test different layers and different hypotheses and compare those to determine which one they feel is going to be the best choice to move into that next season"" he says. ""We know every year is different and every year brings its own set of challenges. We're excited to be able to deliver this functionality so growers can manage those challenges more effectively. Hopefully it will allow farmers to more easily adopt the technology.""

Climate Corp. is also rolling out an update to its tank mix product selection tool which provides farmers with the ability to easily identify and record crop protection products in a tank mix when creating a prescription.

""In June 2020 we launched our first iteration giving farmers the ability to create a crop protection prescription with one product"" Lau says.

Based on overwhelming feedback from growers the latest version of the tool can now handle up to eight crop protection products in a single tank mix.

""When applying herbicides growers rarely put down one product"" he says. ""They often have two three four or more depending on the region and the crop. Growers wanted the ability to more accurately tag all the products they had in the prescription so they know exactly what the recommendation is and what it's going to be used for in the field.""

Both tools come at no added cost for new and existing FieldView customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTExLzEyMzk1MDcuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinese researchers develop advanced tech for snow leopard protection,"Two snow leopard cubs rest at Xining Wildlife Park in Northwest China's Qinghai Province on April 27 2020. Photo: VCG

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been extensively applied in a national park in Northwest China to track snow leopards inhabiting the region.Around 60 percent of habitats of snow leopards around the world are located in China but there have been just 1.7 percent of habitats in China being recorded and investigated.As the top predator of alpine ecosystems snow leopards require sufficient prey and can control prey populations so they are an indicator of the health of alpine ecosystems. This is why researching and investigating the wild animal as well as their habitat is so important.Ma Duifang with the administration bureau of the park's Gansu Province section emphasized that China plays a significant role in protecting snow leopards also because other countries where snow leopards live including Kyrgyzstan and India ""cannot manage the work.""The AI-aided digital toolbox can automatically distinguish the species in the Qilian Mountains National Park Gansu Province from other wildlife using images captured by infrared cameras.The technology jointly developed by Chinese internet giant Tencent the World Wild Fund and One Planet Foundation can thus improve data processing efficiency.Located at around 3500 meters above sea level the Qilian Mountains with vast stretches of bare rocks protruding from the grass provide a favorable hideaway shelter for the snow leopards.Though more than 200 cameras have been installed in the region sorting out relevant information had not been easy for researchers.""For conducting further studies on the population distribution and activities of the snow leopards a flagship species in the region the cameras would capture hundreds of thousands of video clips and photos every quarter"" said Ma.""Even a slight movement in the environment such as a mild breeze blowing over the grass can activate the cameras. Sometimes curious wildlife bumps into the device triggering the shutter and the cameras take pictures of mere clouds"" Ma added.Ma and his colleagues had to go through each video frame by frame. The information of species that appeared on the images also required human input so it often took them several weeks to complete such tasks.AI technology has helped solve this problem and gives them the time to do other research.Tencent's engineering team has independently developed a species recognition algorithm by means of transfer learning and automatic data augmentation.Thanks to AI technologies researchers in the Qilian Mountains National Park no longer need to rack their brains in search of leopards hiding out in the wild.""The forest rangers can now locate a snow leopard from 1000 pictures in just about 20 minutes tremendously faster than before"" said Huang Xiangqi one of the tech developers.Snow leopards are under China's highest national-level protection and are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.In China they can be spotted in alpine areas in southwestern northwestern and northern autonomous regions and provinces including Xizang Sichuan Xinjiang Gansu and Inner Mongolia.""We hope we can combine monitoring data with field investigation to help researchers accurately identify the wild species so as to draw up a more specific plan for their protection"" said Ma Yao director of the project hoping the digital toolbox can be used in more countries.Ma noted that they want to promote the technology and protection experience to the world because in the field of animal protection China is a place willing to try innovation.""We have good resources and now we have good policies so we can make it. And the experience and AI technology can be used in protecting other endangered wildlife not just snow leopards"" the director said.",,,,,,

After reporting zero deposits in Northeast Ohio two years ago the nation's second-largest bank reported $1.1 billion in local deposits as of June 30 2021 according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That put them at No. 17 on the list out of 51 banks in the extended digital version.

So how did they immediately leapfrog so many other banks?

Bank of America had no local retail branches two years ago. It did have customers in Northeast Ohio but their deposits were routed to branches in other areas and thus didn't show up in FDIC data for Northeast Ohio.

Since then the Charlotte-based bank has opened five local branches as part of a plan to add hundreds of new financial centers nationwide. Those new local branches created a double-whammy effect: The bank expanded its local customer base and started reporting pre-existing local deposits through those new branches.

The true size of Bank of America's local presence remained hidden in June 2020: FDIC data at the time suggested the bank held just $3.2 million in local deposits. At that time the bank actually held roughly $846 million in local deposits that previously were almost all allocated to offices outside the region according to an estimate Bank of America provided to Crain's.

The following year the bank grew local deposits by roughly 33% hitting $1.1 billion. Today it also has more than 60 local ATMs up from just one less than two years ago according to Jeneen Marziani market president for Ohio and Cleveland.

Bank of America plans to open nine more local branches in 2022 and several more after that Marziani said.

They're going against the trend. Banks on the list closed 4.7% of their local branches in the 12 months ending June 30 as part of a long national trend driven in part by the rise of online banking and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. But Marziani said the new branches are well-positioned for the future. She said they feel more like Apple Stores and have a ""high-tech high-touch approach.""

""It's not what it looked like 10 or 20 years ago"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhcmFzb3RhbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLXByb2ZpbGVzLzIwMjEvMTEvc3RlcC11cC1zdW5jb2FzdC1hd2FyZGVkLTUwLTAwMC1mcm9tLWJhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Step Up Suncoast Awarded $50000 from Bank of America,"Step Up Suncoast was recently awarded $50000 in grant support from Bank of America.

But already the quarterback is reminding the front office he’s very good for business on Mint Street.

What’s happening: Since signing Newton the team has seen an increase in ticket sales for this Sunday’s game vs. the Washington Football Team as well as for future games a Panthers spokesperson confirmed.

Ticket prices have therefore shot up. Before the team signed Newton the average resale price for a ticket to the Washington game was $159 according to ticket platform SeatGeek. Following last week’s news the average resale price surged 68% to $266.

Demand for this weekend’s game “certainly increased” on SeatGeek spokesperson Jenna McKernan said in an email this week.

“We would expect to see demand remain strong for future Panthers games if the team continues to win and Newton continues to play as he is a fan favorite” McKernan added.

Of note: Another reason Sunday’s game is a big one: former Panthers head coach Ron Rivera now coaches Washington.

Flashback: The Panthers drafted Newton as the No. 1 overall pick a decade ago. A charismatic player known for gifting touchdown footballs to young fans Newton won the NFL MVP in 2015 the year he led the 15-1 Panthers to the Super Bowl.

Injuries plagued the quarterback and the Panthers cut him in 2020.

The Patriots signed him soon after but he’s been a free agent since they released him in August.

Newton’s new deal in Carolina is for one year and up to $10 million with $4.5 million guaranteed as the Observer reported.

“We didn’t bring Cam Newton to sell season tickets” head coach Matt Rhule said last week per the Observer. “We brought him here to win games.”

There are three ways teams generally look to to sell tickets: winning a championship having a brand-new building and signing a star player says UNC-Chapel Hill sports administration professor Nels Popp. All those options are pricey and difficult to do.

“We have seen that generally a star player can move the needle on that” Popp says. “But is it a long-term effect or just a short-term effect? That’s one question we to have to ask.”

It’s also debatable whether Newton qualifies as a “superstar” he says.

LeBron James’ return to Cleveland was a huge boost for ticket sales — but James went on to lead the Cavaliers to a championship. That was a superstar in his prime. That’s not exactly what Newton is now Popp says.

Another similar example Popp notes is when baseball star Ken Griffey Jr. spent a decade with the Seattle Mariners before moving on to the Cincinnati Reds and then the Chicago White Sox. When the Mariners brought Griffey back in 2009 they added into his contract a bonus if the team drew in a certain number of fans.

They didn’t. “People got really excited early on but then the excitement waned” Popp says.

It’s unclear Popp says whether the team brought back Newton to win games or to sell tickets.

“Can it be both? For sure” he adds.

Of note: Just three days after the Panthers brought him back at the start of the Arizona Cardinals game last week Newton scored a touchdown in his first play. He scored again on his very next opportunity and the Panthers beat the Cardinals 34-10.

The Panthers haven’t won at home since Week 2 vs. the Saints on Sept. 19 as the Athletic’s Joe Person reported.

“This Sunday is important for us. We need to reclaim Bank of America Stadium” Newton told reporters this week. “We need to bring the pride back to Carolina.”

Newton is giving away 50 tickets to Sunday’s game through his production company Iconic Saga the team and local organizations.

His return already provided a boost for a fan based frustrated with the team’s mediocre performance. In recent weeks Bank of America Stadium has filled with fans from opposing teams indicating season-ticket holders are selling their tickets.

Jenny Schindler’s family has been PSL owners since Day 1. She was in middle school when the NFL awarded Carolina a franchise. Schindler goes to every game these days and says she’s even more excited to go now that Newton is back.

“I feel like it’s given everyone a huge jolt of energy and optimism” she says. “I’m now looking forward to competitive games and not just seeing my family and friends and hoping we can ‘maybe score a touchdown.'”

PSL owner Shane Little of Kannapolis says Newton’s return creates an energy that “hopefully the team can capitalize on.”

“Hopefully Cam Newton can deliver on both the football end of things and the general fan excitement because whatever you can say about Cam he is definitely the most exciting player in the 26-year history of the Panthers” Little said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbnRoZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhbS1uZXd0b24tcy1jb21lYmFjay1mYWxscy1zaG9ydC1idXQtcHJvdmlkZWQtc3BlY2lhbC1tb21lbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cam Newton's comeback falls short but provided special moments,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jYW0tbmV3dG9uLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtcGFudGhlcnMtbG9nby0xOTI0MDc2NDYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cam Newton celebrates on Panthers logo after amazing TD run,"The energy and emotion for Cam Newton’s return to Bank of America Stadium are reaching levels of overload right now. Can it be contained?

Well the Washington Football Team has yet to contain that or Newton and the Panthers offense here in Week 11. For his second score back home the sport’s most prolific rushing quarterback of all-time threw it back and danced into the end zone—just like good old times.

Then after the play Newton made sure to let everyone know whose city and whose team this is . . .

Newton’s electric 24-yard run capped off a five-play 70-yard drive and helped put the Panthers ahead 14-7 at the 5:52 mark of the second quarter.

It also gave Newton his 44th career game of at least one passing and one rushing touchdown—the most of course in NFL history. His 10-yard throw to wideout DJ Moore on Carolina’s opening possession of the afternoon accounted for the first of that pair of touchdowns.

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience."

Answering the unanswered will be the aim of the game for Prof David Baxter when he takes over as dean of the University of Otago Graduate Research School.

Prof Baxter has had a long-standing interest and commitment to graduate research in New Zealand and Northern Ireland and said he was keen to use what he had learned in his new role.

Prior to starting at Otago in 2005 he worked at the University of Ulster where he established a new research graduate school and was heavily involved in the activities of the United Kingdom Council for Graduate Education.

During his 10-year tenure as the dean of Otago’s School of Physiotherapy (2005-15) development of graduate research activities was also a key element of the school’s strategy.

He continues to work at the School of Physiotherapy and said he was ‘‘absolutely delighted’’ to be taking up such an ‘‘exciting’’ role.

‘‘I see this as a critical position for the university and I’m really looking forward to contributing to the further development of graduate research activities at Otago.’’

Prof Baxter will start in the role in April next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Once-mighty conglomerates have been shrinking for decades and last week ""one of the biggest survivors waved the surrender flag"" said David Nicklaus at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. In spinning off its medical and energy businesses General Electric was dismantling an empire that had loomed over U.S. business since 1892. Shortly after Toshiba based in ""conglomerate-loving Japan"" and Johnson & Johnson said they were splitting up their sprawling entities too. These economies of scale make sense ""when buying office supplies or accounting services but their layers of bureaucracy"" come with a cost. Some companies still cling to this model like 3M which ""makes 60000 products ranging from Scotch tape to medical software."" Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been ""a longtime investor darling"" but its portfolio includes ""an electric utility a railroad insurance and chocolate."" The Buffett-GE model ""was all the rage in corporate boardrooms."" Now it's ancient history.

We hear conglomerates are dead every few years said Brooke Masters at the Financial Times. That's because the history of conglomerates is cyclical. First giants — ITT and Tyco are examples — grow by acquisition then they come apart. After it ""becomes conventional wisdom that conglomerates need to be broken up we end up with companies so specialized that somebody decides there is merit"" in being all-encompassing and the cycle starts again. Resist the temptation to make too much out of GE's demise said Brooke Sutherland at Bloomberg. That's ""a cautionary tale"" about how ""hodgepodge omnidirectional growth and size for size's sake"" can go terribly wrong. But a ""key tenet of the modern conglomerate is continuous reinvention and a willingness to pivot."" That philosophy has benefited other ""reimagined conglomerates"" such as Honeywell and Roper Technologies.

What kills conglomerates is ""the myth that great management can always work miracles"" said Jason Zweig at The Wall Street Journal. ITT first ""popularized the idea that hundreds of elite managers"" could provide expertise on a wide range of subjects. GE under iconic CEO Jack Welch elevated ""management to a kind of science"" with its ""leadership institute"" in New York's Hudson Valley. But ""by the early 2000s the company was spending $1 billion a year on training."" GE became complacent in the belief that ""management technology would always save"" it.

A new incarnation of the model seems alive and well said Matthew Boyle at Bloomberg. The giants of yesterday have been replaced by what University of Michigan business professor Jerry Davis calls ""neo-conglomerates"" such as Amazon which sells everything from groceries to corporate cloud-computing services. This ""new breed fueled by coders and cheap capital now command the same awe and respect in management and investor circles as Welch's GE did in the 1980s."" What they do better than GE is ""skate quickly to where the profit is whether that's automation social commerce sustainability or even the much-hyped metaverse.""

Then on Monday I flew back to San Francisco for the 49ers-Los Angeles Rams game as well as taking a WIG call.

On Tuesday I participated in the Berkshire Hathaway Energy call and monthly virtual CEO leadership meeting. I also attended the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame announcement of the 2021 inductees where Intero Real Estate Services was a sponsor for the event.

On Wednesday I traveled to Palm Springs to attend the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties Arizona Properties and California Properties yearly management retreat with CEO Mark Stark. I held a fireside chat with Mark then took part virtually in the monthly HomeServices of America corporate team gathering.

Today I was a guest speaker at the HomeServices Marketing Conference then had a photoshoot and interview with Andrew Flachner of RealScout. Between today and tomorrow I’ll participate in three succession planning calls. Tomorrow I’m looking forward to being a guest speaker on the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Fox & Roach REALTORS® Friday Forum.

It’s been a productive week and there’s one word that characterizes how I’ve been feeling especially as we lead up to Thanksgiving: grateful.

I’m grateful to my team for my health for my family and for all of the blessings in my life that allow me to wake up and look forward to each new day. Adding gratitude to your life can change your attitude and identifying what you’re grateful for helps you create a positive mindset.

My mentor Jim Rohn once said “Learning the art of expressing gratitude will force you to focus on the positive.”

And it’s true. Another way you can reset your mindset for optimism is by giving back and being kind. Exercising kindness toward others no matter how small the act will always enrich your mindset. As you go about your day think about ways you can enhance someone else’s existence through a small act of kindness. The “helper’s high” you’ll receive by doing something nice for another person will help you build a positive mindset.

Did you know humans are hard-wired to have positive responses to giving back? After we complete a kind act our brain’s pleasure sensors are activated and our bodies release feel-good endorphins which motivates us to find that “helper’s high” through giving back yet again. Over time giving back can even reduce our overall stress levels.

There are so many incredible examples of givers from within our organization but today on the precipice of Thanksgiving week I wanted to highlight two very special people whose selfless gifts and incredible acts of kindness can inspire us all.

In July it was announced that Eddie Oberoi leader of the top-performing Eddie Oberoi Team at the Los Altos office of Intero Real Estate Services was pledging $100000 to the Intero Foundation. Established in 2002 the Intero Foundation is a non-profit organization that has granted more than $6 million to benefit children and seniors throughout the Bay Area and beyond.

With Eddie’s generous gift the organization will be able to help even more children and the elderly in the areas of education health services and personal development. I couldn’t be prouder to know Eddie and watch the growth of not only his business but also his desire to constantly give back to the community he serves. Watch Eddie talk about the donation on Intero LIVE! here.

And just today Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties released the extraordinary news that Montecito REALTOR® resident and community champion Cristal Clarke has donated $100000 to the Santa Barbara chapter of The Charitable Foundation a nonprofit run by the agents and employees of California Properties. When asked Cristal said she chose The Charitable Foundation because it provides to local organizations that benefit the health education community and environment of Santa Barbara County.

To date this is the largest donation ever made to The Charitable Foundation. Cristal is the No. 1 individual agent worldwide for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices—and No.1 in our hearts. Her generosity is boundless and did not start nor will it end with this amazing gift. She has been an advocate for local small businesses in and around her Montecito community ever since the pandemic began.

The timing of Cristal’s $100000 donation allows The Charitable Foundation to begin its grant-distribution process during the holiday season. Cristal says it was her way to thank the local business owners and people who made her community shine.

So what’s the message? True happiness is not something to achieve it is something to bring out in ourselves and in others. We all have the potential for happiness for positivity for gratitude for a winning mindset. Everything is within us. Fulfilment doesn’t come from more wealth more talent more connections—it comes from you. And if we can trust that happiness already exists it then becomes our duty to share our happiness with others. From small acts of kindness to great acts like Eddie and Cristal exemplified when we give back we give happiness and as we enter the start of the holiday season this altruistic spirit is the very best way to spread joy to one and all.

Taking part in the streaming forum on Wednesday Nov. 17 were Lithium Valley Commission members and Assembly member Eduardo Garcia D-Coachella whose legislation Assembly Bill 1657 created the commission.

“The intention of this meeting is to provide the opportunity to learn about opportunities and challenges to lithium development from geothermal brine in the Salton Sea region for the community to share their thoughts and ask questions about what matters most to them and their communities” said Silvia Paz chair of the Lithium Valley Commission during the opening of the forum.

The commission was developed as a response to geothermal and lithium-extraction companies that are set to begin building pilot projects to mine the metal widely used in electronics and rechargeable batteries from geothermal brine drawn from the earth to produce energy. The two active projects in development are from Controlled Thermal Resources which announced in a press release on Monday Nov. 15 that it had started to drill one of two investigatory wells as part of its Hell’s Kitchen geothermal and mineral plant. The other company is EnergySource LLC which already runs the Hudson Ranch II geothermal plant at the Salton Sea resource area.

Supporters of direct lithium extraction claim that the process of removing the lithium through the geothermal brine is the safest least environmentally impactful method of acquiring this valuable resource. Other types of commercial lithium-extraction methods like hard-rock mining and solar evaporation rely on heavy chemicals and huge evaporation ponds that create a tremendous amount of waste and pollution in the communities they are located and use vast amounts of water.

Pollution and public health were the focal point of many of the questions that came out of the forum. Time and again members of the community questioned whether this new system of collecting lithium will have any effect on pollution or public health in the area around the Salton Sea which already struggles with those issues due to the sea’s receding shoreline and emissive dust.

“What I keep hearing not just from the developers but from researchers is that when you’re extracting lithium directly in this closed-loop process that you are not adding contaminants to anything else. Now if I hear something else I’ll be the first one as many other commissioners probably right to say to raise the red flag” said Paz in response to one such question explaining that she lives nine miles from the Salton Sea so this issue affects her and her family directly.

Direct lithium extraction relies on the same superheated water that geothermal plants use to produce energy which has been super-heated and pushed through rock formations dissolving and absorbing the lithium without the need for harsh chemicals. Lithium extractors will use ion exchange resins acting as a chemical sieve to selectively collect only lithium which is then recovered from the sieve purified and concentrated for use.

Once the lithium has been removed from the brine it is taken and injected directly back into the aquifer source that it was pumped out of to begin with never coming into contact with groundwater or soil to contaminate them.

Community members also heavily questioned whether the jobs that the companies’ claim will be developed because of their plants will go to the local residents.

Jonathan Weisgall vice president for Legislative and Regulatory Affairs for Berkshire Hathaway Energy who represents the lithium-extraction industry within the commission answered those question by not only assuring that the jobs are meant for local residents but also by sharing what steps are being taken to prepare the Imperial Valley workforce in order to be successful in those jobs.

“I know from our company’s perspective it is very much in our interest to hire locally as much as we can. And to do that we have to work on the education not just at the four-year college SDSU level not just at IVC with community college but even in high school. And we have every intention of doing that. And welcome input from the community at any time as to how to how to make that happen” Weisgall said.

The commission is made of experts with a wide variety of backgrounds including the Chair Silvia Paz of Alianza Coachella Valley Vice Chair Ryan E. Kelley of the Imperial County Board of Supervisors Steve Castaneda of the Sweetwater Authority Rod Colwell of Controlled Thermal Resources Roderic Dolega of Ford Electric Vehicles Purchasing Miranda Flores of the California Natural Resources Agency Martha Guzman Aceves of the California Public Utilities Commission James C. Hanks of the Imperial Irrigation District Arthur Lopez of the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians Luis Olmedo of Comite Civico Del Valle Inc. Frank Ruiz of the Audubon California’s Salton Sea Program Manfred Scott of the Quechan Indian Tribe Tom Soto of the Diverse Communities Impact Fund and Weisgall.

“Those of you who are on the Lithium Valley Commission have been appointed and empowered to help us make this decision to make some recommendations on how this may or may not work in the interests of those who live in and around the Salton Sea the Imperial County the Riverside County the State of California and quite candidly for our country and the entire world” Assembly member Garcia said at the start of the forum. “All eyes are on us in terms of what we decide to do here. And what’s important to me is that the Commission use its power to engage the community every step of the way.”

The Lithium Valley Commission was created out of AB 1657 which instructed the California Energy Commission to create the commission with 14 members appointed by a combination of the CEC other state agencies Assembly speaker and Senate Committee and is charged with the creation of a report that reviews investigates and analyzes issues and potential incentives regarding lithium extraction and use in California which is due to be submitted on or before Oct. 1 2022.

Gooch will take a three-stroke lead into the final round of the RSM Classic following a third-round 67 and he explained that although he knows there will be plenty of stress on Sunday it won’t compare to his experience in 2016 during the second stage of Q-School.

It's a big hunk of poultry that you only cook once a year so taking the care to properly store thaw and cook the big bird in time for a glorious entrance to the harvest table can be tricky. While it may not be as easy to control for seasonings cooking times and temperatures there is one easy way to start off your Thanksgiving feast preparation on the right foot: Buy the best bird.

To help you decide which turkey to buy for this Thanksgiving we bought roasted and tasted five brand-name frozen turkeys from the supermarket. We had taste testers judge the birds based on tenderness texture and flavor to determine a winner. (Also don't miss We Taste-Tasted 5 Stuffing Mixes & This Is the Best.)

Here's how we did it

We visited three local grocery stores—Food Lion Harris Teeter and Whole Foods—to source our big birds. They were all frozen and ranged in the 12–14-pound range. Two of the birds were not injected or didn't have any added salt while the other three were already brined in the bag.

For how we cooked the turkey we kept it super simple to remove a lot of variables that could possibly skew results. We went with a recipe that includes ""spatchcocking"" the bird which is just cutting out the spine flipping the bird over and pressing down on the breastbone until it cracks allowing you the flatten it out on a roasting tray. This allows for quicker cooking and a more even roast because the cool and moist inner cavity is no longer skewing how fast or slow certain parts (legs versus breast) get cooked to the proper temperature.

We dried the bird applied a tablespoon of canola oil to each side along with two tablespoons of freshly ground black pepper and for the turkeys that weren't brined one tablespoon of Kosher salt.

Our oven was set to 450 degrees and after an hour of cooking a Bluetooth meat thermometer was stuck deep into the breast and set with a 150-degree alarm. Once that went off—most of them only took about an hour and a half to cook—the legs were then checked to make sure they hit the 165-degree mark. When all temps were OK the bird was taken out and left to rest for 5 minutes before carving and taste testing.

Each taste tester was given skin-on breast meat along with a chunk of leg and thigh meat. They were tasked with studying the meat for tenderness texture and flavor and then ranked each according to a one-to-five scale and they wrote down comments. Those results were then calculated and edited and created the Eat This Not That! definitive holiday ranking of Thanksgiving turkeys. Here are the results listed from worst to best.

Disclaimer: Since each turkey took time to thaw and store plus would require five identical ovens to roast at the same time they were cooked over a two-week period with some taste tasters who were around to be able to give their opinions on every bird. And they all tasted very similar as would be expected so either would be a good choice for a successful Thanksgiving feast—and all skin was crispy and delicious thanks to the spatchcock method.

Butterball

Size: 12.61 lbs

Additives: Up to 8% of a solution of water salt spices and natural flavor.

Tenderness: Since these birds are pretty heavily injected the meat ended up to be very tender and moist almost too watery for the breast meat.

Texture: The breast meat was the worst texture of the bunch with a mealy kind of crumbly mouthfeel. We speculated that was possibly because of the heavier brine and longer time sitting in a warehouse frozen.

Flavor: The flavor was decent with almost too-salty taste but it wasn't too overpowering as there was enough sugar in it to balance it out. We also didn't note much flavor from ""spices.""

Verdict: If you failed to secure a turkey before Thanksgiving and this is all that's left it's a fine choice but it's not going to bring rave reviews.

How To Rescue A Dry Thanksgiving Turkey

Shady Brook Farms

Size: 12.92 lbs

Additives: Approximately 9.5% of a solution of turkey broth salt sugar and natural flavoring.

Tenderness: Another plumped-up bird this one didn't fail to bring a moist and tender bite. It was easy to cut the breast meat with a fork and the thigh meat was also tender and easy to eat.

Texture: Again because of the amount of brining/basting done at the factory the texture was on the less firm side. The protein's structure was possibly more compromised by the extra liquid in the meat being frozen for longer.

Flavor: Since it had the highest solution percentage out of the bunch the flavor was a bit on the salty side. But overall it had a solid turkey-like taste with plenty of brothy and sweet notes.

Verdict: This one was pumped full of brine and additives so it had a nice flavor but the flesh didn't have that nice mouthfeel; therefore it's a decent bird but not a standout.

The easy way to make healthier comfort foods.

Harris Teeter Brand

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Size: 12.80 lbs

Additives: Up to 8% of a solution of turkey broth salt sodium phosphate sugar and natural flavoring.

Tenderness: This store-brand was also pretty plumped up and so the meat was also tender and pretty delicious possibly because of the sodium phosphate which is added to increase moisture and intensify flavors. The FDA says that additive is recognized as generally safe.

Texture: The texture was much better in this bird with a firmer and more poultry-like mouthfeel without much mealy-ness.

Flavor: Really nice flavor for a store-brand bird with a nice round saltiness and sweeter notes than the other turkeys.

Verdict: A great choice and certain Thanksgiving-crowd pleaser as long as you (and your guests) don't mind the addition of sodium phosphate.

This Popular Thanksgiving Food Has Skyrocketed in Price

Nature's Rancher

Size: 13.15 lbs

Additives: Non-injected. Less than 5% of retained water.

Tenderness: Without the brine it's easier to get a drier bite when closer to the skin but with the spatchcock method it was still nice and tender on deeper portions.

Texture: Mouthfeel was good with plenty of real turkey-like taste and more fibrous but welcome and fleshy bite.

Flavor: Flavor was good with traditional turkey meat notes of sweetness saltiness and umami. Though not organic you could tell that since there were no additives that it was a more natural-tasting bird.

Verdict: If you don't want to spend the extra money for an organic bird which can range from $3.99 a pound or more this is a great choice with good flavor. Just do your own home brine before cooking to amp up the moistness.

Organic Prairie

Size: 13.64 lbs

Additives: None

Tenderness: Though again the meat was not quite as moist as the injected birds the firmer and more natural bite made it the big hit with taste testers. You could still manage to cut the breast meat with a fork you just had to push a little more.

Texture: No mealy-ness at all. Mouthfeel was excellent without being tough and gave a nice chew.

Flavor: If you've ever had a heritage or wild turkey this comes close to that true slightly gamey flavor. Lots of balanced notes of sweetness saltiness and umami made it the winner.

Verdict: With no additives of any kind and being USDA certified organic the only thing this bird fell a little short on was moisture. But that's easy enough to remedy with a home brine and then you get the ultimate tender turkey that also tastes like real meat and not mush.

Pressure Talor Gooch says is Best Buy.

And it wouldn’t be Sunday he said Saturday night after finishing the third round of the RSM Classic with a three-shot lead. The 30-year-old was 18 holes from his first PGA Tour victory but the nerves ahead had nothing on the thought of wearing a name tag for a living.

“I always go back to Q-School” he said. “It’s funny it’s like when this feels [like] pressure I just think back to I was playing TPC Craig Ranch my third time of going through Q-School in 2016 and I was in second stage at TPC Craig Ranch. I was on the number going to the third round and I didn’t have any more money and I was three-over through four walking off the par-3 and I thought to myself I don’t know why this came up but Best Buy I’m going to have to go work at Best Buy; I’m going to have to go do something to make a few bucks unless you like get it together.

“Fortunately I got it together and I got through second stage but I always fall back on Q-School.”

Gooch didn’t blink then. And he opened eyes on Sunday. Gooch birdied six holes on the Seaside Course at the Sea Island Resort and bogeyed none for a six-under 64 a 22-under total and a three-shot win his first in five seasons on the PGA Tour. Mackenzie Hughes after a 62 finished second and Sebastian Munoz was third.

Locking in the win. 🔒@TalorGooch finished on a streak of 26 consecutive holes without a bogey. pic.twitter.com/GfGvHR4Mxy — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) November 21 2021

Gooch had been trending toward this. Since the start of the 2021-22 Tour season in September he had four top 15 finishes — and two top fives — in five events and he opened the RSM with rounds of 64 65 and 67. On Sunday his lead had dropped to two at one point only for him to birdie four of his first six holes on the back nine to pull away.

On the 426-yard par-4 10th Gooch hit his approach to 5 feet and he birdied. On the 420-yard par-4 11th Gooch hit his approach to 9 feet and he birdied. On the 414-yard par-4 13th Gooch rolled in a 16-foot putt and birdied. And on the 559-yard par-5 15th after hitting his second shot to 15 feet he birdied again and the event was over if it hadn’t been already.

“Obviously I was playing really well this week and I was playing really well today so when you’re playing like that the game is coming easy and the stress levels go down” Gooch said on Golf Channel afterward. “But I was pumped today the few times where things could have taken a different turn and I was able to use those past experiences and step up and execute.”

The big takeaway

Gooch has enough game to where this first win could snowball. Stay tuned.

— Gooch pars the 470-yard par-4 18th and he pumps his fist after his three-shot win his first on the PGA Tour.

The final word

“He’s shown a good mental toughness to me as well this weekend. A lot of people with a lot of game but not everybody has exactly what it takes to be able to grab a tournament by the scruff of the neck like he has done today.” — analyst Trevor Immelman on the Golf Channel broadcast on Gooch.

The company said its customers include leading fintechs in Europe and North America providing trading investing and lending services.

Sedric explained that spending on compliance by fintechs increased by more than 200% over the past two years yet consumer complaints against companies in the sector increased by almost 180% in the first half of 2021 compared to the year prior. The number one compliance challenge for financial services firms is keeping up with regulatory change resulting in bottlenecks and inhibiting growth.

“The cost and reputational damage from non-compliance is a top risk for today’s growing fintech industry” said Nir Laznik Co-founder and CEO at Sedric. “Regulators around the world are racing to add more rules to protect customers requiring continuous monitoring and real-time implementation for fintechs to navigate and grow.”

But in an astonishing turnaround during which they got the most out of the biting wind they outscored their opponents by fourteen points to three to shatter Bruff's hopes of recapturing the title last won just four years ago on a 0-16 to 0-11 scoreline.

A masterly performance by man-of-the-match Gavin O'Loughlin led the way as his eight strikes including three from open play kept the pressure on the Stars every time they tried to respond.

But it was a team performance that got the Ballyhoura men over the line once they neutered Bruff's dominance in midfield to feed enough ball to their front men.

Although O'Loughlin's free opened the scoring once Bruff settled they completely dominated the opening quarter to lead 0-6 to 0-1 by the water break.

However a change in the Rockies' formation three minutes before the break resulted in O'Loughlin's free and Ciarán

Considine narrowing the gap to 0-8 to 0-4 by the interval.

With the wind now behind them the Kilfinane club kept up the momentum with O'Loughlin grabbing the equaliser and by the second water-break they led 0-11 to 0-9. Bruff tried to respond but the Blackrock defence shut them out and once Considine stretched the margin to four they were forced to chase the goal that never looked like coming.

Rockland vs. Abington Rivalry Round Two

Already one of the biggest regular-season rivalries in the area it’s hard to imagine many matchups that could top the anticipation of Rockland and Abington meeting in a Super Bowl.

The Bulldogs (9-1) handed the Green Wave (10-1) their only loss of the season on Oct. 8 17-7. That was Jim Kelliher's 500th game as the head coach at Abington a party that was spoiled by Rockland.

“To have the two best teams in Division 6 be a mile away is awesome” said Rockland coach Nick Liquori. “It’s going to make for good storylines for (the media) and everybody else.”

Setting up that game wasn’t an easy task as Rockland had its hands full with No. 8 Blackstone Valley Tech. The Beavers (6-3) were looking for their second consecutive upset after taking out top-seeded Stoneham last week.

“They’re an (I-formation) team and they came hauling butt at us and dared us to stop them” said Liquori. “It was almost like playing ourselves in a way. We did a good job of bend don’t break.""

BVT threw everything it had at Rockland including multiple trick plays and fake punts.

PJ Celestino who was 6-of-9 passing for 147 yards threw the winning touchdown pass to Logan Rogers (14 yards) in the fourth quarter.

Rockland’s defense had to fend off two late drives from BVT. The first drive ended when Rockland stopped a pass on a fake punt just short of the first down. Jacob Coulstring sealed the win with a late interception.

“We heard they run these trick plays” said Liquori. “It's kind of hard to prepare for all the different types of trick plays but they did a really good job of executing them when they had to.”

Rockland received a strong performance from its defensive front. Liquori said Leary Costa Brett Armstrong Liam Wallace Jaylen Johnson Austin Clarke and Gabe Pinheiro all played well up front.

“I can’t say enough about that defensive side of the ball” said Liquori.

The Beavers' second TD came when they fumbled the ball on offense into the end zone and a lineman recovered it.

Junior Lucas Leander had a big day for Rockland. He turned four receptions into 118 yards including a 63-yard TD. He also had 52 yards rushing.

“They’re quite the combination” Liquori said of Leander and Coulstring in the backfield. “Lucas just gives us that change of speed. Probably just as tough as Couly but doesn’t get the recognition because he’s on that outside. He has that threat to be able to go out and be a wide receiver.”

Celestino and Michael Moriarty both played well at quarterback. Coulstring put Rockland up 7-0 in the first quarter.

“Oh man it’s something you dream of as a coach something you want to do” Liquori a RHS graduate said of leading the Bulldogs to Gillette Stadium for the state final. “It does a lot for the kids the coaches the town. Just seeing the people that were there this afternoon was awesome and obviously the end result was fantastic.”

Randolph's run continues

During a playoff run in which Randolph prevailed in gritty low-scoring games the 10th-seeded Blue Devils tacked on another by defeating No. 11 Oxford 8-6.

“We did it” said Randolph coach Jonathan Marshall. “One more to go.”

Against Oxford senior Kairis Codio had an impressive showing defensively and pitched in on offense with a key block down the stretch that sealed the win. Senior kicker Shaquan Rush starred on special teams by saving the Blue Devils every inch of field position.

“Defense carried the day” said Marshall whose team has allowed a combined 25 points in three games this postseason.

Senior running back Sebastian Jouissance scored the team’s lone touchdown of the game on a direct snap rush with sophomore Mahkhi Barnes adding the two-point conversion.

Setting up the state title game Randolph (7-4) and Hull (9-2) – two South Shore League surprises -- already faced off earlier in the regular season. The Pirates won 26-6 though the Blue Devils were short-handed at the time. A lot has changed since then as both teams will flaunt battle-tested playoff runs in the elevated rematch.

Further reports have indicated that Aaron Singerman and PJ Braun have pleaded guilty as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors. Singerman and Braun pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute substances and to selling unapproved new drugs. Blackstone Labs LLC has also pleaded guilty to these same charge as well as one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to committing mail and wire fraud.

In more direct terms this report is indicating that in pleading guilty Aaron Singerman and PJ Braun have admitted to misleading customers through Blackstone Labs by marketing and selling controlled substances that were not approved by the FDA as dietary supplements. Blackstone Labs has also made these admissions while also pleading guilty to additional charges as mentioned above.

Not only were the substances marketed and sold as dietary supplements. According to the DOJ report the substances were falsely represented as made in “FDA approved” facilities when that was not the case. FDA approved facilities are regulated to standards set by the FDA. Controlled substances of course would not be produced from such facilities.

The news of this plea deal comes long after first reports were revealed about the federal charges made against Aaron Singerman and PJ Braun. Reported in March of 2019 this case seemed to fade from public view until now with this reported plea deal. Singerman’s current supplement company RedCon1 is one of the biggest supplement brands in the bodybuilding industry today. Most notably Aaron Singerman pulled out RedCon1 from sponsoring the Arnold Classic 2021 earlier this year due to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s comments about American citizens’ freedom.

The original federal indictments were based on a raid of Blackstone Labs LLC after a warrant was issued in 2017. Authorities searched the premises of Blackstone Labs and the companies manufacturing partner Ventech Labs. Based on evidence found during the raid the DOJ announced a 14 count grand jury indictment against Singerman Braun and Blackstone Labs LLC.

Aaron Singerman and PJ Braun’s past statements on the Blackstone Labs LLC raid

Generation Iron has been following the story and interviewed PJ Braun multiple times. Generation Iron produced an original series on the life of the bodybuilding business entrepreneur. In one episode of the series Braun detailed the experience of being raided by the federal government in 2017. You can watch that episode below:

Aaron Singerman has also spoken with Generation Iron in previous GI Exclusive interviews. In one segment he details his past relationship with PJ Braun and explains their fall out after the Blackstone Labs LLC raid in 2017. You can also watch that video below right here:

Aaron Singerman and PJ Braun sentencing and forfeiture

As part of the plea deal all three defendants have agreed to forfeit proceed for the above mentioned crimes. Aaron Singerman has agreed to forfeit $2.9 million. PJ Braun has agreed to forfeit $3 million as well as an additional $233000 of certified funds under a warrant from a bank account under Blackstone Labs. Blackstone Labs LLC has agreed to forfeit $1 million. In addition to this both Aaron Singerman and PJ Braun could face up a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison.

Aaron Singerman’s current supplement company RedCon1 has attempted to distance itself from the allegations and the newly announced plea agreement. The company claimed in an email statement:

“Redcon1 was founded after the conduct central to the Blackstone case concluded and we had no involvement in the matters raised in that case.”

Speaking with Generation Iron Blackstone Labs majority owner Jared Wheat commented:

“Blackstone Labs is doing great and it has been under new ownership since 2017. All products are 100% compliant to the law. We are doing great as a company and will continue to do great moving forward.”

Aaron Singerman and PJ Braun are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 27 2022 in Ft. Lauderdale before U.S. District Judge William P. Dimitrouleas of the Southern District of Florida. Judge Dimitrouleas will determine the sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Nov. 20 2021 © Leeham News: Flying Blind The 737 MAX Tragedy and the Fall of Boeing is the sad story of how The Boeing Co. once renowned for its engineering prowess descended into the depths of crisis with its most profitable airplane.

Authored by Bloomberg news reporter Peter Robison much of the story is well known on the proverbial 35000-foot level. Congressional hearings investigative reporting crash coverage of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 310 provided plenty of grist for the mill.

Robison delves deeper into the crisis that encompassed Boeing from March 2019 with the ET 310 crash from which it won’t recover for years. I point to the Ethiopian crash as the start of the crisis because for the most part the Lion Air crash was viewed as just another crash—until Ethiopian’s tragedy made it clear there was something deadly wrong with the 737 MAX.

The fall of Boeing

The fall of Boeing however was rooted in events long before the MAX accidents. Many within Boeing complained for years that the 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp. (MDC) was the beginning of the long descent. I agree and Robison takes a dive into this merger and the cost-cutting philosophy that came with it. Critics and many Boeing employees complain the MDC merged with Boeing using Boeing’s money. (It was actually a stock deal not in cash.) Further they complain the McDonnell Douglas philosophy overwhelmed the Boeing engineering prowess.

But the descent doesn’t stop there. It continued with the “GE” philosophy of maximizing shareholder value at the expense of developing new airplanes—and with the two MAX crashes allegations that shareholder value also was at the expense of safety.

Robison also takes a detailed look at the GE philosophy and how it infected Boeing.

Yet as one gets deep into the book for all the sordid news to come out during the two years since the Lion Air crash in some ways which was only the tip of the iceberg. Only one person is being held accountable by authorities for Boeing’s misdeeds: mid-level pilot Mark Forkner whose impertinent emails deriding the Federal Aviation Administration and others landed him at the center of the scandal. Forkner was the only Boeing official indicted. His attorney is a high-powered high-profile guy named David Gerger. Forkner’s salary at Boeing and later as a pilot for Southwest Airlines (he no longer works here either) couldn’t possibly afford Gerger. Robison reports that Boeing is paying Gerger’s legal fees. For his part Gerger says Forkner is a scapegoat.

Robison’s story is revealing despite all the other information investigations and hearings that are already in the public domain.

Compatible books

When Robison began his work I was already well into writing my book Air Wars The Global Combat Between Airbus and Boeing. Air Wars covers 35 years of the sales marketing and product strategy battles between the Big Two. I had to delay the book to include a chapter on the MAX tragedies and the COVID-19 impact but the two books take different approaches and are compatible. I go into more detail about the development of the Airbus A320neo which maneuvered Boeing into re-engining the 737 to become the MAX. Air Wars also has more detail about the debate within Boeing about the battle whether to re-engine the 737 or develop an entirely new airplane. Flying Blind goes deeper into the McDonnell Douglas influence and discusses the GE philosophy more than Air Wars.

There is a third book Fall from the Skies¸ The Descent of Boeing and the 737 MAX and still other books about the MAX crisis which I’ve not read. Robison’s book is a must-read. And of course I would say the same about Air Wars which is rated 4.5 stars by Amazon reviewers.

SEATTLE — The litany of manufacturing defects on the 787 Dreamliner is expanding as Boeing engineers take apart planes and discover new or more widespread issues an Federal Aviation Administration internal memo indicates.

The FAA memo which was circulated internally Monday and reviewed by the Seattle Times points to new concerns about a previously unreported defect caused by contamination of the carbon fiber composite material during fabrication of the large structures that make up the 787′s wing fuselage and tail.

The memo also adds detail about the small out-of-tolerance gaps that have been discovered throughout the airplane structure: at the joins of the large fuselage sections at a forward pressure bulkhead and in the structure surrounding the passenger and cargo doors.

The FAA memo which lists safety conditions affecting airplanes currently in service worldwide states that these tiny gap defects are thought to be present in more than 1000 Dreamliners. These are not considered an immediate safety concern but could cause premature aging of the airframe.

“We’re looking at the undelivered airplanes nose to tail and we have found areas where the manufacturing does not conform to the engineering specifications” a Boeing spokesperson said Friday. “None of these issues is an immediate safety-of-flight issue.”

Those planes currently in service can be inspected and reworked later during routine maintenance the spokesperson said.

However complicating the process the FAA memo states that Boeing doesn’t have the detailed configuration data on each plane to know which may have the defects.

It’s unclear if coming up with fixes that will satisfy the FAA will further delay resumption of 787 deliveries into next year.

Such a delay could increase the total cost to get the 787 program back on track above Boeing’s previous $1 billion estimate and would risk an accounting write-off in the fourth quarter.

Contamination of composite material

The internal FAA memo relates how early this year Boeing reported to the FAA that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan — which builds the jet’s carbon composite wings — had discovered contamination of the composite material during fabrication that could potentially weaken the epoxy bonding that gives the structure its strength.

In the fabrication process for composites carbon fiber tape impregnated with epoxy resin is laid on a mold then hardened in a high-pressure oven called an autoclave.

Bags are placed around the composite material to create a vacuum and a thin sheet may be placed between the composites and the mold to facilitate release when it comes out of the autoclave. The contamination occurred because some of the bagging and release materials contained polytetrafluoroethylene — commonly known by the brand name Teflon.

The use of PTFE which left a residue after removal did not comply with Boeing’s manufacturing specifications.

Initial tests conducted by Boeing and reported to the FAA in April showed a positive outcome: although the bond strength was reduced it was still within the design limits.

However the memo includes a new update from late last month in which Boeing told the FAA that the same contamination has now been found at other major suppliers and affects not only the wing but also the fuselage and tail.

In addition further tests of small pieces of the composites now indicated that the strength of the contaminated material in some cases was below the allowed design limits.

Boeing last month suggested to the FAA an approach to evaluating the integrity of the bonds in the affected structures. But the FAA isn’t convinced. It responded that the proposed evaluation method is not approved and not validated by testing.

“The FAA will investigate” the memo states.

Boeing’s communications team said Friday it did not immediately have details on the contamination issue and could not comment on that specific issue before press time.

An FAA spokesperson said “We don’t comment on ongoing discussions with manufacturers.”

Fixing tiny gaps at the airplane doors

The FAA memo also highlights the discovery of small gaps in the structure surrounding the passenger and cargo doors in the aft fuselage section built by Leonardo in Italy.

This is another instance of the tiny gaps that have been discovered in the airplane structure during final assembly previously found at the major fuselage section joins and at the forward pressure bulkhead a dome-shaped structural barrier behind the plane’s nose that is crucial to maintaining air pressure within the cockpit and passenger cabin.

Like those previous instances the gaps in the structure around the aft fuselage doors result from waviness in the composite material at the joins.

The FAA notes that these discrepancies between the manufactured structure and the engineering specification are the result not of bad workmanship by mechanics but of imprecision in the robotic equipment used to fabricate the airplane’s structures.

Such gaps which may occur in metal airplanes too are typically filled with small pieces of material called shims during assembly. But somehow the gaps were missed during the building of the airplane sections by Boeing suppliers.

The lack of shims can cause the skin fasteners to pull away the FAA said.

The FAA memo notes that Leonardo relies on mechanics to inspect their own work when they assemble the structures with limited or no oversight by quality inspectors. And it states that the Italian supplier had two formal notices of missed inspections for surface waviness in 2018 and two more in 2020.

In an update this month the FAA said that although Boeing provided a presentation contending that the gaps in the structure around the aft fuselage doors were within engineering requirements it did not provide detailed manufacturing data on the condition of assembly of each plane.

The memo declares the FAA “skeptical.”

As it awaits FAA approval of an inspection method Boeing is going ahead with fixes on some planes.

The Boeing spokesperson said that its engineers had been trying to come up with a standard procedure to remove the doors and inspect the surrounding structure that would satisfy the FAA but that because this was taking too long it had begun reworking some initial planes.

“We have been trying to determine a door removal and inspection approach to see can we plan a nondestructive inspection method to determine what we need to do going forward. That’s taken more time” the spokesperson said. “So we have started rework on the door structure just in the near term to try to be able to move forward with certain airplanes.”

Meanwhile Boeing has paused assembly of the aft fuselages in South Carolina while it sorts out the problem.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report Friday the latest issue with the structure around the door. The Journal cited unidentified people familiar with the plans saying that it is increasingly likely that Boeing won’t resume delivering 787s until “February or March at the earliest.”

1000+ airplanes

The FAA memo reviewed by the Seattle Times also provides updates on another 787 defect problem: the use of an incorrect alloy of titanium in certain fittings installed in fuselage sections made by Leonardo in Italy.

Parts with this incorrect metal included fuselage frame and floor beam fittings and were installed on more than 450 Dreamliners. Boeing identified the most critical installation as the floor-beam-to-fuselage-frame fittings at the side of body area where the wings attach.

The FAA said this could produce an unsafe condition if two or more adjacent fittings had used the wrong titanium alloy. Two aircraft with this immediate safety concern were identified: both All Nippon Airways jets that were parked in Victorville California.

ANA agreed to keep the aircraft grounded while Boeing fixed them. That work was completed as of last month.

Finally the memo notes that the FAA is still evaluating Boeing’s proposal to use statistical sampling to determine which airplanes are affected by the lack of shims and tiny gaps at the joins.

The memo states that more than 1000 airplanes currently flying are affected and that the FAA is concerned about the lack of detailed assembly data on every airplane. Boeing submitted its proposal for inspections and indicated that the process would not require FAA approval.

“We firmly disagree” the memo states. This standoff over what level of inspections is appropriate remains the major stumbling block to Boeing resuming 787 deliveries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vYm9laW5nLTc4Ny1xdWFsaXR5LWlzc3Vlcy1nZXQtYS1uZXctdHdpc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing 787 quality issues get a new twist |,"Care to share?

Boeing’s 787 woes continue as new quality issues with structural composite parts have been found earlier this year. As the Wall Street Journal and The Seattle Times revealed on November 19 the FAA is requesting more evidence that the problems have been solved before the agency will grant permission to restart the production and deliveries. Boeing 787 quality issues get a new twist.

The latest issues were identified early this year an FAA memo says that has been seen by The Seattle Times. Boeing found that the composite wings produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) Aerostructures business had been contaminated with so-called PTFE or polytetrafluorethylene. This could affect the bonding process in an autoclave of composite sub-assemblies and parts inside the wing to the surface.

The memo reportedly explains that while the bonding quality was affected by the contamination Boeing said it was still within design limits. But further investigation by the airframer has learned in October that not only MHI has suffered from PTFE contamination but also the suppliers of fuselage sections (which are Leonardo Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Spirit AeroSystems) and those of the tail section (which includes parts from Leonardo Boeing). The bonding has been found to be below design limits on these segments.

The FAA memo also identifies the problem of gaps around the doors in the Leonardo-produced aft fuselage sections that are too big. Again the regulator is not convinced by the standards of the execution of the work and wants Boeing to come up with a solution that guarantees that the structure around the doors meets the design requirements.

As has been the case with the other quality issues that involve the Dreamliner since 2019 (shimming and skin flatness issues a nose issue and titanium deficiencies) the FAA demands that Boeing comes up with a convincing solution to the problems. Until the agency is satisfied it will not release the 787 for production and deliveries. Spirit AeroSystems said in its Q3-results presentation that it had stopped producing Dreamliner parts (notably the nose section 41) but Boeing itself has now also stopped production until further notice. The problem with inadequate titanium parts from Leonardo’s sub-supplier MPS could affect over 1.000 Dreamliners The Wall Street Journal reports.

Boeing unable to give a schedule on the 787

Last Saturday during a pre-Dubai Airshow media briefing AirInsight asked Boeing’s Ihssane Mounir (Senior Vice President of Commercial Sales and Marketing) when he thinks the airframer is on top of the quality issues and is sure that no new ones emerge. Back then we didn’t know about the latest ones. Mounir replied: “We continue to do meticulous work every step of the way. We are looking at the airplane nose to tail and we are sure that we pressure-test every single aspect. We are working with the FAA on a daily basis making sure they understand the analysis and any rework that is required. We are doing it first to our satisfaction and second to the satisfaction of the regulator. I couldn’t give you a schedule right now. We will get done when we will get done.”

Boeing has over 100 undelivered 787s of which an unspecified number will need rework to solve the earlier shimming issues on the fuselage and forward pressure bulkhead. It isn’t known to what extent the rework now also includes the bonding issues which will be very difficult to do. Boeing said in October that the 787 issues this year will result in some $1.0 billion in abnormal costs.

Related Articles Local News | Top 20 Boston lawsuit payouts since 2016

Since the start of 2016 the city will have paid out at least $18.4 million in more than 300 settlements and judgments to close out suits according to data obtained by a Herald records request.

This calendar year the city is due to pay at least $4.2 million in at least 42 settlements or judgments compared to about $4.6 million in 40 payments in 2020 and just over $798000 in 47 chunks in 2019 per the data.

That includes $6.4 million in 57 pieces in 2018 $1.5 million in 63 in 2017 and just over $946000 in 50 in 2016.

The data that came back this week from the records request which the Herald made in July lists settlements — instances in which both sides agreed to a payout from the city with stipulations — through the end of this August as well as from the same time period a small handful of rarer judgments which come from when a judge jury or other body hears the evidence and orders the city to fork over some cash.

That means the data doesn’t include at the very least one that splashed into the news earlier this week: a $2 million judgment that a jury awarded to Boston Police Lt. Detective Donna Gavin after ruling that her boss Capt. Detective Mark Hayes had discriminated against her because of her gender and then retaliated when she took issue. This money hasn’t been paid yet and the city has until Dec. 1 to file an appeal.

That’s the third-largest sum that the city’s had to shell out in this manner since the start of 2016 according to the data. The largest came in 2018 when Boston agreed to pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit from the family of Kyzr Willis a 7-year-old boy who drowned two years earlier at a city swim camp.

The other seven-figure settlement — which like the Willis settlement was widely reported at the time — came in 2020 to former Boston firefighter Nathalie Fontanez who had sued the city alleging that her colleagues had sexually harassed her and that she’d then been denied a promotion for complaining about it.

Then there are 17 more payouts in the six-figure category including four this year. The fourth-largest sum of the past six years came in February when the city settled for $613919 with Daniel O’Connell’s Sons a Holyoke company that claimed Boston didn’t pay it for extra work the company did at the city’s behest on what would become the Eliot K-8 school in the North End.

Per the settlement agreement the city’s Public Facilities Department also had to hand over an additional $390000 it had been holding back as the contract dispute played out.

Typically the settlement agreements also include both sides waiving any claim to further sue on the matter. They also normally stipulate that the city denies liability or wrongdoing.

Such was the case for another high-dollar amount this year when the city settled with the Regis family in Brighton over allegations that Boston Police had busted into their apartment in the middle of the night shoved down and cuffed several members — only to realize it was the wrong apartment than the number on their “no-knock” search warrant.

The city paid the family of five an even $500000 in March to close out a federal suit and the agreement that the city signed says that Boston “expressly denies any wrongdoing” and that the settlement is simply to avoid the future costs of ongoing litigation. Of the suits since 2016 20 like this are for “Civil Rights – Police” leading to payouts of just under $1.9 million.

Fourteen of the 300-plus payouts over that time come from employment claims and 13 from discrimination claims including allegations of gender and racial discrimination.

Other sizable payouts from this year include more than $196000 going to GF Mackin Construction after the company had claimed it had a contract to do ongoing repairs for the Boston School District — which allegedly stopped paying them for the work.

There’s also a case that was before the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in which the city paid firefighter Sheila Leahy $155000 this year after she had alleged sexual harassment in a suit that dates back years.

Judgments are uncommon as both sides often attempt to settle to avoid paying for years-long lawsuits and trials — and try to eschew the unpredictability of placing the matters in a judge’s or jury’s hands. But in addition to the Gavin one the city lost another this year having to pay Jeffrey McMahon $77000 after the courts found that the Department of Neighborhood Development had shorted him on the assessment of the co-op unit he had via a covenant with the city.

Many of the settlements are insurance claims with big companies taking the city to court in instances in which Boston hasn’t paid them. These generally come from allegations in which a city-owned car hit someone or a person injured themselves on city property.

For example Boston in February agreed to pay a woman $500 after she said someone crashed a city car into her vehicle at the intersection of Blue Hill Avenue and American Legion Highway. Safety Insurance was looking for a bit more than double that but the city wouldn’t fork it over the company claimed and they eventually just settled.

In one odd-seeming case this year the city reports actually gaining one dollar in a case in which someone sued the Zoning Board of Appeals over a denial of some work proposed for a house’s patio. There was no other information about that disposition immediately available.

The city sets aside a few million bucks a year under the assumption that they are going to have to shell out some of it. This fiscal year — this past July through this coming June — the budget includes $5 million for settlements and judgments against the city according to a spokeswoman for Mayor Michelle Wu.

The year-to-year actual total payouts vary widely driven by when the relatively rare big-money settlements or judgments land the data demonstrate.

That equates to 18pc of the overall number of buildings in the borough.

Across the nation only South Holland (33.9pc) Boston (30.8pc) Fenland (25.9pc) and Runnymede (22.1pc) had more in what the Environment Agency calls 'flood zone 3'.

The Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk (BCKLWN) said that when considering plans for new homes it was ""generally allocating development to the lowest-risk areas.""

Almost one in five properties in King's Lynn and West Norfolk are in flood zone 3 (Image: Archant 2018)

Norfolk's other districts had less than 2pc of its properties in the highest-risk zone as follows:

Breckland: 694 (0.8pc)

Broadland: 1271 (1.6pc)

Great Yarmouth: 1072 (1.8pc)

North Norfolk: 1424 (1.7pc)

Norwich: 95 (0.1pc)

South Norfolk: 1458 (1.6pc)

However King's Lynn and West Norfolk's at-risk total has in fact declined since 2018 when 21211 properties (19.7pc) were in flood zone 3.

Warnings have been widespread in recent months over the potential for climate change to cause extreme weather events including flooding on a more frequent basis.

Last winter much of Norfolk was hit by devastating floods over the Christmas period.

Low-lying areas such as the Fens are of course the most susceptible to being submerged.

A spokesman for BCKLWN said the council continually sought to strike a balance between the need for new housing and avoiding flood-risk areas.

They added: ""The council has allocated some two-thirds of its housing requirement to sites in flood zone 1 (less than 0.1pc flooding probability).

""King’s Lynn acts as the sub-regional centre for a large rural catchment area; the town is well-protected and it is recognised that development is needed to aid regeneration.

Flooding at Welney west Norfolk in 2017 (Image: Archant 2017)

""Maintaining the sustainability of communities to the west of the town in flood-risk areas is recognised in planning policy and the lowest-risk areas are identified for housing allocations where needed.

""Following the last major flooding event to substantially affect the borough in 1978 King’s Lynn’s defences were considerably improved and withstood a much higher tidal surge in 2013.""

They also are said to have a higher pain threshold than others. Although there may not be scientific proof of their short fuse according to a recent study there may be some science behind their pain tolerance. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) have shed light as to why those with red hair respond differently to some types of pain than those with different colored hair.

Specialized skin cells called melanocytes are responsible for producing different skin pigmentations and hair colors. Those with red hair – animals and humans alike – have slightly different protein receptors on the surface of their melanocytes. Previous research from MGH shows that when these receptors do not function properly as in redheads it causes decreased pigmentation.

The research team tested a breed of red-haired mice that like humans have melanocytes that lack the properly functioning receptor. Additionally these mice also showed a greater capacity for pain tolerance making them the best candidates for this particular study.

The results indicate an association between the melanocyte receptor (melanocortin 1 receptor) and the hormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC). The absence of melanocortin 1 receptor activity in the red-haired mice prompted their melanocytes to generate less POMC. This results in the splitting of POMC into several hormones one of which increases sensitivity to pain and another that reduces sensitivity to pain.

When these hormones are produced they help to keep the equilibrium between opioid receptors which decrease pain and melanocortin 4 receptors which heighten sensitivity to pain. Reduced concentrations of both hormones in red-haired mice (and thus presumably in humans) should counterbalance each other. However the body creates other substances unrelated to melanocytes that trigger pain receptors. As a result downregulation of melanocyte-related chemicals causes an increased number of opioid impulses which raises the tolerance level for pain.

“These findings describe the mechanistic basis behind earlier evidence suggesting varied pain thresholds in different pigmentation backgrounds” says lead researcher Dr. David E. Fisher of Massachusetts General Hospital in a statement. “Understanding this mechanism provides validation of this earlier evidence and a valuable recognition for medical personnel when caring for patients whose pain sensitivities may vary.”

Scientists have found new methods to influence the body’s normal mechanisms that govern pain such as by developing drugs that block the melanocortin 4 receptors engaged in pain perception. “Our ongoing work is focused on elucidating how additional skin-derived signals regulate pain and opioid signaling” adds co-lead author Dr. Lajos V. Kemény a research fellow in dermatology at MGH. “Understanding these pathways in depth may lead to the identification of novel pain-modulating strategies.”

The pharmaceutical industry appears poised for a record-breaking level of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in 2022. Four emerging trends back up this assertion.

First Pfizer (PFE -0.60%) and Moderna are both flush with cash thanks to their novel coronavirus vaccines. Second Novartis recently banked $21 billion after selling its two decade long position in Roche. Third Amgen AstraZeneca Biogen Bristol Myers Squibb Gilead Sciences Johnson & Johnson Merck Moderna Pfizer and Sanofi are all expected to pursue bolt-on acquisitions next year to flesh out their clinical pipelines and product portfolios. Fourth Novo Nordisk and Roche can both be counted on for at least one small to mid-sized acquisition per year.

Which segment of the pharmaceutical space will see the most business development activity in 2022? If history is any guide promising early stage cancer companies will continue to be a particularly hot area for M&A next year. Cardiff Oncology (CRDF 0.30%) for instance is a small-cap cancer company that comes across as uber-attractive takeover target. Here's a look at upside potential and downside risk associated with this promising biotech stock.

A look at Cardiff's upside potential and downside risk

Cardiff Oncology is a tiny developmental stage cancer company at this point in its life cycle. The star of the show for the company is its Polo-like Kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor ovansertib.

PLK1 inhibition has shown promise in the clinic before with other molecules but the toxicity of these earlier generation drugs kept them from hitting the market. Ovansertib for its part has so far shown a high degree of on-target specificity and low levels of toxicity in early stage trials.

The drug is presently in a basket of early to-mid stage trials for advanced forms of colorectal pancreatic and prostate cancer. Its lead indication is KRAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer which is on track to yield top line data in May of 2022 according to clinicaltrials.gov.

Why is Cardiff on buyout watch heading into this all-important data reveal? Last week the company announced that Pfizer bought a $15 million equity stake in the company and agreed to appoint one of its key executives to Cardiff's Scientific Advisory Board once formed.

What's noteworthy about this partnership is that it appears to be a nearly identical repeat of Pfizer's initial interest in Trillium Therapeutics last year. Specifically Pfizer first took a $25 million equity stake in Trillum and helped the drugmaker form a Scientific Advisory Board. Eleven months later Pfizer decided to buy Trillium for approximately $2.2 billion. Early shareholders in the clinical-stage biotech thus walked away with gains in excess of 4800% in roughly two years' time although the bulk of these gains occurred before Pfizer entered the picture.

Now Cardiff isn't guaranteed to fetch a tender offer from its newfound partner. But if ovansertib hits the mark in advanced colorectal cancer next May Pfizer probably won't hesitate to call the exact same play for Cardiff. Underscoring this point Pfizer also worked the right of first access to the company's clinical data into this deal. That's a strong sign that this smallish equity investment may turn out to be a prelude to a formal buyout offer down the road.

So if all the stars align Cardiff's stock might be gearing up for a Trillium-like run over the next six months.

The main downside risk here is that early stage cancer assets fail more often than not. And Pfizer is in no way obligated to stick around if ovansertib flops. In turn a clinical setback for ovansertib would almost certainly wreck havoc on its share price. Driving this point home this singular drug candidate is essentially the company's entire value proposition at this stage of the game.",,,,,,

Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

The center says any pelican found acting strangely should be reported immediately to local animal control.

More attention to detail especially how guys like to drive and get to the basket and plays they like to make. Just lock in a little more.”

Jaylen Brown echoed those sentiments. “Gotta be more aggressive more ball pressure and just overall more effort” Brown said.

Two days after losing a demoralizing Game 2 at TD Garden on Thursday the Celtics quieted the skeptics by beating the Cavaliers wire-to-wire 106-93 in Game 3.

Game 3 opened with an ultra-aggressive Jayson Tatum scoring in transition off strong drives from behind the arc. He had twelve points in the first quarter (5-of-9 from the field 2-of-4 from 3) and took nearly half of Boston’s shots.

The first half also welcomed a more assertive Holiday. Holiday has only scored more than ten points in two playoff games so far; he had 15 with three assists at halftime.

Brown had an efficient 13 hitting six of his first seven shots.

With Cleveland trying to limit threes with higher pick up points on Boston’s perimeter players the Celtics took advantage driving the ball and running in transition. Through the first 24 minutes they outscored the Cavaliers in the paint 30-18 hitting 55% from the field.

The Celtics then opened the second half on 14-0 run pushing the lead to 23. It was a definitive disciplined stretch with Tatum and Brown attacking the rim and paint touches generating open 3s for Derrick White and Holiday. Cleveland answered with a 9-0 run but after the third Boston stretched the halftime lead from 9 to 15.

The final frame started with six straight points from the Cavaliers: A Darius Garland drive and two easy buckets for Evan Mobley in transition and off an offensive rebound. Boston and Cleveland traded buckets through a slog of a final quarter including two clutch threes from White and Payton Pritchard. With fans clamoring for a gritty win in this postseason Gang Green dug deep. The Jays scored the final 10 of the Celtics 12 points and Boston held Cleveland to fewer than 25 points in the second third and fourth quarter.

Tatum finished the game with a team-high 33 points Brown had 28 and White and Holiday combined for 30 points on 6-of-12 shooting from 3.

It’s no secret: When Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are both shooting well the Celtics are virtually unstoppable.

That fact helped Boston bounce back after being embarrassed at home on Thursday and reclaim the series lead over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night.

Brown secured 28 points alongside Tatum who scored 33 of his own to seal a 106-93 Game 3 victory on the road.

The highest paid player in the NBA in Brown leads the Celtics in scoring this postseason (24.1 points per game). He was a +18 and grabbed nine rebounds but perhaps his 13-of-17 shooting was his most notable statistic in the win.

Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla discussed how Brown’s playoff performances thus far have positively impacted the Celtics through eight games.

“He’s picking and choosing spots really well” Mazzulla said postgame. “Picks and chooses spots picks and chooses matchups picks and chooses shot selection and plays with a sense of poise. … One of the best things he’s doing is even if he scores two three times in a row the next play is the right play. It’s not a play for him it’s a play to make the right one.”

Brown hasn’t always been consistent on both ends of the floor in his career but he seemed to have found his groove in the regular season and has been able to carry it over into the postseason. He averaged 23.0 points in the regular season and owned a 49.9 field goal percentage the highest mark of his eight-year career.

In these playoffs Brown’s field goal percentage stands at 55.6 percent. He’s also averaging 6.8 rebounds and nearly one steal per game which is a testament to the balance he’s found on both ends of the court in 2023-24.

Here’s how it all shakes out.

Despite the folksy stories behind so many whiskey brands many are run by companies with market caps approaching $100 billion. This doesn’t mean brands don’t have histories of their own of course or that those highly marketable histories aren’t based in truth but it does provide some perspective. For the vast majority of America’s favorite whiskey labels the image of a gruff whiskey man toiling away in a rickhouse building the perfect whiskey is in 2021 high fantasy.

Instead they use their billions in capital smartly. The modern macro-whiskey production site is an array of measuring instruments and gauges with computers monitoring everything. To different degrees this is how Jim Beam Heaven Hill Jack Daniel’s Four Roses Buffalo Trace and the rest bring about consistency incremental quality improvements and experimentation. In the aggregate this is excellent for whiskey drinkers.

That said to better understand who’s making what whiskey and how it’s all related one must know who owns who. These are the parent companies of the brands who hold court in the modern whiskey world.

(Note: not every whiskey brand is represented in the images for each respective parent organization. Brands were chosen by popularity. For comprehensive lists visit each company’s brand page.)

Formally founded in 19th century by a French businessman in New Orleans Sazerac is one of the largest privately owned spirits businesses in the world. Its asset sheet is a who’s-who of whiskey mania — Buffalo Trace Weller Blanton’s Pappy (technically a joint venture between the Van Winkle family and Buffalo Trace Distillery) and on and on. Its whiskey holdings aren’t limited to high-profile high-price whiskeys though; the company owns Fireball and Southern Comfort too.

For most whiskey drinkers it’s Buffalo Trace Distillery and the products made under its flag that demand the most respect. The Frankfort Kentucky distillery was previously called the George T. Stagg Distillery and has become home to what is likely the most robust lineup of premium bourbon in the world. The fact that the bourbons made there (and elsewhere in the Sazerac portfolio like at the Barton 1792 Distillery and A. Smith Bowman Distillery) are all near-household names is a testament to Sazerac’s deftness in the art of the acquisition. Starting in 1989 with a handful of former Seagram’s Distillery products (one of which eventually became Fireball one of the best-selling booze SKUs of the 21st century) Sazerac has bought up rebranded repositioned or remade brands into superior versions of their past selves.

Campari Group named after the Italian apéritif that launched the company is one of the less prolific players in the whiskey world but it does own Wild Turkey one of the most iconic brand names in American whiskey.

Campari purchased Wild Turkey and its various sub-brands (Russell’s Reserve American Honey Rare Breed etc.) in 2009 along with its Lawrenceburg Kentucky distillery. As far as impact on the whiskey world Campari Group is a lightweight; but the company’s breadth of brands in nearly every booze category has made it one of the world’s foremost drinks companies.

Debatably the world’s single largest distilling companies Diageo is a corporate behemoth whose highest-profile brands seemingly reflect that. They are the mainstream of the mainstream: Bulleit Crown Royal Johnnie Walker Lagavulin and more (and while obviously not a spirit they also own Guinness).

More than American whiskey Diageo is known for scotch whisky; the brands under the Diageo umbrella also produce more scotch whisky than any other company in the world. After Johnnie Walker the company also owns Oban Talisker Lagavulin and a number of smaller labels and brands exclusive to other parts of the world. And this is all before mentioning the might of Crown Royal the best-selling Canadian whisky which Diageo purchased in the early 2000s for $5 billion (Captain Morgan rum was also part of the deal). When you think Diageo think big.

Beam-Suntory is an American company that makes scotch whisky bourbon whiskey rye whiskey Japanese whisky Irish whiskey Canadian whisky and even Spanish whisky. Beam-Suntory itself is a holding of a Japanese company called Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. which is of course a subsidiary within Suntory Holdings. By volume the company is the third largest distiller in the world (behind Diageo and Pernod Ricard). A lot of that is whiskey.

The North American wing of the company owns Maker’s Mark Knob Creek Booker’s Basil Hayden’s Canadian Club and more. Its list of scotch whisky is slightly shorter but no less gaudy: Laphroaig Bowmore Auchentoshan and more. Then there are the Suntory-produced whiskies which have come to embody both the extreme capabilities of whiskey makers from non-traditional whiskey regions and for some the pinnacle of whiskey hype culture. You’ve got a better chance at seeing a unicorn than finding bottles of Yamazaki Hibiki and Hakushu whiskies at their retail prices. Generally Beam-Suntory is responsible for a serious amount of excellent whiskey.

Along with Sazerac (to a certain extent) Heaven Hill is something of an outlier on this list. It is a privately held family-owned company that is the only Kentucky whiskey maker that remains locally owned. The Shapira family helped found the distillery (with a member of the Beam family no less) and steadily bought out its other founders. Today Max Shapira is the CEO and a number of other Shapiras work within the company.

Though the company has greatly expanded its brand sheet in recent years it’s most known for its collection of fabled whiskeys; award winners like Elijah Craig Heny McKenna Old Fitzgerald Larceny and Pikesville Rye as well as unbeatable value brands like Evan Williams and the inimitable Mellow Corn.

A semi-family affair. The Brown family controls the majority of voting shares in the company and thereby one of the largest American-owned distilling operations. Its brand lineup is small but powerful headlined by the all-conquering Jack Daniel’s brand which remains the world’s best-selling whiskey.

Brown-Forman’s other whiskey lines aren’t as impressive from a numbers perspective but fill out a healthy whiskey bullpen nicely. Old Forester offers value bottles as well as a number of high-profile limited releases like its Batch Proof offering and Birthday Bourbon while Woodford Reserve offers well-crafted lower proof entry points into more premium bourbon. While lesser-known Cooper’s Craft offers experiment whiskeys for those interested in one of Brown-Forman’s largest assets: its own cooperage. To this day it is the only major distiller to own its own barrel making shop lending it the unique ability custom-build barrels and experiments on the fly.

In Kirin’s mighty beverage portfolio Four Roses stands alone. Four Roses’ history is one of the most unique of all major whiskey makers (there is ongoing debate on where the name comes from when the company was founded and so on).

By the 1940s and early 1950s the company which had been America’s most popular bourbon a short time before was flailing. Instead of folding Four Roses was fired to emerging markets all over Europe and Asia in search of a new foothold. In Japan it found one. The Japanese market drank it up and made it the most popular bourbon whiskey in the country effectively saving the company from ruin (there are Japan-exclusive Four Roses expressions to this day).

While it was dominating overseas Four Roses had fallen off the horse in the States. The whiskey was to put it lightly not good and also not bourbon. It had been selling Canadian whisky to America while producing high quality bourbon whiskey to sell abroad. After a series of corporate takeovers and handoffs Kirin secured the Four Roses of today by discontinuing the sale of the lower-end whiskey they’d been selling in favor of Kentucky bourbon whiskey.

(Editor’s Note: for those interested Jim Vorel’s story on the history of Four Roses is an excellent detailed overview of the company’s timeline.)

Pernod Ricard is one of the three largest distilled booze makers in the world and a bit like Diageo its brands are glossy. Jameson Chivas Regal The Glenlivet are the starters but the bench is packed with talent too with the likes of Jefferson’s Smooth Ambler Powers Irish Whiskey Green Spot and more waiting in the wings. But unlike Heaven Hill Brown-Forman or Beam-Suntory Pernod Ricard’s whiskey holdings are a very very smart part of its enormous alcohol-producing apparatus.

21.00: More than 460 delegates have joined us in Dubai for the live return of the MEADFA Conference here at the Jumeirah Creekside Hotel with about 100 more joining online on TFWA 365.

MEADFA President Sherif Toulan said: “It has been a huge pleasure to welcome our industry to Dubai this week. Not only have we enjoyed a stimulating and thought-provoking conference but also wonderful hospitality thanks to our host and sponsors. On behalf of the MEADFA Board our sincere thanks to our host Dubai Duty Free to all our sponsors to TFWA for their assistance and to all the delegates who took part live and online. It has been a fantastic few days that I feel sure will help to reignite our industry in the region.”

12.40: Dr Jennifer Cords Director Corporate Affairs Business Compliance & Corporate Responsibility of Gebr. Heinemann and Richard Gray CEO of ARI Middle East finish the MEADFA conference with a riveting talk on how each of their companies are futureproofing their businesses with sustainability and digitalization at the heart of their plans.

Cords who outlines how Gebr Heinemann is embedding sustainability into everything it does emphasises that sustainability sits in the boardroom not the basement. “It’s not a project it’s a mindset.”

Gray outlines ARI’s digitalization developments and goals adding that sustainability should become a major part of tenders. “Every retailer should be conscious of that and it should be a prerequisite to any bid that your sustainability credentials are genuine.”

12.00: Chair of the MEADFA Advocacy Working Group Rita Chidiac and ETRC Senior Counsel Ricardo Oliveira deliver a powerful session on defending the industry from regulatory threats. The session is moderated by John Hume of Hume Brophy.

Chidiac emphasises the need for efficient and effective government relations something that the industry has realised in the last 18 months is absolutely essential for the travel retail business. She says some of the key successes of advocacy in the industry have included most importantly the delaying of the World Health Organization’s study into the “extent of contribution of duty free to illicit trade” as part of the fight to defend duty free tobacco sales.

She points out that the wording of the study already sets a precedent of criminalising the industry and the fight is far from over.

“We are fiercely fighting against these allegations duty-free does not contribute to [ilicit trade]. We are very much in support of fighting illicit trade” Oliveira adds. How can the regional industry get involved? Become a member of MEADFA she stresses.

Other successes include winning the exemption from track and trace regulation in Bahrain with a similar expectation in Oman coming soon. Track and trace has already been implemented in the UAE and Europe which in the latter has led to a reduction of 450 SKUs in the category more than 50% of the offer to consumers says Oliveira.

“Regulators are not taking into consideration the uniqueness of the channel. With the power of an association like MEADFA we can avoid this cut and paste of regulation being applied in the Middle East & Africa” he says.

10.30: Placing the spotlight on Africa MEADFA invites Africa Airlines Association Secretary General Abderahmane Berthe Chief Executive Officer of Abidjan International Airport (AERIA) Aka Manouan Africa Tourism Association CEO Naledi Khabo and Dufry General Manager Africa Isaias Diaz to discuss how the continent can emerge from the crisis.

Chief Executive Officer of Abidjan International Airport (AERIA) Aka Manouan provides a picture of the developments at the Ivory Coast airport while Dufry General Manager Africa Isaias Diaz describes the global retailer’s experiences in Africa to date.

Diaz highlights the Ivory Coast as a particularly well-rebounding market in West Africa for the retailer while East Africa is having its ups and downs especially in Kenya. Operations in Egypt have had a decent summer thanks to the return of Russian travellers.

He points out the main challenges in the region are a lack of activation of the tourism sector restrictions to travel another wave of the virus in Europe. health protocols in store and inventory level adaptation to the erratic demand. However the positives are that passengers are willing to spend once they pass security and governments are relaxing health protocols that can help to reactivate the sector.

Dialing in from New York Africa Tourism Association CEO Naledi Khabo speaks engagingly about the opportunities that have arisen over the course of the pandemic. “We didn’t see intentional collaboration [between African nations] until this happened. The importance of digitization and upscaling our digital footprints are other developments that may not have happened without Covid” she says.

Khabo also pointed out the importance of promoting intra-regional travel and the diversity of what Africa has to offer among the nation’s diaspora. She says Africa is more than a safari destination there are cultural urban experiences for the diaspora market. “There’s an interest or desire to come to the continent but we haven’t made it easy. We need to focus on reframing how we reposition the destination. We need to focus on domestic leisure travel. There’s a growing pan African [interest] to embrace what we have on the continent. This will be key to sustainable success.”

Africa Airlines Association’ Berthe presents economic data on the continent and the impact of Covid-19. African economic growth dropped to -2.1% in 2020 from 3.4% in 2019. Meanwhile global economic growth went from 2.5% in 2019 to -3.5% in 2020. The African tourism market experienced a 74.2% drop in numbers compared to 2019. Passengers carried by African airlines dropped to 34.7 million from 95.6 million in 2019. This was a -65.7% drop.

Berthe says there is uncertainty about the future of the airline industry in Africa it will require various ingredients for success. The critical priorities for 2021-22 will be the safe reopening of borders financial relief and sustainability of airlines.

The latter is an important one for Berthe who says it is not viable for each country to have its own airline and there needs to be consolidation in the aviation sector in Africa.

“We really need regional operators to connect Africa due to the difficulties of connectivity between states.”

09.50: Pre-pandemic US airline Delta generated turnover of $47bn in 2019 and enjoyed a profit-sharing programme for five years including a record $1.6bn pay-out in 2020. The dramatic fallout from Covid-19 saw the company’s revenue plummet to just 3% after the virus was declared a pandemic as the airline burned $100m cash per day.

Regional Director Manoj Kuriakose speaks about the lessons the airline has learned during the crisis and its five pillar programme to prepare for the restart.

The airline acted fast with the first priority to protect people and Delta culture. Various other efforts saw Delta lower its daily cash burn to $27m a day in June from $100m in March. “Covid-19 taught us to have an integrated approach and work together with all stakeholders in the travel ecosystem” he says.

“These drastic circumstances provided the spark of opportunity for us to come out as a better version of ourselves… we are now a stronger more innovative and more customer-centric airline.” He asked delegates to look at their companies to what opportunities the crisis has created for them? “How can your organisation be more nimble more innovative and more productive?”

However he says this will not include a return of inflight duty free for Delta which ended its programme in 2014.

12.00: Next up Kamil Al-Awadhi IATA Regional Vice President Africa and Middle East and former CEO of Kuwait Airways spoke about the impact of Covid-19 on the aviation ecosystem.

Al-Awadhi stresses: “This crisis is unfortunate. But to not learn from it is unforgivable.”

At the peak of the crisis international travel was down 98%. “This is damaging considering the huge amount of investment the aviation eco-system puts in” he says. Recovery is slow he shared but especially in this region. “We are a long way to pre-crisis levels with 40% recovery in 2021 and 61% expected in 2022.”

IATA operates a system called Timatic (Travel Information Manual Automatic) which is a database containing documentation requirements for passengers traveling internationally at all airports and Al-Awadhi says that IATA is overwhelmed with the updates coming and changing from governments worldwide. Echoing many others in the aviation ecosystem he says that recovery will be sluggish until world governments and airports agree on a global standard for travel requirements.

11.30: After the break MEADFA aired a pre-recorded conversation between Airports Council International Africa Director General Ali Tounsi and Moderator John Rimmer.

Tounsi was adamant to provide a positive outlook on the industry citing the pandemic as a “catalyst for change”. He said it can foster greater innovation and integration of technology in aviation provide an opportunity to think strategically and take a systematic approach and spark regulatory change.

10.45: Delegates recharged over coffees for a morning Business Networking Session kindly sponsored by Nestlé. This was followed by prize draw by Dubai Duty Free Executive Vice President – Corporate Services Salah Tahlak to enter delegates into the retailer’s Finest Surprise competition.

09.45: A panel of renowned regional travel retail heads took to the stage to discuss their readiness for the restart. They included Anthony Kenny COO of Aer Rianta International; Ramesh Cidambi COO of Dubai Duty Free; Frédéric Chevalier Chief Operating Officer – Europe Middle East and Africa at Lagardère Travel Retail Isabel Zarza Chief Operating Officer – Central and North Europe Russia and Africa Dufry and François Bourienne Chief Commercial Officer at Abu Dhabi Airports.

Discussions focused on the topics of digitalisation the travel retail business model and business in the “new normal”.

Bourienne Chief Commercial Officer at Abu Dhabi Airports (ADAC) reports that since the Emirate reopened its borders traffic has been steadily increasing and is now 40% of 2019 numbers – double that of two months ago. Traffic from India Pakistan as well as the UK and Saudi Arabia is encouraging. At the airport 60% of shops are open he says while adding the Midfield Terminal’s reopening date remains a “sensitive subject” that ADAC can hopefully shed light on soon.

Bourienne reports a premiumisation trend among passengers which he feels can be further capitalised on by all parties in the trinity by investing in the system. Essentially he feels this can be achieved by bringing down the duty free price of products back to the traditional value proposition.

He called out to the industry: “Lets develop models that are bulletproof there is room for cooperation.”

“The big learning of the past 18 months is the gigantic instability [in the travel retail business model]” says Chevalier of Lagardère. “This absolute lack of visibility makes it challenging and questions the way we collectively collaborate (airports retailers and brands). That’s where the industry made a lot of progress but we need flexibility.”

Kenny of ARI notes the biggest consumer trends emerging over the current crisis are sustainability safety and convenience – the latter particularly regarding technology and digitalisation. He says concious shopping will be a key factor ahead pointing to a recent pre-loved boutique the company has opened in Montreal.

Kenny reports ARI reduced operating costs by around 60% over the challenges of the past 18 months alongside support from governments and organisations around the world but continued with refits and capital outlays. he highlights reopenings in Bahrain and in Cyprus in particular. “We continued to invest in training and development and providing exceptional customer experience. We redefined our customer value proposition and introduced a new ESG strategy [in that time” he says.

For Dufry’s Zarza who sits on an Airports Council International (ACI) sub-committee on concession agreements the key to recovery is flexibility with airports. ""There has been been a great collaboration with airport authorities [through the pandemic].” She explains the committee has been discussing a new model where the Minimum Annual Guarantee (MAG) is calculated by passenger. “MAG per pax by destination [i[is also possible]o be able to adapt by nationalities etc. This model could give flexibility to all of us” she says.

Dufry is currently 80% open globally accounting for 85% sales capacity. Zarza explains that is variable by region where Asia is primarily shut. “But in Africa we are above 90% already opened spend per pax (spp) is higher. We expect this to go back to normal [e[eventually]ut now they are keen to buy.” She says vaccination is low in some countries in Africa but this varies with some above 60% and some below 10%. Recovery has been faster among those with good interregional traffic. “Recovery in Africa is promising.”

DDF’s Cidambi continued to add insights on the new panel stating that the risk has moved from demand to supply – with products out of stock as a major challenge that will dampen the high spp experienced recently in coming months.

09.45: Ramesh Cidambi COO of MEADFA’s official host Dubai Duty Free relays apologies from Colm McLoughlin Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of Dubai Duty Free who was unable to attend due to personal reasons. He sits down for a fireside chat with moderator Dermot Davitt.

Cidambi praises the development of the vaccination programme in the UAE which is 90% fully vaccinated. “Just as a comparison we only have seven cases per million compared to 406 per million in the European Union. The environment in terms of events and the life in the city is the best it has been during the pandemic.”

He says business travel is returning which is a very good sign in the recovery of the city which is down to the safety security and stability Dubai has maintained over the pandemic. These efforts have resulted in a positive bounceback for Dubai Duty Free which is expecting to close 2021 with sales of US$959.

The retailer has approx. 22000sqm retail space open compared to c.37000sqm in total. The final space in Concourse A is set to reopen this week on 24 November after which apart from Al Makhoum Airport DDF will be fully open.

Cidambi notes that passenger mix in terms of regions has been up and down due to travel restrictions with the biggest impact from the Far East and Australasia which is down around 90% since June 2020. But what is more representative of recovery is that the rest of the regions are performing extremely well he says. DDF has seen a steady growth trend in every month this year. “We should take comfort from what we see in November when we look forward to the next 4-5 months.”

Cidambi describes how the retailer continued to push ahead in terms of retail development during the pandemic in order to get ready for the recovery with several luxury brands opening or underway. “We are glad the brands supported us” he says.

09.05: MEADFA President Sherif Toulan gave his welcome address hailing the “overwhelming attendance” at the event which has exceeded both the 2018 and 2019 MEADFA conferences and is a testament to the association’s affiliates. Rather than go into the devastating impact the pandemic has had on the region’s business Toulan says what matters now is “how we adapt our businesses to the new world in which we find ourselves”.

Toulan stresses how tourism is vital for the region and will play a lead in the recovery of the business. He says: “We hear a lot about pent up demand for travel and it is true for us too. Our customers are determined to travel and we must be ready to welcome them.”

09:00: We are ready for the 2021 MEADFA Conference at the Jumerirah Creekside Hotel in Dubai. Due to the strong attendance and limits in the number of people in the room MEADFA has secured another room for the additional delegates that have joined the event. With an initial capacity of 300 the conference has now attracted over 460 delegates – an optmistic sign for recovery in the region. Moderators John Rimmer and Dermot Davitt kick off the conference.

08.00: Good morning from Dubai ahead of today’s MEADFA conference DFNI spoke to the leading players in the Middle East & Africa for our November edition including: MEADFA President Sherif Toulan (p14) Dubai Duty Free (p32) Iraq Duty Free (p37) Gebr Heinemann (p40) IDFS (p42) Dufry (p44) ARI Middle East (p46) Setur (p48) and IDFTA (p49) about their experiences during the pandemic and plans for the next year. Read it here:

19.30: Tonight’s opening cocktail kindly sponsored by Dufry brought together delegates ahead of a welcome comeback for the two-day Middle East & Africa-focused conference.

Sunday 21 November 17.00: We are pleased to be back in the warmth of Dubai for the 2021 MEADFA Conference following the travel retail and duty-free industry’s first live event after the pandemic held in Cannes France last month.",,,,,,,,,

The TV spot titled “Holidays: Dinner Party” shows the Mannings attending a turkey dinner at the home of “Julius Caesar” (J.B. Smoove) and “Cleopatra.”

Caesar suggests in the ad that the pilgrims loved betting but the Mannings are skeptical.

“Yeah I’m a bit of a history buff; I don’t think that’s true” Peyton says.

It’s the first commercial the Mannings have filmed for Ceasars but it certainly won’t be the last. Peyton has been a hit in commercials for many years and his family’s now getting in on the fun.

“We’re looking forward to interacting with their customers who love sports and love football and we know Caesars has a lot of fun initiatives planned” Peyton said in a press release earlier this month. “They place a strong emphasis on community impact and we appreciate their support of causes that are important to us.”

Expect to see more from Caesar and the Mannings in the coming weeks.

AP

Two iconic Las Vegas hotel-casinos are marking milestone dates — one on the Strip and one downtown.

The Flamingo Las Vegas has begun celebrating its 75th birthday ahead of the Dec. 26 anniversary of the date in 1946 when Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel opened the first resort-style property on a highway that became Las Vegas Boulevard and the neon-lit Strip.

The Flamingo opened with 105 rooms at a reported cost of $6 million with backing from underworld associates including Meyer Lansky.

It now has more than 3400 rooms and a 28-story tower. It's owned by casino giant Caesars Entertainment.

Downtown the El Cortez Hotel & Casino has commemorated 80 years since opening in November 1941 with 59 rooms.

It was built by John Kell Housells John Grayson and Marion Hicks but later drew involvement from mob figures including Lansky Siegel Gus Greenbaum and Moe Sedway.

Jackie Gaughan owned the El Cortez from 1963 to 2008 and lived in a penthouse suite atop the landmark 15-story building.

The high-rise now has about 300 rooms and a separate building has 64 suites. The current owner is Kenny Epstein.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzIwL2hvdy1taWtlLXBlcmVpcmEtd291bGQtc29sdmUtbmZscy1vZmZpY2lhdGluZy1jb251bmRydW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Full-time refs Sky Judge: How Mike Pereira would solve NFL's officiating conundrum,"It is “Roughing the Zebras” season again where an apoplectic public throws the flag on the NFL for the personal foul of screwing their team be it real-life or fantasy or wager.

It is even more critical now for the league to move to extinguish as best it can its week-to-week year-after-year firestorm largely because of the proliferation of betting sites and its embrace of sportsbook partners — such as Caesars Entertainment DraftKings and FanDuel. More than ever with eyeballs everywhere addicted to the NFL and social media content oversaturating the brain we are talking about the integrity of the game.

These officials and it should be recognized there are more pros than joes have a thankless job because to err is human and the humans in the striped shirts err too often for the paying public to rein in their “Any given Sunday” outrage and refined instant replay and technological advances cannot fix everything.

If it isn’t “What is a catch?” (see Calvin Johnson see Dez Bryant) it is “What is pass interference?” If it isn’t “What is pass interference?” it is “What is roughing the passer?” If it isn’t “What is roughing the passer?” it is “What is taunting?” If it isn’t “What is taunting?” it is “What is a helmet-to-helmet hit?”

It is always something and it always will be something.

Serby Says asked Fox Sports rules analyst Mike Pereira how he would characterize the state of officiating.

“The state of officiating I would call it right now the same state that it’s been for the last number of years” Pereira said. “You get the taunting call that raises the ire of everybody around the country — and I understand that. You get the roughing-the-passer that shouldn’t have been made. People now with Direct TV and whatever they watch every game. Those mistakes have been made year in and year out and probably they’re more visible now than they’ve ever been.

“I know people would shoot me if I say this but I don’t think the officiating’s any different this year than it was last year during the pandemic or the years before that.”

There isn’t a fan base that hasn’t felt victimized or cheated by a bad or horrific call:

Better off not asking Bears fans about the league’s crackdown on taunting and referee Tony Corrente flagging and bumping their own Cassius Marsh against the Steelers.

Referee Tony Corrente bumps Bears’ Cassius Marsh right before flagging him for taunting. Fox Sports screengrab

Better off not asking Washington fans about Chase Young’s phantom roughing the passer penalty on Matt Ryan.

Better off not asking Saints fans about the roughing the passer call on Kaden Elliss that negated an end-zone interception of Ryan Tannehill.

On and on it goes.

And oh by the way don’t dare broach the 2018 NFC Championship with Saints fans when a blatant late pass interference against Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman incredulously and inexcusably was not called and the city of N’awlins felt robbed of a Super Bowl berth.

“Some are going to go for you some are going to go against you” Pereira said “but we can’t say that 2021 is the first year that the fans are up in arms.”

Google “NFL Officiating Crisis” and you will find these headlines:

The NFL’s Officiating Crisis — why it’s time to sound the alarm (2019).

The NFL’s Officiating Crisis is hurting youth sports (2019).

Is NFL too Hard to Officiate? Penalties are up calls still being missed (2019).

And one more time: To solve “officiating crisis” the NFL needs full-time officials (this week).

The NFL disbanded its two-year full-time officiating program prior to the 2019 season. Pereira argues against full-time officials.

“I just don’t buy it” he said. “I just can’t buy it on the simplest levels of people bitch about baseball umpires and they are full-time. And they scream about basketball officials and they are full-time. If you had 100 games to play or 160 games to play obviously then I’d get it. But I’m not one in the belief that hiring 130 officials full-time in the NFL to really not get all that many more reps makes any sense. I did (first discussed in 2016) broach the subject of making the 17 referees full-time. I kind of do like that … having them involved in everything. And having them at an officiating institute the middle of the country so instead of going home to Los Angeles after a game in Miami they go to the institute in Kansas City or in Dallas and they break down all the games together. They really then have to take consistent messages back to their crews.”

Pereira former official and vice president of officiating has long been in favor of a Sky Judge — an eighth official in the booth.

“Overall the percentage of accuracy is probably better now with the video assistant and the expedited reviews than it’s ever been before” Pereira said. “But you’re going to have those plays and you’ll probably even have ’em with the Sky Judge if you have ’em where the fans are gonna be in uproar and I don’t blame them. I certainly don’t like some of the calls that are being made but you’re talking about judgment calls 130 people if you try to get them on the exact same page on the area of gray which is basically what we’re talking about here it’s virtually impossible. … To be honest in my opinion it’s not new.”

In the meantime the line between touching the passer and roughing the passer has been blurred.

“Now you’re going overboard to try to protect the position and everybody knows that” Pereira said. “Again you have gray there too. Not all contact to the head is a foul but forcible contact is a foul. It happens real fast in real time and mistakes get made. We will never get beyond that. We’ll never get beyond the fact that mistakes are made.”

Saints coach Sean Payton for one certainly has not.

“We have to improve. Everyone watching and participating and involved in it deserves better” Payton said on “The Dan Patrick Show.”

The league is trying.

“With all the technology and replay and use of the official-to-official communication system and New York we’ve been going further and further down this path of using technology to aid officiating” Pereira said “and so is the next step one that could say ‘OK let this eighth official look at a player safety foul?’ And let him do it in real time before the play clock hits like 15.

“Since we started in 1999 by bringing replay back and added and added and added and this video assistant is now the replay official I think it might be the next logical step and could even get involved in pass interference in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter possibly. Who knows? Who knows where it could end?”

Mike Pereira is in favor of a Sky Judge. AP

It needs to end with an eighth official in the booth.

“Put this guy up there and let him get involved in player safety issues” Pereira said. “Then we throw the caveat in there of hey in the last two minutes let him get involved in pass interference when it has a huge impact on the game at the end of the game — a la the Rams and the Saints. That’s to me the way that I would like to see it expanded but I also say that’s the way I think it’s going.”

To wit:

“Listen close to the game listen close to the referee” Pereira says. “When he says ‘After discussion’ that means that basically the video assistant has given the officials input to change a call on the field which saves a challenge for either team. And if he says ‘After an expedited review’ that means it’s a review situation that the video assistant got involved and gave them the information that saved the review. That’s a big step to me. And I think when we look at the end of the season and see that the number of replay stops are way down that’s the reason why.”

At least the under-the-hood replay review delays are no longer necessary. Pereira applauds the NFL for setting up a system to correct errors in real time.

“I think we’ll all be very very surprised when the end of the season comes and we hear that they used this combination expedited review-video assistants 700-and-some odd times” Pereira said.

Pereira’s Sky Judge concept: “I’d like to have it on a rotation basis so the eighth official is a working official and they rotate into the eighth official position in the booth.”

No one wants to hear that the national pastime is the hardest sport to officiate. But it is.

“I’ve always said that the fans are super-invested in the game — you’re either a big fan of your team or let’s not discount the fact of fantasy football” Pereira said. “And I always said they’re betting even though now it’s becoming mainstream and it wasn’t mainstream before but they still did it.

“I had a guy call me one time after we screwed up a game in Washington and took a touchdown off the board at the end of the game. The game was 24-point difference but there was an illegal forward pass on an interception and we didn’t enforce it which would have taken the points off. So then as a result though it affected the Over/Under.

“So I had a fan call me and wanted me to pay his bet that he lost. I said ‘I have better things to do than to pay your gambling debts.’ ”

Diehard fans then and now undoubtedly would take the Over on blown calls.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vbGl2ZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjEvMTEvam91cm5leS1jb25jZXJ0LXRpY2tldHMtd2hlcmUtdG8tYnV5LXByaWNlcy0yMDIyLXRvdXItc2NoZWR1bGUtb3BlbmluZy1hY3RzLW5ldy1zaW5nbGUuaHRtbNIBmAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vbGl2ZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjEvMTEvam91cm5leS1jb25jZXJ0LXRpY2tldHMtd2hlcmUtdG8tYnV5LXByaWNlcy0yMDIyLXRvdXItc2NoZWR1bGUtb3BlbmluZy1hY3RzLW5ldy1zaW5nbGUuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Journey concert tickets: Where to buy prices 2022 tour schedule opening acts new single,"Just this year the legendary rock group Journey released the single “The Way We Used To Be.”

Sometimes you bow to the illusionists. This sleight-of-sentences is all about magic:

She’s an Angel

Two-week-old Illusia Angelina Sarankatos is already eager to hit the Strip. This is from the baby’s father Criss Angel.

The Planet Hollywood headliner posted a message on social media last week that Illusia who was born a month premature on Nov. 5 is doing well after several days in the NICU. The little girl made it home Friday. She and the mom Angel’s wife Shaunyl Benson are holding up all right.

UPDATE: Illusia Angelina our beautiful baby girl ❤️ pic.twitter.com/uEiHg5xWqb — Criss Angel (@CrissAngel) November 13 2021

“We are so excited about the progress for Illusia Angelina. She’s doing amazing. She is totally healthy now” Angel said in a social-media post Monday. “Everything is fantastic and we just want to say thank you so much for the love and prayers and she’s already told me she is so excited to be at the premier of of “Amystika” Dec. 27th get your tickets now.”

That plug is an indication the Angel/Sarankatos family is in good repair. “Amystika — The Secret Revealed” is the prequel of the “Mindfreak” stage show at Planet Hollywood. The nightclub concept is a partnership between Angel and the distinguished producer Franco Dragone.

The project was announced as “Mr. Smiles & Molly.”

The production has cast an array of artists including contortionists and bone-breakers circus oddities seductive female artists those with unique dancer skills (such as fire manipulating) female dancers physical comedians and character artists. The show promises “a euphoric enigmatic world that pushes the boundaries of reality like never before as a real firestorm ignites and engulfs a human body a tornado rages through the theater and a blizzard of snow falls so heavy it challenges the audience to see their own hands.”

“No pre-show gags no banter no old-fashioned theatrical ceremonies” Dragone says. “Here you will dive into a world that will take you by storm!” OK bring it on Baby.

The Master returns

Lance Burton forever the Master Magician in Las Vegas and everywhere else makes a special appearance at 6:15 p.m. Nov. 27 to benefit Opportunity Village and Variety the Children’s Charity of Southern Nevada. The show is his “Lance Burton & Friends” format with Fielding West Michael Goudeau and Keith West co-starring. Tickets are $20 for the show or $35 for a combo show-Magical Forest visit.

Burton moved back to the family farm in Kentucky in November 2020. He has not performed a ticketed show in Las Vegas since headlining at the Orleans Showroom in November 2018. He left Monte Carlo today’s Park MGM in September 2010 ending a 14-year run in his eponymous theater.

“This is a completely different show than what I did in Las Vegas for the last 20 or 30 years” Burton says. “I’m doing some of my favorite magic big illusions sleight of hand audience participation and I’m bringing some of my best friends with me. And there’s a lot of comedy a lot of magic juggling and we have a little something for everybody.”

“This is a completely different show than what I did in Las Vegas for the last 20 or 30 years” Burton says. “I’m doing some of my favorite magic big illusions sleight of hand audience participation and I’m bringing some of my best friends with me.

Fond o’ Farrell

It wasn’t until Farrell Dillon slipped the multicolored thimbles on his fingers that we recognized him from “Masters of Illusion” from 2018 at Bally’s Jubilee Theater. Same hotel different room more responsibility for the accomplished entertainer in The Magic Attic. Dillon has settled into the 6 p.m. time slot (dark Mondays).

Dillon’s show is fine for all ages even youngsters. That includes the little girl behind us the other night who kept calling out “Make it purple!” to pretty much every one of Dillon’s routines. He’s a classic magician ebullient skilled and engaging. You can take your 8-year-old nephew to this show and I plan to.

Dillon’s production is the first from the new Vegas entertainment collab of John Bentham’s Ivory Star Productions and former Caesars Entertainment executive Damian Costa’s Pompey Entertainment outfit. What these three have in common other than they all have an affinity for magic is RV travel. Really. They all own RVs and are known to tool around the country. But we anticipate Dillon will be parked here for a spell.

A real Study

We call this illusionist Rolex the Magnificent. Because you continually need to check to make sure he hasn’t pilfered your watch.

The anonymous sleight-of-hand genius is the star and sole performer in The Magician’s Study which performs at 7 and 9 p.m. Thursdays Fridays and Saturdays at an undisclosed location. The only way to find this performance is by linking to themagicansstudy.com.

I caught the show or it caught me when it premiered a couple weeks ago. Fellow Vegas scenester Sam Novak of Vegas 411 and Drai’s Nightclub vice president of marketing and entertainment Dustin Drai wereamong the invited guests.

The room seats eight total. The performances include an array of mind-blowing card tricks a silk that zips across the study and into an oversized bottle extensive coin-on-felt artistry and the re-assembly of a $100 bill (or $5 as was the case in the show I caught).

This secret presentation originally cropped up in 2017 at The Artisan and the plan is for the cloaked illusionist to hopscotch the performances around town.

It is worth allowing “Rolex” to steal some time even if it means losing your timepiece for a time because he’ll take that too.

This tiger thing

Magician Murray Sawchuck and his wife Dani Elizabeth are featured quickly in the first episode of “The Tiger King 2” which premiered Wednesday. The Vegas couple are shown playing with cubs along with Jeff Lowe and his wife Lauren at the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma in May 2020. Sawchuck still holds hours of footage from that visit and has toyed with the idea of editing it as a documentary.

Cool Hang Alert

Former Blue Man Group and Angel guitarist from Angel’s Luxor show Elvis Lederer’s Unique Massive band rocks Sand Dollar Lounge from 10 p.m.-2 a.m. Saturday. The band has kicked around for about 18 years. The current lineup is aces all around: Matt Green (keys) Ryan Krieger (drums) Mike Gonzales (trumpet) and Jason Langley (bass). As Lederer says “Unique Massive is a band that brings musicians from the local scene together and takes you on a sonic journey by pulling from creative forces that are unique to the moment.”

Good enough rock star. No cover. FizzyWater pizza and voluminous tunes rule the night.

Confusingly Capital One Offers also function like a shopping portal but you need to be in your Capital One credit card account to find them. In the non-public offers you can find when logged in to your Capital One account there is currently an offer for 15% cash back at activity-booking site Viator. That could be an excellent offer if you’re looking to book activities.

The Deal

Capital One is offering 15% cash back as a statement credit for purchases at Viator when logged in to your Capital One account clicking through the link found under your card and checking out with an eligible Capital One card.

Key Terms

Earn 15% back when you make an eligible purchase at Viator.com.

Not eligible for purchases made with coupon codes not found by Capital One Shopping.

To earn 15% back you must be a Capital One credit cardholder logged in to your account on capitalone.com or the Capital One® Mobile app and pay for a qualifying purchase using an eligible Capital One credit card.

You will receive your rebate as a statement credit to your Capital One credit card account within 3 billing cycles.

In no event will a statement credit be applied to a Capital One checking or savings account. Your credit card account must be open and in good standing at the time the rebate is awarded to receive your statement credit.

In the event you have more than one Capital One credit card we may apply the statement credit to any active credit card account that is open and in good standing.

To make a qualifying purchase you must click the button above and then complete a purchase at the selected merchant’s site in the window opened by the Capital One Offers tile within 24 hours using your eligible Capital One credit card. Offer is not valid by any other method.

Use of other coupons cash back or promotional websites after selecting an offer and before making a purchase will invalidate your offer.

Rebate is calculated using the subtotal amount of your eligible purchase which excludes taxes shipping credits and other fees. A

statement credit earned through this offer is in addition to any rewards regularly earned with your card.

See offer for full terms

Quick Thoughts

For those new to Capital One note that these are not card-linked offers. You have to click through the link you find in your account like a shopping portal (but as noted at the top don’t confuse this with the Capital One Shopping portal that is available to the public — these offers are found within your credit card login).

Keep in mind that the 15% cash back here is on top of credit card rewards. Assuming you’re booking with a Venture or Venture X card you’re looking at a total return equivalent of 17%. We have previously seen an offer for 18% but this is pretty good nonetheless.

That can be a great deal though beware of Viator’s customer-unfriendly policies. I wrote about how I had booked a hot air balloon tour in Dubai and just a couple of days before the tour the operator cancelled my tour and increased the price significantly. Not only was Viator unwilling to help they explicitly allow that in their terms. See more about that here. Short story I’d hesitate to use Viator again.

However I am glad to report that I did eventually get the credit from Capital One offers so if you are planning to book something through Viator this could be an excellent return.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2NlbnR1cmlvbi1sb3VuZ2UtY2hhc2UtY2FwaXRhbC1vbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Express Lounge Relief From Capital One Chase,"My dear readers some links on this site pay us referral fees for sending business and sales.

American Express Opens Centurion Lounges Reduces Access and Increases Fees

Over the last decade American Express has opened more than 40 Centurion Lounges located across the globe for its Platinum and Centurion cardholders. These lounges help customers who may not qualify for an airline lounge based on their ticket find a premium seat outside of the terminal crowds. The American Express Centurion Lounge has delivered a consistently elevated product with better food and drink options updated decor and design better lounge features like kids rooms massages or manicures and consistently better service.

Whether the home-grown lounge network fueled the popularity of the American Express Platinum card or the popularity of the eligible American Express cards has created more demand for the lounges is less relevant than the result that there are lines snaking around the outside of most Centurion facilities. They are so busy in fact that American Express posts just how busy each lounge is inside of the AMEX app.

COVID protocols compounded crowding issues with reduced lounge access for fewer guests due to distancing guidelines and the closure of airline clubs that may have absorbed some eligible AMEX travelers in the past.

In response to the popularity of both the credit cards and the lounges American Express has adjusted its offerings and starting in February of 2023 will reduce Platinum card members’ ability to bring guests with them inside Centurion lounges. They have also increased the annual fees of both their personal and business Platinum cards from $450/year a few years ago to now $695/year – a 54% increase.

Chase Adds Lounges to Premium Offering

Chase has a mixed relationship with its Sapphire Reserve card and its customers. It is disincentivizing sign-ups through lower new sign-up bonuses than the Chase Sapphire Preferred for example as well as paying a points dividend on spend for Preferred customers. At the same time Chase has added some perks to the revamped Sapphire Reserve offering more earnings when booking through the Chase travel portal and rolling out lounges.

The first four Chase Sapphire lounges (in partnership with airport lounge company The Club) will be offered in:

Boston

Hong Kong

New York (Laguardia); and

San Diego

By offering its own lounge network customers that hold both cards traveling through these cities will have their choice though AMEX has not announced any plans to build a location in San Diego yet opting instead for larger markets like Las Vegas and hub cities like Charlotte Philadelphia and Seattle.

Chase has not yet indicated just how many lounges it intends to offer within the network though Centurion lounges started with the same limited rollout. Whether the Chase offering will rival Centurion Lounges or even a Delta Sky Club remains to be seen as does its global reach. JPMorgan Chase Bank (NA) is primarily focused on the US domestic market as that’s where its credit cards are offered. Their customers travel globally (hence the Hong Kong location) but without local Chase accounts and clients global need will be limited.

Nevertheless with access to the Centurion lounge becoming harder to come by even for cardholders meeting all required entry criteria Chase’s alternatives will relieve some congestion in the three key markets of the first four offered.

Capital One Joining The Mix

Plenty of digital ink has been spilled about the Capital One X and its premium offerings this week; Matthew had some salient points to add as well. I’ll leave comments about that product to Matthew who did a fantastic job and while this is not a credit card pitch if you’re going to sign up for one of the cards anyway we would appreciate your support.

Ben from One Mile At A Time and Gary from View From The Wing both reviewed the new Captial One lounge at Dallas/Fort Worth this week and it looks stunning.

I frequent “The Club” in Pittsburgh and while it’s nice and – dare I say – better than the American Airlines Admirals Club at my home airport it’s not nearly the level of its rivals. Centurion Lounges’ commitment to premium food and beverage and Capital One’s impressive initial offering suggest that Capital One is serious about the premium traveler credit card market.

With an annual fee for the “X” card of $395 it’s substantially less than American Express and even Chase’s Reserve card ($550) though relief from crowds limitations and refusal of service due to capacity constraints from Centurion Lounges will only be available at Dallas/Fort Worth for the foreseeable future. Washington-Dulles and Denver International are both slated to open in 2022 but no further plans have been disclosed.

What might be the biggest differentiator for Capital One is that they grant two free visits for Venture and Spark cardholders ($45/visit for guests) as well as selling access for $65/visit to anyone. As a new entrant to the space this might encourage those who already hold the Venture card (competes at the same price point as the Sapphire Preferred and just below the American Express Gold) to try the offering and if they see value upgrade their current card for unlimited access.

Another note about airport lounges generally and where Capital One succeeds is that their commitment to the things lounge customers value is what will set them apart. I mused about the United Club and its pitiful breakfast selection that they wanted to charge $50 for on a recent trip Capital One makes food and drink (La Colombe draft coffee is reason enough to visit) a priority not secondary to free wifi (offered in airports anyway) and a seat. They open with showers available (some American Express Centurion lounges have not reopened showers following the pandemic) and offer food to-go which is not an option at many others.

Conclusion

American Express Centurion Lounges are head and shoulders above almost all other airport lounges without question. However their success may have created a problem of too many cardholders seeking to use the lounge despite their many locations. Prohibitive annual fee increases and new restrictions may seem like a good solution but with real competitors opening for customers that may already have a card with other banks lounge crowding relief may come from Capital One and Chase. Whether that eats into American Express profits is yet to be seen but I for one welcome the alternatives.

What do you think? Will Chase and Capital One lounges give some relief to crowded American Express lounges? Will customers convert or cancel AMEX products in favor of these alternatives?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RlbmRiZWFjb24uY29tL2hvdGVsLXByb3Bvc2Fscy1pbi10aGUtc3BvdGxpZ2h0LW9uLXRoZS1ub3J0aC1mb3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotel Proposals in the Spotlight on the North Fork,"Pictured Above: Peconic Bay Vineyard staff members discuss plans for the hotel at their Cutchogue winery.

There’s a lot going on in terms of potential commercial development on the North Fork and nowhere more than in the world of hotels. Three hotels are currently being pitched along the Main Road (Route 25) between Mattituck and Southold.

In Southold the plan for The Enclaves a 40-room hotel and 74-seat restaurant with an event space and spa on a 6.75-acre parcel along a stretch of the Main Road just east of downtown has drawn the ire of neighbors who came out in droves to decry the project at an Oct. 14 hearing before the town’s Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA). Hotels are considered a “special exception use” from the ZBA in this hamlet business zoning district.

Just a little further west across the street from King Kullen in Cutchogue the Soloviev Group which has purchased significant acreage on the North Fork in recent years is planning a similar sized project albeit on much greater acreage at Peconic Bay Vineyards a winery that had been closed for eight years before it was purchased and reopened earlier this year by a team headed by Stacey Soloviev.

That plan would include a 40-room hotel and spa designed to be an immersive experience in winemaking on the North Fork. It would also require a special exception use permit from the ZBA.

The former Capital One Bank headquarters in Mattituck which could become the largest hotel on the North Fork.

By far the largest proposed new hotel on the North Fork is one proposed by Alan Cardinale owner of the site of the former Capital One Bank headquarters on the Main Road just west of downtown Mattituck.

The most recent proposal for that property in September of 2020 was a 125-bedroom two-story hotel and 300-seat restaurant scaled back from a three-story 200-bedroom hotel that had been proposed in 2018.

Hoping to get ahead of the controversy over the Peconic Bay Vineyards proposal management there invited the community to a Nov. 8 open house at the winery — with free wine and charcuterie.

More than 150 people showed up.

Ms. Soloviev whose ex-husband Stephan Soloviev lives in East Hampton has been managing several properties for him while raising their children on the North Fork including Santa’s Christmas Tree Farm in Cutchogue the Chequit Inn on Shelter Island several thousand acres of farmland and now Peconic Bay Vineyards which sits on 53 acres 16 of which are commercially zoned and the rest of which is in a 2-acre residential zoning district where agriculture is a permitted use.

“I work for my ex-husband. I make my ag payments and he leaves me alone” she told the Nov. 8 crowd at the winery. “But I don’t have a choice. This property has to be developed.”

Peconic Bay Winery in Cutchogue

She added that two shopping centers the size of the King Kullen shopping center along with 50 apartments could be built on the property as of right but she wanted to build something at a much smaller scale.

“I want to do a hotel that’s a total immersion into wine letting people be involved with the winemaking process” she said adding that the hotel would have 10 rooms in a main building on the site of the current tasting room which would be open year-round with separate four-room bungalows surrounding it that could be operated on a seasonal basis.

The main building would be 6000 square feet and would include a pool and the spa. She said the 37 acres of the vineyard land would remain planted in vines though an earlier version of the hotel plan showed that houses could be built there.

She added that the hotel designed by architect Glen Coben would use modern materials like hempcrete and glass and the actual winemaking studio would be sunken with a green roof. There would likely be retail shops within the building selling local meat and vegetables along with space for small North Fork farmers to showcase their products. She added that she’d like to partner with other local wineries on educational events there.

The project would include a $1 million on-site commercial nitrogen-reducing sewage treatment system which is now required for new construction by the Suffolk County Health Department and Ms. Soloviev said a traffic study is in the works. She added that she hopes the immersive element of the project will have many visitors spending their time on premises during their stay.

Ms. Soloviev said she had initially wanted to build a 25-room hotel and Stephan Soloviev had wanted to build a 100-room hotel there.

“He knows my vision and he believes in everything I do” she said. “Right now he leaves me alone but I can’t fail.”

She said that if this project doesn’t work out they will likely sell the property which could then be developed by someone else.

While the crowd at the winery seemed generally receptive to the proposal it was a stark contrast with an Oct. 14 hearing for The Enclaves project in Southold.

For more than three hours residents questioned whether the town’s infrastructure could handle The Enclaves project wondered aloud if a 2018 traffic study of the project would need to be redone after a massive influx of new people to the area since the pandemic and asked what the effect would be on the use of local beaches.

The proposed site of The Enclaves in Southold.

Despite the outcry the Zoning Board of Appeals has less of a legal burden of proof to approve a special exception use than in granting variances a factor that was raised both at the Enclaves hearing and at the Soloviev open house.

“This is not a popularity contest” Southold Town Attorney Bill Duffy told the crowd at The Enclaves hearing. They’re bound by the code and that’s what’s going to guide them in making their decision.”

“A special exception use is simply a use that is authorized if certain conditions are met” he added. “Courts have found that the inclusion of a special exception use in a zoning district is tantamount to a legislative finding that the permitted uses are in harmony with the zoning district.”

The four conditions that must be met include minimum lot size limitations on the number of guest rooms based on whether public water and sewer are available maximum room size and requiring that audible music played on site cannot be heard at the property line said Mr. Duffy.

The Zoning Board of Appeals has not yet made a decision on the application. They next meet Dec. 2.

Southold Town is in the midst of hiring a consultant to make zoning change recommendations in the course of implementing its comprehensive plan.

Town Supervisor Scott Russell cautioned at a Nov. 4 work session that some aspects of the comprehensive plan might not be in line with current concerns.

“I know there’s a lot of concern about hotels right now but the reality is the comp plan says hotels are needed” he said. “Whether they’re consistent with community character that’s the balancing act.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcml2ZXJkYWxlcHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMva2luZ3NicmlkZ2Utc3RvcmVmcm9udHMtZmlsbGluZy11cCw3NjY3NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kingsbridge storefronts filling up,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://riverdalepress.com/stories/kingsbridge-storefronts-filling-up,76676 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcml2ZXJkYWxlcHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMva2luZ3NicmlkZ2Utc3RvcmVmcm9udHMtZmlsbGluZy11cCw3NjY3NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmloZWFydC5jb20vY29udGVudC8yMDIxLTExLTIxLW1hZGRpZS10YWUtc2luZ2VyLWlzLWV4cGVjdGluZy1hLWJhYnktd2UtYXJlLWFscmVhZHktc28tZGVlcGx5LWluLWxvdmUv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaWhlYXJ0LmNvbS9hbHRlcm5hdGUvYW1wLzIwMjEtMTEtMjEtbWFkZGllLXRhZS1zaW5nZXItaXMtZXhwZWN0aW5nLWEtYmFieS13ZS1hcmUtYWxyZWFkeS1zby1kZWVwbHktaW4tbG92ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maddie & Tae Singer Is Expecting A Baby: 'We Are Already So Deeply In Love',"One of the members of Maddie & Tae just announced that she has a baby on the way!

Kenosha Toyota at 8180 120th Ave. had previously been located in the same building as CarMax which sold the franchise after deciding to leave the new car business. The new Kenosha Toyota opened Oct. 1 as a separate entity an affiliate dealership with Rydell Company.

Chad Swan the owner of Kenosha Toyota said it was the first time he built a dealership franchise from scratch including a new building and a new staff of 60 people.

“It was a bit of an oddity” Swan admitted.

Swan said the new 55000 square foot dealership not including outdoor parking offers both greater convenience and service to Kenosha customers something that Swan said customers have appreciated.

“It’s gone really well” Swan said. “People are really happy we’re here.”

Besides selling both new and used vehicles the dealership has a full-service shop open Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 7 a.m. and Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.. For customers with vehicles in the shop Kenosha Toyota has loaner and shuttle cars.

Supply lines impacted by the pandemic have led to some reports of vehicle shortages nationally. Swan said they felt “a little” of the shortages a few months ago however things seem to have leveled out.

“I feel really good where Toyota is at” Swan said. “Hopefully we’ll normalize within the next 12 to 16 months.”

Kenosha Toyota has 140 used cars which Swan said he planned to bring up to 200 in the future.

Swan who moved with his family to Kenosha in July said the community has been welcoming to both his family and the new Toyota dealership.

“We’re happy to be in Kenosha the town has been good to us” Swan said. “It’s felt like home.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmsyNHR2LmNvLmtlL25ld3MvYW5vdGhlci1wcmlzb24tYnJlYWstYXMtdGhyZWUtb3RoZXItc3VzcGVjdHMtZXNjYXBlLXBvbGljZS1jdXN0b2R5LWluLW5hcm9rLTUxMDE0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another prison break; Three other suspects escape police custody in Narok - K24 TV,"Just days after three terror convicts who escaped from Kamiti prison were rearrested in Machakos three other suspects have escaped police custody in Tansmara West sub-county Narok County.

According to a police report the three suspects escaped from the Kilgoris Police Station on Saturday November 20 early morning after breaking the cell's wall.

""It was reported by NO 90198 PC Jalaus Okoa the report office personnel reported three suspects who were in the police cells had escaped. SCPS SCCIO OCS together with other officers visited the scene at the station cells building and established that the three suspects in cells names: Shadrack Leparan 29 a murder suspect Enocj Ndege 28 a theft suspect and Patrick Mausa 31 had escaped breaking cell wall"" a police report read.

The suspects are said to have crafted a hot on the brick wall by removing some bricks next to the cell's door. They are said to have escaped to a nearby Kilgoris township.

Though the three escaped after breaking the wall they left two other suspects who claimed that they did not hear their colleagues escape the cells.

""There were a total of five suspects in the same cells and the remaining two reported that they did not hear their colleagues escape. The night duty officer CPL Carmax Okello did not notice the escape"" the police report added.

Following the incident three officers - CPL Carmax Okelo Jalus Okoa and Andrew Bett - have been taken into custody as they wait to be arraigned in court on Monday.",,,,,,,,,

A cruise ship brawl that ended with more than a dozen family members booted off the vessel was sparked after one of them stepped on a passenger's shoe court documents allege.

The Zakhour family and some of their friends were escorted off the Carnival Legend after it was forced to stop at port in Eden New South Wales on February 16 2018.

Shocking footage captured a group of passengers engaged in a bloody fist fight before security were forced to intervene and detain the family as the ship docked.

Three members of the Zakhour family are now suing cruise company PLC claiming security violently assaulted them before falsely imprisoning them onboard.

Carnival PLC has filed a defence at the County Court drawing up a list of allegations against the family.

They allege members hurled racist abuse at security lashed out at staff when their supply to booze was cut off and sparked a brawl with other passengers Herald Sun reported.

PLC alleges the son of Zaki Zakhour 52 stepped on a passenger's shoe two days before the brawl broke out.

Mr Zakhour then became engaged in a heated argument with the passenger before assaulting them the following day court documents allege.

PLC alleges Mr Zakhour grabbed the passenger by the throat while other family members threatened to kill him.

Mr Zakhour said in his statement of claim that when security intervened he was punched in the head and kicked on the ground.

He alleges the chief of security yelled at him: 'I'm going to f***ing kill you and your son'.

PLC has defended the actions of the security staff saying Mr Zakhour and his son were handcuffed before they were taken to separate rooms.

Staff had been acting under the orders of the captain and employed 'a reasonable use of force' to ensure the safety of its other passengers PLC claimed.

The cruise line company claims the Zakhour family and their friends were involved in several incidents in while on the cruise ship.

They allegedly took out their anger at staff when their booze privileges were revoked and pushed a bouncer after they were refused entry into a nightclub.

PLC claims members threatened passengers near a pizzeria and choked a security guard and told staff to 'be ready for a wrestle'.

With Anthony Modeste scoring for fun and Steffen Baumgart bringing in a new attacking philosophy Cologne are in pursuit of the top six. Horn explains all to bundesliga.com...

bundesliga.com: Timo first of all a question for fans all over the world: What makes 11 November a special day in Cologne?

Timo Horn: “Yeah it is the start of the carnival season. It is an important day for everyone from Cologne I grew up with it my parents would celebrate it and naturally you become a part of it. It is a core part of the city and on that day it is jam-packed everyone celebrates it and there is a very positive atmosphere flowing through the city. A lovely day.”

bundesliga.com: How is the start of carnival celebrated?

Horn: “All the bars are open at 11:11 and that’s when it all begins people are celebrating everyone is dressed up and it is the beginning of a long carnival season.”

bundesliga.com: As a native of Cologne it must be part of your DNA?

Horn: “We always have a bit of luck that the international break is at this time as well so those who are not national team players have the opportunity to celebrate it. At Effzeh we have a tradition that everyone comes to training in costume. It always makes an impact on the younger and newer players and it is always a nice day.”

bundesliga.com: Let's go to the next game in Mainz also a carnival team from a carnival town. Does this fact make the rivalry perhaps even greater to be the better carnival team?

Horn: “There is only one team that really identifies with it and that is Effzeh. In Cologne you say ‘alaaf’ and for me it is the real carnival it is also a fair bit larger than in Mainz. But it is always an interesting game against Mainz it has been a hard-fought game in recent years. They are playing a good season and we have full focus on them.”

bundesliga.com: What do you expect from the game in Mainz?

Horn: “They are a physically robust team against whom you have to hold your own. At home they are also very dominant and have given the big teams problems. They have a good style of play and a blended team who take it to the opposition with an eye towards the goal and winning and we have to do what we have done in recent weeks put Mainz under early pressure not let them settle into the game and then we have a chance to do something.”

bundesliga.com: What would a win against Mainz mean?

Horn: “When you look at the table you see that there aren’t many points between us and the top but also not so many points between us and the bottom it is a very hard-fought and even league. It would be nice to pick up the three points as we have been waiting a few weeks for a win. We had a few draws and a few games where we could've gotten more such as the game in Dortmund where we ended up going home empty-handed and now it’s the time to get three points again.”

bundesliga.com: Let's talk about the man of the hour at the club Anthony Modeste. What happened to make him play so well and score so regularly?

Horn: “I think that he worked really hard on it. He didn’t have an easy period with a lot of injuries that set him back wasn’t always able to take part in the full pre-season which meant fitness was lacking a bit. But in the meantime he has returned to a position where he can really help us. His goals have been a lifeline for us. In the air and the penalty box he is incredibly difficult to defend he has an instinct which you don’t lose in the difficult times. He has returned to form the goals have followed and it's clear to see that his confidence is back on the pitch and that has an effect on the opposition.”

bundesliga.com: What are Tony's special qualities both athletically on the pitch and as a character off the pitch?

Horn: “He's an incredibly important player for the team he's also a very funny guy and he lifts the mood in the team even at times when things aren't going to plan. He knows the club and its history well he helps out the younger players and stands side by side with them. There are not many better finishers in the box in the Bundesliga than him. His instinct and ability to anticipate when and where the ball will come in that cannot be taught. He has demonstrated that over and over again with the 25 goals he scored to take us into Europe and he is on his way towards another good return this season. I'm delighted for him.”

bundesliga.com: How did you like his last celebration with the coach’s hat?

Horn: “Yeah I think that was a spontaneous thing. The coach may have wanted him to get back into position and perhaps score a third goal and Tony grabbed the hat. That is the kind of thing that goes hand in hand with Tony and Cologne the emotion that was missing for so long with covid. And with the stadium full with 50000 emotions can fly out and you can understand that.”

bundesliga.com: And what do you think of his goal celebration with the glasses?

Horn: “That's his goal celebration his trademark. There's a matching emoji which I like posting. That's how he and the fans identify him.”

bundesliga.com: What do you think of the club’s season so far after 11 matchdays?

Horn: “I think we had a really good start to the season. Many people had their thoughts about us before the season whether the squad was too weak for the Bundesliga with the two or three departures which the club had to do for financial reasons. They were good sales. Through covid the situation has not been made easier in terms of new signings but with Steffen Baumgart as coach he has given us confidence from day one and has set us on a path which we are far from finishing. And I think in the meantime we've developed a totally new playing philosophy attacking football with high pressing giving the opposition problems. On the other hand we could have earned a few more points but it's a process we're working on and I think we are on the right track and will collect more points from it.”

bundesliga.com: As a goalkeeper you’d prefer clean sheets. Why has it not worked out for you this season and how nice would it be for you?

Horn: “That's always the aim for a goalkeeper. The attacking way we play means there is of course one or two risks in defence so while you might concede some counter-attacking goals you score more. As a goalkeeper I may not always be so happy but as long as we get the points and play well then I am happy. We’re on the right track there and it won’t be long before we get a clean sheet in the Bundesliga.”

bundesliga.com: Only one goal conceded in six out of 11 games. Is that the positive news despite the attacking style of play?

Horn: “Yeah I think so. Defence starts in attack when you press high and win the balls there. That lightens the load for the defence and allows them to stay compact and focus on defending. It starts at the front and the coach is always mentioning that the forwards are the first defenders and should win the ball early so I think if we can make that work in the coming weeks we’ll concede fewer goals.”

bundesliga.com: Cologne are clearly playing more offensively and courageously under new coach Steffen Baumgart. Does this also affect your play in goal?

Horn: “That does change some things as we play higher up the field and I need to watch my distancing as there's the possibility of long balls coming through which we have seen in some situations where I have been an active player. The coach encourages that. The way we open things up has changed as well wanting to play flatter draw the offence in and find space behind the defence. That has usually worked well but once against Union Berlin it didn’t work we conceded and a lot of people saw that. But with this style of play we have created a lot more chances and that is how we will approach the coming games.”

bundesliga.com: What kind of person is Steffen Baumgart?

Horn: “A very open coach who has strong inter-personal communication skills. He speaks to a lot of people individually for every game and has tried to make everyone feel involved which is great for the team’s harmony to have somebody like that leading the way and knowing that he lives every moment with you on the sideline. He's like the 12th man. He always gives us input on the side and that's great for the team always observing. Off the pitch he is a very affable person not like he sometimes comes across very easy to approach and he's brought us on in terms of confidence and that does us a lot of good.”

bundesliga.com: You haven’t missed a Bundesliga game since March 2017 playing 124 times in a row in the division. Is that a record that makes you proud?

Horn: “Yeah that makes me very proud. Particularly as I've grown up here being able to perform for the team and stay fingers crossed injury-free. That's very positive and makes me proud to be able to help the team. Every match I’m allowed to play for Effzeh means a lot to me. And right now in this phase where we have fans back and the stadium is full you feel the emotions you carry within as someone from Cologne and it makes me proud of every game I can play.”

bundesliga.com: No other goalkeeper in Bundesliga history has managed to not concede a goal in his first 364 minutes. How proud does this record make you today?

Horn: “Yeah back then we had a different approach to what we have now. We made life very difficult for the opposition and our defence played more defensively which in turn helps in terms of not conceding I think we played 13 matches without conceding in my first Bundesliga season which for me was a success and I hope to hold on to that record for a while longer.”

bundesliga.com: You’ve been with the club since youth level and have been the number one keeper since 2012. You also stayed true to the club despite relegation. What does the club mean to you personally?

Horn: “This is my second home. I've played for Effzeh since I was nine years old since 2002 which makes you proud when you come from Cologne. My parents grew up here and became Effzeh fans. As a kid I dreamed of playing in goal and I’ve achieved that. That is a wonderful thing for me and I always try to show that in amongst everything that goes on this is something that will always be there and makes me very proud.”

bundesliga.com: You have already experienced a lot with the club. What moments have stuck with you?

Horn: “The two promotions of course but also qualifying for Europe for the first time in 25 years even if the season afterwards was not so successful with relegation. Managing that after 25 years was one of the best moments because I saw what it meant to people like my parents and grandparents who went through long periods which weren't so good. To celebrate something like that and be a part of it was indeed a special moment.”

bundesliga.com: You're now 28 so actually have your best years as a goalkeeper ahead of you. How long do you still want to stand between the posts?

Horn: “It's always difficult to set goals like this but I feel good. I don’t have any physical problems and I have in mind to play until 35 and then see how the body responds from year to year. It's difficult to plan it but I feel I still have a couple of good years ahead of me.”

bundesliga.com; During a training camp FC-TV produced a morning magazine with Timo Horn as a presenter. Will there be more of it soon and could this possibly be your new field of work after your career?

Horn: “There are many so-called experts in that area. Yeah perhaps it would be fun I find it interesting. I’m not certain if the morning magazine has a future but the guys always come up with good things and it is a fun thing to do to mix things up during the training camp and I’m excited to see what will come of it.”

bundesliga.com: What do you wish for yourself and the club for the whole season?

Horn: “First of all I’d like a consistent and calm season for us as far as that is possible as it is never calm in Cologne but that we always deliver performances pick up points and have nothing to do with the relegation battle. Also to think a little bigger and see what comes of it but I think if we continue to deliver consistent performances like we did in the first part of the season then we will play a good season and see what comes from it. It's all very tight but we look up rather than down and want to continue to deliver this type of football and a good season.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3czRzYW5hbnRvbmlvLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9jYXJuaXZhbC13b3JrZXItZmlyZXMtc2hvdC1oaXRzLTkxLXllYXItb2xkLWZsb3JpZGEtd29tYW7SAWtodHRwczovL25ld3M0c2FuYW50b25pby5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL2Nhcm5pdmFsLXdvcmtlci1maXJlcy1zaG90LWhpdHMtOTEteWVhci1vbGQtZmxvcmlkYS13b21hbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival worker fires shot hits 91-year-old Florida woman,"MARGATE Fla. (AP) — A carnival worker shot fired a gun into the air during an argument with a co-worker and the bullet went through the window of a nearby assisted living facility and struck a 91-year-old woman police said.

Authorities said the bullet traveled some 200 yards on Thursday morning from the grounds of the Broward County Fair to the first floor window of the Waterside Landing assisted living facility in Margate.

The woman is expected to recover from her injuries officials told news outlets. Her name was not released.

But Brandon Lucas Craig 40 is facing multiple charges including attempted murder aggravated battery with a deadly weapon battery and carrying a concealed firearm.

The fair opens Dec. 5 and city officials are assuring the public that the incident was an isolated case.

“To ensure the safety of fairgoers and as initially planned the Margate Police Department will be continuously patrolling the fairgrounds throughout the upcoming weeks to deter any further incidents and avoid any potential risks to public safety” Margate Mayor Antonio Arserio told the South Florida SunSentinel.

Craig remained in the Broward County Jail on Friday morning. Jail records don’t list a lawyer who could speak on his behalf.

We’ve got everything you need to know on that along with all the latest cruise news across the major cruise lines including more itinerary changes.

Here we go with just another busy week of cruise news as even more cruise ships make a return to service. So we’ve got news about the naming ceremonies for two new cruise ships sailing out of Florida itinerary changes for multiple Carnival cruise ships a change in pre-cruise testing for Norwegian Cruise Line Royal Caribbean restarting from Los Angeles after more than 10 years away and a significant milestone for Celebrity Cruises.

MSC Seashore Naming Ceremony

The new MSC flagship MSC Seashore became the first cruise ship to celebrate its naming ceremony at a cruise line private island. After arriving in Miami on November 14 for the first time and after completing her inaugural Mediterranean sailings MSC Seashore departed on a special two-night voyage.

The sailing visited MSC’s private island of Ocean Cay in the Bahamas where godmother Sophia Loren christened the vessel. It’s the 16th ship in the fleet that Loren has named with MSC Cruises having a total of 10 more ships on order or under construction; no doubt there will be plenty more to name.

MSC Seashore will commence guest operations on November 20 from PortMiami in Florida. She will be sailing a range of different cruises including five-night to regular seven-night itineraries and even longer 16-night options. The Seaside EVO class ship is 169400 gross tons and has a guest capacity of 5877 along with 1648 crew members.

Odyssey of the Seas Naming Ceremony

Royal Caribbean’s Odyssey of the Seas was finally christened during a naming ceremony on board the ship in Fort Lauderdale on November 13. The Quantum-Ultra class ship was christened by godmother Erin brown the first Bahamian to be a godmother to a Royal Caribbean cruise ship. Brown is a paratriathlete and competed in the Paralympic Game qualifiers.

Odyssey of the Seas already started sailing from Flordia on July 31 but due to several delays due to the pandemic only in November the ship was officially named during a special two-night voyage that also included a call to the cruise line’s private island of Perfect Day at CocoCay.

The vessel is sailing on 6-night and 8-night cruises to the eastern western and southern Caribbean as well as CocoCay in the Bahamas. In April 2022 Odyssey of the Seas will be based in Rome Italy for Meditteranean cruises.

Carnival Cruise Itinerary Changes

Carnival Cruise Line has informed guests and travel agents of multiple itinerary changes that impact four vessels. For Carnival Sunshine out of the Port of Charleston 12 sailings have been altered. The ship is set to resume cruise operations from the port on January 13 2022.

Carnival Breeze which restarted cruises out of Galveston Texas in the summer has eight sailings that are altered. Carnival Liberty which will resume cruises from port Canaveral on February 11 2022 has a total of four sailings revised. Carnival Ecstasy also has six sailings that are changed for departures out of Jacksonville.

The cruise line did not say the reason for the changes in the communication that was sent out.

Carnival Vista Homeport Change

With the future Carnival Jubilee cruise ship being based out of Galveston Texas in 2023 it does mean that another Carnival cruise ship will have to make way. Carnival Vista which is currently sailing year-round from the Port of Galveston will shift to Port Canaveral in Florida in November 2023.

The final cruise from Galveston will be a six-day Western Caribbean itinerary including a call at Costa Maya Belize and Cozumel with a return to home for the final time on November 10 2023. From Port Canaveral Carnival Vista will operate five- six and eight-day itineraries to the Caribbean and the Bahamas.

Norwegian Cruise Line Pre-Cruise Testing

Norwegian Cruise Line informed guests on November 15 of a change for pre-cruise testing which will go into effect on sailings from January 17 2022. Guests will no longer have to go through two tests before their cruise as the testing at the terminal during embarkation will no longer be a requirement. Guests will only have to do their test at home.

The reason for the change is to make the check-in process more streamlined. It also brings NCL in line with other cruise lines that only require guests to undergo one test. However guests will still have to show a negative test result taken within two days before departure and an extra day for international passengers.

The good news is that the pre-cruise testing at the terminal is not going away and if guests cannot prove a negative test result at embarkation they can use the option from Norwegian Cruise Line. Pre-cruise testing at the terminal will cost $99 per person.

Royal Caribbean Begins Cruises from LA

Royal Caribbean returned to Los Angeles after more than a decade away! Navigator of the Seas restarted its operations and departed the Port of Los Angeles with guests onboard on November 19. The first guest sailing follows a special two-night voyage where invited guests could preview Royal Caribbean’s new offering from California.

The ship is now sailing its highly anticipated year-round season of three-night weekend to four- and five-night weekday cruises to Catalina Island California and the Mexican Riviera. Port visits include Ensenada and Cabo San Lucas Mexico. There is also the option to combine into a longer week-long voyage with visits to Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan Mexico.

Major Milestone for Fourth Edge-Class Cruise Ship

The first steel was cut on November 17 2021 at the Chantiers de l’Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire France for Celebrity Ascent the fourth ship for the Edge class of ships from Celebrity Cruises. The monumental ceremony included company executives signing the ceremonial first cut of steel a tradition for new ship construction as the physical building of a ship begins moving beyond the planning and development phases.

CARR,Carrier Global,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdmlyb2xvZ3lqLmJpb21lZGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwLjExODYvczEyOTg1LTAyMS0wMTY5MS0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Association between maternal hepatitis B virus carrier and gestational diabetes mellitus: a retrospective cohort analysis ...,"Most pregnant women with HBV infection were classified as chronic HBsAg carriers [12]. The global prevalence of HBsAg in pregnant women has been estimated to be 5.0% [20]. In China the prevalence of maternal HBsAg has declined in recent years; however it was higher than the global average [21]. According to a study from 2018 the prevalence of HBsAg in pregnant women has declined from 9.8 to 6.3% while more recent studies have reported a prevalence ranging from 7.0 to 9.4% [567]. In our retrospective cohort of 39539 women we found that 7.7% of pregnant women tested positive for HBsAg consistent with the latter studies.

Recent reports have found that being a chronic HBV carrier was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as GDM [222324]. GDM was traditionally defined as carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity with onset or first detection during pregnancy. The latest meta-analysis from 2019 showed that 14.8% of pregnancies in China were complicated by GDM increasing prevalence [25]. GDM was one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including hypertensive disorders preterm labor neonatal hypoglycemia hyperbilirubinemia and respiratory distress syndrome. It was necessary to highlight the significance of understanding risk factors and specifically modifiable factors for GDM and prevent the condition which might lower the risk of GDM-related adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Nowadays the most common risk factors of GDM include older maternal age obesity and a family history of diabetes [26]. Whether being HBsAg positive a history of PCOS and smoking or alcohol consumption during pregnancy are risk factors of GDM remains uncertain.

In our retrospective cohort of 39539 women we found that maternal HBsAg carriers have a higher risk of GDM (12% vs. 9.7% OR 1.42 95% CI 1.01–2.00). Being HBsAg positive was an independent risk factor of GDM. Several studies supported this finding. Lao et al. [8] analyzed 13683 women in Hong Kong between 1998 and 2001 and found that the rate of GDM was statistically higher in pregnancies with an HBV infection (12.4 vs. 10.2% OR 1.24 95% CI 1.01–1.51). In 2016 Tan et al. [10] concluded that the rate of GDM in HBsAg carriers was higher than non-HBsAg carriers (11.8 vs. 8.2% OR 1.41 95% CI 1.15–1.74) in a case–control study 22374 Chinese women. The latest meta-analysis from 2018 demonstrated that women with HBV infection had an increased risk of GDM (6.48% vs. 3.41% OR 1.35 95% CI 1.17–1.56) [11]. However a few previous studies have shown the connection between maternal HBV infection and the development of GDM to be insignificant. Reddick et al. [12] showed that the incidence of GDM among HBsAg positive women (4.4%) was similar to that of HBsAg negative women (2.5% P > 0.05). Cui et al. [13] found the incidence of GDM between the HBV infected women and non-HBV women to be insignificant (1.17% vs. 1.13% P > 0.05) in a prospective cohort study involving 21004 pregnant women. Furthermore our study found that older maternal age and obesity were associated with a higher risk of GDM consistent with the previous studies.

The potential mechanism for the correlation between HBsAg and GDM is unclear. The liver is an important organ that handles liver glucose metabolism and the development of insulin resistance. Liver disease and inflammation caused by HBV during pregnancy may lead to reduced insulin sensitivity [27]. Another mechanism could be that HBV-infected pregnant women display a spontaneously increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha which contributes to insulin resistance leading to the development of GDM [28 29].

Additionally we found that a high HBV DNA load (> 106 IU/mL) was an independent risk factor of GDM among HBsAg-positive pregnant women. A recent meta-analysis supported our finding. The latter study found that HBsAg positive had a 47% higher risk of developing GDM than HBV negative women associated with HBV serological markers including HBV DNA load [11]. However Peng et al. found that HBV infection during pregnancy was an independent risk factor for GDM but the phenomenon is not related to viral activity such as hepatitis B e-antigen status and viral load [14]. This phenomenon might be because HBV DNA load reflected the level of virus replication and infectivity in patients with an HBV infection. There was a strong inflammatory response in HBV-infected women with a high HBV DNA load leading to a higher risk of GDM. Furthermore our study showed that an HBV infection during pregnancy increases the risk of ICP (1.1% vs. 0.2% P < 0.05) and pre-eclampsia (3.4% vs. 2.5% P < 0.05). These findings which have rarely been investigated before may have important clinical implications for pregnant women [30 31].

Given that maternal HBsAg was associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes our study suggests that women should receive a serological test for HBV infection before or early in the pregnancy. Thus it is necessary to establish appropriate diagnosis and management for HBV-infected women. We recommend that HBV DNA load and the liver function of HBsAg-positive women be monitored regularly which might help observe any change of condition. Antiviral treatment might be considered for women with a high HBV DNA load when necessary [32]. Moreover the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in HBV-infected pregnant women should not be ignored. Screening and early interventions for GDM among high-risk populations such as those who are HBsAg positive (especially those with a high HBV DNA load) are older at maternal age and are obese might contribute to the prevention or early diagnosis of GDM [33].

The strengths of the current study included a large sample size and comprehensive information on demographic characteristics maternal and neonatal outcomes. However our study was a single-center retrospective cohort study which could not exclude selection and information bias. Additionally we did not investigate the physiological mechanisms of the association between HBsAg and GDM.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzc4NTE3MzIxMDA5OTU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surface energy considerations in ternary powder blends for inhalation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378517321009959 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzc4NTE3MzIxMDA5OTU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvZG9lcy11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLWhhdmUtd29ybGRzLWJlc3QtbWlsaXRhcnktMTk2NTk40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does the United States Have the World's Best Military?,"Here's What You Need to Remember: While the amount of military personnel is an important factor of an army’s strength what really takes the U.S. to the next level is our air superiority as well as naval prowess.

The quick answer is yes we do have the most powerful military of all time. At this point there’s really no question about it but it’s surprisingly not just about the size of our military. We have some of the most powerful and advanced military technology the world has ever seen. How do we have the status of the most robust military? It’s certainly not by manpower. That title belongs to China which has 2.19 million active soldiers compared to the United States with only 1.4 million. The answer lies in our superior technology.

The United States has never struggled for military funding which takes up 15 percent of the U.S. budget. That equates to $686 billion spent on weapons tanks boats jets and any other piece of equipment every single year. It hasn’t stopped growing either. In 2020 $750 billion was allocated to the military and its likely we’ll see another increase in 2021.

While the amount of military personnel is an important factor of an army’s strength what really takes the U.S. to the next level is our air superiority as well as naval prowess. The U.S. military possesses almost 2100 fighters 967 attack choppers over 900 air transports and special-purpose aircraft. Some notable units are the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber A-10 Thunderbolt II and Apache Attack Helicopter. Drones shouldn’t be ignored either as they rise in popularity for taking out High-Value Targets.

Oceanside the Navy has accrued eleven aircraft carriers and ninety-one Navy destroyers. In a global conflict aircraft carriers are a vital part of maintaining combat effectiveness. While 11 may not seem like a large number it is five times the amount China has and China doesn’t have the resources to fill the space on theirs. We can accommodate between 85 to 110 fighters on our carriers. This means we don’t need to deploy jets from military bases or even the mainland just send out a carrier with fighters ready to go at a moment’s notice.

The next factor is how rapidly we develop and release new weapons technology like the upcoming smart bullets David’s Sling and potential exosuits like the TALOS project. And these are only the things we actively know about. It’s likely there are top-secret projects in the works that will remain classified even as they’re rolled out into active use. It’s hard to even cover the sheer quantity of military advances in the past 81 years.

Last is the elite training our special forces receive. While this is becoming less of a focus as combat starts gravitating towards drones and proxy wars the training aspect can’t be written off. It can be grueling and break a person but only the most skilled and strong can make it. They excel in combat tactics teamwork and minimizing collateral damage and we have our special forces to thank for eliminating threats to national security like Osama Bin Laden.

The United States is and will remain the most dominant military force in the world because of our spending power a large collection of combat units and elite special forces.

See Full Image Gallery >>



The A90 Toyota Supra may be known more as a circuit carver but that hasn't stopped the Big T from campaigning it in the most American of motorsports: drag racing. Unveiled at Auto Club Speedway in Pomona Calif. one of the spiritual homes of postwar hot rodding the funny car previews what fans can expect to see at drag strips for the 2022 NHRA season.

Of course there is little in common with the actual Supra road car. It drapes a vaguely Supra-esque carbon fiber body over a dedicated tube frame drag chassis. The silhouette is made as slippery as possible so most of the Supra design cues are just large decals. It may look silly but it's no more bizarre than the Toyota Celica NHRA car of the 2000s or the outgoing Camry drag car that the Supra is replacing.

Toyota didn't reveal specs on the Supra but if its past NHRA entrants are anything to go by there's really nothing funny about this funny car. The Camry dragster sported an 8.2-liter supercharged V8 beneath its composite canopy. Horsepower ranged between 10000 and 11000 capable of rocketing the car to 100 mph in less than a second and down the quarter-mile in under four. Since the main thing that's changed is the body there's no reason to believe the Supra won't be similarly potent.

For those mad about the direction the Supra has taken it could be argued that a dragster is the most natural evolution of the much-beloved fourth-generation Supra. In the early days of import tuning it was a true force to be reckoned with. Toyota's legendary 2JZ-GTE engine a twin-turbo and twin-cam 3.0-liter inline-six was often tuned to 800-1000 horsepower for 6.5-second E/T blasts — in a doorslammer. Its popularity with drag racers eventually landed it a spot in the street racing franchise ""The Fast & the Furious.""

This year marks the 20th anniversary of Toyota's official participation in NHRA. Over the years Toyota has notched six Top Fuel and three Funny Car championships. Drivers J.R. Todd and Alexis DeJoria will reprise their roles as official drivers for 2022.

The insects munch through so many leaves that our research has found the resulting decrease in leaf-fall and increase in caterpillar poop hugely alter the way nutrients particularly carbon and nitrogen cycle between land and nearby lakes.

Nitrogen-rich insect excrement called frass can wash into lake water and act as fertilizer for microbes.

These microbes can then release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as they metabolize the frass. In years with insect outbreaks the large quantities of frass may favor the growth of bacteria that release greenhouse gases in lakes overpowering the lake algae that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

These insects are basically little machines that convert carbon-rich leaves into nitrogen-rich poo. The poo drops into lakes instead of the leaves and this significantly changes the water chemistry.

We think it will further increase the extent to which lakes are sources of greenhouse gases.

As the climate in the world's temperate region shifts insect populations are expected to increase and move northwards. This puts northern forests at increased risk of defoliator outbreaks in the future potentially causing greater quantities of carbon dioxide to be released from nearby lakes.

Climate change is also expected to favor the growth of broad-leaved deciduous trees around the lakes which we have found will amplify the insects' impact.

Where is the good news?

While the impacts of insect defoliation appear to be on the rise in both frequency and severity lake waters across the Canadian Shield are also undergoing a process called browning due to a build-up of tea-like dissolved organic carbon in lake water.

This declining clarity of lakes has been attributed to many factors including climate change and their recovery from historical acid rain and logging activities.

Our 32-year-long monitoring study showed that an outbreak of leaf-munching caterpillars can effectively offset an entire year's worth of carbon accumulation in nearby lakes significantly improving water clarity.

In years without outbreaks of leaf-eating insects carbon and nitrogen entering lakes usually come from decaying leaves and conifer needles. These inputs typically peak in quantity in autumn.

In outbreak years we found that nearby freshwater lakes especially those surrounded by deciduous forests had one-third less dissolved carbon or ""forest tea"" in the water because the hungry caterpillars effectively held back the flow of carbon to the lake.

The lasting benefits of these marauding insects become evident when the invasive insects encounter already stressed trees such as the stunted birch forest surrounding the massive metal smelters in Sudbury Ontario.

This 80000 hectare industrial area is undergoing a remarkable natural recovery of its own because of a 98 percent reduction in acid and metal particulate emissions from what was the world's largest point sources of sulphur pollution as recently as the 1970s.

The legacy of soil loss contamination and degradation in Sudbury clearly puts trees at a disadvantage in the battle with defoliating insects.

Caterpillars as tiny plows?

Trees can't flee from insects but usually can survive multiple heavy attacks. However trees in the industrial barrens of Sudbury don't fare so well because of all the other stresses they face.

These stressors include the loss of soil moisture and organic matter and decades of accumulated toxic metal particles from the smelters.

The result is that these stressed trees present themselves as a delicious food source for caterpillars and other insects and the landscape is often littered with dead and dying trees on their way to becoming soil.

In earlier lab experiments we showed that when we fed L. dispar caterpillars leaves from the stressed white birch trees of the industrial barrens they ate more leaves and produced far more frass which increased plant growth in soil that had received this rain of poo.

Yes the insects are giving the struggling trees a very hard time at the industrial sites. But the improving soil quality is the real winner.

Healthy soil is one of the largest and safest places to sequester carbon from the atmosphere key in our fight against climate change. As every farmer knows protecting and restoring soil quality is also essential for sustainable agriculture.

That is why well-informed farmers regularly try to stop extracting nutrients from the soil and plow in a nutrient-rich fodder crop like alfalfa to rebuild the soil.

Our research shows that these hungry caterpillars now appear to play surprisingly large roles in altering key features of the global carbon cycle but we also now think of them as tiny plows that can help improve degraded soils.

While we may all someday own a robotic car in the future – and Elon Musk would argue that Tesla owners already do – the most likely scenario is that most self-driving vehicles will be used for commercial purposes in the near term. This includes not just having crap delivered from Walmart or Amazon but also moving cargo with self-driving trucks or people with self-driving taxis and buses.

Unless you’re lucky enough to live in one of the handful of cities where companies are actively testing these technologies it’s unlikely a robotic Prius will deliver your microgreens from Whole Foods anytime soon. Full-scale deployment on the open road is realistically still years away as there are still plenty of challenges to solve from programming for every possible eventuality to perfecting sensor technology to building the necessary infrastructure to accommodate autonomous vehicles.

That’s why automating a constrained environment like warehouses with mobile robots is an easier feat because there are fewer variables and there’s always workers comp for the occasional mishap. A company called Cyngn (CYN) – a name that makes it sound like a potential candidate to create Skynet and destroy humanity in the machine wars – is developing self-driving software for industrial autonomous vehicles that operate in constrained environments such as warehouses or construction sites.

About Cyngn Stock

It’s likely that most of you have never heard of Cyngn but how about Cyanogen? No it’s not a company developing a biotechnology weapon that will destroy humanity but a one-time serious contender in the smartphone world. Technically founded in 2009 and officially founded in 2013 Cyanogen was a Silicon Valley startup that had raised $115 million from a fairly impressive list of investors including marquee venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz Chinese tech giant Tencent Qualcomm and the Foxy Rupert Murdoch. The company was reportedly valued at close to $1 billion after an $85 million Series C in March 2015.

Forbes published a glowing origin story around the same time. There was the genius programmer Steve Kondik who began tinkering with the open-source Android operating system (OS). There was the iconoclast business guy Kirt McMaster whose vision helped turn an open-source OS project CyanogenMod into a company Cyanogen that was wheeling and dealing with the likes of Microsoft. Allegedly as many as 50 million users were running the CyanogenMod OS on their phones by 2015. Yet by the end of 2016 Cyanogen pulled the plug on its mobile OS product. Rumors said that maybe it was more like three million users. Both McMaster and Kondik left the company at some point.

You probably guessed by now that Cyanogen became Cyngn pivoting from mobile to mobility with an open-source self-driving software suite. The company went public last month opening at $7.50 a share with a market cap near $200 million pocketing about $26 million from people who actually thought it was a good idea to invest their money in a company with shall we say (upon advice of our legal counsel) a colorful history and zero revenues.

The Technology

Let’s step back and look at what’s under the hood of Cyngn before we kick the tires too hard. The company has apparently spent the last five years developing what it calls the Enterprise Autonomy Suite (EAS) which “leverages advanced in-vehicle autonomous driving technology and incorporates leading supporting technologies like data analytics fleet management cloud and connectivity.” The main piece of its industrial autonomous vehicle software is called DriveMod (or CyanogenMod or whatever) which is a “modular software product that is compatible with various sensor and computer hardware components that are widely used throughout the autonomous vehicle industry.”

In this case the software is somehow optimized to work with multiple vehicle types especially industrial machines like forklifts and bulldozers which obviously operate in less dynamic environments than a car trying to cross Los Angeles in the middle of the day. For instance DriveMod is capable of perceiving more than 100 dynamic objects per second to navigate autonomously while the industrial settings of its target market rarely encounter 100 objects per minute. To date the technology has been tested on nine different types of industrial vehicles from stockchasers and stand-on floor scrubbers to 14-seat shuttles and 15-foot-long cargo vehicles. Vehicles running Cyngn’s software can switch between manual remote-controlled and fully autonomous driving modes.

The software suite also includes Cyngn Insight the interface for monitoring and managing fleets of industrial autonomous vehicles. Analytics dashboards surface data about the system’s status vehicle telemetry and performance metrics. The data also feed the machine-learning algorithms that make up Cyngn Evolve the tool that continuously improves the self-driving OS.

The Business Model

Cyngn is all about autonomous driving software so it partners with various companies that manufacture industrial vehicle platforms and hardware that are interested in integrating its autonomous software. For example last month Cyngn announced a partnership with Columbia Vehicle Group which makes small electric industrial vehicles for warehouse environments. The business strategy mainly consists of “acquiring new customers who are either (a) looking to embed our technology into their vehicle products or (b) upsell their existing clients with our vehicle retrofits.” In other words much of Cyngn’s success hinges on its partner network.

The company expects to generate revenue two ways: deployment and EAS subscriptions. Deployments require Cyngn and its partners to work with a new client to map the job site gather data and install the industrial autonomous vehicle tech within their fleet and site. It then offers EAS on a software as a subscription (SaaS) model and then the money just starts rolling in.

The Market Opportunity

How much money? Who knows. Cyngn has yet to make a dime on its autonomous driving solution aside from $166000 that it collected on a one-time proof-of-concept deployment. EAS is currently in beta mode and the company doesn’t expect full commercialization until 2024 which it estimates will cost up to $23 million in additional R&D. That just happens to be about how much Cyngn pocketed in last month’s IPO.

Credit: Cyngn

The company is initially going after the market of industrial vehicles for manufacturing and distribution which it says is worth $119 billion. That’s based on the number of such vehicles shipped by the top 10 manufacturers each year (883000) X hours of operation per non-autonomous vehicle annually (4174) X average hourly labor wage ($32.42). That’s math that even an MBA can understand.

Should You Buy Cyngn Stock?

Of course that same MBA is probably laughing his ass off right about now. There are so many red flags here that we risk being trampled to death by bulls. Cyngn is a public company with zero customers (partners are not the same thing) zero revenue and a product that sounds like it is far from being commercially viable. While the pivot from smartphones to smart forklifts isn’t exactly an Intrexon move the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

And it’s not as if Cyngn is entering a virgin market. We’ve been writing about companies building and deploying robotic construction equipment since at least 2017. One such startup Built Machines is already turning excavators into trenching robots. Others are automating mining trucks and tractors. Commercial floor cleaning robots? Check. And let’s not forget about big boys like Caterpillar (CAT) which has more than 275 autonomous trucks in operation.

Conclusion

One thing Cyngn should be commended for is choosing a traditional path to an initial public offering as opposed to that special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) nonsense that never provides enough color. Cyngn has provided enough color and it’s a big avoid from us because they don’t meet our market cap threshold of $1 billion. And even if they did we don’t invest in pre-revenue companies. Meaningful revenues are critically important to prove product-market fit especially for disruptive technologies like autonomous driving.

The third and longest stage of the Taipei Grand Hike is a 14km walk from Yangmingshan’s highest peak across a vast stretch of alpine grassland

By James Osborne / Contributing reporter





From the dark forest we see glowing eyes peering out at us. Mere meters away our lights reveal a massive black beast through the trees. As it slowly turns to face us we see its enormous curved horns.

These are creatures we had hoped to see on this stage of the hike but not not so close. We quickly and cautiously move a safer distance down the trail hoping they will not charge at us — as they’ve done with other hikers most recently killing one in January.

Throughout the night owls hoot and fly over-head while flying squirrels clamber around in the trees. A highly venomous many-banded krait scurries across the path in front of us. It is no wonder so many spooky tales are set in forests at night.

The third section of the 92km Taipei Grand Trail (台北大縱走) is proving to be just as thrilling as we could hope but we are in for a long night.

STAGE THREE

Having spent the whole afternoon navigating a logistical nightmare of taxis and buses and getting our vehicles parked at the end of the trail we arrive right before dusk at the iconic fumaroles at Xiaoyoukeng (小油坑). Great plumes of steam rise up from cracks in the dormant volcano filling the air with the smell of rotten eggs.

From here we begin our steep ascent up to Qixingshan (七星山). Our eyes are set toward the Qingtiangang Grasslands (擎天崗大草原) then on all the way back down to our motorbikes at Fengguizui (風櫃嘴). At about 14km in length tonight’s stage of the Taipei Grand Hike is the longest.

Soon the Mid Autumn Festival full moon fills the night sky making the silvergrass flowers glint in the moonlight as they tower high on either side of the trail. With a smaller team of only four we quickly but carefully climb the stone staircase to meet our fifth member an entomology student named Janus at the summit. He had gone ahead on a futile mission to film the sunset on what became a cloudy evening.

The city lights of Taipei illuminate the darkness far below. Having convened with our final team member at the peak he points out an iridescent ground beetle running in circles. We get a quick selfie at the summit marker while trying not to bother the dozens of moon gazers then begin our descent back toward the forest.

We soon encounter our usual forest friends; Japalura lizards asleep in the branches a giant stick insect crawling on a fern and a green tree viper lurking among the foliage.

“Wow check this out” exclaims Janus spotting some large and colorful caterpillars on a trail-side bush. These will soon turn into one of the world’s largest and charismatic moths; the lesser atlas moth.

THE GRASSLANDS

A vast expanse of darkness surrounds us as we cross the swing-bridge at Lengshuikeng (冷水坑). Soon we pass an ancient stone structure reclaimed by the forest; an old ruined cow shed. The grasslands must be near. A greater green snake watches us from its perch in a tree as Janus once again cries out in excitement.

In anticipation we crouch down beside him to try and see what it is. A large trapdoor spider pokes its head out from beneath its camouflaged trapdoor.

“They use a fine web tripwire to detect passing prey” he says.

The grasslands feel like another world at night. Our lights reveal a snaking trail ahead while all around seems like an infinite sea of darkness. The air is filled with the sounds of crickets and frogs.

Before long patches of forest break up the stretches of open grass. After entering a stretch of forest we notice a glint of light in among the trees. “Wow” exclaims Monica as our flashlights expose an enormous semi-wild buffalo standing between some trees.

We soon spot two more. The darkness and their proximity makes them seem gigantic. Their large horns and eyes still glowing in the reflected flashlights makes them frightening to behold. After snapping a few shots and admiring these incredible creatures we decide it is safer to move on.

As the forest opens to grassland again we see buffalo warning signs and safety barriers to escape a charging bull. Soon more glowing eyes reveal more water buffalo grazing in the open grass. Although used to passing hikers they can be dangerous.

THE FINAL HAUL

Before we enter the forest for the final descent to Fengguizui we pass five wild turtles. A green tree viper watches over a frog in another forest pool.

Soon our legs become weary and we try not to stumble on the slippery stone path as fatigue grips us. Once again our entomologist cries out in excitement. He has found some black and red beetles eating mushrooms on a log. They are interesting beetles but it’s his enthusiasm that keeps us going.

After a grueling nine and a half hours on the trail a big Formosan toad sits beside the final marker to cheer our completion of stage three. With sore feet and wobbly knees we clamber back onto our bikes. Satisfied but with only our warm comfortable beds in mind we head for home.

Correspondent

Autumn heralds the historic annual migration of millions of monarch butterflies passing through Southern California en route to their winter home in Mexico. Thought to be facing possible extinction with dangerously decreased numbers last year they now are showing a strong presence as their population significantly increases sparking renewed excitement in these beautiful creatures.

Nearly one year after monarch conservation specialist Susie Vanderlip inspired the Laguna Woods Garden Club’s audience in January with her Zoom presentation “Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Monarch Butterflies” several club members Village residents and guests traveled together to experience “Soar” an immersive butterfly pavilion nestled within the beautiful South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes Estates.

We explored the outdoor “host garden” filled with native California milkweed Mexican marigolds hummingbird mint flowering butterfly bushes and lantana. The garden’s purpose is to attract and feed monarchs supplying nectar from the assorted flowers to fuel their long migration. Munching away on the flowers and plants were some colorful striped caterpillars.

The next area was the large glass-enclosed “emergence chamber” window. Our docent guide explained that once a caterpillar has spun its chrysalis it is carefully moved and hung on a small tree limb inside this chamber awaiting the arrival of the butterfly. The living chrysalises hang for up to three weeks.

While standing right in front of this large window we witnessed a new monarch mere inches away breaking out of its chrysalis which had become transparent and thin. The process took only a few seconds until the fledgling monarch was hanging motionless upside down on the small limb where it would remain for several minutes while its crumpled wings smoothed and dried out enabling it to fly.

Inside the large enclosed pavilion we saw four types of butterflies freely flying around: monarch viceroy queen and Julia. Monarchs were by far the most plentiful gracefully flying among the flowers and trees and occasionally coming to rest on the shoulder or head of a lucky visitor generating smiles.

Garden Club welcomes all members and residents interested in learning more about monarchs or in creating a garden with plants and water sources that will attract and feed them to join our Monarch Boosters group.

For additional information please email lwvgcmonarchs@yahoo.com or come to a Garden Club meeting.

Fab labs have digital fabrication tools laser cutters 3-D printers vinyl cutters and milling machines to inspire young people to learn about science technology engineering and math (STEM).







“Chevron is proud to expand our partnerships with the Fab Foundation and FAMU” said Melissa Rosenblatt Chevron social investment manager in a news release. “The fab lab will also directly respond to the community’s desire to expose young people to the latest STEM tools and technology sparking their curiosity and informing their future education and career pathways.”

FAMU Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Maurice Edington Ph.D. said the Chevron initiative is an investment for generations to come.

“The fab lab allows students to study design interpret and implement their own creations. It’s a space that fosters critical thinking skills” Edington said. “These students are our future engineers scientists designers architects artists and teachers.”

The Fab Foundation is a non-profit organization that emerged from the Massachusetts Institution of Technology’s Center for Bits & Atoms. Its mission is to provide access to the tools the knowledge and the financial means to educate innovate and invent using technology and digital fabrication to allow anyone to make (almost) anything. Since 2014 the Fab Foundation has partnered with Chevron to launch fab labs across the U.S to support STEM education.

“We are excited to continue this partnership and support Chevron’s HBCU Social Equity project. This new project will expand our work together with the intention to provide access to advanced technologies and create more equity in STEM” said Sonya Pryor Jones Fab Foundation vice president and chief strategy officer. “We hope to complement the rich history and commitment of HBCUs to serve the educational needs of Black Americans and together accelerate opportunities for African American students in STEM and digital fabrication.”

The fab lab announcement comes as FAMU DRS is experiencing record enrollment for the first time in more than a decade and there’s a waiting list of students trying to get in.

“This is truly groundbreaking for our students at the College of Education and FAMU DRS” said FAMU DRS Superintendent Micheal Johnson. “This will level the field in STEM for all students and provide real application opportunities.” College of Education Dean Allyson Watson Ph.D. said the goal to promote STEM discovery and ultimately STEM careers is at the forefront of this project.

According to FAMU Chevron-supported fab labs include facilities in Bakersfield Richmond and Santa Clara California; New Orleans Louisiana; Pascagoula Mississippi; Houston and Odessa/Midland Texas; and Washington D.C. These labs have served more than 50000 people so far.

Oil operations have also led to deforestation and settlement in Indigenous territory. Yet with few options Indigenous communities must choose to sell their land or fend off oil goliaths through small-scale industries like ecotourism.

Indigenous Groups of the Ecuadorian Amazon

The Amazon — the largest rainforest on Earth — covers more than a billion acres spanning eight South American countries and French Guyana. It contains a tenth of the world’s species as well as some 400 indigenous tribes where about 60 choose to remain isolated. However many have had contact with the outside world utilizing guns for hunting and accessing western medicine and education.

About a quarter of Ecuador’s 1.1 million Indigenous people live in the Amazon making up 10 Indigenous nationalities including the Cofán Siona Secoya and Waorani. Ecuador has taken some progressive measures in protecting Indigenous rights yet inequities remain. According to the World Bank Ecuador’s Indigenous households are 16% more likely to live in extreme poverty than non-Indigenous households. While the Ecuadorian constitution gives land ownership to Indigenous groups energy resources like oil are state-owned.

The Search for Black Gold

In Ecuador companies began searching for oil in the early 20th century but peak oil extraction began in the 1970s. U.S.-based Texaco Petroleum Co. — now known as Chevron — arrived in Ecuador in the 1960s and remained its primary oil company through the early 1990s.

A team of lawyers sued Chevron in 1993 for irresponsible waste management affecting 30000 Ecuadorians. The lawsuit accused Chevron of storing 18.5 billion gallons of wastewater in unlined pits. It also claimed Chevron dumped 16 million gallons of oil into the open. Following this scandal Chevron capped more than 200 oil pits and built schools and medical facilities in the area. The plaintiffs however argued this was insufficient. They claimed the oil spills caused long-lasting environmental damage and harm to human health – including skin conditions and cancer.

An Ecuadorian court ruled in 2011 that Chevron should pay $9.5 billion in damages. Three years later Chevron appealed to a U.S. federal court which found the verdict fraudulent. The Hague’s Permanent Court of Arbitration also ruled in favor of Chevron which has argued it never owned any assets in Ecuador and signed a settlement with the country in the late 1990s absolving it of any further responsibilities there.

Nearly 30 years later Chevron still denies liability and has paid nothing from the original ruling.

Ecuador’s Oil Production Today

Ecuador is still highly dependent on oil extraction to pay off debts to China as well as for state revenue. Yet while oil is omnipresent Michael Cepek — an anthropologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio and author of “Life in Oil” — believes oil companies today use better practices than Chevron did. He tells The Borgen Project companies are more careful about responsible waste management and use safety valves along pipelines.

Yet he does not discount that damaging spills are inevitable in an earthquake-prone country like Ecuador. “Until you totally rebuild the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline or do something to make pipelines impervious to seismic activity you’re just gonna have oil spills” he said.

According to the advocacy organization Amazon Frontlines there are now more than 950 oil wells in the Amazon where — between 2005 and 2015 — there were nearly 1170 oil spills in Ecuador alone. As recently as April 2020 broken pipelines from Ecuador’s Petroecuador and the private company OPC Consortium spilled more than 15000 gallons of oil. The spill affected more than 100000 people including more than 100 Indigenous communities. Both oil companies claim to have cleaned up the spills. Yet recent tests reveal heavy metals are still present in the rivers.

The ITT Initiative: A Call to Save the Rainforest or Cynical Criticism?

Ecuador’s then-president Rafael Correa created an international trust fund in 2007 through his Yasuni-ITT Initiative. The goal was to raise half the value of the oil reserve — some $3.6 billion — under Ecuador’s Yasuní Park by 2023. If the initiative met its goal from international donations the 796 million barrels of oil would stay underground. The plan ultimately failed raising less than half of 1% of its goal six years into the initiative.

Ecuador’s foreign debts continued to lurk and Correa ended the initiative in 2013 allowing oil companies to drill.

Cepek doubts Correa ever expected the international community to save Yasuní. He believes the initiative served as a lesson to hypocritical developed nations. “He put it at the ball in their lap saying ‘(If) you don’t want us to do this kind of extractivism … put your money where your mouth is” Cepek said adding that many others genuinely believed the plan would work and were devastated by its failure.

Caught Between A Road and a Pipeline

Indigenous communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon often find themselves in a difficult position. They can strike a deal with companies to sell their land for oil or risk losing everything regardless.

For 20 years Cepek conducted research in a Cofán community in Dureno where he witnessed those living there fighting off oil for years before finally giving in. They lost faith in western environmental activists he said who seemed dismissive of their lack of resources. For many Indigenous communities working with the oil companies equals money for necessities like health care. “The poverty is so extreme” Cepek said “it’s hard to say ‘no’ when you have no other ways to get money.”

Ecotourism in Ecuador: Sani Lodge

The Sani Isla community consists of about 600 Kichwa people from Ecuador’s Napo and Pastaza provinces. The Sani community built Sani Lodge for guests in 1999 where according to Javier Hualinga — a Sani Lodge guide at the time — the community was resisting two threatening proposals. One was to build a road through their community. The other was to allow Occidental Petroleum Corp. to run a pipeline through instead. In the end Occidental won Hualinga told The Borgen Project and the Sani community felt powerless because Ecuadorian law declared such energy resources are government-owned.

The Sani community built Sani Lodge to create jobs and consolidate greater power against encroaching oil companies. One of Sani Lodge’s primary goals today Hualinga said is to conserve the land. Sani Lodge “is a perfect excuse to fight the oil companies” he said “and has become our armor or shield.” At Sani Lodge guests can take personalized tours through the Amazon led by community guides. Guests also have the opportunity to visit Kichwa homes eat traditional meals and learn about Kichwa customs.

Sani Lodge is Ecuador’s only Indigenous-owned and managed ecolodge according to its website. All of the lodge’s profit stays within the community Hualinga says. Money goes toward expenses such as health care education and the preservation of Kichwa culture. Sani Lodge also partners with the Sani Warmi project which supports Indigenous women in small businesses.

The Instability of “Sustainable Tourism”

While Sani Lodge has provided the Sani community with some degree of autonomy it has not made life easy for its Kichwa residents. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic Sani Lodge struggled financially. With increasing pressure from oil companies the community is not in consensus about whether they should maintain their ecolodge or allow in oil.

The global pandemic has added to the lodge’s financial challenges Hualinga says. Sani Lodge closed for months. While Sani can normally accommodate 20 guests it is currently at just half-capacity.

Last year’s oil spill which affected the Napo River also made it difficult for the community to operate its lodge — to the point where Hualinga says reopening feels like starting “from zero once again.”

Light at the End of the Pipeline

At Sani Lodge guests can witness hundreds of species of birds as well as spider monkeys giant otters and occasionally jaguars. On his guided hikes Hualinga says he allows visitors to formulate their own opinions about what they see. Yet he hopes that their immersion will impact the way they understand the Amazon and the Indigenous communities that inhabit it.

The lodge has the potential to “show (guests) how important (it) is to protect the Amazon” he said “which is home not only for the diversity of flora and fauna but also the diversity of … culture and their abilities to live with it.”

At 3-7 they’re on their way to missing the playoffs for just the second time since they drafted Russell Wilson in 2012.

Understandably the team is frustrated. That emotion overtook Pete Carroll this evening as he walked out early on his post-game press conference – a first during his tenure as Seattle’s head coach.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Mr Lawes said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

‘Desire to bring the painting to life’

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

Other experts involved include Sara Charles a medieval book production expert who hand made the original recipe pigments and the brushes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNodXJjaG5ld3MuY29tL2xlYWRlcnMvMjAyNC8wNS8xMS9tb3RoZXJzLWRheS1jaHVyY2gtbGVhZGVycy1xdW90ZXMtaW5zcGlyYXRpb24tZ3JhdGl0dWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What have Church leaders said about mothers?,"A mother walks next to her two sons who are riding their bicycles.

In Istanbul Turkey a city of many religions and cultures existing together Elder Kearon and his wife Sister Jennifer Kearon met a woman who was “remarkable resilient strong faithful positive can-do amazing.” She rode a bus three hours just to attend Sunday worship services.

The parishioners are all here. The clergy are too. Well sort of — if you count avatars powered by artificial intelligence.

Today's service features a sermon prayers and songs brought to you almost entirely by ChatGPT.

While AI-led services haven't become mainstream scientists and theologians are exploring how new technology can coexist with some of the world's oldest teachings.

In places like Temple B'Nai Or in Morristown New Jersey the congregation made up of scientists young and old sets out to answer a question: What is a human? And does allowing technology into a fundamentally human experience like faith alter it somehow?

""We started looking at the future that is now and had questions of AI and you know even uploading our mind to the cloud things like that"" Rabbi Michael Satz told Scripps News.

Satz says it isn't the first time the nearly 4000-year-old religion has had to grapple with change.

""My ancestors wrote the Torah in the scroll — 2000 years ago the new technology was to have a book. And so the ancient rabbis had to ask the question can we liturgically use a book when we read the Torah? And they decided no you need to read out of the scroll because that's connecting us to our ancestors"" he said.

Today they're faced with similar questions.

""How do we look at AI as a tool that can help us be who we are rather than help us divide ourselves from others?"" Satz asked.

But can AI answer the tougher questions of spirituality like ""What's the one true religion?""; ""Why do bad things happen to good people?""; ""What happens after you die?""

""I can see people turning to AI as a start as a research tool for those questions and see what have the great Jewish teachers said about this question in the past?"" said Satz.

Congress A congressman wanted to understand AI. So he went back to college AP via Scripps News

Kutter Callaway an associate professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary and an adviser with AI and Faith agrees the human touch is necessary.

""Depending upon what data sets it's using we get an intense amount of bias within AI right now"" Callaway told Scripps News. ""And it reflects shock and awe the same bias that we have as humans. And so having someone that is actually a kind of wise guide or mentor to help you discern how to even interpret understand the results that AI is giving you is really important.""

But Callaway says there's good that can come from AI like translating the Bible into various languages.

""That is a very difficult task when it requires on-the-ground humans who know a language really well. But when assisted through AI all of a sudden you have a tool that actually can speed up that process quite a lot"" he said.

Rabbi Geoff Mitelman who helped found the studies at Temple B'Nai Or through his organization Sinai and Synapses agrees saying AI can be an aid in study.

""The best sermons that I ever find ... that I ever hear are when a rabbi sees a word in one text that is used in some other text and links the two of them"" Mitelman said. ""AI can very very quickly say 'Yes here's all the places where this text is used' and then the rabbi can then say 'Oh that's interesting I hadn't seen that connection before but I wouldn't have known this might connect here.'""

However there are concerns across religions about the interpretation of such texts bias and misinformation.

""The spread of misinformation and how easy it is to create and then spread misinformation whether that's using something like Dall-E or ChatGPT or videos and also algorithms that will spread misinformation — because at least for hundreds of thousands of years it was better for humans to trust than to not trust right?"" said Mitelman.

That cautious view of AI and religion seems to translate across practices a poll from the Christian research group Barna shows.

Over half of Christians 52% said they'd be disappointed if they found out AI was used in their church.

In 2020 leaders from the Roman Catholic Church IBM and Microsoft signed the Rome Call for AI Ethics a joint agreement that would eventually include leaders from Judaism Christianity and Islam to make sure future usage of AI is transparent inclusive responsible and impartial.

But no matter how far the technology goes all three agree the embrace of AI and religious life won't happen overnight.

""Our tradition tells us when two people are studying Torah together the divine presence is with them. And I think you know using AI being with AI can be isolating because you're not with other real flesh-and-blood people"" said Satz.

It's just like when places of worship turned to Zoom: Four years later people are slowly coming back to in-person services. The clergy we spoke to said there's a reason for that.

""If you think about so many of the great conversations that you've had or meetings that you've had how many of them were just sort of serendipitous conversations that you had in the parking lot or at services or you know so much of the joy of life are the unexpected meetings"" said Mitelman.

""Often Christian worship is supposed to be cumbersome. It's supposed to be inconvenient. It requires you to bring your body into a space with other bodies and celebrate the broken and bruised body of the God that we worship"" Callaway said.

Which leads back to that church service in Germany and the idea of bots someday replacing faith leaders.

""I think probably yes it is coming and faster than we think"" said Callaway. ""To me depending upon an algorithm essentially to deliver to us what I think is a moment where humans commune with other humans and with God — if you remove the humans from that equation then it's very quickly you're removing God from the equation too.""

Mitelman agrees.

""I think I would be a fool to say that's never going to happen. I think that's certainly not outside the realm of possibility but I don't think it's going to be hugely accepted"" he said. ""People need humanity here whether that's Christianity Islam Hinduism. So much of religion is not just faith but it is a physical manifestation. So is that kneeling is that kissing the Torah scroll is that standing or sitting.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2Zvcm1lci1jaHVyY2gtaW4tc291dGgtbG9yYWluLWRlZW1lZC1hLW51aXNhbmNlLWNpdHktb3JkZXJzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZW1vbGl0aW9uL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2Zvcm1lci1jaHVyY2gtaW4tc291dGgtbG9yYWluLWRlZW1lZC1hLW51aXNhbmNlLWNpdHktb3JkZXJzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZW1vbGl0aW9uL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former church in South Lorain deemed a nuisance city orders emergency demolition,"A former church located at 1715 E. 31st St. in South Lorain was demolished May 10 because city officials learned vagrants had been inside the structure and partying and maybe even a squatter or two spending time in it.

Dave Faciana chief building official for the city of Lorain’s Building Housing and Planning Department said the Lorain Police Department alerted him May 9 that there were youngsters going inside of the former church.

Faciana said he and one of his building inspectors visited the church later that day and noticed that the roof had collapsed and that someone could fall through it especially on the second floor where the joists are weak.

“At that point I determined that it was an unsafe structure” he said. “We’re doing an emergency demolition.”

American Demolition razed the building.

Faciana said the city doesn’t do emergency demolitions often but this structure fell into that category.

“If there’s an issue and we find out that it’s an unsafe structure and vagrants or squatters in it at that point we determine if it’s unsafe and the hazards of if so that no one gets hurt.”

There was no evidence that people were living in the building but they should not have been in there Faciana said.

“They were in there doing God knows what” he said.

Faciana said the building has been vacant at least five years.

The owners are aware of the city razing the building he said.

The Morning Journal contacted the Lorain County Auditor’s on May 10 to get the names of the owners and contact them for comment.

“We are having issues with our website currently at that’s why you can’t get any owner/address information” according to a statement from the Auditor’s Office. “We don’t have any record of a 1715 E. 31st.”

However for where that address would fall there is an owner the statement said.

Since The Journal cannot confirm the name of the owner it is omitting the name.

However once the building is demolished the owners will receive and invoice from the city for the cost of the flattening the structure.

“If they don’t pay that cost the cost will be assessed to their taxes” Faciana said.

It will cost about $50000 to tear down the building he said.

“This is just another example of a dilapidated building that’s been sitting in Lorain for a long time and these are the things the city needs to do to make it a better community safe for the residents and get rid of these blighted dilapidated buildings” Faciana said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0dm0uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvbXQtb2xpdmUtYmFwdGlzdC1jaHVyY2gtcGl0dHN2aWV3LWFsLWJ1cm5zLWRvd24tYWZ0ZXItYW4tb3Zlcm5pZ2h0LWZpcmUv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3R2bS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9tdC1vbGl2ZS1iYXB0aXN0LWNodXJjaC1waXR0c3ZpZXctYWwtYnVybnMtZG93bi1hZnRlci1hbi1vdmVybmlnaHQtZmlyZS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mt. Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

Meskipun begitu kisah hidup mereka menawarkan nilai-nilai kehidupan yang tidak pernah ditemukan di kota-kota besar.

Judul Di Rumah Panjang : Pergulatan Hidup dan Cinta Orang Dayak Iban Penulis Mulyawan Karim Penerbit Penerbit Buku Kompas Tahun terbit 2021 Jumlah halaman xxiv + 280 halaman ISBN 978-623-346-216-7

Kompas Halaman muka buku berjudul \'Di Rumah Panjang\'

Pulau Kalimantan dahulu digambarkan sebagai wilayah dengan kelembapan hutan tropis dengan aneka fauna dan pohon-pohon yang lebat. Di dalam hutan tersebut tinggal suku Dayak Iban yang suka memberontak dan haus darah pemburu orang-orang asing. Inilah gambaran populer dari narasi kolonial lewat novel The Castaways: a Story of Adventure in the Wilds of Borneo (1870) karangan Mayne Reid.

Namun ternyata novel tersebut hanyalah sebuah cerita fiksi semata tanpa adanya riset panjang tentang masyarakat setempat. Sekitar abad ke-19 banyak peneliti antropologi dari Eropa yang datang ke Kalimantan untuk mengadakan penelitian. Mereka ikut tinggal bersama dengan masyakarat yang diteliti sehingga memberikan gambaran yang jelas tentang orang-orang Dayak Iban. Para peneliti tersebut antara lain Victor King Anton Willem Nieuwenhuis H Hallier G.A.F. Mollengraff dan lain sebagainya.

Satu abad kemudian penelitian mereka memotivasi orang-orang Indonesia untuk melakukan penelitian yang sama. Pada 1994 Kompas bahkan mengadakan Ekspedisi Kapuas-Mahakam untuk melihat kebudayaan masyarakat Dayak setempat. Ekspedisi ini melibatkan 20 peserta inti di mana salah satunya adalah Mulyawan Karim penulis dari buku Di Rumah Panjang: Pergulatan Hidup dan Cinta Orang Dayak Iban (PBK 2021).

Pada saat ekspedisi Mulyawan Karim yang mewawancarai sejumlah orang Iban tidak hanya disiapkan untuk tulisan yang akan dimuat di Kompas. Namun ia juga menyiapkan untuk dimuat sebagai buku yang menceritakan kisah hidup orang-orang Iban selama penulis tinggal bersama mereka. Tetapi riset yang telah ia lakukan sejak tahun 1994 tersebut baru benar-benar terbit menjadi buku setelah 30 tahun lamanya.

Dayak Iban

Suku Dayak Iban adalah satu dari sekian banyak sub suku Dayak yang tinggal di Pulau Kalimantan. Mereka tinggal dalam kelompok-kelompok berdasarkan su sukunya di suatu wilayah yang mereka kuasai. Dayak Iban sendiri banyak ditemui di Kalimantan Barat Kabupaten Kapuas Hulu dan Sintang. Namun ada juga orang Iban yang tinggal di wilayah Sarawak Malaysia karena kedua tempat tersebut memang berdekatan.

Banyak peneliti mengatakan bahwa untuk melakukan riset tentang suku Dayak kita tidak bisa memisahkannya berdasarkan negara di Kalimantan yang terdiri dari Indonesia Malaysia dan Brunei. Kita harus melihat suku bangsa Dayak dalam satu kesatuan Pulau Kalimantan.

Orang Iban sendiri sebenarnya berasal dari wilayah yang kini menjadi Provinsi Kalimantan Barat namun kemudian mereka bermigrasi hingga ke wilayah Sarawak sekarang. Tetapi ada juga yang kembali dari Sarawak ke Kalimantan Barat menghindari kejaran dari pemerintah kolonial Inggris.

Kini orang Iban di Kalimantan Barat jumlahnya tidak terlalu besar dibandingkan orang Iban yang tinggal di Sarawak. Pada sensus 2010 populasi orang Iban di Sarawak berjumlah 8.585.242 jiwa. Sedangkan di Kalimantan Barat pada tahun 2017 jumlahnya hanya 19.978 jiwa.

Namun sebenarnya ada kemungkinan terdapat orang-orang Iban yang tinggal menyebar selain di Kapuas Hulu dan Sintang meskipun jumlahnya tidak signifikan. Sehingga orang Iban menjadi terhitung sebagai minoritas karena hidup bersama suku-suku lainnya yang populasinya lebih besar.

Rumah Panjang

Orang Iban biasa hidup dalam kelompok-kelompok yang masing-masing keluarga tinggal di sebuah rumah besar yang disebut rumah panjang atau rumah panjai. Disebut rumah panjang karena memang bentuknya yang memanjang hingga 100 meter bahkan lebih tergantung ketersediaan tanahnya. Rumah panjang dibangun secara tradisional dengan konsep rumah panggung dan memanfaatkan bahan-bahan dari alam sekitar.

Rumah panjang biasanya ditinggali oleh beberapa keluarga-keluarga besar yang jumlahnya bisa puluhan. Ibaratnya rumah panjang merupakan rumah yang dibangun saling menempel sebelah-menyebelah ke arah samping. Saking banyaknya jumlah penghuni di rumah panjang sehingga rumah tersebut dianggap setara dengan kampung atau dusun.

Banyak antropolog dan peneliti lain yang menganggap bahwa rumah panjang Dayak Iban merupakan wujud dari organisasi sosial dan sistem kepemilikan yang bersifat komunal. Padahal anggapan tersebut adalah salah. Rumah panjang pada dasarnya adalah gabungan dari rumah individual yang masing-masingnya dibangun dan dimiliki sendiri oleh setiap keluarga penghuninya. Hal ini dapat diartikan bahwa setiap keluarga penghuni bersifat independen dan tidak bergantung dari keluarga di sebelahnya.

Tiap-tiap keluarga yang menghuni rumah panjang tinggal di dalam sebuah ruangan yang bernama bilik. Bilik yang luasnya kira-kira 4x5 meter merupakan ruang keluarga sebagai tempat untuk menyimpan benda-benda berharga tempat untuk tidur dan berkegiatan sehari-hari. Mereka yang tinggal di dalam bilik biasanya merupakan keluarga besar yang terdiri dari kakek nenek suami istri dan anak-anak.

Di atas bilik terdapat ruang penyimpanan yang disebut sebagai sadau. Tempat tersebut berfungsi untuk menimbun padi hasil ladang yang tersimpang di tong-tong besar terbuat dari kulit kayu. Kemudian di depan bilik terdapat jalan yang menghubungkan antar bilik yang dibernama ruai. Ruai adalah ruangan yang tidak terpotong oleh sekat-sekat dinding biasanya digunakan untuk akses jalan para penghuni. Sedangkan di bagian luar rumah panjang ada selasar yang bernama tanju yang digunakan untuk berbagai kegiatan luar ruangan.

Ngayap

Kehidupan orang Dayak Iban yang tinggal di pedalaman hutan Kalimantan tidaklah jauh berbeda dengan kebanyakan orang. Namun aktivitas mereka sehari-hari tidak dapat dilepaskan dari kebudayaan dan hukum adat.

Salah satu yang ditonjolkan dalam kumpulan kisah di buku ini adalah ekspresi cinta orang Iban antara laki-laki dengan perempuan. Bagi orang Iban hubungan cinta antar pasangan ini dinamakan sebagai ngayap.

Ngayap adalah tradisi orang Iban dalam menjalin hubungan asmara ketika mereka berusia remaja. Mereka menjalin hubungan cinta dengan lawan jenis tetapi belum terikat perkawinan.

Namun orang Iban memiliki keunikan tersendiri dalam mengekspresikan perasaan cintanya kepada lawan jenisnya. Ketika seorang laki-laki Iban yang jatuh cinta kepada salah satu perempuan Iban tidak secara langsung memperkenalkan dirinya ataupun mengungkapkan perasaannya. Dia terlebih dahulu melakukan pengamatan di mana bilik dan rumah panjang tempat perempuan itu tinggal.

Setelah menemukan biliknya pada malam hari laki-laki Iban akan menyelinap secara diam-diam masuk ke dalam bilik perempuan itu dan mengajaknya tidur bersama-sama tetapi tidak boleh sampai berhubungan suami-istri. Hal ini harus dilakukan secara sembunyi-sembunyi dan tidak boleh diketahui oleh orangtua perempuan.

Namun dalam ngayap seorang perempuan Iban diperbolehkan menolak ajakan tidur bersama laki-laki yang datang ke biliknya. Laki-laki yang ditolak tidak boleh marah dan harus menerima setiap keputusan perempuan yang diajaknya tidur. Hal ini membuat laki-laki Iban tidak hanya sekali melakukan ngayap tapi bisa berulang-ulang. Alasannya bisa saja dia belum menemukan perempuan yang mau diajaknya tidur atau juga ada yang senang tidur bersama perempuan tanpa harus memiliki perasaan cinta.

Apabila laki-laki dan perempuan Iban dalam ngayap sudah menemukan kecocokan mereka akan melanjutkan hubungan ke jenjang yang lebih serius yakni pernikahan. Tetapi dalam tradisi Iban pernikahan hanya bisa dilakukan apabila mendapatkan restu terlebih dahulu dari orangtua.

Tradisi menjodohkan anak ternyata juga terjadi di suku iban. Akibatnya ada saja pasangan yang sebelumnya telah ngayap dan mendapatkan kecocokan tetapi tidak direstui orangtua. Apabila pasangan tidak mendapatkan restu biasanya pesta pernikahannya akan berlangsung sederhana. Berbeda dengan mereka yang mendapatkan restu. Pesta pernihakan yang mendapatkan restu orangtua biasanya diselenggarapan secara meriah.

Pernikahan orang Iban juga memiliki keunikan tersendiri. Mereka diperbolehkan menikah dengan saudara sepupunya sendiri yang sesama orang Iban. Hanya menikah dengan saudara kandung yang tidak diperbolehkan. Kebanyakan orang Iban juga menikah di usia belasan tahun atau ketika ia masih di tingkat remaja.

Pergeseran Budaya

Perkembangan zaman yang kian modern membuat tradisi dan kebudayaan orang Iban juga mengalami perubahan. Namun masih banyak tradisi yang tetap dipertahankan. Salah satu contoh tradisi ngayap sudah sangat jarang dilakukan khususnya di Sarawak Malaysia. Tradisi ngayap kian ditinggalkan karena kian tergeser maknanya. Aktivitas ngayap seringkali justru dimanfaatkan untuk melakukan hubungan suami-istri yang dilarang dalam adat.

Orang Iban yang tinggal di Kalimantan Barat Indonesia juga pernah mengalami perubahan kebudayaan. Pada tahun 1977 Pemerintah Indonesia membuatkan rumah-rumah tinggal yang berdiri sendiri di luar rumah panjang. Namun setelah orang Iban tinggal di rumah itu mereka merasa tidak cocok karena dalam melakukan aktivitas sehari-hari mereka harus bekerja sendiri. Padahal di rumah panjang mereka terbiasa saling bantu-membantu. Hal ini membuat orang Iban kembali lagi ke rumah panjang dan rumah yang dibangun pemerintah dibiarkan terbengkalai.

“Sejatinya hidup tanpa cinta bagai taman tak berbunga!..

Sejatinya hidup tanpa cinta bagai lautan tak berpenghuni!..

Sejatinya hidup tanpa cinta bagai sayur tanpa garam. Hampa!..

Sejatinya organisasi tanpa cinta hanyalah perkumpulan biasa!..

Sejatinya organisasi tanpa cinta orasi tanpa makna!..

Sejatinya organisasi tanpa cinta gerakan tanpa tujuan!..”

Cinta ialah rasa yang tak pernah diketahui bentuknya. Jauh dari itu adalah tindakan penuh rasa. Cinta ketika kau merasa sedih aku pun demikian. Ketika aku senang kau pun merasakan. Begitu apa yang dikatakan Kahlil Gibran pujangga dengan Sayap-Sayap Patah-nya menggemparkan seluruh cinta di lapisan muka bumi.

Demikian di zaman yang modern hari ini kemasan cinta tertuang dalam berbagai bentuk yang sangat menarik. Dari yang biasa saja hingga yang paling ekstrim menuangkan cinta dalam pergerakan organisasi. Kecintaan selalu tumbuh dimana saja tak tau tempat ketika ingin hinggap dan menetap di sana cinta berkuasa. Cinta pun mempunyai suatu batasan suatu pegangan atau kisah percintaan dalam setiap perjalanan. Untuk kali ini penulis akan membahas kemasan cinta dalam organisasi.

Di era modern ini ketakutan mahasiswa untuk berorganisasi menjadi tantangan terbesar dalam kemajuan suatu organisasi. Momok organisasi dalam pandangan mahasiswa begitu sangat menakutkan membosankan mengerikan dengan dibenturkan pada tuntutan orang tua agar segera menyelesaikan kuliah tepat waktu. Namun dalam hal ini tidak kah kita berpikir bahwa organisasi sangat penting bagi mahasiswa? Sebagai suatu proses dalam rangka menyambut hidup yang sesungguhnya; dunia kerja.

Dalam hal ini dengan melakukan kajian mendalam tidak kah kita menghiasi suatu organisasi dengan cinta dan penuangan penuh rasa? Terkadang aura semangat organisasi selalu ada di bawah tekanan aura percintaan. Bukan tidak boleh hanya saja cinta selalu tidak tahu tempat. Permasalahan cinta selalu dibawa ke dalam ranah organisasi yang memang akan berpengaruh pada kemajuan organisasi. Ini pun harus menjadi titik fokus pengkajian organisator sejati bahwa kemasan organisasi harus sedikit seksi. Suara lantang orasi menggebu tidaklah membangun semangat mahasiswa untuk berorganisasi membangun negeri  belajar bersama membangun silaturahmi dalam organisasi.

Berbagai tujuan mahasiswa masuk keanggotaan dalam organisasi ada berdasarkan keinginan sendiri ajakan teman ajakan kerabat hingga karena cinta. Bukan kah selayaknya kita bersyukur ditengah krisis minat mahasiswa untuk berorganisasi namun masih ada mahasiswa yang tertarik dengan organisasi sekalipun itu karena cinta. Dalam hal ini peran organisator terbaik sangatlah penting dimana ia mampu mengemas suatu organisasi serenyah cinta berbunga dan bahagia.

Aura cinta ini yang seharusnya dimanfaatkan oleh organisator dalam rangka memajukan suatu organisasi di tengah zaman krisis minat mahasiswa dalam keanggotaan organisasi. Kemasan organisasi untuk hari ini ialah tiada lain untuk merubah momok organisasi dalam pandangan mahasiswa yang begitu mengerikan. Peluang besar seorang organisator ialah ada pada persoalan cinta dalam organisasi bagaimana mengemasnya dengan baik sedikit demi sedikit merubah pandangan mahasiswa mengenai organisasi yang mengerikan. Ternyata mengasikan seperti persoalan percintaan.

Rasa depresi sering kali hinggap rasa bosan sering kali datang sekalipun itu ada pada organisator sejati karena ini persoalan manusiawi. Persoalan ini sering kali keluar dalam koridor organisasi ini menjadi pokok permasalahan yang sering kali dihadapi dalam suatu organisasi. Dalam hal ini seorang organisator dapat meluapkan seluruh keluh-kesah mengenai kemajuan organisasi kepada cinta. Mendudukkan persoalan cinta dengan bijaksana adalah keharusan tidak lantas karena persoalan cinta dapat menghambat kemajuan suatu organisasi.

Rasa lelah capek dalam rangka memajukan suatu organisasi sebaiknya dituangkan dalam cinta. Begitupun sebaliknya rasa bosan dalam percintaan sebaiknya dituangkan dalam organisasi. Di zaman yang modern ini kemasan organisasi seharusnya dikemas serenyah mungkin seperti menelan aroma cinta.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8va2Fsc2VsLmFudGFyYW5ld3MuY29tL2Jlcml0YS8yOTU1MDkvYmlydS1iYXJ1LW1lbmNlcml0YWthbi1yYXNhLXN5dWt1ci1kYW4tY2ludGEtZGktbGFndS1iZW5kZXJhbmfSAW5odHRwczovL2thbHNlbC5hbnRhcmFuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvYmVyaXRhLzI5NTUwOS9iaXJ1LWJhcnUtbWVuY2VyaXRha2FuLXJhc2Etc3l1a3VyLWRhbi1jaW50YS1kaS1sYWd1LWJlbmRlcmFuZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Biru Baru menceritakan rasa syukur dan cinta di lagu ""Benderang!""",,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhcy5jb20vaHlwZS9yZWFkLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEvMDgzODU1MjY2L2RhcGF0LXN1cmF0LWNpbnRhLWRhcmktcHV0cmlueWEtcnViZW4tb25zdS1jaWNpLXlhbmctc3dlZXTSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC5rb21wYXMuY29tL2h5cGUvcmVhZC8yMDIxLzExLzIxLzA4Mzg1NTI2Ni9kYXBhdC1zdXJhdC1jaW50YS1kYXJpLXB1dHJpbnlhLXJ1YmVuLW9uc3UtY2ljaS15YW5nLXN3ZWV0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dapat Surat Cinta dari Putrinya Ruben Onsu: Cici yang Sweet - Kompas.com,"JAKARTA KOMPAS.com - Ruben Onsu mendadak dapat surat cinta dari putrinya Thalia Putri Onsu.

IoT security is where endpoint detection and response (EDR) and enterprise mobility management (EMM) meet the challenges of a rapidly expanding edge computing infrastructure. As the enterprise attack surface grows IoT is yet another attack vector organizations aren’t fully prepared to defend.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the smart consumer and business systems powering the homes factories and enterprise processes of tomorrow. By year-end total IoT device installations will surpass 35 billion and extend to 55 billion by 2025.

Enterprise organizations recognize this shift and need to invest in device management and endpoint security capabilities. In 2016 $91 million was spent on IoT endpoint security solutions. Five years later that number has skyrocketed to $631 million. With the growth of segments like industrial IoT (IIoT) Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and industrial control systems (ICS) IoT security will continue to be critical to business continuity vulnerability management and threat remediation.

This article looks at the top IoT security solutions current commercial features associated risks and considerations for organizations choosing an IoT vendor.

What Are IoT Security Solutions?

IoT security solutions are the software and embedded tools used to monitor edge devices proactively detect threats and facilitate remediation. As such current IoT security solutions are a mix of standalone and bundle plans that include existing tools like EDR encryption IAM EMM and more to protect connected devices and networks.

What Are IoT Devices?

IoT is the broad label given to all devices capable of communicating with each other often at short range with unique identities and few components outside its operational intent including security features. Because of this several organizations are building security into a new generation of IoT devices (embedded security) while other vendors offer agent-based software to monitor and protect IoT devices.

Examples of IoT devices include most consumer smart systems autonomous machinery and vehicles office appliances and a multitude of healthcare devices.

Considerations for Choosing an IoT Security Solution

How does the solution isolate IoT devices and access from critical segments?

What protocols and tools are available for secure transactions? (TLS encryption Auth0)

Are there embedded or built-in IoT security requirements to address exposure?

What policy controls can administrators configure for unmanaged devices or users?

Does the solution issue and manage secure credentials like PKI and code signatures?

Can solution operators identify categorize and provision new devices?

How does the solution establish trust between devices? (e.g. key injection or HSMs)

IoT Security Solution Features

Network scanning device identification and discovery of active connections

Identify users data devices locations and more to identify and assess risk categories

Threat intelligence informs the status of malware and available patches

Security gateways to isolate network segments between ports servers and IoT devices

Baseline responses to anomalous behavior for individuals or clusters of devices

Define and enforce policies across device and access types for hybrid infrastructures

Automated onboarding configuration and threat response policies for new IoT devices

Certificate issuance and management for granting secure credentials and access

Because securing IoT devices is a budding cybersecurity segment the above list is not all-encompassing and several vendors present unique approaches to addressing IoT security challenges.

IoT Device Risks and Vulnerabilities

Once isolated from other devices and an organization’s larger IT environment IoT devices like sensors doorbells and printers are now at risk of compromise. With proper segmentation organizations can avoid access to an IoT device turning into something more but that won’t stop threat actors from using the device and others like it in a botnet attack.

Other identified risks associated with IoT device management include:

Insufficient security or data protection capabilities for devices

Inability to add additional security software

Insecure interfaces easily accessible to a persistent threat

Poor password protection with default credentials staying put

Unreliable patch or update mechanism

Nonexistent or lacking inventory of IoT devices or monitoring IoT traffic

A gap in IoT security management skills for edge systems

Disparate management of IoT and OT systems creating data silos

IoT Security: Not Going Away

The proliferation of IoT devices means securing the next generation of IT environments will require IoT-specific security strategies and solutions. Organizations actively deploying IoT devices should be prudent about the security risks of insecure edge devices and proceed with caution.

Organizations need to visualize IoT assets under management profile their risk apply adequate protections and monitor IoT traffic for unknown threats. Like so much else in cybersecurity visibility informs action and strategy – making the upfront work of selecting an IoT security solution or assembly a strategy that much more valuable in avoiding unnecessary risk.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGFja2VybmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS9ub3J0aC1rb3JlYW4taGFja2Vycy1mb3VuZC1iZWhpbmQtcmFuZ2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Korean Hackers Found Behind a Range of Credential Theft Campaigns,"A threat actor with ties to North Korea has been linked to a prolific wave of credential theft campaigns targeting research education government media and other organizations with two of the attacks also attempting to distribute malware that could be used for intelligence gathering.

Enterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the infiltrations to a group it tracks as TA406 and by the wider threat intelligence community under the monikers Kimsuky (Kaspersky) Velvet Chollima (CrowdStrike) Thallium (Microsoft) Black Banshee (PwC) ITG16 (IBM) and the Konni Group (Cisco Talos).

Policy experts journalists and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were targeted as part of weekly campaigns observed between from January through June 2021 Proofpoint researchers Darien Huss and Selena Larson disclosed in a technical report detailing the actor's tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) with the attacks spread across North America Russia China and South Korea.

Known to be operational as early as 2012 Kimsuky has since emerged as one of the most active advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for setting its sights on cyber espionage but also for conducting attacks for financial gain targeting government entities think tanks and individuals identified as experts in various fields as well as harvest sensitive information pertaining to foreign policy and national security issues.

""Like other APT groups that constitute a big umbrella Kimsuky contains several clusters: BabyShark AppleSeed Flower Power and Gold Dragon"" Kaspersky researchers noted in their Q3 2021 APT trends report published last month. The AppleSeed sub-group is also referred to as TA408.

The group is also known for reeling in targets with convincing social engineering schemes and watering hole attacks before sending them malware-infected payloads or tricking them into submitting sensitive credentials to phishing sites the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a public alert issued in October 2020.

Earlier this month researchers from Cisco Talos disclosed an ongoing Kimsuky campaign since June 2021 that was found leveraging malicious blogs hosted on Google's Blogger platform to target high-value South Korean targets including geopolitical and aerospace research agencies with the goal of delivering a ""constantly evolving set of implants derived from the Gold Dragon/Brave Prince family"" that act as file exfiltrators information gatherers and credential stealers for reconnaissance espionage and credential harvesting.

""This campaign begins with malicious Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) containing macros being delivered to victims"" Talos researchers explained. ""The infection chain results in the malware reaching out to malicious blogs set up by the attackers. These blogs provide the attackers the ability to update the malicious content posted in the blog depending on whether a victim is of value to the attackers.""

Now in what appears to be a further ramping up of attacks the threat actor simultaneously commenced near-weekly email threat campaigns using the identities of legitimate policy experts while featuring themes related to nuclear weapon safety politics and Korean foreign policy ultimately luring the targeted individuals to give up their corporate credentials via a rogue URL embedded in the messages that redirect the victims to custom credential-harvesting pages.

Kimsuky's phishing campaigns had a noticeable shift in March 2021 when the emails moved beyond credential theft to become a medium for distributing malware coinciding with North Korea's missile tests conducted later that month.

The emails included a link that sent the target to an attacker-controlled domain used to trick targets into downloading a compressed archive incorporating a binary which is orchestrated to create a scheduled task that is executed every 15 minutes to install additional malware from a remote server. However the ultimate motive behind the attacks remains unclear as no follow-on payloads were observed.

Another notable attack in June resulted in the deployment of a downloader (""FatBoy"") using an HTML attachment lure that was then used to retrieve a next-stage reconnaissance script capable of collecting ""extensive information"" about the targeted device. Proofpoint said that both the campaigns exhibited overlaps with attacks previously identified as mounted by the Konni Group.

Other notable tools in its malware arsenal encompass a Windows keylogger dubbed YoreKey a number of rogue Android apps striking cryptocurrency users in South Korea a deobfuscation service named Deioncube to decode files encrypted with ionCube's source code protection software and a sextortion scam that urges email recipients to transfer an amount worth $500 in bitcoin to a valid wallet associated with a South Korea-based NGO.

""It's unknown whether the NGO was compromised and the donation message was placed on their website maliciously or if there's another explanation"" the researchers said. ""As of June 2021 the associated bitcoin wallet had received and sent about 3.77 bitcoin.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vYmlnY291bnRyeXByZXBzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzIxLzE3OTg0OS_SATJodHRwczovL2JpZ2NvdW50cnlwcmVwcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yMS8xNzk4NDkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TOURNAMENT RECAP: Jim Ned girls blaze through Pug Parris Classic to remain unbeaten,"The Jim Ned girls basketball team topped El Paso Mountain View 58-42 on Saturday at McMurry University’s Kimbrel Arena to complete a perfect run through the inaugural Pug Parris Classic and claim the tournament championship.

The No. 13 Lady Indians who earned their spot in the title game with impressive wins over El Paso Ysleta (70-26) Lubbock Trinity Christian (69-32) and Wylie (47-36) raced out to a 17-8 first-quarter lead on Mountain View and were never threatened after in improving to 7-0 on the season.

Yet this one wasn’t close for the majority of the game.

Dublin went to halftime with a 27-7 lead before Palmer’s offense woke up and the game turned into a shootout. Still the Lions’ 20-point halftime margin proved wide enough for them to advance to the regional semifinals with a 41-34 win.

After a somewhat disappointing end to the regular season — losing 40-39 to Eastland in the unofficial district title game — the Lions have come into the playoffs with the right amount of intensity. Quarterback Chris Teten has led Dublin past Callisburg and Palmer and will now lead his team to rougher waters.

The Lions match up against Gunter 3A Division II’s defending champion in the regional semifinals. Gunter is 12-0 and most recently beat Millsap 62-12 in the area round.

For reference Dublin lost 44-41 to Millsap.

Jim Ned wins after big second half

Up 21-14 at halftime Jim Ned had played one of its closest two quarters of the season against Muleshoe.

The second half however was all Indians.

Jim Ned outscored Muleshoe 28-6 in the final 24 minutes punching its ticket in the regional semifinals.

There the Indians will meet traditional power Brock which swept by River Road 54-8.

Jim Ned won this same matchup 19-16 in 2020 on its way to the Class 3A Division I championship.

Jim Ned outgained Muleshoe 525-300 holding the Mules below 50% passing.

Unsurprisingly Xavier Wishert had another head-turning performance in Jim Ned’s backfield. The senior ran for 327 yards and four touchdowns. His longest run was a 99-yard touchdown in the second half.

The 12-0 Indians have their toughest test of the season in round three.

Brock is the No. 2 team in 3A Division I in the regional semifinals.

Stephenville beats Paris

Winning by 12 points Stephenville played its closest game of 2021 in the area round. The Yellowjackets improved to 12-0 with a 22-10 win over the Wildcats.

It was a rare defensive battle for the Yellow Jackets as they went to halftime leading 6-3. They found more life in the second half scoring two touchdowns to escape with a win — one likely closer than Stephenville expected.

The play that was the clincher was Ryder Lambert’s 63-yard haul to wide receiver Reece Elston. It was a one-score 16-10 game before that but Elston’s grab put Paris away for good.

After a low-scoring area game Stephenville plays Argyle (11-1) in the regional semifinals. The Eagles beat Kennedale 27-3 in their area game to set up what will be one of the most anticipated games of the 4A Division I playoffs.

2A beatdowns

In the 2A Division I playoffs Cisco and Coleman had no trouble with their round-two opponents.

Cisco won 69-21 over a good Panhandle squad. The Loboes ran for 622 yards and nine touchdowns/

With 334 yards and three touchdowns Hunter Long was Cisco’s leading rusher. Long also threw a touchdown pass to tight end Dawson Hearne.

In their first two playoff games the Loboes’ offense has exploded combining for 124 points. The level of difficulty increases significantly in round three however as Cisco faces an undefeated New Deal squad.

The Lions edged Forsan 28-24.

Coleman posted a 43-0 shutout of Post which played in the 2020 state final to move on.

The Bluecats outgained Post 395-203 and forced three turnovers. Jadin Jackson and Devinar Roberson both scored three total touchdowns a piece.

Coleman will get Hawley in the regional semifinals. Hawley also cruised to a round-two win scoring 40 points in the first half to beat Sundown.

Jayton outlasts Loraine with big second half

Friday’s battle between Jayton and Loraine was a low-scoring one — something rare for six-man playoff games.

Loraine led 8-6 at halftime before Jayton’s normally-potent offense found its groove. The Jaybirds outscored Loraine 28-0 in the second half to win 34-14 to advance to the Region II final.

Jayton will see Motley County in the regional final. The Matadors are 13-0 and earned an impressive 68-44 win over Balmorhea in the regional semifinals.

Six-man blowouts

Aside from Jayton-Loraine none of the other Big Country six-man playoff games were close.

In the battle of the Greyhounds Strawn — 1A Division II’s No. 2 team — had no trouble with Throckmorton winning 61-8. Meanwhile Gordon cruised to an 82-37 win over Gold-Burg to seal its spot in the Region III final.

Strawn and Gordon will play against each other in the Region III final in Dublin on Wednesday. It will be a rivalry game as just 8.3 miles separate Strawn and Gordon.

May also cruised in the second round beating Jonesboro 84-55. Ranked No. 1 in 1A Division I the Tigers face Water Valley in the Region IV championship.

And Westbrook put together another impressive performance to move on. The Wildcats beat Rankin 86-38 and will play defending state champion Sterling City in the 1A Division I Region II final.

Sterling City eliminated Westbrook in the playoffs in 2020 en route to its title.

Inflation — the decline of purchasing power as prices rise — is currently at its highest level in 30 years. This has led to concern among the public and policymakers about the rising costs of many important products like food shelter gasoline electricity and cars. Senator Joe Manchin has said he will not “support a package that risks hurting American families suffering from historic inflation.” As a result CCL has received many inquiries from congressional offices volunteers and other stakeholders regarding the potential impact a carbon price would have on inflation.

The short answer is that well-designed carbon pricing legislation — like the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICDA) and those currently under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee — includes a dividend returned to most or all American households precisely to address the resulting rise in energy costs. Inflation creates a problem when prices rise and household incomes don’t increase commensurately but a dividend program can overcome that problem by sending carbon cashback to households.

Moreover a recent review of carbon pricing systems in Canada and Europe found that contrary to economic modeling predictions that carbon fees will cause inflation carbon fees have actually had the opposite effect in the real world.

What do economic models say about carbon pricing and inflation?

The answer to this question depends on the level of the carbon price and the rate at which it rises. According to modeling by the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP) the EICDA would add approximately 2.4 points to inflation over 10 years or 0.24% per year. For comparison the Federal Reserve aims for a 2% annual inflation rate. Moreover the carbon pricing structures currently under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee will likely rise significantly more slowly than the EICDA and thus have even less impact on inflation.

A carbon price included in the budget reconciliation process would also likely exempt retail gasoline (which would have a relatively small effect on the resulting carbon emissions cuts) and thus would not impact gasoline prices. According to modeling analyses by Resources for the Future and CGEP a carbon price of $20 per ton would raise average U.S. electricity prices by about 0.5–1 cent per kilowatt-hour and average household electricity bills by only about $4–8 per month. As the carbon price rises so would average electricity bills but the dividend would increase as well to offset those costs.

How have existing carbon prices impacted real-world inflation?

A July 2021 discussion paper from the ​​Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) examined existing carbon pricing systems in Europe and Canada and found a very different answer than economic models predicted: “carbon taxes do not have to be inflationary and may even have deflationary effects.”

In the real-world carbon pricing examples evaluated in this paper the potential inflationary effects of increased energy prices have generally been offset by decreases in the prices of other commodities like food services and shelter. The paper also found that countries that return carbon tax revenue to households particularly have not seen inflationary effects.

The authors found evidence that household consumption fell after carbon prices were implemented resulting in lower food shelter and services prices for everyone. In British Columbia where lower-income households benefited most from the distribution of carbon fee revenues most of the decreased consumption came from high-income households who typically have much larger carbon footprints. Carbon pricing impacts on overall economic growth and employment were found to be insignificant despite the decrease in consumption perhaps due to the substantial and immediate health benefits associated with cleaner air that were not considered in the CEPR paper.

Is current inflation a long-term or short-term problem?

The current trend of inflation has largely been caused by the disruption of supply chains and labor supplies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As these disruptions are gradually fixed economists expect inflation to slow although it’s unclear exactly how long that will take. As Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis assistant vice president Fernando M. Martin put it “even though higher inflation may be transitory the transition may last longer than expected.”

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg in October expect inflation to slow to 3.4% next summer and hit 2.6% by the end of 2022; lower than the recent rate of around 5% though still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. But the carbon pricing structures under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee in the budget reconciliation process likely will not begin implementation before 2023. At that point supply chain and labor market problems and thus inflation will likely have begun to ease.

Economists and analysts from leading rating agencies have also said that the budget reconciliation package as a whole will not add to inflationary pressures. Seventeen Nobel Prize-winning economists similarly concluded “Because this agenda invests in long-term economic capacity and will enhance the ability of more Americans to participate productively in the economy it will ease longer-term inflationary pressures.” And as noted above the ​​CEPR analysis has shown that carbon pricing has not caused inflation in the real world and in fact has tended to have the opposite effect.

It’s also important to note that volatile oil and gas supplies and prices have been a significant contributing factor to the current inflationary trend. In his testimony this week to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee International Energy Agency Chief Energy Economist Tim Gould told committee chairman Joe Manchin that in Europe the countries that have experienced the lowest recent electricity price increases are primarily those “that had invested heavily in renewables in the Nordic states.” In the long term climate policies like carbon pricing that transition the energy system away from fossil fuels and their volatile prices will help guard against inflationary problems.

The evidence thus overwhelmingly indicates that the inclusion of a carbon price and dividend in the budget reconciliation package in addition to significantly enhancing greenhouse gas emissions cuts will not worsen inflationary effects and may in fact help to ease inflation.

FOR SUBSCRIBERS:'The blood. The CPR. The dead.' A moment-to-moment account of the Waukesha Christmas Parade that turned into tragedy

Here's what we know:

The incident: A driver in a red SUV plowed through the parade

Darrell Brooks Jr. is accused of driving the SUV into the parade route about 4:40 p.m. according to Waukesha police. Brooks was driving at a much higher rate of speed than the parade vehicles and he kept driving after hitting scores of participants according to witness video footage.

A Waukesha police officer fired at Brooks' vehicle after Brooks broke through the barricades police said but the officer stopped to avoid injuring any parade spectators. Brooks kept driving through the parade route.

More than 60 people were hurt in the attack including members of a girls dance team the Waukesha South High School Marching Band a Catholic priest and a group of dancing grandmothers known as the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies.

An 8-year-old boy named Jackson Sparks who was marching in the parade with the Waukesha Blazers baseball team died two days after being struck. His older brother Tucker was also struck by Brooks' SUV abd survived.

Three members of the Dancing Grannies — Virginia ""Ginny"" Sorenson 79; Leanna ""Lee"" Owen 71; Tamara Durand 52 — as well as Wilhelm ""Bill"" Hospel 81 the husband of one of the dancers were among the deaths resulting from Sunday's attack. Also killed was Jane Kulich 52 a team member from Citizens Bank who was walking with a parade float and was struck.

The suspect: Darrell Brooks Jr. charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide

Brooks has been charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide.

Waukesha County Circuit Court Commissioner Kevin Costello set bail for Brooks at $5 million.

Brooks was out on bail at the time of the parade attack with an open court case related to domestic violence.

Brooks has been charged three times in less than two years with recklessly endangering the safety of others most recently on Nov. 5 as part of a domestic abuse incident for which he was also charged with resisting or obstructing an officer.

In the most recent case a woman told police Brooks purposefully ran her ""over with his vehicle"" while she was walking through a gas station parking lot after he had followed her there after a fight according to the criminal complaint.

Less than 24 hours after the parade attack Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm’s office released a statement saying a prosecutor had recommended an “inappropriately low” $1000 bail in Brooks’ earlier felony domestic violence case.

Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson did not say what triggered Brooks to plow through the parade. Thompson said the incident is not considered to be domestic terrorism.

Just before the parade attack Brooks was involved in a domestic disturbance about a mile north of the parade.

The President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind today felicitated the awardees of the cleanest cities of India at the ‘Swachh Amrit Mahotsav’ hosted as part of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) at Vigyan Bhavan New Delhi. The award ceremony organized to recognize the good work done for Swachhata by towns/ cities States and Union Territories under various initiatives of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) viz. Swachh Survekshan 2021 Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge and certifications for Garbage Free Star rating for cities – saw more than 300 awards under various categories being given away through the day.

For the fifth consecutive year Indore was awarded the title of India’s Cleanest City under Swachh Survekshan while Surat and Vijayawada bagged the second and third spots respectively in the ‘more than 1 lakh population’ category.

Karnataka and Mizoram became the ‘Fastest Mover States’ in the big (more than 100 ULBs) and small (less than 100 ULBs) state category respectively.

Speaking at the event the President said that this year's Swachh Survekshan Awards have special significance because we are celebrating 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav'. He noted that Safai Mitras and sanitation workers have continuously rendered their services even during the COVID pandemic. He said that the government is committed to ensure that life of no sanitation worker is put at risk due to unsafe cleaning practices. The President said that effective management of solid waste is essential to keep the cities clean. He stressed that environment conservation has been an integral part of the traditional lifestyle of India. Today whole world is emphasising on environment protection in which focus is on to reduce reuse and recycle the resources. He noted that good examples are coming out of the idea of ​​'Waste to Wealth' and many start-ups are active in these areas. He said that appropriate schemes could be developed to encourage entrepreneurship and investment in these areas.

Shri Hardeep Singh Puri Union Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs speaking on the occasion said that the achievements under SBM-U have been the result of unprecedented collective efforts. He said that today the Mission has taken the shape of a people’s movement – a true ‘Jan Andolan’. This is also reflected in the massive growth of the Swachh Survekshan which began as a pilot in 2016 among 73 cities and is the world’s largest urban cleanliness survey today. He said that the next few years will be dedicated to focusing on holistic cleanliness i.e. Clean Air Clean Land and Clean Water. The Minister said that we owe it to our future generations to create greener and inclusive cities. He congratulated the Swachhata Champions of urban India through this celebration which is appropriately titled Swachh Amrit Mahotsav.

Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and Shri Kaushal Kishore Minister of State for Housing & Urban Affairs also felicitated the awardee cities and States in the presence of dignitaries including the Chief Ministers of Chhattisgarh and Sikkim and Lieutenant Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

Over the years Swachh Survekshan (SS) has emerged as an effective tool for transforming the urban landscape. Despite the on-ground challenges posed by COVID-19 a team of over 2000 assessors visited over 65000 wards in a record time of 28 days. Maharashtra has successfully bagged a total of 92 awards the highest by any State in this year’s Survekshan followed by Chhattisgarh with 67 awards. Additionally under the Prerak Daaur Samman a new performance category introduced under Swachh Survekshan 2021 five cities – Indore Surat Navi Mumbai New Delhi Municipal Council and Tirupati were categorized as ‘Divya’ (Platinum). This year’s Survekshan participated by 4320 cities also saw an unprecedented number of citizens’ feedback – over 5 crores compared to 1.87 cores last year. SS 2021 has also helped identify over 6000 innovations and best practices in sanitation and waste management from across the urban India.

The second session of today’s event was dedicated to Safaimitras the frontline soldiers of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban. Commemorating World Toilet Day (19 November) this session saw the top performers under the first ever Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge being recognized. Indore Navi Mumbai Nellore and Dewas emerged as the top performers across different population categories among 246 participating cities in the Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge launched last year by MoHUA to eradicate human fatalities from hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. Among the States Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh bagged the award for best performing State and Union Territory under the Challenge. In the last one year the SafaiMitra Suraksha Challenge has been able to propel the ‘manhole to machine hole’ revolution in urban India through initiatives such as credit linkages of SafaiMitras with banks through the National Safai Karamchari Financial Development Corporation (NSKFDC) on-the-job trainings through the Sector Skill Council for Green Jobs and setting up of helpline number 14420 in over 190 cities – a citizens’ grievance platform.

The vision of a Garbage Free India under SBM-U 2.0 was given further impetus by announcing the results of 3-star and 5-star rated cities under the Star Rating Protocol of Garbage Free Cities. A total of 9 cities – Indore Surat New Delhi Municipal Council Navi Mumbai Ambikapur Mysuru Noida Vijayawada and Patan- have been certified as 5 star cities while 143 cities have been certified as 3 star. The Star Rating Protocol of Garbage Free Cities was introduced as a SMART framework by MoHUA in 2018 to holistically evaluate cities across solid waste management parameters. In 2018 only 56 cities were awarded certification on some star rating. This year the number has gone up manifold with 2238 cities applying for the assessment. The mammoth exercise was completed successfully despite the COVID-19 restrictions as is evidenced in the numbers - 1.4 crore photographic evidence collected across 3.5 crore data points along with 14.19 lakh citizen validation and 1 lakh locations covered during the assessment period.

The spirit of celebration was further enhanced through the release of a song titled ‘Har Dhadkan Swachh Bharat Ki – Reaffirming a Nation’s Commitment to Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0’ by President of India. The song encapsulates the spirit of the Swachhata movement and is a salute to the commitment of all citizens especially the children youth and senior citizens in the Swachhata journey. The video which depicts a clean green and modern urban India is an effort to reinvigorate people to carry forward the SBM-U 2.0 journey in the days ahead. The link of the song is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY_ejy6ifwE.

Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 launched on 1st October 2021 will focus on ensuring complete access to sanitation facilities for all. Technology has played a critical role in achieving the outcomes under SBM-U’s journey in the last seven years. Taking a giant leap forward in this digital journey the Ministry launched the revamped Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 website and the integrated MIS portal ‘Swachhatam’.

Additionally a futuristic and state-of-the-art spatial GIS platform was launched that will further propel the Mission towards smart data driven decision making. These new digital enablements will further enable the Mission to become paperless robust and transparent along with round-the-clock connectivity with States Cities and stakeholders across the Swachhata spectrum.

Swachh Amrit Mahotsav was thus a celebration of the achievements of cities in the past seven years of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban and a commitment from cities and citizens to move forward with renewed vigour in the next phase of Swachhata through Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0.

Four players slept on the 54-hole co-lead but only one came out on top with the $1.5 million winner’s prize.

After battling a wrist injury that kept her from practicing at the CME Group Tour Championship Jin Young Ko still proved nothing can hold her back. Ko scorched Tiburon Golf Club with a sizzling 63 which tied her career-best score for 18 holes and set the new tournament scoring record at -23. The win also secured Ko her second Rolex Player of the Year award as she becomes the first Korean player to achieve the feat twice. It is her 12th career victory and fifth of the season becoming the first player to record five wins in a season since Ariya Jutanugarn in 2016. She is the third Korean to win five or more times in an LPGA Tour season along with Sei Re Pak and Inbee Park.

“I don't have pressure on the course. I just want to better play than the other players. So I did it and yeah” said Ko who had more wins (five) than rounds in the 70s (four) in her last nine events. “Also I'm happy to make like my best career score today 63; 64 was my best score record but I crushed it and it's so happy.”

Ko hit 63 straight greens in regulation to finish the week with her last missed green in regulation on No. 9 in the first round. She recorded only one bogey over her last 63 holes played with 24 birdies in that stretch. Nine of those came on Sunday including six on her front nine closing with a 30 as she made the turn. When asked about the most important shot from the day Ko said there were three.

“Number one is No. 3 hole second shot with the 7-iron. And number two on No. 8 par-3. I got maybe three feet. Yep with a controlled 9-iron” said Ko. “And No. 17 second shot with the 6-iron. I got two on so two-putt and made birdie.”

Ko’s season was one for the ages. Despite no major championship titles Ko walks away with the largest prize in women’s golf a scoring average of 68.774 five victories and Rolex Player of the Year. But the 26-year-old only has one thing on her mind this offseason. “I want to keep the golf clubs at a distance and not think about golf and get a good sleep. Just want to put potato chips in my stomach and watch Netflix.”

Nasa Hataoka put up a fight on the final day to finish second at -22 after posting an 8-under 64 that included nine birdies. It was her second-consecutive 64 of the event. Mina Harigae and two-time LPGA Tour winner Celine Boutier finished in a tie for third at -18. Megan Khang along with 2021 major champions Nelly Korda and Minjee Lee tied for fifth at -17. Korda who was among the 54-hole co-leaders with Ko Hataoka and Boutier finished her season averaging 4.90 birdies-or-better per round. It’s the best single-season rate for any player with 40 or more rounds played in the last 30 LPGA Tour seasons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXBsZXNuZXdzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL2dvbGYvMjAyMS8xMS8yMS9waG90b3MtamluLXlvdW5nLWtvLXdpbnMtY21lLWdyb3VwLXRvdXItY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLW5hcGxlcy84NzEzODU1MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Jin Young Ko wins CME Group Tour Championship in Naples,"Photos: Jin Young Ko wins CME Group Tour Championship in Naples

The stakes are high Sunday for Jin Young Ko left and Nelly Korda. Getty Images

The LPGA Tour has played 28 events this year and it’s holding its 29th and final tournament this week. Hundreds of players have taken thousands of shots. And yet Sunday’s 18 holes at the CME Group Tour Championship will be more than a victory lap. Here are three things you need to know after Saturday’s third round at Tiburon Golf Club in Naples Fla.

Complete leaderboard here.

Four are tied for the lead

Along with the tournament title Player of the Year is also on the line and the POY leaders are also tied for first at the CME.

Let’s review the tournament leaderboard first. Nelly Korda Jin Young Ko Nasa Hataoka and Celine Boutier at 14-under are tied for the lead. One shot back are Gaby Lopez and Mina Harigae and Leona Maguire Nanna Koerstz Madsen and Lexi Thompson are two behind.

Hataoka who played her final 10 holes at eight-under had the day’s low round with an eight-under 64 and she’ll play with Korda and Ko in Sunday’s final grouping.

“The first nine I wasn’t really stroking my putts really well but I was patient with that” Hataoka said. “I was more focused with my routine this week which kind of helped my game today this week. So I think that really helped my game today.”

Korda Ko in fight for Player of the Year

What a day for Jin Young Ko.



She's vying for two trophies heading into the final round 🏆



Check out Saturday highlights 👇 pic.twitter.com/42bBVuDihK — LPGA (@LPGA) November 21 2021

The season-long contest for Player of the Year also will be determined on Sunday. Korda with four victories this season (not including her win at the Olympics) and 191 points leads and Ko also with four wins is in second with 181 points. Should either win they’ll win POY too.

If neither do here’s where it gets interesting. Ko can overtake Korda by finishing second (and earning 12 points) and Korda finishing 10th (one point) or lower (no points). The two will tie if Ko finishes second and Korda finishes ninth (two points). For all other scenarios Korda will become the Player of the Year.

“Yeah it’s for other people” Korda said when asked whether she’s caught up in the drama ahead. “I’m just out there going to do my job taking a shot at a time and see where it takes me. That’s all you can do.”

Ko isn’t taking warm-ups!

It was revealed on Friday that Ko has been dealing with left wrist pain since May and it’s worsened to the point where she has gone without warming up this week. But it’s not exactly like you would notice. She opened with rounds of 69 and 67 then birdied holes two through eight on Saturday on her way to a 66.

“Yeah she said she hasn’t done a single warm-up since last week as well” said Lydia Ko Jin Young Ko’s playing partner on Friday. “Yesterday I said did you warm up today? She was like no I didn’t. Injuries are no fun. You know golf is hard enough playing with 100 percent health and beautiful weather but to have lingering injury it’s one thing to just feel pain but when you know at the back of your mind that you could feel pain you kind of back out of it.

“So the level of golf she’s been playing with that shows she’s a grinder and yeah you know hopefully we all finish the season off strong.”

How to watch the final round

Sunday’s final round will be broadcast (live!) on NBC starting at 1 p.m. ET.

Ko opened with a 25-foot birdie putt and never looked back in the CME Group Tour Championship. She shot 30 on the front nine and closed with the low round of the tournament at 9-under-par 63 for a one-shot victory over Nasa Hataoka of Japan.

Facing high stakes against her toughest opponent Jin Young Ko delivered a performance that was close to perfect Sunday to win the richest prize in women’s golf and overtake Nelly Korda for LPGA player of the year.

“I don’t know what happened out there” said Ko who has been coping with a left wrist injury since May that limited her practice before rounds. “This week was amazing.”

This victory brought big spoils beyond the $1.5 million to the winner.

The 26-year-old South Korean had to win the tournament to claim the points-based LPGA player of the year the second time in three years Ko has won the award.

“I tried to play aggressive and I got it and I’m so happy” Ko said of surpassing Korda. “She got gold medal and she had major. She had three more wins this year. She hits it straight and too far and putting so good. I was a little bit more lucky than her so I got this.”

Korda’s big year of becoming a major champion and Olympic gold medalist ended with a thud. She couldn’t keep pace at the start and was never a serious factor when Ko pulled away on the back nine. The 23-year-old American closed with a 69 and tied for fifth six shots behind.

“It was the Jin Young Ko show today and honestly it was cool to see” Korda said. “I just sat back and watched all day.”

Ko won the season finale for the second straight year.

Lydia Ko closed with a 64 to wrap up the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average. Jin Young Ko and Korda had lower averages but did not meet the required minimum of 70 rounds.

The winner finished at 23-under 265 for her 12th career victory.

Ko won five of the last nine tournaments she played on the LPGA Tour and became the first five-time winner on the LPGA since 2016.

PGA — Talor Gooch was playing too well to get fazed by anything in the final round of the RSM Classic and it paid off with his first PGA Tour title when he closed with a 6-under 64 for a three-shot victory at Sea Island Ga.

He was playing with two guys who have won before. He was pushed early by a past Sea Island champion. The buzz in the middle of the round was another player flirting with 59.

Gooch ran off three birdies in four holes to start the back nine and never let anyone get close to cap off a strong fall with the ultimate prize. The victory moved him to the top of the FedEx Cup standings to No. 33 in the world ranking and to Augusta National in April for the Masters.

Gooch tied the tournament record of 22-under 260 set by Kevin Kisner in 2014. He became the seventh player in the 12-year history of the event to make the RSM Classic his first victory.

Mackenzie Hughes of Canada who won the tournament in 2016 rallied from the group ahead of Gooch with four birdies among his last six holes capped by a 20-foot putt at No. 18 for a 62 to finish second at 19-under 263.

European — British Open champion Ryder Cup winner and now the first American to finish a season as the European Tour’s No. 1 player.

It’s been quite the year for Collin Morikawa.

The 24-year-old Californian demonstrated patience after a slow start and then world-class iron play down the stretch in making five birdies in his last seven holes to overhaul a fading Rory McIlroy and win the DP World Tour Championship with a final-round 6-under 66.

With the three-shot victory Morikawa also captured the Race to Dubai title as the leading points scorer on the European Tour in the 2021 season.

“It’s an honor to be the first American to do that to put my name against many many greats and Hall of Famers” Morikawa said. “It’s special. I get touched up just talking about that.

“To close it out not just with a top 10 but to actually win ... what a great way to finish.”

One swing two words and three seconds of a video was all it took from Tiger Woods to get everyone talking about his future on the golf course.

Woods had not made a public comment about injuries from his Feb. 23 car accident in Los Angeles since May and he didn’t have a lot to offer on Twitter.

“Making progress” was all he said Sunday accompanied by the video of a smooth swing with a wedge. Woods was wearing a black compression sleeve on his right leg with a large bucket half-filled with golf balls on a practice range.

He also had a launch monitor behind him that measures such metrics as distance and ball speed.

Woods was recovering from another back procedure at the start of the year when he ran his SUV over a median and it toppled down a steep hill on a winding sweeping road in the Los Angeles suburbs on his way to a television shoot at a golf course. Doctors said he shattered tibia and fibula bones on his right leg in multiple locations. Those were stabilized by a rod in the tibia. A combination of screws and pins were used to stabilize additional injuries in the ankle and foot.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L2NtZS1ncm91cC1scGdhLXRvdXItY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLW5lbGx5LWtvcmRhLWppbi15b3VuZy1rby1jZWxpbmUtYm91dGllci1uYXNhLWhhdGFva2HSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xmZGlnZXN0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9jbWUtZ3JvdXAtbHBnYS10b3VyLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1uZWxseS1rb3JkYS1qaW4teW91bmcta28tY2VsaW5lLWJvdXRpZXItbmFzYS1oYXRhb2thL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Korda vs. Ko is going down to the wire in the LPGA's Tour Championship,If either World No. 1 Korda who shot 67 on Saturday or No. 2 Ko (66) win the tournament they will earn the title of the season’s top player.

The Surprising Career Marty Lagina Had Before The Curse Of Oak Island

Everyone loves a good treasure hunt even though in reality they're costly time-consuming endeavors that often result in next to no success. Even still that hasn't stopped ""The Curse of Oak Island"" from sticking around the TV scene for now-nine seasons nor has that prevented fans from tuning in to see what the show has in store next. Week in and week out the Oak Island team makes great strides in unearthing the mysterious locale's long-hidden treasures — something only possible because of the dedication and commitment of the sibling duo Rick and Marty Lagina.

When ""The Curse of Oak Island"" arrived on the small screen in January of 2014 it touted the Lagina brothers as the poster boys of the entire project — a status they still hold to this day. It's not hard to see why this was the case considering that they're the ones responsible for much of the Oak Island expedition and its presence on television. For a good chunk of their lives they've intently studied everything they could about the island in hopes of finally discovering its legendary secrets. Although they haven't been on-location excavating for long.

Before the Lagina's and their team started digging up Oak Island in 2010 both brothers worked quite different professions. In the case of Marty his previous job titles are especially interesting.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil Ministry's proposal to give away Mumbai High field to private sector on platter upsets ONGC union,"

The petroleum ministry 's proposal to give away ONGC 's biggest oil and gas fields to foreign companies has met with strong resistance from the officers union of the company which has said that the government should empower and give the company a level-playing field rather than giving away its prime assets to the private sector on a platter.The Association of Scientific & Technical Offices of ONGC petitioned Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri against a proposal put by Amar Nath additional secretary (exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas  for giving away 60 per cent stake and operatorship of Mumbai High and Bassein & Satellite (B&S) offshore assets to international partners for raising output.The union which represents ONGC's 17000 officers said the company and its employees are completely aligned with the government objective of raising domestic production to cut imports and for this to happen ONGC should be given the same fiscal and regulatory regime as the private sector enjoys for exploring and producing oil and gas.The government-dictated below market price gas price fixation for ONGC fields should be reviewed to make production from smaller and remote fields viable it wrote to Puri on November 11. Also ONGC should be given freedom to market small pools of natural gas which in present price regime are unviable.Statutory clearances and authorities for ONGC need to be optimised and procedural aspects rejigged to help the firm take faster decisions.Farming out stake in ""existing fields shall not yield the desired results of enhancing domestic production instead it will provide a level playing field and empower ONGC to further enhance productivity"" the union wrote.""We would therefore request you that handing over producing fields on a platter to the private operator will not be successful and therefore in our opinion should not be pursued"" it added.It said exploration of oil and gas is a highly risky endeavour where very few like to participate. ""This is evident from the tepid response to the bids invited under OALP (bid rounds) where only ONGC and to some extent OIL are the only bidders.""Private and foreign operators are unwilling to take the risk of investing millions of dollars in surveying and drilling wells to establish reserves. They instead want to enter into established fields.""The private operators most probably are giving priority to commercial aspects the prevailing business climate and therefore may not be taking the risk that ONGC is willing to take"" the union wrote.The data of the last 3 years shows that ONGC has been consistently drilling more than 100 exploratory wells every year even when the international crude prices had hit an all-time low. During the low price regime most of the international and private E&P companies had stopped their exploratory plans and had drastically reduced their development investments.""ONGC however bucked the trend and continued to aggressively invest in exploration and development activities"" it said adding private exploration and production (E&P) companies have been very quick to give up fields with falling commercial returns.""The example of Panna Mukta and tapti fields (in western offshore) where international E&P operators did not renew their leases even though the recovery factor from these fields had not even reached 20 per cent in fact in one case it was even less than 10 per cent"" it said pointing to ONGC's recovery factor - percentage of reserves being recovered - at 28 per cent in Mumbai High and Bassein fields.ONGC took over the Panna Mukta and Tapti fields after the exit of Shell and BG Group and is producing more than the approved profile of the field.Similarly the Ratna field which was given to the private sector was put to production by ONGC. PY-3 field too was lying idle for years before ONGC took over.""Despite the impact of COVID-19 ONGC has been able to maintain the production levels as envisaged in the annual plans. Mumbai high has been producing since 1976 and has been the cornerstone of the country's oil production. Bassein and Satellite have been the frontrunner for gas since 1987"" the union wrote.""ONGC has been optimally producing from these fields keeping into consideration the health of the reservoir"" it noted.With time ONGC has also accreted reserves in these fields and has enhanced the recovery factor.""ONGC has plans to further enhance the production from these fields and in coming years we shall see substantial increase from these fields"" the union wrote.""All these efforts are in public domain and we are sure that the same must have been scrutinised by the Board of ONGC of which senior officials from the ministry are an integral part"" it added.The Union sought an opportunity to meet Puri personally and present its suggestions for augmenting domestic crude oil and natural gas output.""Farming out 60 per cent interest and operatorship in these fields shall have a major negative impact on ONGC's performance whereas such efforts in the past have not yielded desired results for example Panna Mukta Ratna Tapti and PY-3"" it added.",,,,,,,,,

The company had acquired this plant about two years ago from Coca-Cola’s bottling arm Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (HCCB).

According to the notice sent to plant workers a copy of which is with BusinessLine  SLMG Beverages said the contribution of the glass bottle-packaged beverage segment to its business has become almost nil due to the shift to PET bottles. It added that despite the evolving circumstances the company’s management made full efforts to keep the plant operational. However due to financial losses it had to take the “difficult” decision to shut down the plant located at Raja Talab Varanasi on November 12 the notice said.

SLMG Beverages did not respond to queries in this regard. Per the notice the final payment of “statutory dues” to workers included salary up to November 17 one month salary (basic +DA) and annual bonus till November on pro-rata basis.

Workers’ protests

The Coca-Cola Workers Union of the plant termed the shutdown as “illegal”. In a letter to various local authorities the union said reasons given by the management for the plant shutdown are inaccurate as manufacturing of glass-bottled soft drinks continues in other plants of SLMG Beverages and HCCB. The union said no voluntary retirement scheme was offered and the company’s management did not take permission from the labour department and other authorities before terminating the services of the workers.

Independent legal entities

Responding to e-mailed queries from BusinessLine  a spokesperson for Coca-Cola India said “Our bottling partners are independent legal entities and align their operations with evolving market conditions and business imperatives. Any decision our bottling partners take as part of their processes are focused on enhancing efficiencies and optimising existing capacities. We have confidence in our partners to operate in compliance with local guidelines and mandates.”

5 IoT Cloud Case Studies

1. Coca-Cola Içecek

One of the key bottlers in the Coca-Cola ecosystem Coca-Cola Içecek (CCI) services more than 400 million consumers in 10 countries across central Asia and the Middle East. CCI sought to improve the efficiency of their 26 bottling plants starting with input from their clean-in-place (CIP) equipment to model a digital twin bottling plant.

“Our CIP is an everyday production process and crucial for industry hygiene and quality requirements” says Burcu Hacioglu digital twin product owner at CCI. “We wanted to improve process efficiency by avoiding errors in time measurement which could lead to CCI plants overusing energy and water.”

CCI fed their industrial IoT information to the AWS cloud where it was used to create data models that could be manipulated to improve efficiency in the system. Early success with the CIP process motivated CCI to expand the model to include filler-mixer machines.

Industry: Beverage

IoT cloud provider: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Outcomes:

Over 30 improvement opportunities identified

20% savings in electricity and 9% savings in water

34 days of processing time saved per year

2. Deep Sky Vineyard

Family-owned Deep Sky Vineyard operates in Arizona and Argentina to grow grapes for wine. In one of their vineyards an unmonitored irrigation valve broke and flooded an entire zone which motivated Deep Sky to improve information over the entire crop management process using cloud-connected instrumentation.

“This year I already know several ways we’ll improve our grapes“ says Phil Asmundson owner of Deep Sky Vineyard. “Without this digital solution … we wouldn’t have the invaluable insights needed to make these decisions.”

Deep Sky installed connected hardware to monitor water flow soil moisture and other factors to automate and monitor the vineyard. The data flows wirelessly to the Google Cloud to be processed and analyzed.

Industry: Agriculture

IoT cloud provider: Google Cloud

Outcomes:

Saves 1.6 million gallons of water over 15 acres

Produces a 30% saving in labor

Reduces human error costs by as much as 75%

3. DHL Supply Chain

In more than 50 countries around the world DHL Supply Chain provides customers with highly automated logistics storage transportation and distribution services. Although operating in a labor-intensive industry DHL strives to reduce the most labor-intensive tasks by using robotics and automation.

“With the integration capabilities we’ve gained employees can now simplify or eliminate the most tedious parts of their jobs and contribute in more valuable ways” says Fekko Roelofs program manager of robotics hub and resource orchestration at DHL Supply Chain.

Integrating automation at each facility separately consumed a lot of time so DHL implemented a centralized hub on the cloud. Their new architecture feeds information from robotics wearable devices and other data sources to develop reporting and allow for rapid and simple integration of new equipment.

Industry: Supply chain

IoT cloud provider: Microsoft Azure

Outcomes:

Reduced robotics integration times by 60%

4. Dow

The worldwide chemical manufacturer Dow strives for zero safety-related incidents. However vast factories and numerous production lines lead to huge numbers of points to monitor for their Digital Operations Center.

“In this situation we were looking at more than just the speed at which we could put together a solution for monitoring video at the edge — there are open-source tools we could have used to cobble something together” says Michael Dessauer senior solutions manager at the Dow Digital Operations Center. “But we need to scale our solution to thousands of deployments.”

Initially Dow selected to monitor for leaks using video. Video feeds need quick analysis to issue timely alerts but also need tight security. Dow opted to incorporate edge technology to generate alerts quickly and also use the traditional cloud applications for storage machine learning (ML) for video analysis process modeling and deeper analysis.

Industry: Chemicals

IoT cloud provider: Microsoft Azure

Outcomes:

Leak sensors now deployed to places difficult dangerous or costly to monitor with people

Human-trained AI continuously improving ability to identifying leaks

Success with leak detection spurring development of systems for PPE protection and security monitoring

Read the full Dow and Microsoft Azure case study.

5. Thermo Fisher

Thermo Fisher manufactures equipment used in laboratory research worldwide. Their equipment could sequence the 3.2 billion base pairs in DNA but the PCs that ran Thermo Fisher software were insufficient in capability for this information flow.

“We looked at trying to build our own cloud” says Mark Field CTO at Thermo Fisher Scientific. “Very quickly we said … this is not our core competency to run massive cloud infrastructure.”

Instead they partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a private cloud environment for Thermo Fisher. Equipment now forwards data directly to this cloud instead of to local PCs to harness scale and improve collaboration.

Industries: Biotechnology manufacturing

IoT cloud provider: AWS

Outcomes:

Over 1000 partner organizations now feed information into the Thermo Fisher cloud

Initially the cloud IoT data expands the reach of supercomputing to all researchers instead of a few

DNA sequencing will allow a future of more customized care for patients

The Chicago Red Stars started on the front foot despite weathering two early injury blows. Both Vanessa DiBernardo and Mallory Pugh who was only cleared to play in the game yesterday due to COVID protocols went down in the opening half of the final forcing Chicago to make two substitutions.

The Red Stars were already missing Julie Ertz Alyssa Naeher and Kealia Watt to injury as well as Casey Krueger to a non-COVID related illness.

Despite the missing talent the Red Stars persevered scoring immediately after Pugh left the pitch as Rachel Hill headed in a well-placed cross from Arin Wright to go up 1-0 just before the break.

In a switch of momentum the second half was all Washington with Trinity Rodman spearheading the Spirit’s attack. Playing her way back into the game Rodman fired a rifle off the crossbar from distance putting Chicago’s defense on notice.

After knocking on the door Washington finally got on the board in the game’s 67th minute with Andi Sullivan converting a penalty from the line to equalize.

Chicago only getting one shot off in the second half managed to keep the scoreline at 1-1 handling a consistent Spirit attack to force overtime.

Washington keeping up the pressure notched their go-ahead goal in the game’s 97th minute with Kelley O’Hara heading in a lofted cross from Rodman to make it 2-1.

The finish marks O’Hara’s first of the season and makes the 33-year-old the oldest playoff goalscorer in NWSL history. The play also made Rodman the youngest NWSL player to record an assist in the playoffs at 19-years-old.

The Red Stars however weren’t ready to give up testing the Spirit’s backline late into the game. Goalkeeper Aubrey Bledsoe had to come up clutch down the stretch to keep her side ahead and deliver Washington the victory.

The Spirit’s NWSL Championship comes after a tumultuous season on and off the pitch which included previous coach Richie Burke being fired for verbally abusing players co-owners Steve Baldwin and Michele Kang fighting for control of the team and two games being forfeited due to an intra-team COVID outbreak.

Brian Humphries on strategies

“Core to our strategy is an investment in international markets where growth opportunities are larger. We’ve invested $2.5 billion in digital acquisitions. We’ve also turbocharged our investments for training and re-skilling sales and marketing and we brought in hundreds of more commercially oriented go-to-market client-facing teams.”

“About 50 percent of our current clients are only buying one of our current practices 25 percent two to four and 25 percent five plus. So we have a huge opportunity to land and expand to upsell to cross-sell and we’re getting after that opportunity by putting in place much more sophisticated go-to-market customer segmentation account plans etc.”

“We’ve made investments in our commercial engine not just in hiring of 500 commercially oriented resources that tend to have come in at a higher cost just because of the sophistication and the alignment and the expertise needed by industry to walk the corridors beyond the CIO and CTO office but as we’re selling digital into the broader C-suite.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9mb290YmFsbC9kb2xwaGlucy9kb2xwaGlucy13aW4tdGhpcmQtc3RyYWlnaHQtdG9wLWpldHMtMjQtMTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dolphins win third straight top Jets 24-17,"EAST RUTHERFORD N.J. — Tua Tagovailoa threw a go-ahead 5-yard touchdown pass to Myles Gaskin early in the fourth quarter and the Miami Dolphins hung on to beat the New York Jets 24-17 Sunday for their third straight victory.

The Aston Martin driver has not been a regular participant in recent Q3 sessions but he did make it through to the top-10 shootout at the inaugural Qatar Grand Prix.

Sitting P10 when the chequered flag came out Vettel was hoping to improve that position on his final run. But his chances were ended when Pierre Gasly’s car suffered a broken front wing and a puncture and came to a halt near the pit wall along the start-finish straight.

That brought out the yellow flags of which three drivers – Max Verstappen Valtteri Bottas and Carlos Sainz – appear to have fallen foul all of them summoned by the stewards for separate hearings in the period between three and four hours before the race.

So while Vettel was initially disappointed with 10th he may yet find himself starting higher – his best chance of doing so resting on the verdict regarding Sainz who is due to line up seventh.

But at least the German ensured he did what he should have done to comply with the rules and avert the prospect of a sanction that would drop him down the order.

“It was a shame because I had the yellow flag and I had to abort (the lap)” Vettel told reporters of his final qualifying run at the Losail International Circuit.

“There was a car parked on the track and normally that’s double yellow – I don’t know what happened after or behind me but a bit of a shame. We couldn’t finish our final run.

“It would have been close I think for P9 or then again P10. It didn’t make a big difference but obviously a bit of a weird feeling to finish the lap lifting off.”

Regarding his race chances Vettel added: “It’s a difficult one to overtake so we will see. I’m fairly open-minded. We need to make a good start and take it from there.”

Before any penalties are applied Vettel’s team-mate Lance Stroll is due to start in 12th so it is unlikely if precedents are any guide that he will move up as Sainz is expected to receive a three-place grid penalty if found guilty of the offence.

“The car felt good it was a lot of fun the track’s great to drive” said the Canadian – in contrast to FP3 when he had said over the team radio that “man the car is ****** ******” after running over a kerb."

Dear Poliakoffs

I live in a condominium building. Our association has entered into a bulk contract with a new cable company to replace Comcast as our basic internet and cable provider. I am a Comcast/Xfinity customer who wants to retain Comcast even though I will have to pay the basic monthly addition to our association fee for the new company (and for services I will not be using). However according to the new provider they have an exclusivity contract with our association and Comcast will have to disconnect all service to our complex. Can they do that or do I have the right to retain Comcast as a consumer? Comcast has already told me they have no intention of cutting off my service.

Signed. J.M.

Dear J.M.

In 2007 the FCC officially declared exclusive service or access agreements in cable service contracts to be unlawful. This also would include exclusive easements that would purport to grant a cable company an exclusive right to run wiring through a building. Comcast certainly knows this and this is why they have no intention of cutting off your service. I have to imagine the new cable provider is aware of this as well and I can’t begin to imagine how they think they can forcibly disconnect Comcast from the units. The only exclusivity agreement that might be enforceable would be an exclusive right to market their services on the condominium property but that certainly wouldn’t lead to blocking other service providers. Now it is possible that depending on the ownership of the wiring in the building Comcast might need to install new wiring and/or equipment—but there is no way they could be forcibly blocked from servicing your unit.

Consider finally that the Condominium Act at Section 718.1232 Fla. Stat. provides that “no resident of any condominium dwelling unit…shall be denied access to any available franchised or licensed cable televisions service…” All in all I would push back on this new provider and try to pin down why they think they have the right to be the exclusive cable provider in the community.

Dear Poliakoffs

I live in a community where two neighboring HOAs have formed a joint use committee. It seems that this committee has more power than the board of the two HOAs. I understand its purpose—to maintain common grounds and manage reserve accounts. But why is the joint use committee involved with things like social activities? Violations I could understand but activities don’t seem to fit its purpose. Can you summarize the purpose of a joint use committee and explain how it would be properly funded?

Signed J.D.

Dear J.D.

The problem with your question is that there is no standard formal construct that would be called a “joint use committee.” It means something different and is structured differently in every community. Joint use committees are common when two separate and unrelated associations have to share a recreational facility such as a clubhouse or other shared common areas. Some are simply informal committees with a bank account that is funded by two or more associations where the members of the committee are appointed by the associations and they have been delegated authority (either by covenant contract or informally) to make certain decisions on behalf of the associations as it relates to the recreational facilities. In other circumstances the joint use committee is actually a formal incorporated entity with its own corporate procedures. I tend to prefer this kind of structure as it allows the committee to hire vendors have bank accounts and engage in its business more efficiently. And as I noted the purpose of an informal joint use committee (which is what it seems you have in your community) can be essentially anything desired by the boards of the various associations. If the associations want the committee to manage joint recreational activities it can delegate that authority to the committee (whether association common funds can be used for such activities is a legitimate and separate question but there is no real reason the committee cannot serve as event planners if desired—that’s pretty common). Even when a joint use committee is not its own formal entity I recommend that the various associations memorialize the operation of the committee and its powers in some kind of contract that can be executed by all the associations so there’s no question as to what the committee is responsible for and how it will operate.

Jackson Wieger has been a Denver sports fanatic for 20 years. He loves the Nuggets who are led by reigning NBA most valuable player Nikola Jokic and grew up watching the NHL's Colorado Avalanche. ""Both the Nuggets and the Avalanche play 82 games and I'd say I used to watch 65 games a year"" said Wieger 27 who lives in Lakewood Colorado just outside of Denver. Two years ago his fandom was crushed. Comcast stopped carrying Altitude Sports the regional network that owns broadcast rights for both teams because the two sides couldn't reach a carriage agreement. Comcast said at the time that more than 95% of its customers watched the equivalent of less than one game per week. Wieger was in the 5% along with many people he knows. Sports for them are different now. ""My friends and family used to be so passionate but now that you can't watch you're not as in tune with what's going on"" Wieger said. ""You're not as excited. You're not as engaged."" The local sports saga is playing out in markets across the U.S. as cable and satellite TV companies abandon regional sports networks or RSNs. Rather than accept large monthly subscription fees pay-TV providers like Comcast DirecTV and Dish  and digital providers such as YouTube TV and Hulu are increasingly walking away to keep costs down. They've decided the amount they have to pay to keep RSNs in the bundle no longer makes economic sense given how few people watch them and how much they charge. Other than ESPN RSNs are the most expensive networks in the bundle. Many charge more than $5 per month per subscriber according to research firm Kagan a subdivision of S&P Global. Cable bills have to rise to support the added cost which leads to more cancellations. Since 2012 about 25 million U.S. households have cut the cord on traditional pay-TV. Media executives expect subscriber numbers to fall by another 15 million to 25 million by the end of 2025. Meanwhile monthly bills continue to go up.

The result is a lot of unhappiness. Fans are shut out. RSNs are bleeding money. Teams and leagues are losing their most valuable asset: their audience. A potential escape from the vicious cycle is subscription streaming where media and entertainment companies are focusing their attention. That push accelerated during the pandemic as consumers looked for ways to cut costs and for several months had no live sports to watch while stuck at home. But RSNs haven't yet figured out a streaming solution and professional sports leagues are starting to consider their future options. ""As an investor I would short RSNs"" said Leo Hindery former CEO of New York's YES Network who now works in private equity and recently formed two special purpose acquisition companies. YES broadcasts New York Yankees baseball games and Brooklyn Nets basketball games. ""The cost of sports is the main reason people are cutting the cord on cable. We're learning to live without sports"" Hindery said.

The plight of Sinclair

Dish's decision to move away from RSNs goes beyond Sinclair. Dish dropped Comcast's NBC Sports RSNs in April and AT&T's RSNs in September. In Denver near where Dish is headquartered the company doesn't carry Altitude Sports the network that's home to the Nuggets and Avalanche. Both teams are controlled by Altitude owner Stan Kroenke. Altitude says on its website that Comcast and Dish ""continue to ignore the wishes of their customers and our fans"" and ""have demonstrated a level of greed that is clearly out of touch."" Dish's billionaire founder and chairman Charlie Ergen refuses to budge. On the company's quarterly earnings call in August Ergen described RSNs as a tax on subscribers. When there are no live games most of the networks air low-rated programs like sports documentaries and reruns. ""We don't have any customers calling us on RSNs today"" Ergen told analysts. ""We're happy to talk about anything that's creative and doesn't harm our customers but we're not interested in taxing our customers when they don't watch the channel. That doesn't make any sense.""

'Bundle is broken'

As the RSN industry reckons with an existential threat the potential downstream effects have America's major sports franchises justifiably on edge. RSNs provide billions of dollars to sports leagues which use the revenue as one way to pay player salaries and invest in the organization. There's also the future of fandom. If fewer people are exposed to local sports because they're no longer available on their bundle and consumers can't find them outside of pay-TV younger audiences may have little interest in going to games or buying hats and jerseys. Warning signs are already present. Research shows that younger Americans are far less likely than their parents to watch live sports. ""Forget the actual teams and regional sports networks it's not going to be good for the sport or the leagues"" said Michael Schreiber CEO of Playfly Sports a sports marketing and media company. ""The trick is maintaining high exposure of live games across the U.S. at the same time as creating new innovative ways to access the content."" Sinclair's near-term plan is to build a direct-to-consumer subscription service allowing local fans to get streaming access to games outside of the cable bundle. The company laid out its streaming strategy in an SEC filing in July. In the document Sinclair predicted that allowing fans to watch their hometown teams over the internet could ""potentially generate $2 billion+ in annual revenue"" with an estimated 4.4 million subscribers by 2027. The filing hints at opportunities in sports betting fantasy and non-fungible tokens all hot topics that may or may not produce actual revenue. Sinclair rebranded its RSNs using the Bally's casino name earlier this year to more closely align the networks with gambling. The biggest obstacle for a streaming service is affordability. Based on contracts with pay-TV operators Sinclair would be forced to charge much more for a direct-to-consumer product than the amount that Comcast DirecTV and Dish pay the company. One industry insider told CNBC the typical rate for a consumer would be five times higher. In other words if a cable company pays $4 per month per subscriber to Sinclair for one of its regional sports networks Sinclair would have to charge at least $20 per month for the same content to be streamed directly to a user.

The New York Post reported in June that Sinclair was considering a $23 monthly offering to stream games in markets where it owns digital rights though Sinclair hasn't confirmed the figure. By comparison Netflix and HBO Max cost about $15 per month and the combined package of Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+ costs $13.99 per month. Sinclair declined to comment on the pricing it's considering for its streaming service which will debut next year. The risk to Sinclair beyond just the high price is that a streaming play could make it even easier for pay-TV distributors to cut its networks from the bundle. As Ergen points out if content is no longer exclusive to the bundle it's also not as essential. Last month Comcast dropped MSG Network from its Xfinity channel lineup claiming that viewership was ""virtually non-existent."" MSG and its sister networks MSG2 and MSG Plus 2 show live games from the NBA's New York Knicks and the NHL's New York Rangers New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils. Comcast serves New Jersey and Connecticut but not New York City. ""We don't believe that our customers should have to pay the millions of dollars in fees that MSG is demanding for some of the most expensive sports content in the country with extremely low viewership in our markets"" Comcast said in a statement. ""Almost 95% of all customers who received MSG over the past year did not watch more than 10 of the approximately 240 games it broadcast."" Sinclair isn't faring any better with digital distributors. YouTube TV Hulu with Live Sports and even sports-focused FuboTV have chosen not to carry the RSNs in their bundles which start at $65 a month. Complicating matters further Sinclair hasn't actually secured streaming rights for most of the teams on its RSNs. MLB allows each team to negotiate separately for its media rights. The NBA and NHL own digital rights for all of their teams. So far Sinclair has direct-to-consumer streaming rights for four MLB teams and is in talks with the NBA and NHL to stream outside of the cable bundle.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred Steven Ferdman | Getty Images

Ripley is confident he'll get what he needs because Sinclair holds what's in essence a block function on digital rights. That means it would be financially punitive for the leagues to circumvent Sinclair without the company's participation. Whether Sinclair can afford to participate is another matter. ""We've been very clear with [Sinclair] from the beginning that we see both those sets of rights as extraordinarily valuable to baseball and we're not just going to throw them in to help Sinclair out"" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month during the CAA World Congress of Sports. He went on to say that cord-cutting is one problem but there's also ""excessive leverage"" in Sinclair's Diamond subsidiary.

Can RSNs survive?

Creating a unified entity that controls all RSNs is an ideal way forward for the major sports leagues as they adapt to the digital era. They could sell multi-team packages to local fans. They could allow individuals to pick and choose different teams across different sports and subscribe to just those games. While MLB and the NBA already have out-of-market national streaming options — MLB TV and NBA League Pass — blackout restrictions prevent the packages from including local teams. The whole concept of geofencing seems antiquated at a time when nearly every other form of video content is accessible on mobile devices wherever you are. Greg Maffei CEO of Atlanta Braves owner Liberty Media told CNBC earlier this week there will be plenty of ways to get games to fans outside of using RSNs. ""You'll see a host of new alternatives whether it be offerings provided by MLB whether it be over-the-top offerings or whether it be a more a la carte model over traditional linear television"" Maffei said. ""Those will proliferate.""

watch now

MLB's Manfred said that digital rights ""are very valuable and crucial to our future"" but ""who exactly the partners will be I'm not prepared to dismiss or not dismiss."" Team owners are acclimating to a possible future without RSNs. Some hope that large technology companies such as Amazon  could acquire streaming rights potentially through partnerships with existing RSNs. Amazon already owns a minority stake in the YES Network and streamed 21 Yankees games to New York-area Prime users this year. Comcast could also choose to include local games in Peacock NBCUniversal's streaming service. ""The revenue that comes from people enjoying our games who are not in the stadium I don't think that is going to bust"" said Steve Ballmer owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and former Microsoft CEO in an interview. ""How we get that revenue there's a lot of open questions. Will they be big media contracts from people who are on cable in broadcast TV? Will the players change and companies like Amazon  Apple and the streaming guys want to come into the game as opposed to just ESPN and Turner? Will there be some direct-to-consumer offer by the league which is certainly a possibility? There's a lot to be figured out."" According to a New York Post story last month MLB the NBA and the NHL have considered launching a streaming service together that circumvents the need for RSNs. Sinclair would have to either forego its block provision or work with the league to be part of the streaming solution. Sinclair knows leagues and teams desperately want a direct-to-consumer strategy. Cord-cutters abound and RSNs are reaching fewer people in the pay-TV ecosystem. But RSNs still generate billions in cash for the leagues each year and Sinclair sees some leverage in that position. ""I tend to think that RSNs aren't going to go away"" said Ed Desser president of Desser Media a consultancy firm that advises the sports television industry. However they have to evolve to meet the realities of the market he said. ""It's been one-size-fits-all for many years"" Desser said. ""I would expect that will change.""

McKane finished second overall and first among New York State Public High School Athletic Association swimmers in the 100-yard butterfly at the New York State Federation Girls Swimming & Diving Championships at Ithaca College's Athletics and Events Center.

""I feel really special"" McKane said when asked about becoming a state champion. ""I’m really grateful to have a chance to be Corning’s first state champion. It’s a very surreal feeling.""

Her All-American consideration time of 54.63 set a Section 4 record after she lowered her team record Friday with a second-place prelim time of 55.17. McKane entered the meet with a top time of 55.36.

Samantha Suer of Chenango Forks was the previous Section 4 record-holder with a time of 55.07 in 2014.

""Honestly I was expecting not that fast of a time so I was really shocked when I got that time. I’m really grateful"" McKane said.

Sacred Heart junior Tess Howley a USA National Junior Team member won the overall race in 52.37 after setting a state record with a prelim time of 52.06. Sacred Heart is part of the New York State Catholic High School Athletic Association. Howley added a win in the 100 backstroke in 53.13 another state record.

McKane opened her day by placing fifth in the 50 freestyle in 23.69 seconds lowering the team record of 23.74 she re-broke in prelims. Sabrina Johnston of Greeley took first in 22.85.

McKane carried over the momentum into the 200 freestyle relay joining Carolyn Heckle Kara Peters and Vanessa Turner in finishing 11th among public schools in 1:40.97.

Those same four placed 22nd overall and 21st among public schools in the 400 freestyle relay in 3:44.13.

""It was the best season I’ve ever had"" McKane said. ""It was full of friends and friends that seemed like family and I’m really glad I got to spend it with them. Everyone swam really fast swims so I’m super proud of my team as a whole.""

Seton's Olsian takes eighth in 50 free

McKane was joined on the podium for the 50 freestyle by Binghamton/Seton Catholic Central's Ava Olsian who finished eighth in 24.16. Olsian is a junior at Seton.

Olsian entered the weekend seeded 26th with a top time of 24.68 but she made the championship race Friday with a swim of 24.18.

""I wasn't expecting to finish that well so it was super exciting for me"" Olsian said. ""I was definitely excited to drop so much time in my event.""

Olsian said her results give her added excitement going into her senior season.

She finished 34th in the 100 freestyle in 54.47 on Friday missing out on a spot in Saturday's three finals heats.

M-E's Pignatelli seventh in breaststroke

Maine-Endwell senior Maria Pignatelli finished eighth overall and seventh among public schools swimmers in the 100 breaststroke with a time of 1:06.42 in Saturday's championship race. That improved on her prelim time of 1:06.84. Denise Phelan of Northport-Commack won in 1:01.07.

""I felt pretty good during (the race)"" Pignatelli said. ""I was really happy to move up a spot from where I was seeded. I’m just happy I did good in the final heat.""

Earlier in the day Pignatelli placed 12th overall and 11th among public schools in the 100 freestyle registering a time of 53.09 in the consolation finals. Her prelim time was 52.88. She said the freestyle also went well Saturday.

""I’m really happy with how my season went and I’m happy that the hard work in training paid off for me to reach my goals"" Pignatelli added.

Other Saturday results

Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour junior Faye Mooney placed 13th in the breaststroke with her time of 1:07.62 in the consolation finals.

Also in the breaststroke Chenango Valley senior Lindsey Rice took 23rd overall in 1:08.34. She was 21st among public schools.

Janet Burger Appier

Big Flats - JANET BURGER APPIER RN BSN MSN ANP-CS - 76 died Thursday November 18 2021 at her home following a lengthy illness.

""Once a nurse always a nurse."" A phrase every nurse knows but no truer words could describe Jan who spent her whole adult career of over 45 years as a nurse and nurse practitioner touching the lives of countless people.

Janet Marie Burger was born on August 7 1945 in Andover the fifth child of William and Isabel (Wereley) Burger. She was a 1963 graduate of Andover Central School. Like her older sister Phyllis Jan pursued a nursing career. She attended St. James Hospital of Nursing in Hornell graduating in 1966. On May 26 1967 in Andover she married James Appier who survives.

In addition to her husband of 54 years Jan is survived by two sisters-in-law Kathleen Burger of Big Flats and Marjorie Burger of Hornell as well as 13 nieces and nephews and their children.

In addition to her parents she was predeceased by her siblings Bernard (Rose Mary) Burger Donald (Kay) Burger Robert (Margie) Burger and Phyllis (Edward) Wilson; her ""adopted siblings"" Clayton Burger and Jessie Burger (Newell) Baker whom her parents raised after William's brother died in an accident and nephew George (Patti) Burger the only child of Bernie and Rosie.

After having a mis-carriage with her first pregnancy she and Jim did not have any children of their own. Over the years they housed advised and helped several individuals many of whom remain close to this day and look up to Janet almost as a mother.

Following a couple short term RN staff positions in the Hornell area she and Jim relocated to Corning in late 1967 where they found their forever home in Big Flats in 1976. There Jan joined the nursing staff for Dr. Wayne C. Templer where she worked for over 17 years until Dr. Templer's retirement in 1985.

At this time Jan returned to school and began working on her Bachelor's degree through Alfred University with many classes completed at Corning Community College. Most of her college work being done while working full time at St. Joseph Hospital in Elmira. Her years at St. Joseph Hospital from 1987 through 1996 in the Acute Rehabilitation Department were most satisfying as she observed the progress of her patients.

Janet finally completed her Bachelor of Science in Nursing in 1991 from Alfred University and her Masters of Science in 1994 from Syracuse University and subsequently licensed as an Adult Nurse Practitioner in 1995. The following year she changed her position at St. Jos's to the Occupational Health Department.

From 1997 through 1999 Jan taught full time at Elmira College in their Medical\Surgical and Rehabilitation Clinicals. Beginning in 1999 she took a position at Corning Hospital in the Woman's Health Department (later Guthrie Hospital) until 2002. In 2003 she became a primary care provider for the Bath Veterans Administration Hospital in the in-patient drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility until her retirement in July of 2008.

Jan was a member of the Sigma Theta Tau International Elmira College Honor Society of Nursing Nurse Practitioner Association of New York State; District 3 Professional Nurses and the Corning Area Women's Club.

Jan loved people and cats not necessarily in that order. She once gave her husband a card that said ""Next to the cat I love you best!"" She loved the friends she made in the sewing and quilting circles and the women she met as a Mary Kay Consultant. She remained very close to her original classmates from St. James and coordinated their annual reunions.

Jan loved to travel as time allowed. Jim surprised her with a live Elvis performance in Las Vegas and they toured Dollywood and the Gatlinburg area on another occasion taking in the wonderful Christmas decorations. A weekend getaway or a boat ride on one of the local lakes was always a nice way to relax. Her favorite trips were the two-week trip to Scotland their trip to California to celebrate their great-niece Nicole's graduation from nursing school and their ""farewell"" tour in 2015 to visit family and friends at the beginning of Jan's health decline. Though unable to attend her sister Phyllis' granddaughter and her great-niece Grace graduation from nursing school Jan considered this as part of her legacy.

Jim would like to thank all those in the medical profession including their staff who supported them through these last seven difficult years.

Friends are invited for a time of visitation on Wednesday (November 24) from 1-4 p.m. at Haughey Funeral Home in Corning and on Friday (November 26) from 1-4 p.m. at Baker-Swan Funeral Home in Andover. The funeral service will be held on Saturday (November 27) at Baker-Swan Funeral Home at 1:00 p.m. with Rev. Christian Mattison of the Andover Presbyterian Church officiating. Burial will follow in Valley Brook Cemetery in Andover. Online condolences may be offered at www.baker-swan.com.

Though the ultimate goal is to set up a memorial scholarship award for graduating seniors at Andover Central School for those wishing to pursue a medical career memorial contributions in Jan's name may be made to Wounded Warrior Project 4899 Belfort Road Suite 300 Jacksonville FL 32256; or Alzheimer's Association 435 East Henrietta Road Rochester NY 14620. © 2021 Baker-Swan Funeral Home."

COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy9nYXMtcHJpY2VzLWNvc3Rjby13YWxtYXJ0LWJqcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy9nYXMtcHJpY2VzLWNvc3Rjby13YWxtYXJ0LWJqcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's why gas is so cheap at Costco and Walmart,"New York CNN Business —

Gas prices are skyrocketing and Americans want to save at the pump. That plays right into the hands of Costco BJ’s Wholesale Club and Sam’s Club.

The national gas price average jumped to $3.41 a gallon Friday according to AAA 61% higher than the average at the same time last year. The Biden administration has called for an investigation into whether oil and gas companies acted illegally to push up prices.

The spike has pushed more shoppers to rely on these chains to fill up their tanks say the companies retail analysts and fuel experts. Gas prices at warehouse clubs can be as much as 30 cents lower than traditional gas stations and the chains offer members coupons to use in their stores when they fill up. Gasoline sales at the warehouse clubs are an important part of their business and draw customers inside.

“People are seeking out the clubs because of the gas” said Michael Baker a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson. “It’s US consumers’ nature to go out of their way for lower gas prices.”

Costco for example is typically 20 cents a gallon below the market average according to Tom Kloza the global head of energy analysis at IHS Markit’s Oil Price Information Service. BJ’s says it’s 10 cents below average.

These companies are “winners when gasoline prices go skyward” said Kloza.

Costco (COST) Sam’s Club and BJ’s (BJ) want you to fill up your tank in their parking lots and then go stock up on giant jugs of ketchup boxes of snacks and clothing. (And why not buy a flat-screen TV or a new couch while you’re at it?) Their gas stations give these warehouse stores an advantage that many retail competitors can’t match.

Gas makes up around 10% $20 billion annually of Costco’s overall sales and 9% of BJ’s. Walmart (WMT) which owns Sam’s Club does not disclose what portion of its sales come from gas.

Gas is a notoriously low-margin business but retailers can make money from selling huge volumes of gas – even while charging much less than independent gas stations said Kloza adding that it’s not unusual for sales at a Costco location to reach up to 1 million gallons a month compared to an average of 80000 gallons a month at typical gas stations.

Despite their big-brand names the vast majority of Exxon Chevron BP and Shell gas statons are independently owned so they aren’t able to make a volume play like wholesalers do. Although wholesalers are able to make a profit on gas they’re not making much: Costco for example reported that gasoline has a lower profit margin than the rest of its business. Rising gas prices typically help Costco’s sales but hurt its profits.

“When there are inflationary pressures and prices are going up people look to save on gas” said Richard Galanti Costco’s chief financial officer. For every 100 people who come to Costco to fill up on gas more than half go shop inside afterwards he said.

Gas sales at BJ’s Wholesale Club jumped 20% during its most recent quarter ending October 30 compared with the same time a year ago.

BJ’s is growing market share in gasoline “in leaps and bounds” CEO Robert Eddy said on a call with analysts Thursday. When gas prices hit over $3 a gallon “members love us” and shift their gas spending to the club.

Gas discounts are a tool Walmart uses to encourage customers to sign up for Walmart+ memberships which also offer free shipping and discounts on prescriptions.

Walmart said on Tuesday that it’s actively trying to keep gas prices down to attract customers worried about how much they’re paying at the pump especially as federal stimulus benefits wane.

“Gas prices are a concern….They’re up dramatically versus a year ago” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on an earnings call. “The customers had money [then]. And at some point that’s going to come to an end.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3N0Y28tcmV0dXJuLXBvbGljeS1ob2xpZGF5cy0yMzAxMDcwMjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Costco's Return Policy for the Holidays?,"shaunl / Getty Images

Costco is one of the most beloved retailers in America as evidenced by the company’s astonishing 91% annual membership renewal rate in North America for its 2020 fiscal year. Part of the reason for the store’s popularity is its generous return policy. As the holidays approach choosing a retailer with a wide-ranging easy return policy can become even more important when you’re shopping. Here’s a look at Costco’s holiday return policy including comparisons of the store’s standard return policy and those offered by its major competitors.

What Is Costco’s Holiday Return Policy?

Costco’s generous return policy is in force for the entire year with no specific changes for the holiday period.

Costco’s Return Policy at a Glance Type of Item Return Policy Return Period Restocking Fee General merchandise Returns accepted Unlimited None Electronics 90-day return policy 90 days None Tires and batteries Limited returns Unlimited None Alcohol Varies by state Varies by state None Cigarettes No returns accepted N/A None Diamonds over 1 carat Paperwork required Unlimited None Custom products No returns; warranty applies N/A None

The beauty of Costco’s overall return policy — which extends unchanged through the holiday season — is that most items are returnable essentially forever. Certain restrictions apply — such as with electronics which have a 90-day restriction or non-returnable items such as cigarettes — but otherwise the Costco return policy is by and large unlimited.

What Is Costco’s Electronics Return Policy?

Although the general Costco return policy is wide-ranging and applies to most merchandise the company does break out a specific more limited return policy when it comes to electronics. As with many retailers Costco only accepts returns on certain electronics for 90 days after customer receipt. Specific electronics included in the 90-day return policy include the following:

Major appliances including refrigerators above 10 cubic feet freezers dishwashers over-the-range microwaves ranges water heaters cooktops and washers and dryers

TVs

Computers

Touchscreen tablets

Cell phones

Smart watches

Cameras

MP3 players

Aerial cameras (drones)

Projectors

Camcorders

What Other Gifts Can You Return to Costco?

As Costco’s general return policy applies to most merchandise you can feel free to return nearly any gift that you are not satisfied with to your local Costco. The only exceptions are those that apply to the standard Costco return policy.

What Can’t You Return to Costco?

Costco is legendary for accepting almost any type of return. News articles regularly cite the more sensational returns such as half-eaten food dead plants and used toilets. The bottom line is that as long as a product doesn’t explicitly violate any part of the Costco return policy — such as the 90-day restriction on certain electronics — you can return practically anything to Costco. That being said there are some limits to the company’s generosity and not all are company-imposed. Individual states for example have their own alcohol return policies that Costco must follow. For diamonds 1 carat or larger members must present all original paperwork including IGI and/or GIA certificates to receive a Jewelry Credit Memo. You can receive a refund within 48 hours after a Costco Graduate Gemologist verifies the authenticity of your diamond. Products such as batteries and tires which have a limited useful life expectancy might have a separate product-specific limited warranty. Perhaps the greatest exception to the all-encompassing Costco return policy applies to Special Order Kiosk and Custom Installed Programs. As those types of products are manufactured to customer specifications they cannot be returned or refunded. The exception is a warranty replacement due to product or workmanship failure.

Are There Any Exceptions to Costco’s Holiday Return Policy?

As the Costco holiday return policy is the same as the retailer’s standard return policy the only exceptions are listed above.

Restocking Fees for Certain Types of Returns

Unlike many retailers Costco doesn’t charge restocking fees for certain types of returns such as electronics.

How To Return an Item to Costco

Costco makes returning items easy. Customers who bought an item at a Costco warehouse can get a refund at the returns counter at any Costco location not just the one where the purchase was made. Even items purchased online can be returned to any Costco warehouse although you can also initiate a return online via Costco.com. Simply click on “Return Items” under your order history and you’ll generate a return label. Where eligible you can also schedule a pickup. If you’re returning large items Costco will contact you with further instructions.

Exchanges and Refunds

If you would like to exchange an order contact Costco. In many cases it’s easier to simply return the item for a full refund and then purchase the item you would like. The company does allow for returns by mail; however as with exchanges it’s often easier to visit any Costco warehouse location for a full refund. Costco also offers a price adjustment service for goods bought in a warehouse or at Costco.com. This generous policy allows shoppers to capture any promotional price reductions in a Costco warehouse for a full 30 days after purchase. For example if you bought a product online for $19.99 and it goes on sale for $14.99 in a warehouse 20 days later you can receive the price difference back as a credit within three to five business days.

How Costco’s and Other Major Retailers’ Return Policies Compare

Costco is one of the few retailers that doesn’t alter its return policy over the holidays. In most cases its competitors do typically to offer more generous returns during a busy shopping season. But it’s apparent that even with these modifications the holiday return policies of most retailers still can’t match the general year-round return policy at Costco.

Costco’s and Other Major Retailers’ Return Policies Retailer Holiday Return Policy General Return Policy Costco Same as general return policy Generally unrestricted

90 days for certain electronics

Limited returns for select products like tires and batteries

State-specific returns for alcohol

No returns for cigarettes or custom products Walmart 14-day return policy on certain electronics begins Dec. 26 Generally 14-90 days Target 30-day return window begins Dec. 26 for electronics and entertainment items purchased between Oct. 1 and Dec. 25 90-day general return policy

14-30 days for electronics

Up to 1 year for Target-owned brands Best Buy Items purchased between Oct. 18 and Jan. 2 of the following year can be returned through Jan. 16 of the following year. Generally 14-15 days

Up to 60 days for Totaltech members

How Do Costco Returns Stack Up?

At first glance some shoppers might be disappointed that Costco doesn’t have a separate more expansive holiday return policy. But loyal Costco members likely have no problem with that. Costco returns are easy and nearly unlimited in scope. Even the electronics return policy extends for 90 days which is much more than the 15-30 days offered by many competitors. Thus Costco has no need to adjust its return policy over the holidays: At any time of the year the retailer will likely take back nearly any product that you are not satisfied with.

Nuts

Costco shoppers are nutty about the store's nuts. So are the team members who source and purchase the products for the shelves. To bring a 2-pound bag of Kirkland Signature Heart Healthy Mixed Nuts the buyers worked with suppliers of almonds pistachios and walnuts in the San Joaquin Valley of California and then turned to hazelnut suppliers in Turkey to find the finest quality of that nut to add to the mix according to the Costco Connection magazine.

And the nut prices are legendary. On the store's website Kirkland Signature Unsalted Mixed Nuts are listed at $17.49 for 2 1/2 pounds. At Whole Foods the 365 Everyday Value Roasted & Unsalted Deluxe Mixed Nuts cost $8.99 for 16 ounces. Buying them at Costco is like getting almost a half-pound for free.

Cake

The Costco brass learned in mid-2020 shortly after the start of the coronavirus pandemic not to mess with success. Or cake. For years the Costco half-sheet cake has been immensely popular but when the pandemic hit and big gatherings ceased Costco pulled the under $20 cake from its offerings. Who needed a cake to serve 48? Americans revolted started a petition drive through Change.org and got their beloved treat back. Fun fact: A Costco half-sheet cake weighs more than 9 pounds.

Alcohol

In most states you can buy alcohol at Costco even if you don't have a membership and people flock to the warehouses to take advantage of a high-quality product at a low price. Speculation long has abounded as to who makes Costco's Kirkland house brand wines and liquors but actual manufacturers remain a mystery. In a February 2021 article Thrillist tried mightily to come up with the answers and its expert couldn't precisely name the manufacturer but compared several Kirkland products favorably with the biggest names in liquor.

When it came to the Kirkland Signature Blended Canadian Whisky for example the expert surmised it was made by noted producer Crown Royal. The cost difference? A 1.75-liter bottle of Kirkland brand sells for $18.99 while a 750-milliliter bottle of Crown Royal starts at about $26.50 at discount retailers.

Pizza

If Costco were a pizza chain it easily would fall within the top 20 in the United States based on sales volume. At just under $10 for a large 18-inch pizza it's a delicious steal. Costco has mastered pizza-making efficiency keeping the price down but that efficiency also has led to consistency in taste. According to Kitchn a daily online food magazine a Costco pizza begins in a flattening machine which presses the dough before it makes its way to the sauce robot for covering. Employees then cover it in mozzarella and provolone cheeses before the pizza hits the oven. Kitchn reported the pizza ovens need just six minutes for the finished product.

Olive Oil

Costco's olive oil has a cult following. Samin Nosrat the host of ""Salt Fat Acid Heat"" on Netflix (and the writer of the book) told The Seattle Times in an interview in 2019 that the Kirkland brand organic extra-virgin olive oil is her go-to for everyday use. ""It's really good!"" she said.

And also really affordable. A 2-liter (about 67 ounces) bottle of Kirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil costs $13.49 on the Costco website. At Trader Joe's the Trader Giotto's Selezione Sicilian Extra Virgin Olive Oil sells for $7.99 for 16.9 ounces.

Toilet Paper

Some of the enduring images of the early days of COVID-19's arrival in the United States -- even before it was declared a pandemic -- were the photos of Costco shoppers packing their carts with what would become a valuable commodity: toilet paper. They stocked up on a higher-quality paper at a value price; a New York Times analysis of toilet from February 2021 gave the Kirkland Signature brand high marks for wet strength softness and cleaning power (it didn't fare as well for absorption). With the Delta variant causing continued COVID-19 concerns in late September Costco announced it would be limiting per-person sales of key items including toilet paper to maintain supply.

Tires

Costco is the tire store for many car owners and Readers' Digest said there is a secret to the store's tire pricing: A different brand goes on sale each month. If the tire you want is available at a price you don't want to pay wait a few months if you can. The Costco website also features offers to save you bundles on a set of four tires. A bonus if you buy tires here: Costco will repair flats and rotate tires at no cost as long as you have them.

That could be a considerable saving with flat repairs typically starting at about $15 and tire rotation costing $35 and up. Tires should be rotated in general every 6000 to 8000 miles.

Chickens

It really isn't a secret that Costco shoppers love the store's legendary $4.99 rotisserie chickens and shoppers gobbled up about 101 million of them in 2020 Reader's Digest reported. Costco has steadfastly refused to raise the price on them through the years even if it is taking a loss on each one sold. Reader's Digest reported the chain loses as much as $40 million per year on the chickens but those chickens keep shoppers coming through the door. Who among us hasn't walked in for a $5 chicken and walked out with $100 worth of stuff in the cart?

Gift Cards

When is $40 worth $50? When you buy a Cinemark gift card through Costco's website. Members can spend $39.99 to purchase a $50 gift card for the theater chain which can be used for admission tickets or refreshments. Costco has other great deals on gift cards too including a $50 card for Jiffy Lube for just $37.99 or a $50 card at sports retailer Fanatics for $39.99.

Tech Support

When it comes to buying a computer camera home theater system tablet or television consumers have lots of choices of stores and online sites. But Costco has developed a following as the place to buy electronics for one reason: free tech support. The tech team is available from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. PT seven days a week to answer questions about setup or to troubleshoot problems. While tech support isn't necessarily a ""product"" its availability drives business to the store.

I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here is back at Gwrych Castle for another series.

The full line-up has now been revealed and it includes an Emmerdale bad boy a singer turned Loose Women star and an Olympic gold medalist.

It will be the second time a King of Queen of the Castle will be crowned - rather than a King or Queen of the Jungle.

But who won the show last year?

Radio host Jordan North author Giovanna Fletcher and presenter Vernon Kay made the it to the final last year.

And for the very first time in the ITV reality show's 20 series history the winner was crowned King or Queen of the Castle.

And it was Giovanna who became the first ever Queen of the Castle.

The mum-of-three just pipped BBC Radio 1 DJ Jordan North - who was a favourite amongst viewers right from the start - and was awarded the crown for the 2020 series in a closely fought race.

He told Ant and Dec Giovanna ""deserved"" the win"" and described her as the ""kindest"" person he had met.

Giovanna was completely lost for words as she sat on her now throne.

""Ask me in a week"" she told the I'm A Celeb hosts after they asked how she felt.

She has since joked that she can't return her Queen of the Castle crown.

Speaking on ITV's Lorraine about her new book Walking on Sunshine earlier this month Giovanna revealed she's made good use out of the famous crown reports Wales Live.

""This time last year you were getting ready to go into the jungle"" Lorraine said. ""You need to go back and give your crown back now.""

""No that's my door wreath now!"" Giovanna exclaimed.

""It's your door wreath?"" Lorraine questioned before adding: ""Oh they just need to make another one I'm sure they will!""

""I was lucky actually because I got to keep my sceptre as well"" the author continued. ""I'm pretty sure when they are in Australia they can't keep that because they can't fly home with it.""

The basic business model is to lug lots of stuff to offset the high fixed costs of owning fleets of locomotives and maintaining thousands of miles of track. That has been hard as America’s supply chain has come unglued first because of covid-19 and then as it has waned. Ports are gridlocked warehouses over-stuffed and labour unavailable. It has unquestionably been a tough time to be a rail company and it turns out a remarkably good time to be one.

Volumes and profits at the listed companies that run America’s tracks and trains used to be tied as closely as a locomotive to its cargo. No longer. Traffic has yet to recover from pre-pandemic peaks according to the Association of American Railroads a trade group.

He has every attribute to be a success with media outlets and the sporting public: tall good looking sufficiently young without being too young intelligent well spoken a winning smile a hint of political progressivism without – you know – talking about it too much a seriously good highlight reel a winning CV and a place in all formats that is never open to question. Unless some unlikely transgression is dug up from his past he is the ultimate cleanskin at a time when Cricket Australia desperately needs one.

All of which means that he will surely be installed as Australia’s next Test captain once his obligatory milkshake duck check is complete. After the sandpaper farrago in 2018 some of the cricket world did manage to dredge up enough goodwill to see whether the Australian men’s players and the governance body responsible for them could remake their culture into a kinder gentler polity. The public relations version of that image was maintained via new captain Tim Paine while he and CA put their preaching of “elite honesty” into practice by covering up an investigation into his off-field behaviour. Three years later and a tearful resignation press conference ended Paine’s tenure just as one had begun it.

Once again a captaincy shuffle will be the tactic to convince observers that a bold new era has begun one completely distinct from the past despite sharing every other attribute. To make that sell those running CA need an exceptional candidate rather than just the next in line. They have one in Cummins who can make followers of the sport feel lightheaded by nothing more than a looping GIF of him bowling Joe Root at Old Trafford. Aside from all of the attributes above he also offers the novelty of seeing a fast bowler lead Australia. Novelty combined with integrity could be a powerful public analgesic.

They need a pick that communicates a vista towards the future

Fast bowlers don’t get to captain Australia. Ray Lindwall did it once filling in. That’s the list. The generally accepted reason is that fast bowling is intensely hard physical work therefore those poor souls need to gasp for breath between their overs or to switch off for an hour at fine leg recovering from a long spell without having to stay focused on the tactics and progression of the match. No doubt it’s easier to marshal the field as a specialist batter standing at slip all day. But that probably underestimates fast bowlers who even when they are not bowling have more at stake than anyone in how the opposition is progressing.

Fast bowlers also tend to get injured or at least need breaks more than players who bat or keep wicket or even bowl spin. But Cummins after his youthful injury years has become Australia’s most durable. Aside from skipping a two-Test jaunt to Dubai to play Pakistan in late 2018 he has played all of the team’s other 33 Tests since his comeback. That includes two five-Test Ashes series and another six-Test home summer. As for his quality with the ball he is the one player who Australia will mot want to rotate out if they can avoid it.

In any case a captain who misses a match here and there or even has to miss a series is nothing new in cricket. It is more generally accepted in other countries where the process around captaincy involves less formality and reverence. Sometimes it just needs somebody to do the job.

In any case there isn’t exactly a suite of alternatives. If administrators are too spooked by the idea of picking a bowler they could turn back to the former captain before the former captain Steve Smith. He is still there still twitching still willing to take up the task again. But in the middle of another public relations disaster based around CA’s chronic unwillingness and inability to demand integrity or hold anyone accountable restoring a formerly disgraced captain would only exacerbate and underline the problem.

For an organisation more interested in brand management than in what the entity behind the brand actually stands for this will not do. They need a pick that communicates a vista towards the future a(nother) fresh start a(nother) pledge to do things differently. Whether that is actually true is not important only whether it looks true. The one consolation for those who love Australia cricket is that in this case the option which looks best also happens to be the option that is best. One is left to hope that Cummins brings some substance to add to CA’s desired style.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8xMS9jdW1taW5zLXBvd2VyZWQtMTk2My1jaGV2eS1jMTAtcGlja3VwLWlzLWEtc2VyaW91c2x5LWNvb2wtc2hvcC10cnVjay12aWRlby_SAXRodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjEvMTEvY3VtbWlucy1wb3dlcmVkLTE5NjMtY2hldnktYzEwLXBpY2t1cC1pcy1hLXNlcmlvdXNseS1jb29sLXNob3AtdHJ1Y2stdmlkZW8vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cummins-Powered 1963 Chevy C10 Pickup Is A Seriously Cool Shop Truck: Video,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/11/cummins-powered-1963-chevy-c10-pickup-is-a-seriously-cool-shop-truck-video/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8xMS9jdW1taW5zLXBvd2VyZWQtMTk2My1jaGV2eS1jMTAtcGlja3VwLWlzLWEtc2VyaW91c2x5LWNvb2wtc2hvcC10cnVjay12aWRlby_SAXRodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjEvMTEvY3VtbWlucy1wb3dlcmVkLTE5NjMtY2hldnktYzEwLXBpY2t1cC1pcy1hLXNlcmlvdXNseS1jb29sLXNob3AtdHJ1Y2stdmlkZW8vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L3BhdC1jdW1taW5zLXBvaXNlZC1iZWNvbWUtY2FwdGFpbi1hbWlkc3QtY2EtZWNiLXNjYW5kYWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cummins poised to captain Australia amidst off-field controversies for CA and ECB,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/pat-cummins-poised-become-captain-amidst-ca-ecb-scandals on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L3BhdC1jdW1taW5zLXBvaXNlZC1iZWNvbWUtY2FwdGFpbi1hbWlkc3QtY2EtZWNiLXNjYW5kYWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9uZXdzL2phbWVzLWFuZGVyc29uLWJhY2tzLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hdXN0cmFsaWEtdGVzdC1za2lwcGVyL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg3ODMxNzUyLmNtc9IBlgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9uZXdzL2phbWVzLWFuZGVyc29uLWJhY2tzLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hdXN0cmFsaWEtdGVzdC1za2lwcGVyL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NzgzMTc1Mi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Anderson backs Pat Cummins to become Australia Test skipper,"SYDNEY: England pacer James Anderson has thrown his weight behind Pat Cummins to become the next Test skipper of Australia.

In the middle of last week - a moment that now feels a long time ago - Pat Cummins was asked about the likely need for Australia to rotate their fast bowlers during the Ashes.

While in one breath saying he thought it unlikely that all the quicks could play the five Tests he then added: ""I certainly won't be putting my hand up to be rested unless I've got something going wrong.""

If what is highly expected to happen in the coming days is confirmed and Cummins is named as Australia's next Test captain following the sudden departure of Tim Paine then it may not even be up for discussion.

It is a remarkable part of the Cummins story that he has become Australia's most durable fast bowler. Since his return to Test cricket in 2017 only Stuart Broad James Anderson Nathan Lyon and R Ashwin have bowled more overs . A major success story for sports science after Cricket Australia saw the talent they had but held him back from Test cricket for six years following his stunning debut - which marked its 10th anniversary just a few days ago. But that durability will now be tested to the full.

There is recent evidence that Cummins can withstand the strains of the five Tests which are largely back-to-back from early December to mid-January. He was the only one of Australia's fast bowlers to play all five Tests in the 2019 Ashes as the team embraced rotation although conditions in England are not as brutal as those that can play out in this country.

However if his elevation is rubberstamped it is a journey into an unknown world both for Australian cricket and Cummins himself. The previous fast bowler to captain an Australia men's side in any format was Ray Lindwall who did it for one Test in 1956. Having a wicketkeeper in the role was going against the grain too even if not quite so much and it does raise a question about whether an on-field leadership void has opened up in the Australian men's game.

History is not without specialist quicks (the list is widened if allrounders are included) who have held the position over the longer-term - Courtney Walsh Wasim Akram and Bob Willis among them - but it remains a select group. Bowling fast is the toughest job in the game physically at least and there is the added challenge of a bowler-captain needing both a singular focus and a wider view of the game when they have ball in the hand.

For a batter the traditional custodians of captaincy in the game all they need to worry about at the crease doing their main job is the next ball and that innings. The other questions don't go away but they are more easily parked when the team is at the crease.

The other factor for Cummins will be knowing when not to bowl. He was Paine's go-to man last season against India particularly by the time the series reached the final Test but he will need to resist the temptation of feeling he has to be the one to take the ball on all occasions. When Andrew Flintoff was named England captain in 2006 he bowled himself into the ground peaking at 68 overs during a Test against Sri Lanka in Lord's after which he was never the same again.

Writing in Nine newspapers Greg Chappell said that Cummins had some natural advantages that other quick bowlers may not.

""The captain traditionally fields close to the wicket to control proceedings"" he said. ""Cummins is such a brilliant all-round fielder that he can be close to his bowlers instead of the outfield pastures usually favoured by fast bowlers. My biggest fear? The workload which could preclude him playing a full five-Test series without a rest. So it would be interesting to see who is appointed as his deputy. Cummins will also have to learn to use himself judiciously and neither over-bowl nor under-bowl. It is imperative that the seniors in the team advise him in a timely manner.""

That is not say Cummins won't be able to make a success of it he is a hugely impressive cricketer with a terrific mind - and perhaps significantly a broad range of interests beyond runs and wickets - but there is precious little on-field evidence to go by. His professional captaincy experience is four one-day games for New South Wales last season a role he was given with the future national leadership in mind although not quite so soon.

He was good in those domestic one-day matches but was not overly taxed by too many situations. And with due respect to the Marsh Cup the consequences of it not going so well were minimal. That certainly won't be the case come next month in Brisbane not to mention the weeks leading up to that first ball which will test his leadership given the situation in which he is set to be appointed.

""My biggest fear? The workload which could preclude him playing a full five-Test series without a rest. So it would be interesting to see who is appointed as his deputy."" Greg Chappell on Cummins' challenges

As Chappell pointed out the identity of the vice-captain is arguably just as intriguing. Steven Smith is a strong candidate although that would put him one injury away from taking the captaincy again and it remains to be seen if in the current climate that is something Cricket Australia wants. Beyond that it becomes a rather thin field particularly in terms of experience.

David Warner is not an option as he remains banned from any leadership position in Australian cricket for life - although there is a push to have that reconsidered - and it feels too early for Marnus Labuschagne. Travis Head is a previous vice-captain but is not assured of his place in the middle. Usman Khawaja has the experience and standing but is fighting for the final batting spot with Head. During the era of dual vice-captains Josh Hazlewood also had the title. If ultimately it is decided that Paine can't keep his position in the team and Alex Carey takes the gloves he would be a candidate even on Test debut. Nathan Lyon with 100 Tests to his name would seem worthwhile of consideration."

Here's what happened,"New York CNN Business —

CVS’ announcement Thursday that it will close 900 stores over the next three years — around 10% of its pharmacies — may have caught some shoppers off guard.

Isn’t CVS doing really well right now? Haven’t lots of people gone to drug stores during the pandemic to stock up on hand sanitizer cleaning wipes and toilet paper? What about all those Covid-19 vaccine shots CVS gives out?

Actually CVS (CVS)’ closures shouldn’t come as a surprise. They are the latest moves in the long-running contraction of the US retail pharmacy sector. CVS (CVS) Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) have been shuttering stores for years while independent pharmacies have come under pressure from chains. Drug store closures can hurt local communities creating access gaps for medications and essentials.

CVS the largest drug store chain in the United States pointed to “changes in population consumer buying patterns and future health needs” as factors in its decision to close stores.

Here’s why CVS will close 900 stores.

Pivot to health care

The future of CVS is not selling snacks candy shampoo and greeting cards. It’s in health care.

To that end in 2018 CVS completed a $69 billion acquisition of Aetna the largest health care deal in history to create a gigantic customer base of about 40 million Americans. CVS bet that the deal will increase its profits from those patients’ health plans while helping to lower its costs.

CVS also has been revamping its retail strategy and said Thursday that its stores will have three distinct models: locations that offer primary care services; “HealthHub” stores that have on-site dieticians nurse practitioners and lab services and on-site treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma; and traditional stores.

CVS is “really pivoting and leaning into the health care aspects of the business” said George Hill an analyst who covers the company and the health care industry at Deutsche Bank. “You’d much rather be selling health care services that are high-dollar value high-margin versus greeting cards.”

Too many stores

When you walk down the street or drive around the suburbs you’ll typically pass a CVS. And then hit a Walgreens right next door. Rite Aid is probably pretty close too.

“There’s too many pharmacies in the country and there’s too much pharmacy capacity. That gives CVS a reason to go” said Hill.

CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 yet it still has more than 9900 stores. That’s more than Walmart (WMT) Target (TGT) Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST) — combined.

Its latest closings will “reduce store density in certain locations” CVS said Thursday which translates into the fact that CVS has too many stores too close to each other in some places.

Competition from Amazon and Dollar General

Also fewer people are heading to CVS and other drug stores to fill their prescriptions and shop for household staples these days. (And they’re not going into CVS to buy tobacco either which the company stopped selling in 2014.)

Some shoppers have replaced their trips to stores like CVS by buying their supplies online from Amazon (AMZN) or from brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart and Target. The chains have built their own strong e-commerce businesses in recent years.

Dollar General (DG) has also grabbed market share from drug stores undercutting the sector with lower prices on similar items. And now Dollar General (DG) is launching its own health care initiative as it continues to take business from pharmacies.

Online pharmacies and telemedicine have gained traction too. Amazon bought PillPack in 2018 for more than $700 million and started shipping prescriptions to Prime members last year. Capsule and other digital pharmacies that deliver directly to customers’ homes are also growing.

Although brick-and-mortar pharmacies are still an important stop for many elderly peopleor those who don’t use the web or have access to it they are increasingly becoming a thing of the past to the growing ranks of online shoppers.

Rising costs

Closing stores also reduces CVS’ costs while still keeping most of its sales. Its labor and store operations costs increased during the pandemic because of safety protections like plexiglass floor decals and masks. The company said in August it planned to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 in a bid to retain and attract workers.

“There are cost pressures in all directions” said Hill the Deutsche Bank analyst.

Seventy-five percent of CVS’ sales comes from filling prescriptions but its profits from that segment have declined in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates.

But when CVS closes a store it can hold onto most of those sales by shifting the prescriptions to its nearest pharmacies Hill said.

Covid-19 vaccines weren’t a huge boost

CVS got a lift from people coming into its stores for their Covid-19 vaccines and tests. The company has administered 43 million vaccines and around 38 million tests CEO Karen Lynch said on an earnings call earlier this month.

But the vaccines were only a short-term gain for the company which said they will generate only $3 billion in revenue in 2021. That will decline by up to 40% next year along with whatever sales CVS racked up as shoppers browsed aisles while they waited to get vaccinated Lynch said.

People also visited their doctors less frequently last year and into 2021 and elective procedures were suspended early in the pandemic which meant that CVS filled fewer regular and chronic care prescriptions than in the years before the pandemic.

And fewer people have also been coming into stores to pick up cough and fever medicines — big business for CVS — because they’re still wearing masks and spending more time at home than they once did.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2VuLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEvbGF0ZXN0X25ld3MvMTYzNzQ2MDI3NF82ODQzNDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is CVS closing 900 stores? when and where?,"Beginning in the spring of 2022 CVS will start a process of changing its store formats to “drive higher engagement with consumers.” The process will see around 900 stores closing over the next three years as the pharmacy chain adjusts to “changes in population consumer buying patterns and future health needs.”

The closures will represent roughly nine percent of the company’s total retail locations. The restructuring which is dubbed “omnichannel health strategy” will see the development of three different store models which will serve as community health destinations.

CVS Health will reduce store density

In the drug store chain’s press release CVS said it performed a strategic review of its retail business. Due to shifting populations and demands the company wants to “ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers.” Part of that mission will require reducing store density around the country where is some places the pharmacy chain has two stores in relatively close proximity within a matter of blocks.

CVS plans to begin the reorganization in the spring of 2022 with the first of 300 stores closing next year. The process will continue with a further 300 closures more or less in each of the following two years. Exactly which stores will be closing their doors hasn’t been stated yet.

New formats to engage costumers

CVS will tailor its remaining 9000 retail stores to fit three areas of their business as part of a broader realignment of its services. “Our retail stores are fundamental to our strategy and who we are as a company"" President and CEO of CVS Health Karen Lynch said in a statement.

The company will update the traditional CVS pharmacy experience where customers can have prescriptions filled and pick up convenience items in addition to receiving health and wellness services. Other locations will focus on offering primary care services and the drug store chain will be developing an enhanced version of its HealthHUB locations.

""We remain focused on the competitive advantage provided by our presence in thousands of communities across the country which complements our rapidly expanding digital presence"" Lynch said.

CVS needs to clean up its image to draw in the public

The need for a remodeling and culling of locations comes as some stores are “shabby” and there are “too many overlapping locations"" according to Neil Saunders managing director of GlobalData. In a letter to investors he said the pharmacy chain has “neglected stores for far too long and has pushed some of them into the downward spiral of irrelevance.”

He added that “too many stores are stuck in the past with bad lighting depressing interiors messy merchandising and a weak assortment of products.” Facing competition from natural rivals and newer ones CVS stores are not “destinations or places where people go out of anything other than necessity” Saunders said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbXlyZ3YuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVkLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEvY3ZzLXRvLWNsb3NlLTkwMC1zdG9yZXMtb3Zlci1uZXh0LXRocmVlLXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS to close 900 stores over next three years,"CVS Pharmacy executives announced they intend to close 900 stores over the next three years or about 9 percent of their total locations.

CVS has 14 locations in the Rio Grande Valley with five of those in Brownsville and two others in Harlingen. Single stores are located in McAllen Edinburg Mission Weslaco Elsa San Juan and South Padre Island.

The company did not release a list of locations which will shut down.

“The company has been evaluating changes in population consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business” a company statement reads.

The decision comes as the pharmacy chain works to diversify its offerings outside of the traditional pharmacy business. Executives with the company say they are going to concentrate on a business model they hope will make CVS locations community health destinations.

Those include sites dedicated to offering primary care services an enhanced version of HealthHUB locations to fill everyday health and wellness needs and traditional CVS stores that provide prescription services and other retail offerings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9saWZlc3R5bGUvdXMtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExLzIwLzYxOTkzYjc1Y2E0NzQxNDIwZThiNDYwYS5odG1s0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWFyY2EuY29tL2VuL2xpZmVzdHlsZS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTEvMjAvNjE5OTNiNzVjYTQ3NDE0MjBlOGI0NjBhLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS: Why is it closing 900 of its stores?,"CVS the biggets pharmacy chain in the U.S. informed last Thursday that will close 300 stores every year for the next three years a total of 900 pharmacies according to Barron's.

That represents nearly 10% of its outlets.CVS's main argument is that the closures will assure retail presence with """"right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business.""

CVS aims at a digital market

""Our retail stores are fundamental to our strategy and who we are as a company we remain focused on the competitive advantage provided by our presence in thousands of communities across the country which complements our rapidly expanding digital presence"" said CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch in a statement.

In addition to the closures CVS's broader realignment of its retail strategy includes remodeling some stores by adding more health services such as primary care and an ""enhanced version"" of its HealthHub layout offering everyday health services and providing what a traditional pharmacy would.

""Too many stores are stuck in the past with bad lighting depressing interiors messy merchandising and a weak assortment of products. They are not destinations or places where people go out of anything other than necessity"" Neil Saunders retail industry analyst and managing director of GlobalData said in a note.

Dollar General the big winner

One company will take advantage of this decision Dollar General (DG) which has rapidly expanded in the United States in right now is trying to ""establish itself as a health destination.""

DG is launching a special health care initiative offering customers in ""health care deserts"" in rural America a variety of health services in stores and expanded over-the-counter products.

CVS's closures will cost the company about $1 billion by the end of 2022. Affected employees will be offered jobs at nearby locations or different opportunities altogether."

MOLINE Ill. — The John Deere Pavilion in Moline has been closed since March 2020 and reopened for the first time on Friday Nov. 19 with a new look.

""We knew that we needed to change things and make it feel like a welcome center for people coming to see John Deere"" said John Deere Branded Properties Lead Brandon Jens. ""For the last year over this entire summer we've had an incredible team of people put together this new space. It's taken a lot of work a lot of energy supply chain issues.""

A major part was refreshing the space to make it look more like a pavilion Jens said. It also serves as the welcome center for the company.

""We needed to show everyone our higher purpose what our equipment's doing today"" he said. ""It's just meant to be a space that completely is changing and evolving through time.""

Visitors can see the iconic green tractor equipment on display including some vintage equipment. Some of it you're able to climb up and sit in while others are for eyes only.

""That's the star of the show. Everybody wants all the kids want to climb on the equipment"" Jens said. ""Around April I believe we're bringing in an X9 combine so the idea of the space is really to have it be modular and flexible. If you come in six months every six months it should be very different new experiences.""

Some of the other new exhibits include a tech room that you can walk through and interact with to learn about how four different individuals around the world use the equipment.

Also new to the pavilion is the ""We Run Hat Exhibit.""

""You can pick a hat in our exhibit there's 30 hats to pick from and you can hear the story of the person who wore that hat or even just a little detail about the hat"" Jens said.

There's still some work that has to be done before the new pavilion is complete. Jens said there's eventually going to be digital kiosks next to the equipment so visitors can read and learn about it. There's also going to be a new game that he believes will be a hit with the kids.

""It's called a stomp and spray so like ""Dance Dance Revolution"" game where you dance on the pad"" Jens said. ""We're gonna have a screen that shows crops going by and you have to stomp on the weeds to kill them.""

Jens said after being closed for so long it's fun to see everyone get to enjoy the space again.

""I've been in this space for a year and it's been empty"" he said. ""It's amazing to see all these people in here seeing the community see how they're interacting with the equipment and our exhibits.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmljdWx0dXJlLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Nyb3AtbWFuYWdlbWVudC9vZmZzZXQtZmVydGlsaXplci1jb3N0cy13aXRoLXZhcmlhYmxlLXJhdGUtdGVjaG5vbG9nedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Offset fertilizer costs with variable-rate technology,"Soaring fertilizer costs at their highest levels since 2008 are impacting 2022 planting decisions. Analysts predict a correction is unlikely in the near term.

According to the USDA's Illinois Production Cost Report in October the average price for urea was $810 per metric ton compared to $352 per metric ton in 2020. Diammonium phosphate (DAP) prices were at $814 per metric ton nearly double what they were in 2020 at $427 per metric ton.

The report also noted the price of liquid 28% nitrogen saw a significant jump in 2021 with the average at $475 per metric ton compared to $222 the previous year. Potash prices were $775 per metric ton an increase of almost $400 per metric ton from the previous year.

""With increases this dramatic in fertilizer prices we are starting to see growers turn toward or gain interest in tools like scripting that allow them to be more efficient and cost effective with their inputs"" says Matthew Lau global product manager of scripting for The Climate Corp.

Variable-rate prescriptions have been available for several years yet the technology is still not widely used.

""Approximately 20% of our current FieldView customers in the U.S. are using seed fertilizer and crop protection scripts"" Lau says. ""Our products that help farmers variable-rate have been in the marketplace for about five years. In that time we've been able to identify the pain points preventing farmers from creating more prescriptions and adopting more variable-rate activities.""

Ease of use is at the top of the list. With the introduction of Automatic Zone Creation Climate is working to make the process more automated.

""We were always hearing from growers how much time it took to create and manage prescriptions. Previously the tool for manual scripting had little to zero automatic capabilities with it and it required the user to pull up an image or a yield layer as a background layer and manually draw out the parts of the field they would like to begin managing"" he says. ""We're trying to get to a point where we are able to take the grower's data that has been collected and provide him with a fast easy solution to optimize the subfield areas in his operation.""

Automatically creating field zones using satellite imagery from any scouting map saves the farmer time. This tool also enables farmers to more easily and confidently write variable-rate fertilizer prescriptions to optimize their fertilizer investment and meet performance goals.

""The changes we've made give users the ability to easily see between all of their scouting layers and see the variability in their field using those layers and then make adjustments"" Lau says.

Users can set a zone count from two to 12 zones in a field allowing them to easily manage field variability and tailor it to the activity they're creating a script for.

""Automatic zone creation gives growers a much higher level of flexibility and accuracy to optimize inputs. It also allows growers to test different layers and different hypotheses and compare those to determine which one they feel is going to be the best choice to move into that next season"" he says. ""We know every year is different and every year brings its own set of challenges. We're excited to be able to deliver this functionality so growers can manage those challenges more effectively. Hopefully it will allow farmers to more easily adopt the technology.""

Climate Corp. is also rolling out an update to its tank mix product selection tool which provides farmers with the ability to easily identify and record crop protection products in a tank mix when creating a prescription.

""In June 2020 we launched our first iteration giving farmers the ability to create a crop protection prescription with one product"" Lau says.

Based on overwhelming feedback from growers the latest version of the tool can now handle up to eight crop protection products in a single tank mix.

""When applying herbicides growers rarely put down one product"" he says. ""They often have two three four or more depending on the region and the crop. Growers wanted the ability to more accurately tag all the products they had in the prescription so they know exactly what the recommendation is and what it's going to be used for in the field.""

Both tools come at no added cost for new and existing FieldView customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExL2N5bmduLXN0b2NrLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtYXV0b25vbXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cyngn Stock: Investing in Industrial Autonomous Vehicles,"Our last article to delve into self-driving technology analyzed autonomous vehicle delivery for Walmart. While we may all someday own a robotic car in the future – and Elon Musk would argue that Tesla owners already do – the most likely scenario is that most self-driving vehicles will be used for commercial purposes in the near term. This includes not just having crap delivered from Walmart or Amazon but also moving cargo with self-driving trucks or people with self-driving taxis and buses.

Unless you’re lucky enough to live in one of the handful of cities where companies are actively testing these technologies it’s unlikely a robotic Prius will deliver your microgreens from Whole Foods anytime soon. Full-scale deployment on the open road is realistically still years away as there are still plenty of challenges to solve from programming for every possible eventuality to perfecting sensor technology to building the necessary infrastructure to accommodate autonomous vehicles.

That’s why automating a constrained environment like warehouses with mobile robots is an easier feat because there are fewer variables and there’s always workers comp for the occasional mishap. A company called Cyngn (CYN) – a name that makes it sound like a potential candidate to create Skynet and destroy humanity in the machine wars – is developing self-driving software for industrial autonomous vehicles that operate in constrained environments such as warehouses or construction sites.

About Cyngn Stock

It’s likely that most of you have never heard of Cyngn but how about Cyanogen? No it’s not a company developing a biotechnology weapon that will destroy humanity but a one-time serious contender in the smartphone world. Technically founded in 2009 and officially founded in 2013 Cyanogen was a Silicon Valley startup that had raised $115 million from a fairly impressive list of investors including marquee venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz Chinese tech giant Tencent Qualcomm and the Foxy Rupert Murdoch. The company was reportedly valued at close to $1 billion after an $85 million Series C in March 2015.

Forbes published a glowing origin story around the same time. There was the genius programmer Steve Kondik who began tinkering with the open-source Android operating system (OS). There was the iconoclast business guy Kirt McMaster whose vision helped turn an open-source OS project CyanogenMod into a company Cyanogen that was wheeling and dealing with the likes of Microsoft. Allegedly as many as 50 million users were running the CyanogenMod OS on their phones by 2015. Yet by the end of 2016 Cyanogen pulled the plug on its mobile OS product. Rumors said that maybe it was more like three million users. Both McMaster and Kondik left the company at some point.

You probably guessed by now that Cyanogen became Cyngn pivoting from mobile to mobility with an open-source self-driving software suite. The company went public last month opening at $7.50 a share with a market cap near $200 million pocketing about $26 million from people who actually thought it was a good idea to invest their money in a company with shall we say (upon advice of our legal counsel) a colorful history and zero revenues.

The Technology

Let’s step back and look at what’s under the hood of Cyngn before we kick the tires too hard. The company has apparently spent the last five years developing what it calls the Enterprise Autonomy Suite (EAS) which “leverages advanced in-vehicle autonomous driving technology and incorporates leading supporting technologies like data analytics fleet management cloud and connectivity.” The main piece of its industrial autonomous vehicle software is called DriveMod (or CyanogenMod or whatever) which is a “modular software product that is compatible with various sensor and computer hardware components that are widely used throughout the autonomous vehicle industry.”

In this case the software is somehow optimized to work with multiple vehicle types especially industrial machines like forklifts and bulldozers which obviously operate in less dynamic environments than a car trying to cross Los Angeles in the middle of the day. For instance DriveMod is capable of perceiving more than 100 dynamic objects per second to navigate autonomously while the industrial settings of its target market rarely encounter 100 objects per minute. To date the technology has been tested on nine different types of industrial vehicles from stockchasers and stand-on floor scrubbers to 14-seat shuttles and 15-foot-long cargo vehicles. Vehicles running Cyngn’s software can switch between manual remote-controlled and fully autonomous driving modes.

The software suite also includes Cyngn Insight the interface for monitoring and managing fleets of industrial autonomous vehicles. Analytics dashboards surface data about the system’s status vehicle telemetry and performance metrics. The data also feed the machine-learning algorithms that make up Cyngn Evolve the tool that continuously improves the self-driving OS.

The Business Model

Cyngn is all about autonomous driving software so it partners with various companies that manufacture industrial vehicle platforms and hardware that are interested in integrating its autonomous software. For example last month Cyngn announced a partnership with Columbia Vehicle Group which makes small electric industrial vehicles for warehouse environments. The business strategy mainly consists of “acquiring new customers who are either (a) looking to embed our technology into their vehicle products or (b) upsell their existing clients with our vehicle retrofits.” In other words much of Cyngn’s success hinges on its partner network.

The company expects to generate revenue two ways: deployment and EAS subscriptions. Deployments require Cyngn and its partners to work with a new client to map the job site gather data and install the industrial autonomous vehicle tech within their fleet and site. It then offers EAS on a software as a subscription (SaaS) model and then the money just starts rolling in.

The Market Opportunity

How much money? Who knows. Cyngn has yet to make a dime on its autonomous driving solution aside from $166000 that it collected on a one-time proof-of-concept deployment. EAS is currently in beta mode and the company doesn’t expect full commercialization until 2024 which it estimates will cost up to $23 million in additional R&D. That just happens to be about how much Cyngn pocketed in last month’s IPO.

Credit: Cyngn

The company is initially going after the market of industrial vehicles for manufacturing and distribution which it says is worth $119 billion. That’s based on the number of such vehicles shipped by the top 10 manufacturers each year (883000) X hours of operation per non-autonomous vehicle annually (4174) X average hourly labor wage ($32.42). That’s math that even an MBA can understand.

Should You Buy Cyngn Stock?

Of course that same MBA is probably laughing his ass off right about now. There are so many red flags here that we risk being trampled to death by bulls. Cyngn is a public company with zero customers (partners are not the same thing) zero revenue and a product that sounds like it is far from being commercially viable. While the pivot from smartphones to smart forklifts isn’t exactly an Intrexon move the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

And it’s not as if Cyngn is entering a virgin market. We’ve been writing about companies building and deploying robotic construction equipment since at least 2017. One such startup Built Machines is already turning excavators into trenching robots. Others are automating mining trucks and tractors. Commercial floor cleaning robots? Check. And let’s not forget about big boys like Caterpillar (CAT) which has more than 275 autonomous trucks in operation.

Conclusion

One thing Cyngn should be commended for is choosing a traditional path to an initial public offering as opposed to that special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) nonsense that never provides enough color. Cyngn has provided enough color and it’s a big avoid from us because they don’t meet our market cap threshold of $1 billion. And even if they did we don’t invest in pre-revenue companies. Meaningful revenues are critically important to prove product-market fit especially for disruptive technologies like autonomous driving.

There were sprayers and applicators silo refurbishers and silo builders seed companies and chemical companies as well as soil health companies and software tracking firms.

The show which was put on by the Kansas Grain and Feed Association and the Kansas Agribusiness Retailers Association featured businesses from Iowa Kansas Minnesota Nebraska Oklahoma and South Dakota. All were trying to inform farmers landowners and other business people about their services and products.

Some Kansas Ag businesses

Kevin Henderson of Western Ag traveled from Great Bend where the company manufactures blue white and black tarps to cover hay and silage. They also construct shade cloths for feedlots for cattle during the summer months.

""It (the canopy) really helps a lot"" Henderson said.

Mark Wurst of Pickens Restoration said many farmers and businesses are repairing or replacing silos that were built during the 30s 40s and 50s.

""They're upgrading"" he said. ""They're also trying to get it (grains) out of the weather.""

Engineering equipment and software were also on display. Wichita-based Hammel Scale brought in scales probes meters and protein testers. Kasa Controls and Automation which provides turnkey industrial controls and automation engineering came down from its headquarters in Salina and AgTrax an agriculture software company in Hutchinson was present.

Two members of the Kansas Highway and Patrol showed up to answer questions about how to obtain specific driver's licenses find out about road closures load securement and inclement weather.

Some other Kansas businesses present were ServiTech a soil testing service out of Dodge City Mears Fertilizer out of El Dorado Kauffman Seed of Hutchinson Mid-Continent Industries in Newton and INAlert out of Ellinwood.

Last year analysts valued the scheme at around $18bn-30bn eclipsing the company’s current market capitalisation of $12.9bn. Such programmes have proved a boon to American carriers in the pandemic. Firms including American Airlines have raised $30bn in debt backed by the schemes.

Airlines once hoped simply to foster loyalty by offering customers freebies. Passengers collected miles as they travelled and were awarded a free flight once they racked up enough of them. But schemes today are far more sophisticated. Airlines profit by selling miles to credit-card firms at a price that exceeds the cost of providing reward flights and dishing out other perks such as hotel stays. They also gain when miles expire unused or are cashed in for something of poor value.

Dubai — It’s simple really. No pilots no flying. A shortage of aviators is already stinging airlines particularly in the U.S. where the whiplash of the rapid pandemic drawdown of staff in 2020 and the swift rebound in traffic in 2021 has created a hiring and training crunch.

Big carriers aiming for 2019 levels of flying need the pilots to do so retraining its existing crews who have moved up the seniority ranks while recruiting as many qualified pilots as possible from the regional carriers and other sources. In the immediate future that means a more fragile air travel system and threatens service to smaller communities served by the smallest regional jets.

Longer term and regardless of whether the flying public labor unions or regulators are ready the technological foundations for single-pilot operations (SPO) are already being laid today for a coming generation of regional aircraft and freighters spurred by retirements a clogged pipeline of new pilots and the search for the next step change in operating economics.

The shortage is leaving its mark today.

Officials said Transportation Security Administration employees confronted the bag’s owner who lunged for the weapon which led to the discharge.

Videos posted to social media showed passengers seeking shelter and lying on the ground after hearing the gunfire.

THANKSGIVING TRAVEL FORECAST: WHERE HOLIDAY TRAVELERS CAN EXPECT FLIGHT DELAYS INTO NEXT WEEK

Meteorologists say the weather for metro Atlanta looks favorable on Sunday for airlines to get planes and travel schedules back on track.

Forecast models show rain holding off until early Monday morning ahead of a cold front.

FOX Weather meteorologists say Monday’s expected rain could slow travel in and out of the airport and lead to moderate delays.

Do remote jobs not have to abide by local minimum wages? If so could a Portland company “relocate” to Alabama and cut their current employees’ pay accordingly? —Cathleen A.

I certainly appreciate the penny-pinching fiendishness of your plan Cathleen but if it were legal to pay employees based on the minimum wage at corporate headquarters Jeff Bezos would live in Somalia. Your wage is governed by the laws of the place where you physically do the work regardless of the state (or planet) your employer calls home.

Delta Airlines for example is based in Georgia where the state minimum wage is $5.15 an hour.* But if they hire you to work in downtown Portland—incinerating passengers’ luggage maybe or throwing darts to determine which flights to cancel—you’re entitled to the local minimum wage of $14. This holds true even if you were hired in Georgia your name is Bubba and you go back home to Macon every weekend.

Things are less clear when it comes to taxes though especially in a pandemic. Both Oregon (which has an income tax) and Washington (which doesn’t) have always agreed that if—and only if—you work in Oregon you pay Oregon tax. Thus Washington residents who once commuted to Oregon are now getting a major tax break by working from home.

New York on the other hand claims that (for the duration of COVID at least) nonresident telecommuters employed by New York firms still legally work in New York. This means there are probably people in New Jersey paying New York income tax who haven’t crossed the Hudson in almost two years. (Maybe that’s one of the reasons cranky New Jerseyans almost elected a Republican governor.)

New York’s harder line has been adopted by other states too. Who’s right? The Supreme Court had a chance to decide in a case called Massachusetts v. New Hampshire but—possibly mistaking it for a pretty dull-sounding basketball game—they refused to hear it. For now if you’re going to telecommute to another state make it Oregon.

* Yeah I know. In practice folks get the federal minimum of $7.25 but Georgia lawmakers like keeping $5.15 on the books so you won’t forget they’re assholes.

After announcing in August that it had hired Kumar — formerly vice chairman of Bain Capital-backed Chindata Group — to lead its digital infrastructure venture PAG which ranks among Asia’s largest private equity firms with $45 billion in assets under management recently unveiled the Flow Digital Infrastructure brand while vowing to becoming a player in one of the region’s hottest asset classes.

​​“PAG Real Estate has been actively investing in digital infrastructure over the past few years and we expect to make significant investments in the sector in the years ahead” said PAG group president Jon-Paul Toppino in a company press release. “With Flow Digital Infrastructure we are leveraging PAG’s experience expertise and access to capital to create one of Asia’s leading companies in this space.”

The roll out of Flow brings PAG into head on competition with global specialists such as Equinix which recently established a $575 million joint venture with PGIM Real Estate to expand its Australia footprint and regional rivals like Gaw Capital which expanded its digital infrastructure holdings into Southeast Asia in July with the establishment of Singapore-based platform Data Center First.

Decades of Experience

To help Kumar gain ground in the data centre derby Flow has hired four top level executives including a pair of former senior leaders at Digital Realty where Kumar had served as senior vice president and regional head of Asia Pacific from 2010 and 2014.

Teruo Iwamoto who joined chief financial officer and head of acquisitions for digital infrastructure initiatives for PAG in October took on the titles of CFO and head of acquisitions at Flow this month while continuing his role at the parent firm. Prior to his move to PAG Iwamoto served for a year at ESR as director of fund management and capital for data centres where he was responsible for data centre investment and fund management until October of this year.

Before joining ESR Singapore-based Iwamoto was director of acquisition and investments for Asia Pacific at Digital Realty from 2017 to 2020.

Another Digital Realty graduate Grant Yabsley is joining Flow as director of corporate development for Southeast Asia based in Singapore after consulting independently for the past two years.

Before serving stints with DCI Data Centers and Tata Communications from 2015 through 2019 Yabsley had worked together with with Kumar at Digital Realty in Singapore when he was employed there as director of acquisitions and investments for Asia Pacific from 2012 through 2015.

Joining Flow as director of corporate development for North Asia is Ari Druker who has worked in real estate finance and investment banking for 25 years including roles at Deutsche Securities Tokyo Star bank and Jones Lang LaSalle and specialises in data centre financing.

Among them the new team holds over eight decades of experience in the Asian digital infrastructure space spanning investment acquisition financing and project development.

Ready for APAC Expansion

Flow’s senior hires have been announced just months after chairman Kris Kumar put aside his retirement plans to take on the role of chairman of the regional data centre startup teaming up with PAG as data centre firms scrambled to find fresh talent.

The region-wide search for senior data centre leadership has accelerated over the past year with Singapore-based Digital Edge naming a former senior member of JP Morgan’s investment team Yaniv Ghitis as chief investment officer in August of this year.

In July Gaw Capital Partners brought aboard industry veteran Kok-Chye Ong a former Keppel Data Centres strategist to lead its server-hosting platform in Asia ex-China.

Just last month US data centre startup Stack expanded into Asia with the announcement of a base in Singapore and the private equity firm tapped Pithambar “Preet” Gona a former colleague of Kumar’s from Chindata’s Bridge Data Centres division as chief executive officer for Asia Pacific.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJwcmVhbHR5cGx1cy5jb20vaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy9ibGFjay1tb25leS1pbi1ob3VzaW5nLWlzLWRvd24tcG9zdC1kZW1vbmV0aXphdGlvbi0xMDE5MTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Money in Housing is Down Post Demonetization,"Real estate developers express their views on demonetization impact on realty transactions. In the pre-demonetisation period (2013-Q3 2016) approx. 16.15 lakh housing units were launched across the top 7 cities while sales stood at approx. 11.78 lakh units. Post demonetisation Q4 2016-Q3 2021 sales of about 10.37 lakh units outstripped new launches of 9.04 lakh units. Overall new launches between two periods reduced by over 44%. Pritam Chivukula Hon. Secretary CREDAI MCHI said ""An important goal of demonetization was to reduce the use of cash in transactions and inspire people to pay using non-cash modes. This has brought a large number of evaders in the tax net. It has indirectly made things more systematic accountable and transparent. Overall the move has declined cash transactions increased the bank deposits and financial savings has seen an uptick too."" According to the study the secondary sales or resale housing market proved far more vulnerable to demonetisation than the primary market. This segment along with luxury housing historically drew the bulk of 'cash components'. While the resale housing sector continues to reel from the aftereffects of DeMo affordable and mid-segment housing demand in primary sales (sales by developers) increase. Vedanshu Kedia Director Prescon Group said ""All the three major objectives of curbing black money fake notes and most importantly creating a cashless economy have been achieved as India has become one of the largest markets for digital payments. After demonetization a large share of the population has gone digital and have adopted cashless transactions. There are many proptech start-up’s now that are working on creating platforms that allow homebuyers to experience property and make a block on their inventory by committing an expression of interest. This will definitely enable ease of doing business and bring liquidity to the real estate market."" One major driving factor behind demonetization is that branded listed players who now attract a significant majority of housing demand to their projects play by the book and avoid unaccounted monies in their transactions. After DeMo and the roll-out of RERA and GST homebuyer demand gravitates towards branded products. Leading developers shifted their previous focus on luxury projects to the new demand for affordable and mid-segment housing. Kaushal Agarwal Chairman The Guardians Real Estate Advisory said ""It has helped the sector to consolidate the market it brought a level playing field for the organised and transparent entities. It has prevented the inflow of black money and nearly wiped-out the unorganised players. More importantly it has paved the path for corporate and listed companies to expand and grow which in other cases was tilted in favour of local and unorganised players.""",,,,,,,,,

To tackle the coronavirus pandemic the Hong Kong government has come up with the Leave Home Safe app which records people’s whereabouts and tracks the location of Covid-19 patients.

It was recently made compulsory to enter government buildings including libraries sport centres and hospitals.

This begs the question: Should the app be mandatory to enter non-government buildings as well? Yes I believe so because health should be our top priority especially when a deadly virus is sweeping the world.

Hong Kong will restart quarantine-free travel to the mainland

The app most importantly helps health authorities trace close contacts of Covid-19 patients and thereby stop a potential community outbreak.

The app also helps to identify patients who make false claims about their whereabouts. According to a newspaper report a 29-year-old Indian man was confirmed with a coronavirus variant along with his 31-year-old Filipino friend earlier this year. They were arrested for concealing their whereabouts.

The pair were at the centre of an infection cluster that triggered two rounds of mandatory Covid-19 testing for the city’s 370000 domestic helpers and the compulsory quarantining of hundreds of residents.

While being interrogated they revealed that they had visited many places including Citygate outlets in Tung Chung as well as a restaurant in Discovery Bay places where the usage of the app is not compulsory.

Therefore using the app should be made compulsory when entering non-government buildings too.

This would make it much easier for health authorities to track down coronavirus patients and their close contacts while preventing similar incidents as mentioned above from happening again.

The app can help boost the city’s resistance against the pandemic as well as protect its citizens’ health and safety.

Cross-border students will miss out when travel resumes

Against: Victor Wu 16 Hon Wah College

With the coronavirus causing chaos across the globe some countries have introduced Covid-19 passports or tracking apps to contain the threat.

Hong Kong was quick to follow this trend and introduced its premier software – Leave Home Safe – in November last year.

Some people say the app should be made mandatory even when entering non-government buildings.

Is the Leave Home Safe app useful for fighting the pandemic?

On the surface it may look like a good suggestion. But a deeper investigation brings to light many pitfalls that deserve scrutiny.

Right off the bat those who are unable to afford smartphones will be virtually stripped of their right to go anywhere. For low-income people buying even basic necessities has become a daunting task let alone getting smartphones and other non-essential items.

This regulation will essentially bar people from entering a lot of areas that are an integral part of their day-to-day lives from markets and malls to even their own workplace!

Making the app a requirement for government buildings led to a rush to buy second hand smartphones so people could comply with the rule. Photo: SCMP/ Felix Wong

Besides its financial inconsideration another blind spot that hasn’t been thought through yet is the inconvenience it will cause to the elderly and those who have disabilities.

Most elderly people in Hong Kong aren’t as tech-savvy as youngsters. There have been reports about the elderly not being able to enter markets because they simply do not know how to use the technology. Ordering the app to be used even in non-government facilities will only make their lives more inconvenient and miserable.

Also with the recent developments in technology more people have become concerned about data privacy. Therefore the risks posed by the Leave Home Safe app are too great to be ignored.

HK schools with cross-border students set up mainland learning centres

Considering all this the cons of using this app significantly outweigh the pros.

MACON Ga. — The Bibb County Sheriff's Office is investigating an armed robbery at the Dollar General on 4996 Bloomfield Road.

According to a press release the incident happened on Saturday at 5 p.m.

A man entered the store and held up a gun as he demanded money from the register.

Once he received an undisclosed amount of money he ran from the store.

No one was injured in the robbery.

Recently Tyler Texas Police shared this photo taken from surveillance video at a Dollar General Store.

Times are hard and sometimes that drives people to do things they might not ordinarily do. Perhaps that's what happened with this woman.

She used a stolen credit card and proceeded to use it to pay for her items at the Dollar General on West Gentry in Tyler Texas.

The Tyler Police Department shared this photo on their Facebook page as a part of their ongoing #findemfriday series. Some of the comments from Tyler and East Texas residents added interesting sad and honestly humorous perspectives surrounding this case.

Some Tyler residents seem sincerely baffled that someone would steal a credit card and then go and use it at a dollar store.

One person even said that illegalities aside this lady may be a ""practical thief."" In other words he said at least she's not using it to buy luxuries but rather simple necessities. Um...that's an interesting way to look at it. But it's illegal. Period.

Others said they'd be more likely to forgive her if that was food in her basket. That made me have at least two thoughts:

First of all it's interesting how much grace people can have for others when they're struggling to make ends meet.

I find that comforting in that it speaks to the hearts of East Texans. But we can't get around the fact that she's breaking the law though.

Secondly what is going on in this woman's life that she felt compelled to do this to the detriment of someone else who is now tasked with cancelling their stolen credit card and dealing with the hassle of that in the midst of their own busy complicated life?

That's why we have laws. I just wish people didn't feel so desperate that they feel they must break them to get what they need.

Then again so many East Texans are struggling in many ways right now but find ways to NOT break the law.

It operates through two segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The Dollar Tree segment offers merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. It provides consumable merchandise everyday consumables variety merchandise and other items and seasonal goods. This segment operates 7805 stores under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada brands. The Family Dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores that offer consumable merchandise home products apparel and accessories merchandise as well as seasonal and electronics merchandise. This segment operates 7880 stores under the Family Dollar brand.

Activist Commentary: Mantle Ridge was launched by Paul Hilal a veteran activist who was a former senior partner at Pershing Square. Hilal is an incredibly experienced activist investor with a unique mix of analytical abilities communication skills and likability that you rarely see in the activist world. Mantle Ridge is very selective with its investments and while many activists look for three to four good ideas a year Mantle Ridge looks for one good idea every three to four years. Hilal's approach has generally been to constructively engage with the company amicably get the required level of board representation for the given situation bring in the right senior management team and then decide how to best optimize the portfolio of assets.

Mantle Ridge intends to have conversations meetings and other communications with certain members of the company's board and management team stockholders and other persons. In each case they plan to discuss the company's business operations strategies governance the composition of the executive suite and board and possibilities for changes thereto.

This is Mantle Ridge's third investment the first two being CSX and Aramark. Hilal also played a leading role in several Pershing Square investments including Air Products Ceridian and Canadian Pacific.

Previously Starboard Value was involved at Dollar Tree. In January 2019 they outlined two opportunities they felt the company should be pursuing – exploring strategic alternatives for Family Dollar which the company owns and evaluating and testing a multiple-price point strategy. Starboard ultimately dropped its proxy fight for seats on the board after the company expressed openness to test multiple price points in its stores. However it is almost two years later and not much has changed.

DLTR's stock traded as high as $120.37 on April 6 but fell to $84.26 on Sept. 24 after the company reported bad earnings and guidance for two consecutive quarters due in part to ocean freight headwinds. To stop the stock price's dive and possibly to head off a rumored activist the company announced that it would implement the multi-price point strategy and do a $1 billion stock buyback even though it still had $1.5 billion of capacity on its previously announced buyback.

Hilal has a track record of creating shareholder value by bringing in a rock-star CEO most notably at Canadian Pacific and CSX with Hunter Harrison. In this case we believe he has found the Hunter Harrison of consumer goods stores – someone who has grown up working every facet of the industry and has a proven record of creating value at the highest level. It has been reported that he is working with Rick Dreiling the former CEO of Dollar General. We believe these reports to be true for two reasons: (i) Dreiling is on the board of Aramark with Hilal and the two are working very well together there and (ii) Dreiling is the exact type of CEO that Hilal looks for in an investment like this.

Dreiling has had a successful four-decade long career with success at Longs Drugs Safeway and Duane Reade. But perhaps his biggest success was in 2008 when he was brought in by KKR to Dollar General. In just seven years Dreiling took the company's value from $4.5 billion to $25 billion and it is now worth about $52 billion. After Dollar General Dreiling a Lowe's board member strongly advocated that Lowe's select Marvin Ellison for the CEO job. As a player/coach Dreiling partnered with an experienced CEO in Ellison (former chairman/CEO of JC Penney and senior executive at Home Depot for 12 years) and gave him the added benefit of his decades of experience and knowledge in a range of retail formats. Since then Lowe's has returned 192.9% versus 71.9% for the S&P 500.

That player/coach structure is exactly what is needed at DLTR. Bob Sasser was the company's CEO from 2004 to 2017 and has since been its executive chairman while the company is on its second CEO in the four years since Sasser. This is not surprising as it is very difficult for a new CEO to operate and make necessary changes with the old CEO looking over his shoulder. Bringing in Dreiling as chairman with a CEO he can partner with — like he did at Lowe's — should work great here. That CEO could even be current CEO Michael Witynski – it is too early to tell as he has only been CEO since July 2020 and working in Sasser's shadow the whole time.

With a new team in place two things can be done to create shareholder value. First aggressively implementing a multiple price strategy which has proven to work elsewhere. In early 2009 Dollarama introduced $1.25 $1.50 and $2.00 price points and same store sales growth more than doubled due to increases in the average ticket and store traffic. Dollarama has continued to add additional price points with a $4.00 ceiling. Over the past ten years average same store sales have increased from about 2% per year (prior to 2009) to roughly 6%. Gross margins have increased from nearly 33% to about 40% and EBITDA margins increased from roughly 14% to about 25%. Further when DLTR trialed this strategy they found a 6% same stores sale lift from only dedicating 10% of its square feet to items in other price points. By increasing that mix and merchandising the stores for optimal sales these improvements could even be greater as Dollarama discovered.

The second area for value creation is with Family Dollar but not to sell it as Starboard advocated at least not immediately. With Dreiling involved he can do for Family Dollar what he did for Dollar General and maybe even quicker. At the time Dreiling took over Dollar General Family Dollar was also worth approximately $4.5 billion and it is still worth $4.5 billion today. Dreiling was able to massively improve Dollar General in seven years but with the benefit of that experience he should be able to improve upon that with Family Dollar. For example it took Hunter Harrison 12 years to turn around Canadian National and he did it in four years at Canadian Pacific. After turning around Family Dollar that could be a good time to explore a potential sale of it.

Mantle Ridge's track record and comprehensive business thesis it always comes with should be enough reason to get it board seats. They will work constructively and amicably work with the board as they always do. We would expect that an engaged objective board should be able to come to a reasonable settlement with them. But if not Hilal has shown in the past that he is not afraid to resort to a proxy fight if need be. The director nomination window opens on Nov. 24 and if it comes to that Mantle Ridge has several advantages. First it is clear to many shareholders that the company needs fresh eyes at the highest levels of the board. While the company has refreshed many board seats with new directors recently the four directors with the most influence including Sasser have all been there for at least 13 years. Second the company has been severely underperforming – on a 1- 3- and 5-year basis the company has underperformed the S&P 500 by 11.06% 40.27% and 71.02% respectively and the recent earnings misses are still fresh in the minds of shareholders. Third since it has been rumored that Mantle Ridge is involved in the company the stock has gone up on heavy volume and the shareholder base has seen significant turnover likely to more event-driven and activist-friendly shareholders. Finally Mantle Ridge not only has a track record of working well with incumbent boards but Hilal has skills and characteristics that are generally attractive to boards. If the DLTR board checks up on him they will no doubt see this but they really need to look no further than Rick Dreiling for proof of this — he was an incumbent at Aramark and definitely on the other side of the table from Hilal when Mantle Ridge showed up there. Not only have they been able to work together at Aramark as they got to know each other but they are now working together in this investment for Mantle Ridge. There is no higher endorsement for an activist investor.

If Mantle Ridge is successful here in getting board seats we expect that they will not only apply the governance operational financial and strategic activism that they are known for but will also use their unique position as a director to keep an eye on any environmental and social issues or opportunities at the company. For example the distribution centers have never been completely integrated after DLTR bought Family Dollar. In fact only one of the 26 serves both brands. This means that Family Dollar trucks are passing DLTR distribution centers to make deliveries and vice versa. Not only would integrating these distribution centers be good for the bottom line but it would also be beneficial to the environment by greatly reducing the emissions from these trucks as they make their deliveries. Also a company like DLTR that serves the lower economic demographic of our country has many opportunities to institute programs and policies that benefit many of the neediest of our citizens. This is a main tenet of the benefits of Active ESG or AESG investing. As an AESG investor Mantle Ridge will be in a unique position to implement societal benefits that a passive ESG investor would never be able to do.

(WLOX) - Two people arrested Saturday night for armed robbery in Jackson County were denied bond at their Monday court appearances.

Xavier Spivery 27 of Pascagoula and Faith Pritchett 30 of Mobile are both charged with armed robbery. They’ll be in court again December 13 for preliminary hearings unless they choose to waive them.

The armed robbery happened around 8 p.m. Saturday at a Dollar General store in the Big Point community. Sheriff Mike Ezell said deputies responding to the call spotted the suspects’ car at a red light on Highway 613. When the light changed Ezell said Spivery took off at high speed.

The chase continued to Highway 63 and into the city of Moss Point. Once there Ezell said Spivery got out of the car and ran into the woods while Pritchett stayed in the car.

With the help of a K-9 and Moss Point police deputies eventually found Spivery and arrested him.

Here's what happened,"New York CNN Business —

CVS’ announcement Thursday that it will close 900 stores over the next three years — around 10% of its pharmacies — may have caught some shoppers off guard.

Isn’t CVS doing really well right now? Haven’t lots of people gone to drug stores during the pandemic to stock up on hand sanitizer cleaning wipes and toilet paper? What about all those Covid-19 vaccine shots CVS gives out?

Actually CVS (CVS)’ closures shouldn’t come as a surprise. They are the latest moves in the long-running contraction of the US retail pharmacy sector. CVS (CVS) Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) have been shuttering stores for years while independent pharmacies have come under pressure from chains. Drug store closures can hurt local communities creating access gaps for medications and essentials.

CVS the largest drug store chain in the United States pointed to “changes in population consumer buying patterns and future health needs” as factors in its decision to close stores.

Here’s why CVS will close 900 stores.

Pivot to health care

The future of CVS is not selling snacks candy shampoo and greeting cards. It’s in health care.

To that end in 2018 CVS completed a $69 billion acquisition of Aetna the largest health care deal in history to create a gigantic customer base of about 40 million Americans. CVS bet that the deal will increase its profits from those patients’ health plans while helping to lower its costs.

CVS also has been revamping its retail strategy and said Thursday that its stores will have three distinct models: locations that offer primary care services; “HealthHub” stores that have on-site dieticians nurse practitioners and lab services and on-site treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma; and traditional stores.

CVS is “really pivoting and leaning into the health care aspects of the business” said George Hill an analyst who covers the company and the health care industry at Deutsche Bank. “You’d much rather be selling health care services that are high-dollar value high-margin versus greeting cards.”

Too many stores

When you walk down the street or drive around the suburbs you’ll typically pass a CVS. And then hit a Walgreens right next door. Rite Aid is probably pretty close too.

“There’s too many pharmacies in the country and there’s too much pharmacy capacity. That gives CVS a reason to go” said Hill.

CVS got a lift from administering Covid-19 vaccines and tests but it took a hit from people limiting their visits to stores and going to the doctor less often. Maddie Meyer/Getty Images

CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 yet it still has more than 9900 stores. That’s more than Walmart (WMT) Target (TGT) Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST) — combined.

Its latest closings will “reduce store density in certain locations” CVS said Thursday which translates into the fact that CVS has too many stores too close to each other in some places.

Competition from Amazon and Dollar General

Also fewer people are heading to CVS and other drug stores to fill their prescriptions and shop for household staples these days. (And they’re not going into CVS to buy tobacco either which the company stopped selling in 2014.)

Some shoppers have replaced their trips to stores like CVS by buying their supplies online from Amazon (AMZN) or from brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart and Target. The chains have built their own strong e-commerce businesses in recent years.

Dollar General (DG) has also grabbed market share from drug stores undercutting the sector with lower prices on similar items. And now Dollar General (DG) is launching its own health care initiative as it continues to take business from pharmacies.

Online pharmacies and telemedicine have gained traction too. Amazon bought PillPack in 2018 for more than $700 million and started shipping prescriptions to Prime members last year. Capsule and other digital pharmacies that deliver directly to customers’ homes are also growing.

Although brick-and-mortar pharmacies are still an important stop for many elderly peopleor those who don’t use the web or have access to it they are increasingly becoming a thing of the past to the growing ranks of online shoppers.

Rising costs

Closing stores also reduces CVS’ costs while still keeping most of its sales. Its labor and store operations costs increased during the pandemic because of safety protections like plexiglass floor decals and masks. The company said in August it planned to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 in a bid to retain and attract workers.

“There are cost pressures in all directions” said Hill the Deutsche Bank analyst.

Seventy-five percent of CVS’ sales comes from filling prescriptions but its profits from that segment have declined in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates.

But when CVS closes a store it can hold onto most of those sales by shifting the prescriptions to its nearest pharmacies Hill said.

Covid-19 vaccines weren’t a huge boost

CVS got a lift from people coming into its stores for their Covid-19 vaccines and tests. The company has administered 43 million vaccines and around 38 million tests CEO Karen Lynch said on an earnings call earlier this month.

But the vaccines were only a short-term gain for the company which said they will generate only $3 billion in revenue in 2021. That will decline by up to 40% next year along with whatever sales CVS racked up as shoppers browsed aisles while they waited to get vaccinated Lynch said.

People also visited their doctors less frequently last year and into 2021 and elective procedures were suspended early in the pandemic which meant that CVS filled fewer regular and chronic care prescriptions than in the years before the pandemic.

And fewer people have also been coming into stores to pick up cough and fever medicines — big business for CVS — because they’re still wearing masks and spending more time at home than they once did."

They will work constructively and amicably work with the board as they always do. We would expect that an engaged objective board should be able to come to a reasonable settlement with them. But if not Hilal has shown in the past that he is not afraid to resort to a proxy fight if need be. The director nomination window opens on Nov. 24 and if it comes to that Mantle Ridge has several advantages. First it is clear to many shareholders that the company needs fresh eyes at the highest levels of the board. While the company has refreshed many board seats with new directors recently the four directors with the most influence including Sasser have all been there for at least 13 years. Second the company has been severely underperforming – on a 1- 3- and 5-year basis the company has underperformed the S&P 500 by 11.06% 40.27% and 71.02% respectively and the recent earnings misses are still fresh in the minds of shareholders. Third since it has been rumored that Mantle Ridge is involved in the company the stock has gone up on heavy volume and the shareholder base has seen significant turnover likely to more event-driven and activist-friendly shareholders. Finally Mantle Ridge not only has a track record of working well with incumbent boards but Hilal has skills and characteristics that are generally attractive to boards. If the DLTR board checks up on him they will no doubt see this but they really need to look no further than Rick Dreiling for proof of this — he was an incumbent at Aramark and definitely on the other side of the table from Hilal when Mantle Ridge showed up there. Not only have they been able to work together at Aramark as they got to know each other but they are now working together in this investment for Mantle Ridge. There is no higher endorsement for an activist investor.

If Mantle Ridge is successful here in getting board seats we expect that they will not only apply the governance operational financial and strategic activism that they are known for but will also use their unique position as a director to keep an eye on any environmental and social issues or opportunities at the company. For example the distribution centers have never been completely integrated after DLTR bought Family Dollar. In fact only one of the 26 serves both brands. This means that Family Dollar trucks are passing DLTR distribution centers to make deliveries and vice versa. Not only would integrating these distribution centers be good for the bottom line but it would also be beneficial to the environment by greatly reducing the emissions from these trucks as they make their deliveries. Also a company like DLTR that serves the lower economic demographic of our country has many opportunities to institute programs and policies that benefit many of the neediest of our citizens. This is a main tenet of the benefits of Active ESG or AESG investing. As an AESG investor Mantle Ridge will be in a unique position to implement societal benefits that a passive ESG investor would never be able to do.

On a crisp late summer morning 65-year-old Army veteran Nancy Vonner walked the five blocks from her home in a North St. Louis neighborhood marked by pawn shops and boarded up homes to the St. Augustine Wellston Center a long-time community fixture that’s part thrift shop part food pantry.

Joined by a steady stream of clients including a young mother who lost her warehouse job during the COVID-19 pandemic Vonner filled a shopping cart borrowed from a major grocery store that’s no longer in the neighborhood. She stocked up on milk meat pasta and other essentials that would keep her family fed until she received her monthly government assistance.

“Everybody knows I’m the struggling granny” Vonner said explaining that a car wreck a year ago left her once able-bodied son paralyzed forcing her into the role of being a caretaker for the son and his passel of children including a set of triplets. “I come here once a month. I’m working with whatever I get.”

Wellston one of dozens of food pantries across the St. Louis metro area joins a growing number of community gardens as part of a homegrown response aimed at heading off a major food catastrophe that loomed when the deadly coronavirus shuttered businesses and schools across the region.

In addition retailers large and small and federal state and local agencies stepped in offering an all-hands surge especially needed in areas already classified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as having low access to healthy foods.

Leaders up and down the food chain expressed admiration for the success of the concerted effort during the height of the storm but no one interviewed by The St. Louis American saw the steps taken as even the beginnings of a permanent solution to the long-standing scourge of food insecurity in areas already tagged as food deficient. That leaves more than 190000 residents in St. Louis St. Louis County and St. Clair County Illinois living in neighborhoods without easy access to fresh food or victims of “food apartheid” as activists call it.

“Food drives there’s been a lot of those efforts” said Kelly McGowan who works with St. Louis-based EVOLVE to help community members conduct audits documenting what healthy foods are available nearby. “People have to eat and I’m definitely not knocking that. But you know that’s putting a Band-Aid on a systemic issue.

“Looking at things like housing making sure people work at jobs that pay a livable wage … public safety that’s huge. So I think at least it is a start and [we’re] having the conversations to figure out ‘okay we have a couple of Band-Aid solutions that help to support the communities.’ … But longer term what are the solutions?”

Just as it laid bare decades-old inequities in health care the 20-month old pandemic which swelled the ranks of the unemployed exposed holes in the nation’s food safety net.

Karen Robinson-Jacobs / The St. Louis American As a safety precaution during COVID workers at the St. Augustine Wellston Center in St. Louis box groceries before the food pantry opens to speed distribution.

In 2020 one in four Black residents across the U.S. experienced food insecurity — more than three times the rate for white households — according to Feeding America the nation’s largest charitable hunger-relief organization.

Many of them live in areas deemed by the USDA to be low income and with low access to healthy food options. The regions formerly were described as “food deserts” but activists such as Dara Cooper say that rather than experiencing a naturally occurring phenomenon like a desert the hardest-hit regions have been subjected to food apartheid – “structural racialized inequities” including decades of declining investment from traditional grocers and a saturation of smaller stores hawking highly processed foods often high in salt and sugar.

Diets heavy in these foods have been linked to ailments such as diabetes and hypertension which are known to boost the risk of severe illness in those who test positive for COVID-19. Even before COVID-19 hit according to USDA data from 2015 and 2019 dozens of census tracts in St. Louis and St. Louis County were considered low income and low access meaning access to healthy food within one mile was scarce.

Across the Mississippi River in St. Clair County between 2015 and 2019 the number of urban census tracts deemed low-income/low access leaped by 43% to 20 USDA data show encompassing an area of more than 72000 residents.

Last year COVID-19 pushed the persistent problem of healthy food access toward crisis levels.

Between June 30 2019 and June 30 2021 the number of meals provided by The St. Louis Area Foodbank – which serves 14 Missouri counties and 12 in Illinois – increased by 53% to nearly 53 million data from the nonprofit show.

In seven especially hard hit zip codes in St. Clair County the number of residents deemed to be food insecure rose by 60% between 2019 and 2020 to more than 6700 food-insecure residents according to “Map the Meal Gap” an analysis of food insecurity in the United States distributed by Feeding America.

“On the charitable food side we saw just this huge increase in demand” said Emily Engelhard managing director of research for Feeding America. “And seeing the increase that we did for Black individuals and Latino individuals and then children overall I think just continues to point to …underlying systemic issues that are not going to go away. Again they existed before the pandemic they continue to be a problem.”

Some of the triage measures introduced during the pandemic may have staying power.

Food distribution organizers praised the efficiency of drive-through food giveaways including efforts by The Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis which gave food to more than 60000 families over 22 weeks.

Wiley Price / The St. Louis American Jeremy Ferrell and Chante Bass with Better Family Life's Neighborhood Outreach program are thanked by a driver after bags of food were placed in her car at the Urban League's food distribution drive in April 2020 at the agency's Jennings location. The line for the good stretched down Jennings Station Road to Interstate 70 by 9 a.m. The event was not scheduled to start until noon.

Organizers also credit the pandemic with helping to destigmatize visits to food pantries since many clients were first-time users. While food donations clearly provided a lifeline to many the process was not without hiccups.

Tosha Phonix who co-founded St. Louis-based EVOLVE — Elevating Voices of Leaders Vying for Equity — noted that some food boxes handed out to St. Louis area residents during the pandemic contained the same salty high-calorie snacks nutritionists say have contributed to unhealthy conditions in Blacks.

Kim Jayne treasurer of Wellston Loop Community Development Corporation serving an area marked by low-income and stubbornly high levels of substance abuse said she started pitching in money from her own pocket when the hand-out boxes stopped coming. Choking back tears she conceded that approach is not sustainable.

Where are the grocery stores?

When residents in low-income areas talk about the lack of access to healthy foods it’s usually related to the absence of major grocery stores within walking distance or on convenient bus lines.

Grocers operate on notoriously thin margins. When accused of abandoning low-income areas they routinely point to profit and loss statements that guide them to open in areas with higher incomes and steady foot traffic.

Schnucks is one of the largest grocers serving the St. Louis area which is home to nearly 80 of the brand’s 111 locations. Only one of the three locations the brand opened since the beginning of the pandemic – in Columbia Missouri – was near a low access area. Two locations closed since the pandemic began – in Alton and Shrewsberry – were near food desert neighborhoods.

“We’re obviously a large regional grocer and we’ve committed to leveraging our business expertise to help communities not just through the operation of our stores but also through our work in the communities” said Bill Bradley chief marketing and communications officer for Schnuck Markets Inc.

In 2020 Schnucks donated food valued at more than $12 million to St. Louis-based Operation Food Search with which it has a decades-long partnership. The nonprofit and its 300 food partner agencies monthly serve more than 200000 Missouri and Illinois residents many of whom live in low-access areas.

The $12 million was a slight decrease from the $13 million donated in 2019 as the pandemic boosted consumer purchases of fresh foods leaving less available for donation the company said.

Kristen Wild chief executive and president of Operation Food Search said a 26% drop in the value of food donated between its 2019 and 2021 fiscal years was offset by a jump in financial donations and federal CARES Act funding.

In October 2019 months before the pandemic hit retailer Save A Lot snipped a ribbon at a newly built store at 1331 Union Blvd. in St. Louis near Page Boulevard. The newest of 44 local Save A Lot locations it was one of the few traditional grocery stores to open in the area in recent years.

USDA The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines large sections of North St. Louis and East St. Louis Illinois as having low access to healthy food in part due to an absence of traditional grocers.

The location which offers fresh-cut meat fruits and vegetables is blocks from a USDA designated low access area but a former company executive said that status did not figure in the pre-opening calculations.

“That particular store here in St. Louis it was just a fantastic area for us to do a ground-up brand new store” said Chris Hooks who was executive vice president and chief merchandising officer for Save A Lot. “It’s a high-traffic area. It absolutely fit the model when we look at density of population [and] opportunity for our brand. And when we look at the competitive set [and] the available real estate it just absolutely made perfect sense. It just checked all the boxes.”

Weeks after that interview however Save A Lot opted to close a location in nearby Pagedale following a review of a “number of factors including financial performance as well as strategic alignment with long-term plans” a spokeswoman said.

The Pagedale location opened in 2010 to much fanfare and praise from area residents concerned about food access.

While traditional grocers have not rushed into the low-access areas dollar stores have initially to the chagrin of some food activists.

That may change as two of the largest brands — Dollar General and Dollar Tree — look to add fresh produce to a mix that has long relied on sales of everything from cleaning supplies to kitschy holiday decorations.

One Dollar General with fresh produce in Spanish Lake happened to be the site of a recent food audit McGowan was helping area residents complete.

“I was shocked” McGowan said. “I forgot I was even in Dollar General. The produce they had in there … they had fresh cauliflower.”

The Bellefontaine Road location added produce during a pandemic-era remodel in October 2020 according to Dollar General. The produce mix includes lettuce tomatoes onions sweet potatoes lemons and salad mixes.

Several activists said they would like to see local retailers and area restaurants partner with local Black farmers to help meet community needs for fresh foods.

“There were a lot of organizations that were coming into community trying to feed community sub-par food right not healthy food” Phonix said. Some also spoke of the need to add healthier items “but no one was talking about getting them from Black farmers.” “I just felt the need to converge and connect the two” she said.

A Dollar Tree spokeswoman said some suppliers will be local but so far none of the locations in the produce test group is among the 37 Dollar Tree stores in St. Louis and St. Louis County. Even without official connections to major retailers urban ag and community gardening are growing in the region.

Matt Schindler is executive director of Gateway Greening which provides urban agriculture education and resources to help launch or expand community gardens and farms.

The organization typically works with about 50 new or expanding projects a year. It expects this year to see an 18% increase in projects over the 53 projects completed in 2019.

“Interest has gone up… and it’s been great to see” said Schindler noting that funds allocated for the year for supplies such as lumber were spent by March. “It was already going up but then it’s severely jumped in a good way during COVID.”

On Suburban Avenue in Ferguson a young father arrived at a community garden recently mate and two children in tow seeking food according to the garden’s caretaker.

With no money to spend he offered his watch. “He … asked could I help his family out” said Ron Brown operations manager at the garden. “They were hungry. And I said ‘yes you can get vegetables’.”

In a nondescript grocery bag the family placed tomatoes peppers maybe a head of cabbage and some eggplant Brown recalled. “The area of our garden is very low income” he said. Residents without cars wander by the garden going to or from a nearby bus stop.

“Some of the ones they’ll come up and say ‘I’m really down on my luck can you help me out.’ And I’ll say ‘I can’t give you money but I can give you a bottle of water and I can give you some vegetables.’”

The solitary solicitation of the watch-bearing dad and the parents and grandparents who regularly visit food pantries give quiet testimony to the enduring need. Such requests continue Brown said emphatically taking a break from his weeding and pruning. Not as much as earlier in the year but the need persists.

The Marshall location 15861 Michigan Ave. is expected to close on Sunday Nov. 21 according to Marshall City Manager Tom Tarkiewicz.

Kmart has deep roots in Michigan going back to 1899 when Sebastian Spering Kresge opening a five-and-dime store in downtown Detroit according to the company website.

The S.S. Kresge Company discount stores expanded for decades until the company pivoted to operating department stores.

The first Kmart store opened in Garden City Michigan in 1962.

Within four years the discount big box store was operating 162 locations across the United States. At its peak Kmart operated about 2500 locations worldwide.

Plagued with financial issues Kmart filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and was purchased by Sears Holding Company three years later. Kmart then continued to struggle shuttering most locations in the United States over the past two decades.

Only six Kmart stores are expected to still be in business by the end of the year CNN reported.

“The biggest concern is for Marshall and Albion residents who do not drive and must use our transit service to shop. With Kmart closing they do not have any store to shop for household and personal needs” Tarkiewicz wrote in an email to MLive.

Other shuttered Kmart stores in Michigan have been occupied by new retailers like Family Farm & Home a KFC restaurant Dollar Tree a U-Haul facility and T.J. Maxx. A Norton Shores Kmart building sat empty for 15 years before being demolished and replaced with a new healthcare facility.

Tarkiewicz said the Marshall Kmart building does not have a new tenant yet.

Joe Canfield CEO of Cleveland-based Yellow Banana LLC was a guest speaker at the South Lorain 6th Ward Town Hall meeting on Nov. 17.

Yellow Banana LLC announced Sept. 7 the business completed the sale of 32 Save A Lot company-owned stores across Greater Cleveland greater Chicago and the Milwaukee area. Save A Lot is converting its corporate-owned stores to local ownership.

The 32 stores generate annual revenues more than $130 million making Yellow Banana one of Save A Lot’s largest retail partners according to that company.

Since then new owners have added six stores for a total of 38 including 15 across northern Ohio Canfield said.

The stores will keep the same name but changes are coming including remodeling the South Lorain store starting in March 2022 Canfield said. It is in the Fairless Plaza at 2222 Fairless Drive.

Save A Lot owned 1000 stores based in St. Louis.

“Good folks with good intentions but it’s really hard to run local grocery stores from thousands of miles away” said Canfield who lives near downtown Cleveland.

The new owners were excited to buy the stores because they intentionally targeted stores in underserved communities where the stores might have closed if they were not sold Canfield said.

The new owners want to do good for communities and be good corporate neighbors while doing well for themselves he said.

Save A Lot can operate in communities where larger chains do not because their overhead costs are too high and offer fresh foods as an alternative to processed foods found at dollar-style stores Canfield said.

The area Save A Lot stores were run poorly and unsanitary Canfield said. For district managers the new owners’ first order in the first 30 days was to clean up the stores — literally with mops buckets bleach and disinfectant as needed Canfield said.

“When you shop at a grocery store you should feel a little bit like being in a hospital they should be that clean and that’s what we’re looking for” Canfield said. “We won’t achieve that all the time. I’ve been in this business 30 years and stuff happens so we understand that but we want to react quickly to those situations and get to those things.”

The stores have added staff. Canfield said he understands cutting workers to improve a business’ bottom line which happened at Save A Lot.

“This is a long-term investment for us” Canfield said. “We did not buy these stores to make them run well and sell them to somebody else.”

At one store recently a manager apparently fell sick and closed the store at 4 p.m. without telling anybody. “That manager doesn’t work for us anymore” Canfield said and stores will be open during posted open hours.

“We are a local grocer our communities are important to us” Canfield said. “And we can either say things are important to us or we can act like things are important to us.”

The South Lorain store has 15 employees and they are excited about the new owners and future renovations said store manager Nolan Baker.

The store already has added new vendors and increased amounts of other products Baker said. Like other retailers some products are in shortage and staffing sometimes is short.

Save A Lot donates to Second Harvest Food Bank of North Central Ohio and on Nov. 19 a pallet of food was awaiting pickup by local church volunteers Baker said. That day the store was down to two turkeys because they had sold quickly at 79 cents a pound.

“There’s a lot of good things happening” said Baker a two-year worker with prior retail experience at Dollar Tree Walmart and Lowe’s.

Yellow Banana is controlled by 127 Wall Holdings LLC a minority-owned holding company co-founded by Walker Brumskine Ademola Adewale-Sadik and Michael Nance who met while attending Yale Law School. Brumskine and Adewale-Sadik also earned master’s degrees from Harvard Business School.

Yellow Banana’s purchase announcement stated the company intended to employ all of more than 400 store associates and maintain their current wages health insurance and retirement benefits.

The stores will continue to emphasize convenience offer high-quality products deliver great value and promote easy-to-shop store experiences. Yellow Banana also intends to expand each store’s assortment of local and regional products and hire talent from local communities."

When designer Kelsey Duda stumbled across a piece of land for sale on Craigslist located in Elk Rapids Michigan directly across from a county park with beach access to Lake Michigan she snapped it up. It was a perfect fit for her dream project: a vacation rental constructed from the ground up. “I set out to build a home that would function as a small hotel concept because I really wanted to break into hospitality design and I didn’t know how else to make it happen” says Duda.

Elk Rapids is a sleepy town nine months out of the year; then when summer hits visitors flock to the area to experience its crystal-clear lakes small-town charm and family-friendly beaches. But for such a popular tourist destination there’s a surprising lack of hotels that offer the type of spaces and experiences common to other hot spots—think: sauna rentals or an elevated kitchen with an island fit for entertaining. Duda sensed an opportunity but she couldn’t do it alone.

Building a home from scratch during the pandemic was no easy feat and after numerous material delays and not seeing eye to eye with contractors Duda’s parents came to the rescue. They drove round-trip eight hours from Detroit nearly every weekend of 2020 to help her frame paint trim and everything in between. During the week her naturally handy dad would watch YouTube videos to learn the skills he needed for the next phase while Duda acted as his assistant as well as project manager general contractor and interior designer. “I didn’t have time to engage an architect and I didn’t want to wait so I drew up the plans myself” says Duda with a laugh. “I couldn’t think beyond a rectangle so that was my constraint.” Fortunately a simple one-story layout with few walls is more budget-friendly than complex multistory designs. “I’m so proud of what we built together” she adds.

The big challenge with any new build comes after the drywall has been installed: it’s bringing in objects textures finishes and patinas that create interest and a sense of history. Coating much of the interior with Color Atelier’s limewash paint immediately lent depth and age to the space. Duda worked with local artisans to bring more complex design ideas to life like the white oak kitchen island by Wolf Wood Co. that features open shelves where she can display handmade ceramics. As for furniture the interior is an expertly curated mix of thrifted pieces. The vintage sofa reupholstered in rust velvet and the Baker twin beds were both Chairish finds while the pair of Kurt Versen sconces in the living room (her favorite score) was $42 at a local antiques shop. The only new thing in the house is the dining table from Stoffer Home.

A lot of vacation rentals feel like an afterthought but Duda designed this home specifically with her guests in mind. “There is so much more to a space than how it looks. There’s the tactile moments those items you touch throughout the day—light switches doorknobs faucets. The details make such a difference” she explains. Even carving out an arched niche for a plant in the shower makes the otherwise routine spot feel memorable. While custom details like the coffee-bar nook pushed the project over budget the entire home still came together for under $300000.

An old postcard advertising the Ferndale Motel which used to reside on the property was the inspiration for the home’s name: Fernhaus. “Whenever I’m designing a brand or concept I start with the history of the place and land as a source of inspiration” says Duda. She chose the Instagram handle @_fernhaus and softly launched in December 2020 inviting a handful of interested guests via DM to test the experience. Shortly after the trial run she listed the space on Airbnb and this past summer she connected with two local investors to form a hospitality group called Fernhaus Studio with a mission to elevate northern Michigan’s offerings (they currently have several lodging and F&B concepts in the works that are slated to debut in 2022). And to think it all started on Craigslist.

The Goods

Go-to vintage shop: With two locations in the Traverse City area there’s always some treasure to come home with from Wilson.

Favorite source for gardening supplies: Darling Botanical is a really beautiful local plant shop.

Where I buy decor online: Chairish. I love the thrill of the hunt and it’s so much more economical and sustainable than shopping new.

Object in my home that gets the most use: My ceramic cups by local artist Ben Maier. They are perfect for coffee wine and even flowers or toothbrushes.

Biggest splurge: My last-minute white oak coffee bar from Wolf Wood Co. The space was meant to be a closet but I decided it would be nice for my guests to have a dedicated (and beautiful) spot for beverages.

Nicest contractor I’ve ever met: Does my dad count?

Electrician/plumber who can do no wrong: My neighbor Carl Fromholz and his wife Lisa Grise who own the Paradise Pines rentals next door helped me remedy some complex problems.

Also a major shout-out to Grace Start and Sue Duyser for being my sounding boards design consultants and the best of friends throughout this whole process.

The one thing I wish I knew before renovating: If I could go back in time I’d trust my gut.

If the Red Roses can rack up four straight autumn international wins with consummate ease what might they be capable of at next year’s World Cup in New Zealand?

Simon Middleton’s side reduced USA to rubble in front of a lively Worcester crowd of 7515 capping a perfect end to 2021 and equalling the men’s team’s record of 18 successive Test victories.

It means England Women have scored 37 tries and 239 points during autumn wins over New Zealand twice Canada and USA enhancing their status as the world’s No 1 ranked side as they bid to become world champions in less than a year’s time.

They breached their opponents’ defence 15 times here running amok on a day when positives emerged everywhere for Middleton. The Red Roses’ head coach said: “We had high hopes for this series but I just said to the girls in the circle that we haven’t just improved our game we’ve improved the women’s game. We’ve shown what’s possible when you back the girls and you’re given the resources and you put them in the right environment. They’re just fantastic players so full credit to them.

“It’s taken some time to build this so what we’ve got to do is make sure we continue to do so. We’re definitely heading in the right direction.”

There will be greater challenges for England. There has to be. It cannot be this easy. But there is an energy and a self-belief about this team and Middleton spoke endlessly after the game about their desire in attack and defence.

Certainly from the moment the Harlequins prop Vickii Cornborough powered over the line from another expertly executed lineout a feature of England’s displays this autumn in the second minute this was one-way traffic. After Cornborough’s opener Sixways had its breath taken away courtesy of a stunning individual score from the full-back Abby Dow.

The Wasps player collected possession and showed remarkable pace to saunter past a clutch of leaden-footed USA defenders on a diagonal left-hand run which took her all the way over the visitors’ line.

Last Monday Dow was nominated for the International Rugby Players’ Women’s try of the year for her scintillating effort against France in April. This was another collector’s item.

When England’s third try arrived it was a moment to savour for the Worcester wing Lydia Thompson. Quick hands following a well-worked scrum for England saw them stretch the USA defence before Dow showed intelligence to send Thompson over in the right corner on her 50th appearance for the Red Roses. The try was rapturously received by Thompson’s home crowd but USA finally steadied themselves and began to match England’s physicality at the breakdown.

Crucially however they lacked the quality to unlock England’s defence. The hosts lost their rhythm when they conceded a handful of penalties and spurned another try-scoring opportunity when Thompson dropped Dow’s pass on the edge of USA’s 22-metre line but Lark Davies and Leanne Infante added further scores to make it 29-0 at the break.

The procession increased in the second half as Helena Rowland raced inside the left channel before sending Lagi Tuima clear to score after just 42 seconds. Zoe Aldcroft the captain nipped through a gap for an opportunistic score and Heather Cowell went over before Sarah Bern the impressive replacement prop scored twice.

Davies and Thompson also crossed the line again and Connie Powell capped her debut with a try. Holly Aitchison the Saracens centre also got her name on the scoresheet on a day where positives emerged everywhere for Middleton.

The competition for places within his squad is fierce and a number of players missed out here giving much cause for optimism as England seek to retain their Women’s Six Nations title before attention turns to the rescheduled World Cup.

Dow who was the player of the match after an outstanding display said: “We rarely play four games in a row so to be able to go out there and perform like that and to keep the tempo that we wanted is just incredible. It’s been a long process but all the training we’ve been doing is clearly paying off.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2h1Y2tqb25lcy8yMDIxLzExLzIwL2JpZGVuLWhhcy1tb3JlLXNwLTUwMC1yZWNvcmRzLXRoYW4tdHJ1bXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden Has More S&P 500 Records Than Trump,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2021/11/20/biden-has-more-sp-500-records-than-trump/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2h1Y2tqb25lcy8yMDIxLzExLzIwL2JpZGVuLWhhcy1tb3JlLXNwLTUwMC1yZWNvcmRzLXRoYW4tdHJ1bXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy9jdnMtY2xvc2luZ3MtcGhhcm1hY3ktcmV0YWlsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzExLzIwL2J1c2luZXNzL2N2cy1jbG9zaW5ncy1waGFybWFjeS1yZXRhaWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS had every advantage but it lost the pandemic. Here's what happened,"New York CNN Business —

CVS’ announcement Thursday that it will close 900 stores over the next three years — around 10% of its pharmacies — may have caught some shoppers off guard.

Isn’t CVS doing really well right now? Haven’t lots of people gone to drug stores during the pandemic to stock up on hand sanitizer cleaning wipes and toilet paper? What about all those Covid-19 vaccine shots CVS gives out?

Actually CVS (CVS)’ closures shouldn’t come as a surprise. They are the latest moves in the long-running contraction of the US retail pharmacy sector. CVS (CVS) Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) have been shuttering stores for years while independent pharmacies have come under pressure from chains. Drug store closures can hurt local communities creating access gaps for medications and essentials.

CVS the largest drug store chain in the United States pointed to “changes in population consumer buying patterns and future health needs” as factors in its decision to close stores.

Here’s why CVS will close 900 stores.

Pivot to health care

The future of CVS is not selling snacks candy shampoo and greeting cards. It’s in health care.

To that end in 2018 CVS completed a $69 billion acquisition of Aetna the largest health care deal in history to create a gigantic customer base of about 40 million Americans. CVS bet that the deal will increase its profits from those patients’ health plans while helping to lower its costs.

CVS also has been revamping its retail strategy and said Thursday that its stores will have three distinct models: locations that offer primary care services; “HealthHub” stores that have on-site dieticians nurse practitioners and lab services and on-site treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma; and traditional stores.

CVS is “really pivoting and leaning into the health care aspects of the business” said George Hill an analyst who covers the company and the health care industry at Deutsche Bank. “You’d much rather be selling health care services that are high-dollar value high-margin versus greeting cards.”

Too many stores

When you walk down the street or drive around the suburbs you’ll typically pass a CVS. And then hit a Walgreens right next door. Rite Aid is probably pretty close too.

“There’s too many pharmacies in the country and there’s too much pharmacy capacity. That gives CVS a reason to go” said Hill.

CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 yet it still has more than 9900 stores. That’s more than Walmart (WMT) Target (TGT) Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST) — combined.

Its latest closings will “reduce store density in certain locations” CVS said Thursday which translates into the fact that CVS has too many stores too close to each other in some places.

Competition from Amazon and Dollar General

Also fewer people are heading to CVS and other drug stores to fill their prescriptions and shop for household staples these days. (And they’re not going into CVS to buy tobacco either which the company stopped selling in 2014.)

Some shoppers have replaced their trips to stores like CVS by buying their supplies online from Amazon (AMZN) or from brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart and Target. The chains have built their own strong e-commerce businesses in recent years.

Dollar General (DG) has also grabbed market share from drug stores undercutting the sector with lower prices on similar items. And now Dollar General (DG) is launching its own health care initiative as it continues to take business from pharmacies.

Online pharmacies and telemedicine have gained traction too. Amazon bought PillPack in 2018 for more than $700 million and started shipping prescriptions to Prime members last year. Capsule and other digital pharmacies that deliver directly to customers’ homes are also growing.

Although brick-and-mortar pharmacies are still an important stop for many elderly peopleor those who don’t use the web or have access to it they are increasingly becoming a thing of the past to the growing ranks of online shoppers.

Rising costs

Closing stores also reduces CVS’ costs while still keeping most of its sales. Its labor and store operations costs increased during the pandemic because of safety protections like plexiglass floor decals and masks. The company said in August it planned to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 in a bid to retain and attract workers.

“There are cost pressures in all directions” said Hill the Deutsche Bank analyst.

Seventy-five percent of CVS’ sales comes from filling prescriptions but its profits from that segment have declined in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates.

But when CVS closes a store it can hold onto most of those sales by shifting the prescriptions to its nearest pharmacies Hill said.

Covid-19 vaccines weren’t a huge boost

CVS got a lift from people coming into its stores for their Covid-19 vaccines and tests. The company has administered 43 million vaccines and around 38 million tests CEO Karen Lynch said on an earnings call earlier this month.

But the vaccines were only a short-term gain for the company which said they will generate only $3 billion in revenue in 2021. That will decline by up to 40% next year along with whatever sales CVS racked up as shoppers browsed aisles while they waited to get vaccinated Lynch said.

People also visited their doctors less frequently last year and into 2021 and elective procedures were suspended early in the pandemic which meant that CVS filled fewer regular and chronic care prescriptions than in the years before the pandemic.

And fewer people have also been coming into stores to pick up cough and fever medicines — big business for CVS — because they’re still wearing masks and spending more time at home than they once did.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFtYXRpb24uY29tL2FwcGxpY2F0aW9ucy9pbnRlcm5ldC1vZi10aGluZ3MtaW90LWNsb3VkLXVzZS1jYXNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Internet of Things (IoT) Cloud Use Cases,"Datamation content and product recommendations are editorially independent.

5 IoT Cloud Case Studies

1. Coca-Cola Içecek

One of the key bottlers in the Coca-Cola ecosystem Coca-Cola Içecek (CCI) services more than 400 million consumers in 10 countries across central Asia and the Middle East. CCI sought to improve the efficiency of their 26 bottling plants starting with input from their clean-in-place (CIP) equipment to model a digital twin bottling plant.

“Our CIP is an everyday production process and crucial for industry hygiene and quality requirements” says Burcu Hacioglu digital twin product owner at CCI. “We wanted to improve process efficiency by avoiding errors in time measurement which could lead to CCI plants overusing energy and water.”

CCI fed their industrial IoT information to the AWS cloud where it was used to create data models that could be manipulated to improve efficiency in the system. Early success with the CIP process motivated CCI to expand the model to include filler-mixer machines.

Industry: Beverage

IoT cloud provider: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Outcomes:

Over 30 improvement opportunities identified

20% savings in electricity and 9% savings in water

34 days of processing time saved per year

Read the full case study on CCI and AWS.

2. Deep Sky Vineyard

Family-owned Deep Sky Vineyard operates in Arizona and Argentina to grow grapes for wine. In one of their vineyards an unmonitored irrigation valve broke and flooded an entire zone which motivated Deep Sky to improve information over the entire crop management process using cloud-connected instrumentation.

“This year I already know several ways we’ll improve our grapes“ says Phil Asmundson owner of Deep Sky Vineyard. “Without this digital solution … we wouldn’t have the invaluable insights needed to make these decisions.”

Deep Sky installed connected hardware to monitor water flow soil moisture and other factors to automate and monitor the vineyard. The data flows wirelessly to the Google Cloud to be processed and analyzed.

Industry: Agriculture

IoT cloud provider: Google Cloud

Outcomes:

Saves 1.6 million gallons of water over 15 acres

Produces a 30% saving in labor

Reduces human error costs by as much as 75%

3. DHL Supply Chain

In more than 50 countries around the world DHL Supply Chain provides customers with highly automated logistics storage transportation and distribution services. Although operating in a labor-intensive industry DHL strives to reduce the most labor-intensive tasks by using robotics and automation.

“With the integration capabilities we’ve gained employees can now simplify or eliminate the most tedious parts of their jobs and contribute in more valuable ways” says Fekko Roelofs program manager of robotics hub and resource orchestration at DHL Supply Chain.

Integrating automation at each facility separately consumed a lot of time so DHL implemented a centralized hub on the cloud. Their new architecture feeds information from robotics wearable devices and other data sources to develop reporting and allow for rapid and simple integration of new equipment.

Industry: Supply chain

IoT cloud provider: Microsoft Azure

Outcomes:

Reduced robotics integration times by 60%

Enabled real-time data reporting from a centralized dashboard

Plug-and-play flexibility realized

4. Dow

The worldwide chemical manufacturer Dow strives for zero safety-related incidents. However vast factories and numerous production lines lead to huge numbers of points to monitor for their Digital Operations Center.

“In this situation we were looking at more than just the speed at which we could put together a solution for monitoring video at the edge — there are open-source tools we could have used to cobble something together” says Michael Dessauer senior solutions manager at the Dow Digital Operations Center. “But we need to scale our solution to thousands of deployments.”

Initially Dow selected to monitor for leaks using video. Video feeds need quick analysis to issue timely alerts but also need tight security. Dow opted to incorporate edge technology to generate alerts quickly and also use the traditional cloud applications for storage machine learning (ML) for video analysis process modeling and deeper analysis.

Industry: Chemicals

IoT cloud provider: Microsoft Azure

Outcomes:

Leak sensors now deployed to places difficult dangerous or costly to monitor with people

Human-trained AI continuously improving ability to identifying leaks

Success with leak detection spurring development of systems for PPE protection and security monitoring

Read the full Dow and Microsoft Azure case study.

5. Thermo Fisher

Thermo Fisher manufactures equipment used in laboratory research worldwide. Their equipment could sequence the 3.2 billion base pairs in DNA but the PCs that ran Thermo Fisher software were insufficient in capability for this information flow.

“We looked at trying to build our own cloud” says Mark Field CTO at Thermo Fisher Scientific. “Very quickly we said … this is not our core competency to run massive cloud infrastructure.”

Instead they partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a private cloud environment for Thermo Fisher. Equipment now forwards data directly to this cloud instead of to local PCs to harness scale and improve collaboration.

Industries: Biotechnology manufacturing

IoT cloud provider: AWS

Outcomes:

Over 1000 partner organizations now feed information into the Thermo Fisher cloud

Initially the cloud IoT data expands the reach of supercomputing to all researchers instead of a few

DNA sequencing will allow a future of more customized care for patients

Guest columnist

Lillie James Frazier is a name recognizable to many Pensacolians as one of the 17 children of “Miss Lillie” and the sister of the U.S. Armed Forces’ first black four-star general Daniel “Chappie” James. From the 1940s through the 1960s Lillie Frazier’s mother “Miss Lillie” was headmaster of the L.A. James Private School for Colored Children which educated many black Pensacolians like me who later emerged in leadership positions by taking to heart her Eleventh Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Quit!

One of the first black instructors to integrate then-Pensacola Junior College Lillie Frazier was the English professor who when stopped by a PJC campus police officer for speeding replied to his “I’ve been waiting on you” with this correction: “You have not been waiting ON me … you have been waiting FOR me.”

A less-known fact about Lillie Frazier is that she was among the seven colored women who came together 75 years ago and made a revolutionary decision to charter a Pensacola chapter of the premier sorority for black women Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority (AKA) Incorporated.

Already AKAs and college graduates themselves the local charter members had been initiated in the sorority at different HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities). They “were women then / husky of voice stout of step / who made a place for us” — the college-trained women who have been initiated in or transferred to the local Delta Iota Omega Chapter since 1946.

It was 1946 when Lillie Frazier joined forces with Lorena Cannon Brown Elsie Johnson Jones Annie Belle Williams Hilda Preer Alyce Williams Henderson and Edythe Lucky to charter the local chapter at a time when their lives were affected by the Jim Crow South in which they lived: These women couldn’t vote; they sat on the back of the bus; they couldn’t eat at downtown lunch counters; they went through the back-door entrances of theaters; they shopped at stores where they tried on clothes in colored waiting rooms; and they drank from colored water fountains and used colored restrooms.

As college-trained women most of them were colored teachers who encountered wage discrimination earning an income significantly lower than that of white teachers. In the late 1950s when the local chapter hosted an AKA regional conference comprising chapters in Florida Georgia and South Carolina the women could not rent any local hotels for rooms or meetings.

Learn their stories:Before they were forced out Black men rose to power in Pensacola.

Black women entrepreneurs:'When Queens Link Up' helps build community for Black women entrepreneurs

Nonetheless “they struggled the path” to begin what is now history — AKA history Pensacola history. They became the promoters of their own existence and visibility in Pensacola and their impact reverberates throughout the local chapter to this day.

With a tradition of service that began with spelling bees Ebony Fashion Fairs political forums musical concerts health fairs food pantries and mentoring programs for young girls from the 1950s to the present the chapter has grown to its current membership of 113 women.

This tradition of “service to all mankind” continues through the talents and skills of women who are renowned community leaders with diverse talents. Among its members are administrators educators entrepreneurs legal and health care professionals volunteers and retired professionals who want to advance the aims of the international organization. You’ll also recognize the name AKA for its scholarships to high school seniors and its fundraisers for health awareness including cancer mental illness and Alzheimer’s disease.

On Nov. 23 we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the chartering of the Pensacola chapter. What started in the living room of Hilda Preer and continued at various meetings at the L.A. James Schoolhouse where these seven women met to begin their historic chartering now resonates in the lives of the sorority’s Emerging Young Leaders its Debutantes and in women like me who want to continue to carry out the mission of these magnificent seven women. Because Lillie Frazier and they walked through history we are able to walk behind them and be the progenitors of the AKA legacy in Pensacola.

But as Xander helped her cover up the fact that Abigail DiMera (Marci Miller) didn’t cause Gwen’s miscarriage the two found themselves in love. But the return of Kristen DiMera (Stacey Haiduk) brings news that could end their new romance before it could even properly being.

Kristen demanded that Gwen help bust her out of prison. Gwen barely even knows who Kristen is so she basically laughed in Kristen’s face. That is until Kristen informed Gwen that if she wants to stay with Xander then Gwen had better do exactly what Kristen says because Kristen could blow up Gwen and Xander’s romance. Xander believes that Dr. Sarah Horton (Linsey Godfrey) dumped Xander on their wedding days to return to her ex Rex Brady (Kyle Lowder). But that isn’t what really happened.

DOOL Spoilers – Dr. Sarah Horton Discovered That Kristen DiMera had Escaped Prison!

Kristen had been posing as Susan Banks (also Stacey Haiduk) while the real Susan was in jail pretending to be Kristen. Sarah discovered Kristen the night before the wedding and threatened to tell everyone that Kristen was free. Kristen wasn’t ready to return to prison so she drugged Sarah and shipped her off to a tropical paradise prison. Meanwhile Kristen used a mask to make her look like Sarah and made love to Rex. She also arranged for Xander to catch her and Rex making love. The fake Sarah told Xander that she was leaving town with Rex. And then she dumped Rex who left town all alone.

Kristen told Gwen to break her out of prison or she would tell Xander exactly where to find Sarah. Regardless of what Gwen does the truth won’t stay hidden long. Once Xander finds out that Sarah didn’t dump him and is a prisoner on a deserted island somewhere he will likely drop everything including Gwen to rescue Sarah and bring her home.

Spread the love

Robert Plant and Alison Krauss have announced their first tour together in a decade starting Summer 2022. The news comes following the release of the pair’s new album Raise The Roof which came out on Friday (19 November 19) 14 years after their first collaborative release the enormously successful Raising Sand.

In an interview with The Independent yesterday (20 November) Plant reflected on the partnership “With Alison and I we’re leagues apart in so many elements and then when you realise it that’s part of the magic of the whole thing. It comes from our continued surprise at how we can twist songs round and round. It’s never really appropriate for the limitations of my voice some of the country stuff that we have touched on but when we get it right and the right key to sing in for the both of us… it’s just so surprising. When we sing we just look at each other and laugh.”

Krauss went on to speculate about a third album from the duo and to comment on the forthcoming tour: “ It has to be the right songs so that’s what you wait for. If you get the right song… But I know everybody’s excited to get out and play I’m excited and really proud of this record I think we have something that’s really beautiful and representative of us at that time.”

Photo: Getty Images

France captain Antoine Dupont said Saturday’s 40-25 record win over New Zealand was “magnificent” in a dress rehearsal for the opening game of the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

Les Bleus claimed a first win over the All Blacks since 2009 thanks to Peato Mauvaka’s double and efforts from Romain Ntamack and Damian Penaud as well as Melvyn Jaminet’s points from the boot.

New Zealand lost a second game in the space of seven days after the defeat to Ireland last weekend and conceded 40 points or more for the second time in two years.

“We know how long it has been since we’ve beaten the All Blacks” home captain Antoine Dupont told reporters.

“Everything came together an incredible scenario an incredible opponent and a magnificent win.

“It’s an important point in our adventure and we showed we have the quality” he added.

All Blacks head coach Ian Foster lamented his side’s first half performance -- they conceded three tries in the opening 32 minutes -- before bringing themselves within two points of the hosts in the final quarter.

“They came out really strong. They put us under pressure from the start” Foster told reporters.

“I was delighted with the way we came back in it and how we put them under pressure. We need to learn to do more of that” he added.

France head coach Fabien Galthie moved Romain Ntamack back to fly-half with powerful centre Jonathan Danty brought into midfield.

Foster made seven changes from last weekend’s loss in Dublin with Richie Mo’unga starting at fly-half instead of Beauden Barrett who suffered a concussion at Landsdowne Road.

Hooker Peato Mauvaka born closer to Auckland than Paris in New Caledonia claimed his fourth try in three Tests this November profiting at the back of a rolling maul after less than three minutes.

Visiting full-back Jordie Barrett closed the gap to a point with two penalty goals before the noise in northern Paris lifted by another octave.

Les Bleus progressed from their own half with a succession of one-pass phases before Romain

Ntamack stepped off his right foot inside opponent Mo’unga to dive over justifying Galthie’s decision to move him back to fly-half.

Jaminet’s second conversion made it 14-6 to cap off a thrilling opening quarter before Danty justified his selection at inside centre by bulldozing over 122kg 2.04m lock Brodie Retallick with ease.

Mauvaka had further reason to celebrate after half an hour after repeating his feat from earlier in the half to crash over from another rolling maul.

- All Blacks fight back -

Trailing 24-6 at the break the All Blacks came out of the changing rooms early after the interval and gained some momentum by copying the hosts’ first half tactic of one-pass phases before Barrett found a way over in the corner.

The full-back however who had had a poor first half failed with his touchline conversion.

Les Bleus’ lead was cut again with half an hour remaining as centre Rieko Ioane sprinted over from 40m and Barrett’s conversion made it 24-18 setting up a tense final 30 minutes.

The ominous signs of an All Black comeback increased on 58 minutes as Ardie Savea charged over from short range Barrett again converting to make it 27-25.

The home support rediscovered their voices with 17 minutes left as Ntamack escaped from his own tryline and Jaminet kicked a penalty two phases later to stretch the lead to five points.

With 12 minutes left New Zealand attempted to run the ball from their own 22m but Damian Penaud intercepted David Havili’s looping pass to cross unopposed under the posts.

Leading 37-25 Les Bleus closed out the game in clinical fashion as Jaminet took his tally for the night to 20 points with a penalty goal with the clock in the red.

The matchups for next week's Class 2A state championship game are set.At CSU-Pueblo's Thunderbowl it will be No. 1 Eaton facing No. 7 Brush in the Class 2A state championship game.

EATON — Even during an afternoon in which the sun never really poked through the thick gloomy clouds Zac Grable routinely found daylight.

Grable — the Reds' athletic 6-foot-3 junior receiver — found daylight on third-and-short. He found daylight on second-and-long.

He found daylight every time University seemed to be on the verge of turning the tide in its favor during a Class 2A state football semifinals game this afternoon.

In all Grable found daylight on three separate occasions as he hauled in deep passes from junior quarterback Walker Martin for three of Eaton's six touchdowns during the top-seeded Reds 39-24 win against 12th-seeded University.

""Me and Walker have a good connection within the passing game"" said Grable who had three receptions all touchdowns for 144 total yards. ""We wanted to prove something big.""

With the win the defending 2A champion Reds (12-0) advance to their second consecutive title game and will face No. 7 Brush (10-2) at 6 p.m. Saturday at the Neta and Eddie DeRose ThunderBowl on the Colorado State University-Pueblo campus

While Eaton moves on in pursuit of its third state title in program history University ended its historic season at 7-5.

Early in the postseason the Bulldogs won their first playoff game since 1985. Today they played in just the second semifinals game in program history the first since 1964.

But even though University — in two meetings this season — proved to be more effective against the Reds' brick-wall defense than any other offense has been it was Eaton's big plays in the passing game that assured the Bulldogs wouldn't be celebrating their first trip to the state finals in program history.

The Reds struck on their first of many splashy offensive plays on the first play from scrimmage with the Bulldogs perhaps expecting smash-mouth Eaton to attempt to get its talented running game in rhythm.

Instead Martin dropped back and delivered a feathery pass up the middle to junior Austin Martinez who took the pass 80 yards to give the Reds a 7-0 lead just 10 seconds into the game.

Undaunted University — with 2A's top passing game powered by senior quarterback Greg Garza — promptly marched his team 82 yards on 11 plays to pull the Bulldogs within a point 7-6 with 7:11 left in the first quarter.

These two offenses were just getting started as Eaton scored three touchdowns in the first 10 minutes while University scored two touchdowns in the first 8 minutes.

While the Bulldogs struggled with point-after kicks and conversions the Reds slowly and methodically pulled away.

But there was nothing slow and methodical about Eaton's passing game.

Martin attempted just eight passes. Five of those passes went for touchdowns. And each of those five touchdowns were 35 or more years — including touchdown catches of 64 45 and 35 yards by Grable.

""Watching film we knew that (University) didn't have high safeties se we wanted to really push the ball up the middle"" said Martin who completed 5 of 8 passes for 261 yards. ""And Zac was great today. The first time we played (University) he didn't have his best game. But coming in to this game he was the warrior of the week.""



(7) Brush 35 (6) Severance 18

The Brush Beetdiggers and Severance Silver Knights each pulled of an upset to reach the Class 2A quarterfinals so when they faced off against one another on Saturday neither was truly an underdog nor the favorite.On the strength of a 24-point second quarter it was the Brush Beetdiggers who prevailed with a 35-18 victory. The win which came against a Severance squad that won 20-7 in a regular-season matchup between the two teams sends the historically successful Brush program back into the championship game.""They were really conscientious of our inside game so they were putting nine and ten people in the box"" Brush head coach Lance Schwindt told the Colorado Preps Scoreboard Show. ""So we started out running outside a little bit and loosened them up. They had eleven people close by so we were able to not hit a lot of passes but just enough to keep them honest. And then our running game at the very end kind of wore them down.""Brush will be making its 13th state championship game appearance. The Beetdiggers last won a football state championship in 2014.In Friday's championship game the Beetdiggers will reassume their underdog role when they take on undefetaed defending champion Eaton.“Coach Lemon he does a great job"" Schwindt said. ""Last year we played them and they balnked us 28-0. They’ve got athletes all over the place. I was listening to another radio show and they were talking about 'Division-I athlete Division-I athlete.' God darn we're happy to get somebody to go to a small school and play. So we're really excited for the challenge still in front of us.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuc3lyYWN1c2UuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvc3lyYWN1c2UvbmFtZS9laWxlZW4tZ291bGQtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE2NjMyNjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eileen Gould Obituary (2021) - Fayetteville NY - Syracuse Post Standard,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.syracuse.com/us/obituaries/syracuse/name/eileen-gould-obituary?id=31663268 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuc3lyYWN1c2UuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvc3lyYWN1c2UvbmFtZS9laWxlZW4tZ291bGQtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE2NjMyNjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vdGVycmlibGUtZm91ci1ob3JzZW1lbi1tZW1iZXJzLXJlcGxhY2VkLXRoZW0td2N3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Terrible Four Horsemen Members (And 5 Who Should Have Replaced Them),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vdGVycmlibGUtZm91ci1ob3JzZW1lbi1tZW1iZXJzLXJlcGxhY2VkLXRoZW0td2N3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vZ2FtZXRpbWVjdC9naXJscy1zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9DbGFzcy1NLUdpcmxzLVNvY2Nlci1NZXJjeS1TYWNyZWQtSGVhcnQtQWNhZGVteS0xNjYzODA1NC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Class M Girls Soccer: Mercy Sacred Heart Academy share title after scoreless tie,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ctinsider.com/gametimect/girls-soccer/article/Class-M-Girls-Soccer-Mercy-Sacred-Heart-Academy-16638054.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vZ2FtZXRpbWVjdC9naXJscy1zb2NjZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9DbGFzcy1NLUdpcmxzLVNvY2Nlci1NZXJjeS1TYWNyZWQtSGVhcnQtQWNhZGVteS0xNjYzODA1NC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Others probably don’t know that BMW (and other companies) makes brand-new vehicles too and probably know the estimated value of most used models by heart. So where do you fit?

Don’t answer that question yet because it is time to focus one yet another used ride. Only this time it’s not a high-end machine that bears the logos of an exotic carmaker but one that’s more than affordable. At $995 which is the sticker price on eBay  it’s probably one of the cheapest vehicles that we ever covered. At the time of writing it was the most low-priced car on the quoted website next to a 2008 Hyundai Sonata that was quickly deemed as being too bland to deserve an entire article. Cadillac DeVille  which saw the light of day in 2001 according to the ad part of the eighth and final generation of the model that sports a gold paint finish on top of a black interior. The front end and sides are not visible at all in the multitude of pictures shared by the vendor but at least it looks quite good out back with the shiny chrome trim dedicated badging and quad exhaust pipes.The ‘32V Northstar’ logo bedecking the left side of the trunk lid is a nod to the engine  a 4.6-liter V8 making 275 bhp and 300 lb-ft (407 Nm) of torque. The straight-line performance of the car which is slightly bigger than the modern-day BMW 5 Series and sports a longer wheelbase was nothing to write home about two decades ago. From 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) it needed around 8 seconds and flat out it could do a bit over 110 mph (180 kph).Moving on to the cabin we can see that the black leather upholstery looks surprisingly good for a car born 20 years ago. It was wrapped around the seats center armrests door cards steering wheel and part of the dashboard with wood inserts providing an interesting contrast reminiscent of vehicles much older than this one. In terms of equipment you’re looking at a basic audiosystem with separate controls for the rear seat passengers power windows and door locks electrically adjustable side mirrors multi-function steering wheel and a few other bits and bobs.Despite the multitude of pictures accompanying the ad most of which reveal the cabin from multiple angles  the vendor couldn’t be bothered to share any technical details. They did say however that it has 133297 miles (214521 km) under its belt but then again the digital dials state the same.

However EA will be developing two new single-player Star Wars games.

Star Wars Battlefront as a franchise has not had great luck at Electronic Arts despite strong sales. The original title in DICE’s rebooted series was rushed to meet a deadline in time for the release of The Force Awakens with its scope confined to the original trilogy era with no story campaign. While the second game had a much greater variety of content available from the start and a clear plan for free DLC the launch was marred by outrage over predatory microtransactions which had to be overhauled at the last minute as the company had to rethink its economic model for the title. Thanks to a devoted team of developers supporting the game post-launch Battlefront II really turned around and became a success story – but its time in the sun was cut short as EA moved all available resources toward preparing the next titles in their Battlefield series.

Now word has suggested that after many of the developers that helped with Battlefront II‘s post-launch support either left EA or were reassigned elsewhere that EA has rejected a pitch from DICE for a third game once again in favor of developing more titles in their Battlefield series (which incidentally served as the blueprint for what would become Star Wars Battlefront). The reasoning for this appears to be due to the scale of the title which would either have to be scaled back at launch to the disappointment of fans who want them to go bigger or for DICE to go bigger and have to make a game that would be harder to recoup the company’s investment on. (Ignoring of course that a title bigger than Battlefront II and a smooth launch would likely sell better and pay for its additional expenses.) With that being said EA is still developing new Star Wars titles including starting work on two new single-player games one of which is likely the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order.

IGN’s Tom Henderson revealed this information in a Twitter thread which you can read below:

Battlefront 3 was a pitched title from DICE but ultimately the title was shot down by EA due to licensing costs. “It got turned down because it takes 20% more sales to make the same money” said one past developer. — Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) November 20 2021

Since several key developers that worked on the Battlefront series have since left the DICE studio in the past year including the likes of Battlefront II’s creative director Dennis Bränvall core gameplay designer Christian Johannesé and lead hero designer Guillaume Mroz (cont) — Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) November 20 2021

These processes are standard throughout game development and although it might appear counterproductive to start pitching concepts on one title before the other has launched it did not take away the development time of #Battlefield2042 (before the rumors start). — Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) November 20 2021

It should also be said that development can change at any given time and the next title has started development bur if Battlefront 3 ever gets greenlit and starts development for whatever reason I'll break the news. — Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) November 20 2021

EA infamously indicated that they were over making single-player titles but between the complications with the Battlefront series and the unexpected breakout success of Jedi: Fallen Order they’ve changed their focus to be more about Star Wars games that you can play by yourself. Fans frustrated with EA’s approach can at least take solace with the fact that since their exclusivity license is all but wrapped up now more developers will be able to take a crack at Star Wars video games – and it’s always possible that another developer could get the opportunity to develop more Battlefront titles in EA’s place. As it stands the only Star Wars game from EA that appears to be a sure thing is a sequel to Fallen Order. The company has indicated that they will reveal their plans for future Star Wars games at their next EA Play presentation which will happen on July 22 of next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2dhbWluZy9zdGFyLXdhcnMtYmF0dGxlZnJvbnQtMy12ZXJ5LXVubGlrZWx5LWVhLXNob290cy1kb3duLXNlcXVlbC1wbGFucy0xNzAzMTY3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star Wars Battlefront 3 “very unlikely” after EA quietly shoots down sequel plans,"Battlefront 3 is looking “very unlikely” insiders have revealed with EA quietly shooting down DICE’s pitch to develop a threequel for the popular Star Wars franchise following the slow-built success of Battlefront 2.

Star Wars fans are set to be denied a Battlefront III for the second time in the past two decades with Electronic Arts turning down a pitch for another series sequel.

According to insider reports heavyweight publishers EA was approached by DICE to back another Battlefront title following on from Battlefront 2’s slow-simmering success. Top powerbrokers at the Californian gaming giant ran a red line through the plans however with licensing costs the main concern.

One past developer revealed the sequel “got turned down because it takes 20% more sales to make the same money” as other similar titles like Battlefield 2042. The hefty price tag comes via the use of the Star Wars universe.

To make matters worse for Battlefront 3 hopes several Battlefront devs have departed DICE including the sequel’s creative director and core gameplay designer.

Electronic Arts Following launch woes Battlefront 2 has become a must-play for Star Wars fans.

While Battlefront III dreams may be going down in smoke Star Wars fans still have several upcoming titles to look forward to via the ongoing Electronic Arts partnership.

Early reports suggest these are “more story-driven single-player games rather than multiplayer titles” and one may be a Jedi: Fallen Order follow-up. A sequel to the 2019 release would be no surprise; the EA action-adventure title shattering several franchise gaming records on release.

Recently Quantic Dream were also linked to a heavily-story-focused Star Wars game similar to their immersive titles like Heavy Rain and Detroit Become Human. Aspyr is also remaking Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.

Perhaps the biggest Star Wars rumor however relates to Ubisoft. According to sources Disney bosses have handed them the reins of an open-world game.

Electronic Arts EA resurrected the much-loved Battlefront series with a remake title in early 2015.

Ironically this is the second time in as many decades plans for a Battlefront III title have been scrapped. Free Radical Design was “pretty much done” with their original threequel in 2008 but it was eventually shelved.

Lecius. A second Lecius. Teas. Parent. Hippauf. Rock. Lampron. King. Piper. Nichols. Newcomb. Ross. Nikitas. Lagios. A second Lagios.

Wait. What about Boyle?

If “Boyle” doesn’t immediately come to mind that’s because the name Francis “Frank” Boyle Jr. a former longtime Nashuan and 1942 Nashua High graduate was far more prominent behind the scenes of the broadcast industry.

But earlier this month the name Frank Boyle was suddenly in the national spotlight standing shoulder to shoulder with such broadcast industry luminaries as Hall of Fame sports broadcaster Bob Costas; Marion Ross the beloved “Marion Cunningham” of “Happy Days” fame; and “Good Morning America” co-anchor Robin Roberts who is also president of her production company “Rock’N Robin

Productions.”

The occasion was the awarding of the Library of American Broadcasting Foundation’s 2021 Giants of Broadcasting & Electronic Arts Awards a virtual event that took place two weeks ago and broadcast out of the foundation’s New York City headquarters.

The man who still today recalls his formative years in Nashua as “some of the most wonderful years of my life … it was a marvelous place to grow up” was one of the nine members of the Giants of Broadcasting’s Class of 2021 an event created “to honor the remarkable creators innovators leaders performers and journalists who have brought the electronics arts to the prominence that they occupy today” according to the foundation.

Contacted by phone at his southwestern Connecticut home last week Boyle sounds younger than his 96 years most notably when it comes to recalling details of events that happened generations ago.

Try as he might however Boyle’s interviewer was only marginally successful in coaxing the affable nonagenarian to talk more about the highlights of a career – or more accurately careers – that sufficiently impressed members of the foundation’s nominating committee to put his name on this year’s list of Giants.

Indeed Boyle clearly delighted in recalling his early Nashua years even though he lived here for just 16 or 17 years.

That was plenty of time however to fall in love with a thriving little city he saw for the first time at age 8.

That’s when his mother Alice who was born in Nashua in 1901 moved him and his two sisters back to Nashua from Woodstock Vermont where she worked serving food to big shots and guests of the area’s resorts.

“My father was in the lumber business in Montpelier … I was 8 when he deserted us” Boyle recalls.

He enrolled in the elementary school connected to St. Patrick’s Church went on to Nashua High and upon graduation worked “at the textile plant for a couple years” until he was old enough to join the Air Force.

“I wanted to be a fighter pilot and save the world” he said with a laugh.

Boyle’s son James Boyle said in an email that his father flew upwards of 35 missions over France and Germany “in the ball turret of a B-17” the so-called “Flying Fortress” fighter plane that carried the chilling nickname “The Flying Coffin.”

Returning to Nashua after the war Boyle said jobs were available but not the type of jobs that lead to productive careers. So he enrolled in college – a process that turned out to be the stuff of legend.

When Boyle was at NHS the principal – they called them “headmasters” at the time – was Walter S. Naismith who Boyle described as “a sort of Lou Grant figure” known to be tough on troublemakers but who “we worshipped because we knew he was right.”

Somewhere along the way Naismith suggested that Boyle consider enrolling at the University of Michigan where Naismith had earned his masters degrees.

Boyle thanked his mentor for the advice and went to the reference books to learn more about the Midwestern school.

Going down the index list Boyle stopped at “Michigan” not realizing that was the entry for Michigan State University not the University of Michigan.

Boyle was accepted. To this day James Boyle who followed his father and late mother too to Michigan State shudders thinking about how close he came to being a lifelong “Wolverine” rather than a forever “Spartan.”

It would also be at Michigan State that Boyle met his future wife. Her birth name Burgess was next to “Boyle” alphabetically putting the two side-by-side in their journalism class.

They hit it off and eventually married prompting James Boyle to note how his sisters and him “got very lucky twice” thanks to alphabetical forces.

Otherwise “we wouldn’t have had such tremendous MSU alumni parents who told us East Lansing stories and perhaps fables.

“Gosh we could have been Wolverine kids” he added with a laugh.

Frank Boyle started out studying chemical engineering at MSU. “I tried it it was a total flop” he said with a laugh. So he tried the advertising field found he was quite adept at selling and managing sales forces which led him to form a media brokerage firm that among other markets involved stations in southern New

Hampshire.

Whenever someone asks Boyle his secret to his success in almost always beating his competitors he has a ready answer.

“What I tell them is I outlive them” he said with a laugh.

According to journalist Tom Henderson DICE had pitched Battlefront 3 but ultimately the proposal was rejected by EA due to the costs of using the Star Wars license.

“It got turned down because it takes 20% more sales to make the same money” one anonymous developer is quoted as stating.

EA is now said to be focusing its efforts on the next Battlefield game instead which Henderson suggests could release as soon as 2023.

Several key developers behind the Battlefront series have recently left DICE Henderson points out including Battlefront II’s creative director Dennis Bränvall core gameplay designer Christian Johannesé and lead hero designer Guillaume Mroz.

Battlefront 2 launched in November 2017 and received widespread criticism due to its reliance on loot boxes and microtransactions. These were quickly removed and a generous post-release content roadmap was received favourably by fans.

Lucasfilm confirmed in January that its Star Wars exclusivity deal with EA was set to end by partnering with Ubisoft on a new open-world game although EA responded by stating that its “long-standing collaboration with Lucasfilm Games… will continue for years to come”.

Adding some colour to those comments during EA’s third quarter earnings call in February CEO Andrew Wilson said the company would continue to invest in Star Wars games new and old.

“If you look at our history with Star Wars we’ve had a long and very profitable relationship first with LucasArts or Lucasfilm and then with Lucasfilm as part of Disney” he said.

“As we’ve established these very strong parts of that franchise” Wilson added “you should expect that we will continue to invest in those as well as some new experiences across platforms for the future.”

Star Wars Squadrons developer Motive has said it’s working on a new Star Wars action game and EA suggested last year that it would create a Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sequel after Respawn‘s 2019 game surpassed expectations with over 10 million sales.

This week EA confirmed that the next expansion for its Star Wars MMO The Old Republic Legacy of the Sith will release in December.

Is it working?,"Pharma companies vying for a piece of the lucrative migraine market have gone all-in on marketing. They've turned to Olympic athletes and Hollywood stars to pitch recently approved brands in TV commercials and on social media.

But is the message sinking in with patients? Apparently not yet a new survey from Phreesia Life Sciences suggests.

Nearly half of the more than 4000 migraine patients polled in July 2021 said they couldn’t recall a single brand name when asked about preventive migraine drugs. The most recognized brand? Topamax which won FDA approval for migraine way back in 2004.

While slightly more than a quarter of patients (26%) recognized the older Johnson & Johnson drug fewer than 1 in 10 patients remembered the newer brands which have entered the market in recent years.

Leading the pack among these newer meds which target CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is Amgen’s Aimovig with 8% of patients recalling the brand followed by Eli Lilly’s Emgality and Biohaven’s Nurtec ODT (both 7%) and Teva’s Ajovy (3%).

RELATED: Eli Lilly under pressure from Biohaven launches head-to-head migraine trial between Emgality and Nurtec

Although the survey shows migraine drug marketers have work to do when it comes to brand recognition it also reveals a large untapped market said Liz Hebert senior research manager at Phreesia which surveyed patients checking in for doctors' appointments through its digital patient intake platform.

For example nearly three-quarters of patients said migraine has had a moderate to great impact on their daily lives but only 37% had tried a preventive treatment. (The figure jumps to 52% for acute meds.)

That doesn’t mean they’re not willing. In fact 40% of patients who have never taken a preventive med—and nearly 60% of those who have—said they were likely to try a new preventive treatment in the next year according to the survey.

“What that tells me is they just need an additional push” said Joyce Wang Phreesia’s associate director of research.

One way pharma companies can provide that push is with more detailed information about how their meds work and how they can help the report suggests. In some cases patients aren’t even aware their migraines are serious enough to warrant a prescription so stronger messaging is needed Wang and Hebert said.

“They haven’t been given the information to understand that ‘Hey you don’t need to suffer’” Wang explained.

What else do migraine patients want from drug companies? Information about side effects is high on the list Wang and Hebert said with 36% saying it would increase their interest in a new preventive brand.

Almost a third of patients (32%) said “tips to manage side effects” would rank among the top three most helpful resources pharma companies could give them about their migraine care. And among those who are no longer taking a preventive medication 28% said they stopped because of side effects compared to only 15% who said the treatment didn’t work.

“That tells a really strong story” said Wang. “They really need some more detailed guidance on how to best manage those [side effects].”

Pharma also needs to continue its outreach to doctors—particularly primary care physicians who may be more likely to recommend over-the-counter meds the report recommends. More than half of patients (53%) said a doctor’s recommendation would boost their interest in a new migraine treatment.

“Patients are talking about their migraines all the time and they’re not just talking about their migraines to their specialty doctors” Wang said. “We really need to broaden the horizons and get more people involved in the treatment process.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZXh0ZXItcmVjYXAtaGlkZS1ib2R5LTAzMDAzNzgxMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dexter Recap: How to Hide a Body,"Dexter Morgan may have pulled a fast one on the residents of Iron Lake but when the cops call in the dogs it’s probably time to ditch the dead guy.

In Sunday’s episode of Dexter: New Blood the town remains on the hunt for Matt Caldwell who we know became Dexter’s first kill after breaking his abstention from murder. But the pressure and the stakes are raised when a bit of found footage reveals a second figure lurking about the scene of the crime. Can Dexter continue weaseling his way out of this one and where’s he going to stash Matt’s body parts? Let’s find out by recapping “Smoke Signals.”

More from TVLine

Dexter’s “one tiny mistake” continues to haunt him. As the search party carries on he’s balancing his efforts between trying to parent Harrison and concealing the body hidden directly underneath the cops’ feet. And that’s when Angela announces there’s been a break in the case: Reservation land management unearthed footage of Matt shooting down that deer. Of course the word “footage” immediately sends “Jim” into a panic. Luckily for Dexter the video is geothermal so all that can be seen are colorful silhouettes. However it does reveal a second figure in the woods which officially turns this missing persons case into a criminal investigation.

—

Dexter shadows the investigator hired to review the blood at the scene and he determines some of it is human. He then takes a stab at what he thinks happened and the guy is right on the money. He even determines there was foul play involved based on the removal of a rock that likely caused a head injury. (“I’ve gotten rusty in my abstinence” Dexter tells himself.)

Dexter New Blood Harrison Audrey

Angela orders a DNA test on Kurt and confirms that the blood found was indeed Matt’s. She deduces that someone probably saw Matt kill the protected buck on Seneca land and he or she wasn’t too happy about it. She tells Dex later that she’s ordered search dogs to sweep the woods so that night he takes Matt’s clothing and spreads the scent aaaall over the area.

At school Harrison is accused of cheating on his placement test but the boy is miffed when Dexter doesn’t immediately back him. Harrison retakes the test and actually scores higher than he did the first time.

Meanwhile Lily is still petrified in her cage of an apartment. But suddenly the door unlocks and she bolts down the hall and out of her basement confines. She takes off running but doesn’t get far: A masked assailant shoots her dead with a sniper rifle.

Dexter still can’t figure out how to dispose of Matt’s body. The ground’s too frozen to bury it and the lake is too shallow to risk it being found by fishermen. Deb suggests a wood chipper which gives us a hilarious (and bloody) little scene where Jennifer Carpenter gleefully destroys various body parts but Dex finds that to be “a little Fargo.” Then he considers the old iron mine. It’s remote humungous and filled with twisty tunnels which may be just what he needs. He straps on snow shoes and makes the trek to the mine where he finds what looks to be the perfect hiding spot… until he awakens a hibernating bear and is forced to flee.

Dexter New Blood Episode 3 Michael C. Hall

At dinner with Angela Audrey and Harrison Dexter tells us he doesn’t want to lose his new “family.” He’s very aware that his impulsive kill almost cost him his small semblance of happiness. After he apologizes to Harrison for not having his back at school. “I was wrong” he tells the boy. “From now on this is me on your side.” Harrison responds: “Thanks Dad” which Dexter tells us is now his new favorite word.

Ultimately Dex decides to toss the body into the town’s incinerator and promises himself he’ll go back to abstaining. “But what if it’s not the killing that got me in trouble?” he wonders. “What if it’s the not killing?”

At the close of the episode he sees a drunken Kurt on the street who says Matt not only called him but they Facetimed. We know the mourning father is lying… but why?

I do have two PW2's... the major system components are listed in my signature block.I'm really asking about compatibility between a given panel and its microinverter: the number of cells in a panel and the ability of the micro-inverter to manage that. Not concerned about the number of panels in each branch. I have one branch of 10 panels one branch of 8 panels and I'm sketching out the third branch with 8 panels.FYI I'm laying out the third branch as a ground mount with 2 axis tracking but I probably won't be getting super high end panels for it.Sorry for the confusion about my current and proposed branches. Currently I have high spec panels. What I'm really trying to understand here is how much I'm leaving on the table with my installed G9 380W panels with the IQ-7+. Seems like a lot (290 VA microinverter cap 380W panel @ MPP 290/380=76% seemingly leaving 24% unused).I'dto agree as I'm wondering how the microinverter even knows how many cells are in a panel. I'm pretty sure each panel is only connected to the microinverter with a single positive and a single negative lead. But the documentation is very specific especially for the IQ-7X. The number of cells even shows up in the model numbers. Isn't there some direct relevance?",,,,,,,,,,,,

ACSO Deputies have taken reports on as many as 20 thefts in the past two months.

Early Thursday morning suspects hit a location off FM 3387 south of Christine. Sheriff’s investigators mobilized at approximately 3:30 a.m. and began tracking the suspects who managed to slip back to a residence in Christine.

ASCO Investigators worked throughout the day and obtained a search warrant signed by Justice of the Peace Orlando Carrasco. Prior to the execution of the search warrant ASCO deputies stopped a vehicle believed to be involved in the thefts and found evidence linking it to the crimes. When the search warrant was executed sheriff’s investigators found stolen #2 copper wire believed to have been stolen earlier that morning at the theft off of FM 3387.

Two suspects were arrested and booked into the Atascosa County Jail. They are identified as John Edward Bautista age 49 of Christine and Ernesto Laque III age 42 also of Christine. As of Saturday morning Bautista has been charged with five counts of Damaging or Destroying Critical Infrastructure Facility a 3rd degree felony and five counts of Theft of Copper a State Jail Felony. Laque has been charged with three counts of Damage or Destroying Critical Infrastructure Facility and three counts of Theft of Copper.

According to ACSO Sheriff David Soward several investigators and deputies took part in the investigation however it was spearheaded by Sergeant Investigator Stephen Wilson and Lieutenant Max Peralta and supervised by Chief Jake Guerra.

Additional charges on other thefts will be filed by investigators on Monday.

Sheriff Soward stated “We will also be making additional arrests in this investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The new building that will join the north side of the Philadelphia skyline as part of the Cathedral Square development. Developed by EQT Exeter and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia the tower will soon rise to a height of 470 feet and will feature a curvy angled parapet standing 34 stories above ground. The building was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz which has also designed Philadelphia buildings such as The Murano The Laurel Rittenhouse and 33 North 22nd Street. Today YIMBY shares exclusive massings that show the tower’s future impact on the skyline.

Out of the unusual designs in Philadelphia the building will soon stand out as one of the most original out of all of them. The shape of the building features many flat and curvy faces. The structure steps up to the crown in three sections with the first section having the largest floors. The section section is smaller and the shape is slightly adjusted while the top section is way smaller and features a curve on the east face.

When the tower is built it will be the tallest building along the Vine Street Expressway. The Alexander is the current tallest building along the Expressway standing at a height of 370 feet and 22 stories but Two Cathedral Square will rise exactly 100 feet above The Alexander. Though the building was previously projected to stand 685 feet the 470-foot-tall structure will still stand dominant over the area and will make an impact on the skyline when looking from Logan Square and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The cause of their anger was spiralling rents in the Irish capital pushed higher as the fastest growth in house prices in years has made renting more attractive. The sentiment is spreading. Private-equity firms insurance companies pension funds and other institutional investors that have snapped up residential property during the pandemic are becoming the butt of resentment in rich countries. As their share of the residential-property market has grown so has the backlash. Some blame big landlords for soaring rents. Others accuse them of exploiting crisis for profit.

Policymakers have been fast to respond. The White House wants to restrict the types of properties that large investors are allowed to buy. New Zealand has scrapped tax breaks for property investors and Ireland has slapped a 10% tax on the bulk-buying of houses. Canada’s central bank says the role that big investors play in housing requires more scrutiny. In Germany Berlin’s residents voted in September to force their city’s biggest landlords to sell more than 200000 flats to the state though the referendum was non-binding and the constitutional court is expected to overturn the result if it becomes law.

This restructuring by the multinational maker and marketer of makeup skincare fragrances and haircare products involves elevating China so that it reports directly into the international organisation and creating China’s first-ever CEO role promoting Joy Fan to President and CEO China.

Reflecting Estee Lauder's dedication to China and Chinese consumers this important evolution in the company’s regional enterprise structure is set to both reinforce its focus on Asia-Pacific to realise its future business growth and further enable the region to lead in what is an “increasingly complex and competitive beauty landscape” Cedric Prouve Group President International said.

Estee Lauder expects double-digit growth in China

As one of the most dynamic markets globally for prestige beauty China is strategically significant for Estee Lauder as a source of deep inspiration for product development marketing excellence and consumer insights.

According to Estee Lauder’s fourth-quarter 2021 earnings the APAC region saw annual sales growth accelerate from 18% to 22% driven by strong sales performance in China where net sales rose in double-digits. In particular this was led by the continued strength of skincare acceleration of fragrance growth and the recovery of makeup.

“We expect the market in China to continue to grow double-digit and we are very very optimistic on the strength of this market as well as on our position with the consumers in this market” says Fabrizio Freda president and director of Estee Lauder Companies.

The company has seen dramatic growth on platforms like Tmall and in July 2021 unveiled its brands on Chinese ecommerce platform JD.com hoping to further capture the online opportunities by opening up to a new demographic. The company has also entered more cities with its offline offerings reaching 145 to date.

Elevating China and creating CEO role

Believing in the long-term growth fundamentals in the market Estee Lauder is deepening therefore its commitment to China.

By elevating its China business so it reports directly into the global organisation and has its own executive leadership team the company will enable increased speed local decision-making and global collaboration to advance its leadership and to successfully deliver high-quality products and services for the Chinese consumer.

As part of this focus on China Estee Lauder has created the region’s first CEO position providing China with its own executive leadership. Joy Fan will assume the new role of President and CEO China overseeing the mainland China business effective February 2022.

Having joined Estee Lauder APAC in 2012 as leader of the China affiliate of the business Fan has worked with her team for the last nine years to successfully drive growth within the market as well as to elevate the understanding of the Chinese consumer across the enterprise.

She spearheaded the direct-to-consumer strategy in China which resulted in the growth of multiple brands in the group’s portfolio and development of key channels and under her tenure the China affiliate has grown into an industry leader in social media and marketing. She leveraged innovation to recruit and retain new younger consumers and successfully pivoted during the pandemic to address the changing distribution landscape and evolving consumer preferences to rapidly return the business to positive growth.

Described by Estee Lauder Companies as a visionary executive and one of the most respected leaders in the business Fan has deep expertise of China especially of consumer preferences along with a global perspective and exceptional brand-building abilities making her the perfect choice of CEO for China.

In her new role Fan will continue to be responsible for the company’s long-term growth strategy for China and its vision of the Chinese consumer.

Opening of new China Innovation Center in Shanghai

Underlying its commitment to China the company is further expanding its scientific presence in the country recently opening its new China Innovation Centre in Shanghai.

A first of its kind for the company this world-class innovation centre will “create a unique opportunity to grow and build on our market and consumer insights to develop exceptional products to meet and surpass the needs and desires of Chinese consumers” says Freda adding too that it will enrich “our capability in product design formulation consumer insight and trend analytics for Chinese and Asian consumers”.

This along with the company’s scientific investments in China are expected to support and inspire the development of the entire prestige beauty industry worldwide enabling truly localised innovation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVubGVhc2guYWkvdW5sZWFzaGFtZXJpY2Evc3BlYWtlcnMvc3RlcGhlbi1nb2xkZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stephen Golden | UNLEASH America,"Stephen Golden

Etsy (ETSY -2.41%) made the surprising move last summer of acquiring Depop a peer-to-peer social e-commerce site for $1.625 billion giving it exposure to the resale market.

In this episode of ""Upgrade or Topgrade"" Millionacres editor Deidre Woollard and Fool contributors Jeremy Bowman and Nick Rossolillo discuss the acquisition and how it fits into Etsy's broader business model.

10 stocks we like better than Etsy

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Etsy wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of November 10 2021

Deidre Woollard: Well let's talk about that Depop acquisition because they were purchased in July for $1.625 billion. At the time it seemed like maybe an interesting move for Etsy. I think it's actually turned out to be it's a pretty great company. They're a little more international than some of these other brands.

Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah I believe Depop is actually based in the U.K. if I'm not mistaken. Big presence here in the US though as well but definitely more international presence. You get the exposure to the same market but over in Europe.

Deidre Woollard: I'm not sure if they are as much of a buyer seller all-in-one ecosystem. I'm wondering because Etsy itself is much more buyer-seller differentiated if that's going to impact Depop in any way.

Nicholas Rossolillo: It'll be interesting. Sorry Jeremy go ahead.

Jeremy Bowman: Go ahead Nick. I was just going to say I think like you were saying with Poshmark I think Depop positions itself as a social network/social commerce platform which is cool. There's a social benefit in addition to buying and selling and making some money. I think their interface basically looks like [Meta Platform's] Instagram. That's cool I think it feels familiar and easy to use to people which I think is an advantage for them.

Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah and it is a good fit for Etsy because though it has a different dynamic with the buyer-seller ecosystem it too is a social platform as well. A lot of people use Etsy for that reason exactly: they like being able to interact with who they're buying from who made the item and that merchant that craftsperson that is shipping it to them. This is why I got interested in this whole bigger industry was when Etsy said we're buying Depop because at first I raised my eyebrows. Over $1.6 billion how much revenue is this company doing? $60 million last year? That's a steep price tag. But then you delve deeper into it and it is much more than just the small tiny niche. It has become a lifestyle among especially younger generations. Etsy's a little mum at this point on how many people are using Depop but it would seem like it's a pretty good size platform with a couple of million people buying and selling on it 90% of which are in that early 20s and younger age range which obviously says something on perhaps the longevity of the business model.

Deidre Woollard: Nick you had a note on here about the commission. I know you've been following the commission across all of these different companies. I think it's interesting to think about the aspect of seller doing the work and how much of that is a factor in all of these companies as we think about it going forward. With ThredUp you just shoved the clothes in the bag and send it off with The RealReal you have to usually take the item or ship the item somewhere. Do you think that the seller doing all of the work and having to deal with the individual people in an eBay model is a positive or a negative for Depop?

Nicholas Rossolillo: That's a good question. It probably depends on the person and that's why there's probably room for all these different platforms. Etsy has become a haven for people that want to manage their own small business they want to turn their skill into either a side hustle or a full-blown small business. You can almost do that with Depop as well. It's only a 10 percent commission that's it. There's no listing fee they just simply take a 10% commission of whatever the sale price is. But then you the seller are responsible for it. If you're just trying to make a couple of quick bucks here on the side between the extra work and the lack of authentication process Depop is probably not the platform to go with. If you want to make a living out of reselling clothing and accessories I think this is a fantastic platform. For that alone you get some pretty good support for a pretty low commission especially when you're comparing it against the other players in the field 10% is pretty low.

Jeremy Bowman: Yeah I think Depop too it's worth mentioning. They're not strictly resale I think their scope is a little broader than it might be for some of the other companies they're talking about. I think that also makes them a good fit with Etsy in addition to that direct buyer-seller connection that Nick was talking about. I think that's going to encourage repeat. You're not going to make a Depop account just to sell one thing you're going to be a repeat user. I think in some ways that's an advantage.

Deidre Woollard: I would agree with that too because I think that's one of the reasons that Etsy bought them is that Etsy has been trying to increase the amount of habitual buyers that they have: that's always been an issue for them. It's that people go to Etsy to buy a holiday present or something like that. It's not necessarily where they go all the time. Pandemic changed that a little bit for them because so many people went to go look for masks and then started looking for other things. I think the supply chain issues are something that has been good for Etsy as well as being good for Depop and other brands like that.

Jeremy Bowman: Yeah that's a good point. Etsy was another beneficiary of the supply chain thing if you think of handmade and there's not much of a supply chain for that compared to other larger companies that are global.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9hbGV4YWxpc2l0emEvYm9vay1mb3JlZGdlLXBhaW50aW5ncy10aWt0b2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman Draws Famous Book Scenes On Their Pages,"To realize her masterpieces Maisie created a press that firmly holds the pages together while she skillfully brings scenes from the book to life on its pages.

(Photo credit should read JEFF HAYNES/AFP via Getty Images) JEFF HAYNES | AFP | Getty Images

In September Illinois lawmakers agreed to spend up to $694 million of energy ratepayers' money over the next five years to keep several money-losing nuclear power plants open. Nuclear energy produces no greenhouse gas emissions meaning it can contribute to lowering carbon emissions. But today's nuclear plants often can't compete on price against cheaper existing sources of energy particularly natural gas and government-subsidized renewables. The negotiations in Illinois are a microcosm of a larger debate taking place across the country about the role existing nuclear power plants should play in the clean energy future. For two of the nuclear plants at stake the operator Exelon  had already filed paperwork with federal regulators to shut them down for financial reasons. Lawmakers agreed to pay to keep the nuclear plants open so that Illinois could meet its clean energy goals and Exelon agreed to keep two other marginal nuclear plants in the state open as well. The deal is a culmination of a lot of painstaking negotiations and ""midwestern practicality"" according to Illinois Deputy Governor Christian Mitchell. But not everybody agrees. Illinois gets a much larger percentage of power from nuclear than other states and it would've taken a massive new investment in renewables to meet the state's clean energy goals. In a sense Exelon had the state over a barrel. ""This is now the second round of such subsidies that Illinois is paying out"" explained Steve Cicala a non-resident scholar at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago referring to a previous round included in an energy jobs bill in 2016. ""When this runs out they'll be doing the same 'pay us or the plant gets it' dance.""

The need for nuclear today

The latest battle started in Aug. 2020 when Exelon Generation announced that it would to retire two of its Illinois nuclear power plants in fall 2021. Byron was scheduled to close in September 2021 and Dresden would close in November 2021. Exelon said the plants were losing hundreds of millions of dollars although it declined to disclose exact figures to CNBC. ""Submitting decommissioning paperwork is like a parent dangling their keys and saying 'I'm really leaving...' when their kid doesn't want to put down the video game controller and get in the car"" Cicala said. It can be hard to justify offering government subsidies to a profitable company with a market capitalization of $52 billion. Exelon in total earned $1.2 billion in GAAP profits in the third quarter of 2021 and its Exelon Generation subsidiary which operates the plants earned $607 million. However as is often the case with utilities its results can vary widely — for the first nine months of the year total Exelon earned $1.32 billion and Exelon Generation showed a loss of $247 million both worse than the equivalent period last year.

Exelon says it is unfair to ask it to compete in an open competitive energy market where carbon-emitting energy sources are able to emit their waste into the air for free while nuclear power plants have very strict and expensive waste management regulations to comply with. Meanwhile legislators were anxious to pass a comprehensive energy bill that moves the state toward 100% clean energy by 2050. The two nuclear plants at issue provided nearly 4200 megawatts of power while two others on the edge of viability Braidwood and LeSalle provided another 4700. For reference 1000 megawatts of energy will power a mid-size city according to Bill Gates' book ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster."" To replace that much power with renewables would have required a tremendous amount of new wind and solar construction in the state. The current capacity-weighted average size of a solar farm is 105 megawatts and for wind it is 188 megawatts Jason Ryan spokesperson for American Clean Power a membership organization representing the renewable industry told CNBC. That means the state would've had to construct about 85 solar farms or more than 47 wind farms. If the nuclear power plants were retired now ""renewables wouldn't be ready in time to take their place"" Jack Darin the director of the Sierra Club's Illinois chapter told CNBC. The environmental lobbying group does not support nuclear power as a long-term clean energy solution because of the nuclear waste that is generated among other reasons. But Darin also suggested that building new natural gas plants would be worse in the long run. ""Once a gas plant is built and pipelines are brought in those are very likely to run for decades and decades and pump out carbon pollution"" he said.

Why are nuclear plants losing money?

According to nuclear advocates plants constructed decades ago simply cannot compete on an economic basis with other forms of energy in today's U.S. market. Ultra-cheap natural gas drove energy prices down across the board and nuclear power plants have not been able to cut costs enough to be competitive. ""The trend that you've been seeing across the country of premature nuclear retirements are all entirely about economics"" according to Exelon's Kathleen Barron who oversees government and regulatory affairs for the company. Exelon owns electricity generation facilities throughout the Midwest mid-Atlantic Northeast Texas and California. Of those facilities more than 85% of its output was nuclear in 2020 with natural gas making up most of the rest. All of Exelon's nuclear power plants in Illinois (except the Clinton nuclear plant) hook into PJM which runs the largest electrical grid in the U.S. and operates one of the largest wholesale electricity markets in the world. Power generators bid into the wholesale marketplace and PJM accepts the mix of sources that keeps rates lowest. ""Everyone bids in and then we accept the offers from lowest to highest until we reach the target capacity number we need to reach"" explained PJM spokesperson Jeff Shields. PJM's mix of energy sources has changed over the last 15 years or so with natural gas increasing to about 40% of the total electricity and renewables increasing slightly to sit at 6%. Over the same time coal has consistently decreased over time and now stands at 19%. Along the way nuclear has remained relatively constant at about 35%. While the composite mix has changed the wholesale electricity price has largely remained flat over the last 15 years when adjusted for inflation PJM said. Cicala argues the real problem isn't the total supply of energy but the ability to move power from the rural areas where it's generated to high-demand areas like the city of Chicago. Today there's a surplus of inexpensive wind power in those rural areas — where Exelon's nuclear plants are located — driving prices down. ""The plants would be in a much better financial situation if they could get the prices that power goes for downtown rather than downstate. Investments in high-voltage transmission could solve that problem and be done with it rather than re-creating a crisis every few years and throwing money at it"" Cicala said. ""Ultimately this is a problem of too much supply depressing prices. The nuclear subsidies attempt to fix this problem by encouraging even more supply. It's like thinking that one more flush is going to fix an overflowing toilet.""

Exelon's Barron disagreed. ""While transmission improvements in certain areas would aid the expansion of renewable energy and improve grid reliability they would have no meaningful impact on the underlying market and policy failures that have put nuclear operators at a competitive disadvantage"" said Barron in a statement. ""What we need are state and federal policies that recognize the carbon-free benefits of nuclear energy much as existing policies value the environmental benefits of wind and solar.""

The arbitrator comes in

To enable a fair discussion the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency hired Synapse Energy Economics in January to complete an independent audit of Exelon's financials. ""Everyone had a baseline of agreement — from the governor to the legislature to the environmental groups to our union allies — everyone agreed that we needed to keep the nuclear fleet online. The only question was 'What is going to be a sufficient level of support to allow them to continue to operate?'"" Deputy Governor Mitchell told CNBC. ""That was really where the push was."" A redacted version of the audit is publicly available and CNBC has reviewed a version with fewer redactions but none of the reports contained a precise breakdown of what each plant was losing citing proprietary business information. That's because energy trades on a competitive marketplace and competitors could use that information to just barely undercut Exelon. ""We see this with other utilities and merchant generators so Exelon is not unique"" said Max Chang a principal associate at the auditing firm. ""It would be really nice to improve transparency."" The independent audit did confirm that Exelon was losing money on the plants and recommended a $350 million state subsidy. Exelon disagreed with the number saying the auditor left out some of Exelon's costs and that the report was overly optimistic about where energy prices would trend. Synapse later admitted its projections of energy prices were off. ""As it turns out our estimates of capacity prices are too high for 2022 and 2023 and our estimates of energy prices are too low for 2021 and possibly for 2022"" Chang told CNBC. ""The $694 million was within the bounds of our analysis. The report focused on the 95th percentiles not the maximum values."" Consumer protection advocates agreed the final deal was necessary. ""The most cost-effective way to deal with climate change is just to build on what we've got"" said David Kolata the executive director of the Citizens Utility Board a nonprofit nonpartisan organization that works to protect the interests of consumers. ""It became apparent to folks that you can't at the end of the day cost-effectively reach 100% clean energy if existing nuclear plants close prematurely"" Kolata told CNBC. ""None of this is an argument for a blank check for Exelon or for nuclear"" he added. Another part of the deal says that if federal money becomes available to subsidize existing nuclear fleet then Exelon must apply for those funds and return any money due back to the Illinois ratepayers. ""That made it much easier for us to pass a bill that had this $700 million nuclear support element to it because if the feds do act then there's a strong likelihood that that money will be rebated to or maybe never collected at all from the ratepayers"" said Bill Cunningham the assistant majority leader in the Illinois Senate who was the Democratic point person on the negotiations. That could come into play now that the Democratic-controlled Congress has passed President Biden's infrastructure spending plan and could be on track to pass the larger Build Back Better plan. In the end Exelon won by keeping the plants open Cicala said. While a nuclear plant may lose money at times it's hard to turn on and off — think of it a like a 24-hour convenience store that makes more money at 8 a.m. than it does at 4 a.m. ""Of course given the opportunity to get subsidized by the government the 24/7 store is going to complain about how much money they're losing at 4 a.m."" Cicala told CNBC. ""But there's option value to holding onto the plant if the economics aren't working for them right now — look how quickly gas prices can change!"" Exelon CEO Chris Crane celebrated the deal in the quarterly financial report too calling the legislation a critical milestone. As far as costs to consumers the total subsidy comes down to about 80 cents a month for the average customer according to Exelon's Barron.

Unlikely bedfellows in an imperfect compromise

Although contentious the final agreement involved some unlikely political alliances which offers hope for similar compromises in the long-term transition to carbon-free energy. Some environmental groups do not consider nuclear power to be clean energy because of the carbon emissions necessary to construct a plant and the toxic waste which needs to be stored long-term. But they were willing to join arms with nuclear power generators in order to meet short-term carbon-emission goals for Illinois. Labor unions also wanted to keep the nuclear power plants open because they provide high-paying community-sustaining jobs pitting them against environmental advocates who normally come from the same side of the political spectrum. Pat Devaney the Secretary Treasurer of the Illinois American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) told CNBC organized labor supported the bill and glad to see the nuclear power plants kept online. ""The economies of those whole regions in regards to property tax funding for school and public safety I mean it would have just been decimated entire regions of our state"" if the plants were to have shut down Devaney told CNBC. Environmentalists who wanted the plants shut down think the jobs argument is overblown. ""We dubbed that the nuclear hostage crisis"" said David A. Kraft director of the Nuclear Energy Information Service an anti-nuclear non-profit. ""What we mean by that is you know they would cry economic hardship we're losing money we're gonna close the plants. And wouldn't that be awful — you're going to lose all those jobs."" Kraft does not believe the financial woes of the plants are a reason to give operators subsidies. ""Competent adults plan for their retirement. We think utilities should do the same thing"" Kraft told CNBC. Ultimately Illinois ended up with an imperfect compromise. But the fact that it was possible to reach a compromise in the name of reducing carbon emissions was an accomplishment. ""Even if the bill isn't what we would write if we were kings and queens we've got to move forward"" J.C. Kibbey the clean energy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council for Illinois told CNBC. ""It was on the back of years and years of organizing and education. And that filtered up to putting elected officials in place who understood that how important that existential threat of climate change was"" said Kibbey. ""So as a friend of mine says 'You've just got to do the work.'""

I should preface this article by admitting that I’m not really the type that cares about getting the best possible quality in my home theater system (if you can even call it that). I own a 4K television but only because it was really cheap at Walmart. I have stereo speakers hooked up to a small amp to improve the sound quality a bit too. I also use a Chromecast with Google TV exclusively to access my streaming platforms.

What I’m trying to say is that I’m not too picky when it comes to streaming media.

I purchased the Chromecast with Google TV because I was already using a Chromecast Ultra and I liked the idea of a Google-made TV platform. Plus the $50 price tag and pink-ish Sunrise colorway really sold me on the device.

But lately I’ve been running into an issue with the Chromecast with Google TV that I didn’t foresee happening. I am constantly running out of storage space. I can no longer install new apps on the device without deleting something else. It’s annoying especially because I’m trying to install apps for streaming platforms that I subscribe to.

8GB (but really 4.5GB) is the standard

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

I subscribe to Netflix Hulu Disney Plus Shudder and thanks to a recent T-Mobile promotion Paramount Plus. I use the free version of YouTube a.k.a. the one riddled with advertisements. I also have Spotify Premium. There isn’t enough room on the Chromecast with Google TV to install these seven apps.

The streaming device has 8GB of onboard storage 4.4GB of which are available for app storage. If I want to install another app or install an update to the Chromecast with Google TV I need to go into the settings menu and manually clear the cache on some of the apps I do have installed. Dealing with 4.4GB of onboard storage on my streaming device is like dealing with 2010-level smartphone storage all over again.

The Chromecast with Google TV isn’t the only culprit here. Most budget-friendly streaming devices only have 8GB of storage of which only about 5GB are available to the user.

I do not miss clearing my device's cache in order to install software updates.

There is a way around this. You can expand the storage on the Chromecast with Google TV Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max and other cheaper streaming devices. It just requires a bit of know-how and some extra hardware like a USB-C hub and an SD card.

Don’t get me wrong I’m thankful these cheaper devices offer expandable storage and it’s something I might check out for myself — the Chromecast with Google TV is pretty great otherwise. But maybe it’s just my naiveté that got the best of me but I didn’t think this would be a problem on a device that’s built to house your media-streaming applications. I personally don’t think seven apps is an outrageous number to expect to install without investing more money into the platform.

Or maybe that’s just the way of things. If you want to install more than a handful of apps you either need to get creative and expand your device’s storage or you need to invest more money up front and go with an NVIDIA Shield TV ($150) Amazon Fire TV Cube ($140) or Apple TV 4K ($180). Either way you may be destined to shell out more cash.

How many apps do you have installed on your media-streaming device? 1121 votes 3 or fewer 10 % 3-5 17 % 5-7 19 % 7-10 20 % 10 or more 34 %

I was hesitant to write this article because this seems like the most “first world problem” one could imagine. But I’d rather warn a few readers about streaming device storage issues before they make the same mistake I did. If you’re planning on buying an inexpensive streaming device this holiday season make sure it has enough storage space for all your apps.

This assurance was given by the President to Stabroek News on November 17 by his spokesperson after widespread concerns that the government had allowed the period for the scrutiny of the US$9.5b to expire without appointing an auditing firm.

The PSC said that it welcomed and endorsed the government’s decision to coordinate a group of fully qualified Guyanese auditing companies to participate in conducting this audit.

The statement said that the PSC has taken note of the fact that the pre-2017 Audit was left outstanding for a lengthy period and expects that such a situation is not allowed by any government to ever occur again.

“The PSC wishes to emphasize the fact that the Oil and Gas sector is critical to Guyana’s national development and that every effort should be made by government to ensure its full accountability including comprehensive and timely audits.

“The PSC therefore looks forward to a prompt and transparent audit process of the Exxon expense claims and the PSC expects the full and unqualified cooperation of ExxonMobil in the conduct of this audit” the PSC said.

It encouraged all Guyanese audit companies to participate in this process by where necessary “acquiring sufficient capabilities through joint ventures and partnerships with their local or international counterparts”.

The PSC said it is committed to developing a robust and dynamic private sector as the engine of growth in Guyana where local businesses are able to capitalize on the opportunities that are being presented in the Oil & Gas sector.

“We remain resolute in our support for all activities that will enhance our Private Sector businesses national development and the wellbeing of the Guyanese nation as a whole” the statement added..",,,,,,,,,,,,

Prosecutors allege that Keith Ingersoll and James Adamczyk defrauded an Orlando-area investor of $12 million according to the Orlando Sentinel. The pair was charged with 41 federal crimes including 20 counts of wire fraud as well as conspiracy and money laundering.

Federal investigators say the pair claimed they needed money for deposits to purchase contracts for properties they said they would flip. They instead took the money for themselves and spent it on “luxury cars travel and adult entertainment” among other personal purchases.

They allegedly told the investor that they had entered purchase agreements for those properties and provided the investor with falsified documents purporting to prove it. Yet “as the defendants then and there well knew the owners had not agreed to sell the real estate and in some instances had never been contacted about selling the real estate.”

The two were also involved in a property sale to the Seminole County Tax Collector’s Office that an auditor said “has collusion written all over it.”

Greenberg authorized the office’s $810000 purchase of a bank property from Adamcyzk hours after the latter had bought the property for $680000 according to the Sentinel. Greenberg also hired Ingersoll as a real estate advisor for $48000 despite what auditors called “no evidence of work.”

Greenberg once considered a rising star in central Florida’s Republican scene pleaded guilty in May to sex trafficking of a minor and other federal criminal charges after he admitted he and two other men paid a 17-year-old girl for sex and gave her narcotics.

Federal investigators are also probing whether U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz had sex with that same girl. Greenberg’s plea requires him to cooperate fully with “the investigation and prosecution of other persons” according to the Sentinel.

FedEx the world’s largest delivery company announced on Wednesday Nov. 17 that it was closing its Hong Kong crew base and sending pilots overseas blaming coronavirus restrictions that have left “no clear date” for when the city would return to normalcy.

The move is the latest setback to Hong Kong’s status as a global logistics powerhouse as severe travel restrictions and rigorous quarantine procedures isolate the city from the rest of the globe. FedEx’s system chief pilot Robin Sebasco claimed the airline needed to “adapt” to the global economic regulatory and business environment in a company document indicating that a January decision to relocate its pilots out of the city was now permanent.

Industry stakeholders said the move reflected the government’s strict quarantine policies making it an increasingly difficult operating environment for businesses though the decision was seen as unlikely to affect FedEx’s flights into and out of the city which are largely operated by pilots based in California. While Hong Kong has experienced almost no local coronavirus infections for months as part of its zero-Covid strategy the mandated 21-day hotel quarantine for anyone returning from various countries means the city is effectively cut off from the rest of the globe even as the rest of the world reopens.

FedEx confirmed this in a statement with a spokesperson stating that the business would “continue to retain its operations in Hong Kong which are crucial to our Asia-Pacific and global network.” She went on to say that closing the local pilot base will “enable us to continue to staff our Hong Kong and Asia flights without being subject to Hong Kong immigration restrictions.”

Cathay Pacific unlike FedEx takes a different method.

Cathay’s View

Cathay Pacific is also a key shareholder in Hong Kong International Airport’s Asia Airfreight Terminal. FedEx Pilots from Hong Kong routinely traveled to Guangzhou to operate cargo flights from FedEx’s regional hub. Similarly Cathay Pacific is considering relocating pilots outside of the city for up to four months in order to work around the city’s rigorous quarantine requirements.

The government recently tightened exemptions for local cargo pilots after three Cathay Pacific flight crew members were confirmed to be sick with Covid-19 in Frankfurt where a suspected outbreak occurred at the crew’s hotel. Earlier on Wednesday Elsa Yuen May-yee president of the Hong Kong Logistics Association warned that the government’s recent decision to require 130 Cathay Pacific aircrew to undergo 21 days of mandatory quarantine after returning from Frankfurt would have a negative impact on the sector especially given the increased demand during the Christmas and New Year holidays.

Its’ Plan

Cathay Pacific will require all aircrew exempt from Hong Kong’s tight quarantine protocols to self-isolate and avoid gatherings upon their return even as it plans a drastic contingency plan to base pilots overseas for months at a time to bolster up personnel. It is currently polling pilots to gauge their enthusiasm in the new contingency which would see them transferred outside of Hong Kong quarantined in between flights to and from the city and kept out of the local community – and away from their families – for four months at a period.

Pilots are being asked if they would want to be located in Dubai Anchorage Chicago or other unspecified sites on both coasts of the United States. The new strategy is viewed as a workaround for Hong Kong’s tough anti-epidemic efforts which are causing the airline’s aircraft operations to become unstable.

Cathay Pacific announced the “increased” self-isolation regulations to its employees on Monday night with the measures slated to go into force on Wednesday. Three Cathay freight pilots who were exempt from quarantine upon arrival later tested positive for the coronavirus days later after re-entering Hong Kong. As a result of the pilots who tested positive there is a greater emphasis on crew conduct during stopovers. All three had spent layovers at the Hyatt Regency Mainz a hotel near Frankfurt Germany’s international airport.

With that exemption potentially jeopardized as a result of the recent infections Cathay has encouraged pilots from all of its cargo and passenger fleets to express their interest in its relocation contingency from ports other than Hong Kong. The airline stated that the relocation plan may begin as early as January 2022 or it might be scrapped entirely if judged unnecessary.

""America brought us the American Dream. We got a house here. It’s been amazing. The fact that he came and put our flag up is great"" Matthews North Carolina homeowner Karla Cruz - who immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico - told WJZY after watching the video of the FedEx driver hanging the flag outside her home.

The scene was caught on a Ring security camera and shows the driver looping back to the fallen flag after dropping off a package on Cruz’s porch. He then salutes the flag.

""I was like ‘Oh he’s gonna fix the flag that’s a really kind act'"" Cruz told WJZY after watching the video.

""And then he salutes it and my heart melts. I thought ‘maybe he’s a veteran’"" Cruz continued.

Cruz 20 came to the U.S. when she was 4-years-old and said the flag represents her family’s journey to the U.S.

""We came here and we adore Mexico. But we adore this country and the opportunities it brought our family"" she said.

SIMONS ISLAND Ga. -- Darn right Talor Gooch has a chip on his shoulder.

Gooch comes from a long line of Oklahoma State players to make it to the PGA Tour and when the current crop is discussed recent PGA Tour winners Viktor Hovland and Matthew Wolff usually enter the conversation first.

But here’s Gooch underrated in his mind after three consecutive years of making the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup playoffs earning nearly $3 million last year with three top-10s and eight top-25s (including a tie for fifth in The Players Championship) and a fall season with six-of-six made cuts two more top-10s and on the verge of cracking 50th on the world golf rankings at 52nd.

Putting power:Denny McCarthy churns out nearly 158 feet of putts in surging from behind in the RSM Classic

Love and Soul:How Davis Love III's taste for barbecue helped a St. Simons Island institution

That’s why a victory on Sunday in the RSM Classic is so crucial to validating his confidence and the work he's put in.

Gooch took a huge step towards that under more severe weather conditions on Saturday firing a steady 67 at the Sea Island Club Seaside Course to take a three-shot lead over Seamus Power and Sebastian Munoz at 16-under-par 196.

Gooch will play in the final group with two players who recently broke the ice on capturing their first PGA Tour titles Power (67) a native of Ireland who won the Barbosal Classic last summer and Munoz (69) a native of Colombia who won the 2019 Sanderson Farms Championship.

History might be on Gooch’s side: Seven RSM Classic winners in 11 years have made it their first PGA Tour victory.

“I want to be the best and I want to compete against the best and I want to be the best Oklahoma State golfer on Tour” he said. “Everyone talks about Matt Wolff and Viktor Hovland … rightfully so. They're incredible players. But that’s always a nice little something to kind of get you to work a little bit harder be a little bit more diligent and try to prove them wrong.”

Gooch shook off missing eight fairways and put some distance on Power and Munoz with a 5-foot birdie putt at the par-5 15th hole and a 12-footer at the par-3 17th after lasering a 7-iron through the wind from 185 yards out.

“What you're trying to do out there is avoid bogeys” said Gooch who shot 67 in the final round of the Players in Mar. “It would have been easy today at times to just really get conservative and really be defensive.”

Power chipped in for eagle at the 15th to help get in the final group and Munoz weathered bogeys at Nos. 11 and 12 to birdie the 15th.

Tom Hoge (67) is fourth at 12-under and Luke List (66) 2016 RSM champion Mackenize Hughes of Canada (70) and Scott Stallings (69) are tied at 11-under.

Making a big move in the third round was Webb Simpson (66) who birdied the final hole on a 6-foot putt and moved into a tie for eighth at 10-under. Simpson who has lost the RSM Classic in playoffs twice also holed out a 95-yard wedge shot for eagle at the par-4 13th.

Denny McCarthy who reached the PGA Tour by winning the 2018 Korn Ferry Tour Championship at the Atlantic Beach Country Club staged a clinic by one-putting his first eight greens and 12 of his first 13 to post the best round of the day with a 65."

Toledo Ballet will stage its 81st production of “The Nutcracker” the longest-running annual production in the nation to be held in December. This year’s production presented by Fifth Third Bank will span across five public performances on Friday Dec. 10 at 11 a.m. for a special school show and 7 p.m. for the first performance Saturday Dec. 11 at 2 P.M. and 7 p.m. and Sunday Dec. 12 at 2 p.m. Last year’s performances were virtual only. This year Toledo Ballet returns to the Stranahan Theater and is offering both in-person and livestreaming tickets.

“All of us at the Toledo Ballet are eagerly awaiting the 81st annual Nutcracker” says Lisa Mayer-Lang Artistic Director for Toledo Ballet. “The excitement and buzz in the air is always palpable once Nutcracker auditions begin and lasts until the weekend of performances. We’re hoping for a ‘regular’ Nutcracker year with full audiences so that we are able to reach as many people as possible in person.”

Toledo Ballet’s Nutcracker is a long-standing holiday tradition that tells the magical story of a young girl her Nutcracker Prince and their adventures with toy soldiers mice dancing snowflakes and a Sugar Plum Fairy in the dazzling Land of Sweets. To honor the life and work of the late Marie Bollinger-Vogt Founder and Artistic Director Emerita of Toledo Ballet the lead role will be Marie rather than the traditional Clara in the production.

“I am so excited for this year’s ‘Nutcracker!’” says Zak Vassar President & CEO of the Toledo Alliance for the Performing Arts. “We were so proud to perform it last December and continue our streak as the longest-running Nutcracker production in the nation. However the pandemic forced us to dance for cameras only and our audiences were left cheering in front of their screens. This year is different. We can welcome audiences back to the Stranahan once again to delight in the wonder of this holiday classic. I think this will make Christmas feel a little more ‘normal’ and connect us with the customs of previous holiday seasons.”

Guest appearances in this year’s production include Cincinnati Ballet Principal dancers Melissa Gelfin De-Poli as the Snow Queen and Sugar Plum Fairy and Rafael Quenedit Castro as the Snow King and Cavalier.

“I am filled with happiness that this season I will be returning to dance with Toledo Ballet in ‘The Nutcracker’” says Melissa Gelfin De-Poli guest artist in this year’s production of “The Nutcracker.”

“In 2019 when I first shared the stage with Toledo Ballet I immediately felt so connected to the entire team! Lisa Mayer-Lang and Michael Lang have created an incredibly special environment that radiates through the dancers and the performances. I was gutted to have missed out on last year’s production due to COVID protocols that I needed to adhere to. This year will be a very happy return and I can hardly wait for December to arrive!”

Each year Toledo Ballet selects two students to perform the role of Marie (formerly known as Clara) in its annual production. Toledo Ballet is proud to announce that Hayden Graham and Charlotte Sexton will perform the role of Marie in this year’s performances.

“I’m very excited to be performing the role of Marie this year in Toledo Ballet’s 81st annual ‘Nutcracker’” says Hayden Graham Toledo Ballet dancer. “My favorite scene of Marie’s has to be the party scene! It is so fun to perform together with all of my friends. I’m so thankful for this opportunity. Ever since I was little I have dreamed of being Marie one day hoping that I could help inspire others to start dancing as well.”

“From the first time I saw ‘The Nutcracker’ at 3 years old I knew my dream was to perform on stage as Marie” says Charlotte Sexton Toledo Ballet dancer. “I feel so honored and proud to be able to bring that same magic to this year’s performance. I’m most looking forward to dancing in the Party Scene. I am speechless and beyond excited to be a part of this year’s 81st ‘Nutcracker’ with the Toledo Ballet.”

Big fines,"Attention airline passengers: Your captain kindly requests you fasten your seatbelts keep your masks on – and this holiday season please don't be that air traveler from hell.

It's stressful catching planes and dealing with family members but tempers can run short amid the lingering COVID-19 pandemic.

Responding to a spike in unruly passenger incidents airline regulator the Federal Aviation Administration in early 2021 adopted a ""zero-tolerance"" policy that skipped warning letters and went straight to stiff fines turning around planes and calling law enforcement.

So far this year more than 5100 ""unruly passenger"" incidents have been reported prompting nearly 1000 investigations and more than $1 million in fines. The FAA periodically offers descriptions of its most dire incidents with unruly passengers but doesn't identify flyers hit with fines.

With more than 4 million air passengers expected to slam U.S. airports this Thanksgiving airlines are asking that you plan ahead arrive a little early follow safety and health instructions exercise patience and generally avoid losing your sh... uh composure.

Specifically kindly refrain from protesting mask policy on a crowded flight at the top of your lungs. Do not punch that flight attendant. Do not threaten fellow passengers. And please only urinate in the toilet.

Here are some incidents involving unidentified passengers from airports serving the Greater Cincinnati region:

Mask rules piss you off? Cross your legs and consider a strongly-worded letter

Masks are required on your face on airplanes and at airports until at least Jan 31. Right now it's effectively the law. The FAA reports that more than 7 out of 10 unruly passenger incidents were mask-related.

On April 29 an Allegiant Airlines passenger on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron refused to wear a mask and clashed with flight attendants. He later registered his vehement disagreement with the federal rule by urinating all over the bathroom floor which leaked into the galley area.

The result was a $10500 fine.

Wear the mask; don't threaten or hit new moms

On Feb. 19 a female passenger on a Republic Airlines plane preparing to fly from Indianapolis to Philadelphia was kicked off her flight and fined $18500.

The unruly passenger repeatedly disregarded instructions to wear her mask or her seat belt. She disrupted the preflight safety announcements and the cabin check by playing loud obscene music. She also threatened a new mother holding a baby for closing her window shade.

During the taxi the captain turned the plane around back to the boarding gate. When the captain left the cockpit and told the passenger they were being removed from the plane the woman cussed the pilot out as she left. She also punched the mother in the back of the head while she held her infant.

Don't back your friends up too far

That Republic flight was eventful. The woman who punched the mom had a friend who also disregarded safety instructions disrupted takeoff prep and argued with the captain.

The price of her moral support: a $10000 fine.

Seriously no fighting and don't double down

After getting busted for smoking in the bathroom on an Allegiant Air flight from Lexington to Fort Lauderdale on Jan 21 a passenger briefly tussled with other travelers on their return flight three days later. She cussed out crew members after they moved her to another seat.

Her fine: $16700.

Don't kick other passengers either

On March 20 a passenger on an American Airlines flight from Cancun to Indianapolis grew so agitated with the traveler seated behind them that they stood up during the descent and kicked and stomped their feet.

Police were summoned to greet the passenger who was later slapped with a $9000 fine.

The planned implosion at 420 Main St. took less than half a minute. A rapid series of deafening blasts — bang! bang! bang! — took down the 18-story office tower promptly at 7 a.m.

For subscribers:Implosion of Evansville's 420 Main tower will be a spectacle. Its construction was too.

The building's lower section containing its parking garage collapsed first. Upper floors followed. Hundreds of onlookers gathered at safe distances across Downtown cheered as a cloud of smoke enveloped the scene.

Contractors said the dust did not contain harmful chemicals because all asbestos was removed from the building beforehand. Most of the 18000 tons of rubble left will be crushed and reused in the redevelopment of the site.

A thunderstorm would have delayed the process contractors said beforehand but they welcomed the light rain that fell Sunday morning. They said it would help quell the dust and maybe convince more people to watch on TV or a livestream.

Some however braved the weather to witness the rare event in person.

Miki Baughman drove in from Wadesville to watch with her 8-year-old son Calyer. ""Very cool!"" Calyer said summing up the experience.

The tower housed Old National Bank's headquarters from 1970 to 2004. After ONB moved out the tower's occupancy dropped its condition deteriorated and efforts to rehabilitate it did not materialize.

Reitz High School seniors in Jon Carl's Feel the History class watched from different locations; they are doing a project about the tower. Ava Roblero and Piper Weythman filmed from another Downtown building.

""You could feel the building shake as (the tower) came down"" Roblero said.

Neil Chapman's law firm was the last tenant at 420 Main. He had a party Sunday morning to watch the implosion in his new office in the Fifth Third Center which at 15 stories is now the city's tallest structure.

People from all over the U.S. and the world watched livestreams of the implosion recorded by Chapman the Courier & Press and other media.

""It was surreal almost cataclysmic"" Chapman said. ""We hosted a party with 50-60 people and I don't think anyone came out of it without a feeling of having witnessed history.""

There seemed to be little mournful nostalgia in Evansville for the 420 Main building but Chapman was an exception. He worked there for a decade occupying a suite that Old National Bank's top brass once used.

""It was where bank presidents would put up their feet and read the Wall Street Journal"" Chapman said.

The implosion will make way for a new project on the block — a retail and apartment development that will top out at four stories. Property owner Domo is leading that endeavor which is being called Fifth & Main.

Like others who witnessed Sunday morning's implosion Chapman marveled at its precision and seemingly flawless execution.

""This was a man-made structure 18 stories tall and to see it come down suddenly and violently within seconds is amazing"" Chapman said. ""It brings out your inner 8-year-old."""

The project saw 2700 carport solar panels installed throughout the school's parking lots providing power to a battery system that will stores energy for heating cooling and providing electricity.

The improvements will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to near zero eliminating the emission of approximately 277 tons of carbon a year. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held Nov. 2.

""There was will at the executive levels of the school board to engage in this project and that's really what allowed it to come about"" said Peter Cassidy principal at John Paul II.

Cassidy understands that it can be difficult for school boards ""to engage in projects that exceed the basic requirements"" because of funding issues but said he is proud of the board for making it happen. The London District Catholic School Board funded more than half of the project which cost 9.7 million Canadian dollars (US$7.7 million) with the federal government contributing $4.8 million.

To catch a glimpse of the next total solar eclipse on December 4 sky gazers will have to trek to the icy continent of Antarctica. University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Astronomy (IfA) Astronomer Shadia Rifai Habbal and her eclipse team the Solar Wind Sherpas are one of a small handful of scientific teams traveling to the remote South Pole to carry out scientific observations. The 14-member team is busy testing equipment before they depart Hawaiʻi on November 22 and 24.

They’ve chased eclipses around the globe however this winter - for the first time - their only observing option is at sea and their plan is to conduct studies from a cruise ship.

“The Sun is the closest star we can study in detail and it’s really our gateway to other stars” said Habbal. “So anything we can learn about the Sun and its outer atmosphere the corona impacts a tremendous part of astronomy and many other fields in astronomy.”

A Solar Wind Sherpa first

Habbal has led her team on 16 eclipse expeditions across the world but this will be the first one they’ll study while on water. The team has prepared by testing equipment aboard the Majestic a 150-foot yacht belonging to local company Atlantis Cruises. To operate on a swaying boat deck scientific equipment must be mounted on stabilizing platforms. Weather conditions during the December expedition will also play a major factor in the quality of observations.

During a total solar eclipse the Sun Moon and Earth align. It’s a sight that supercharges IfA graduate student Sage Constantinou. The upcoming event will mark his third eclipse expedition.

“It’s unlike anything you can imagine. The whole sky goes dark everything gets cold. You wouldn’t think instantaneously the air temperature drops” Constantinou said. “All the animals in the region just start freaking out birds dogs everything. The sky just lights up with the Sun’s corona.”

How eclipse observations reveal impacts to Earth

Observations of the awe-inspiring event can help broaden understanding of space weather and enhance GPS and satellite communications. During the 2020 eclipse in Argentina the team discovered a solar eruption that formed a double bubble shape. They observed how it triggered measurable changes in the temperature distribution and density of the Sun’s corona. These events originating on the Sun’s surface can devastate the world’s power grid and impact astronauts in orbit so fully understanding their nature is important.

There are many ways to study the solar corona from spacecraft to ground-based solar telescopes but solar eclipses provide a superior opportunity. Even amateur data from consumer-grade cameras can produce scientifically useful imaging. In the past Habbal and her team have combined their findings with amateur data- however there’s little chance of that this round given the remoteness of this eclipse.

Leandro Leviste 28 will seek to raise as much as $54 million by selling shares in Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corp. a unit of his Solar Philippines Power Project Holdings Inc.

The funds will go toward constructing the first phase of a 500-megawatt plant in a province about 81 miles north of Manila. That would increase the country's solar capacity by almost 50% and be able to power about 800000 homes when completed. The offering comes as the Philippines haltingly moves away from fossil fuels.

""Solar is no longer a marginal piece of the energy mix but will comprise a majority of new capacity"" Leviste the chief executive officer said in an interview.

The offering period for the unit will be Dec. 1 to Dec. 7 with trading beginning Dec. 17 on the Philippine Stock Exchange.

Leviste's mother is Loren Legarda deputy speaker of the House of Representatives and a former candidate for vice president. His father was the governor of Batangas province outside Manila.

Leviste founded Solar Philippines in 2013 after selling the shares in Tesla Motors Inc. and SolarCity Corp. he bought while attending Yale University. He was convinced that solar power could lower electricity prices for the islands but progress has been slow.

The archipelago ranked 42nd of 114 nations in solar capacity at the end of 2020 according to BloombergNEF data. Its challenges include a shortage of land and transmission capabilities compounded by delays implementing renewable energy policies said Caroline Chua a BNEF analyst.

The country aspires to get at least 35% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 compared with about 24% in 2020 but it's unclear how binding that target is Chua said. Coal power doubled to 54% of the mix last year from 27% in 2009 according to BNEF.

""They have been slipping further and further away from the target because of how much coal they've built in the last decade"" Chua said. ""If they're serious about meeting it they do need to build a lot of renewables.""

Last year the government declared a moratorium on building new coal-fired power plants. At the recent COP26 summit it partially backed a pledge to shift away from coal and joined an Asian Development Bank-backed plan to shut some plants early.

Meanwhile its massive Malampaya gas field could stop pumping as soon as 2026 requiring utilities to import expensive cargoes of liquefied natural gas.

Solar Philippines' strategy is to partner with large power companies and rent out land for others to build solar farms on. The company has cobbled together options on about 24711 acres that could hold about 10 gigawatts of solar capacity he said.

That could mean trying to work with erstwhile competitors. Philippine power giants AC Energy Corp. and Manila Electric Co. have both made recent moves into solar.

The company operates about 200 megawatts of solar now and is planning another 800 megawatts to be constructed in the next year according to Leviste.

""The Philippines is an exciting place for the renewable transition because of the high price of conventional generation sources"" he said. ""Solar can go mainstream here faster than in countries with lower power prices.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhcm1wcm9ncmVzcy5jb20vY29tbWVudGFyeS9zb21lLXN0aWxsLW9wcG9zZS1pZGVhLW9mLXNvbGFyLXRha2luZy1vdXQtZmFybWxhbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some still oppose idea of solar taking out farmland,"We invited readers to weigh in on the solar debate with this editorial that also ran in the November issue of Indiana Prairie Farmer. However we laid down ground rules: Any replies needed to be civil. So far those picking up the conversation are complying.

The fact is that at least two large solar installations are either under or near construction in Indiana with several more approved or in the discussion stage. We will continue to explore the pros and cons of these installations. We look forward to your comments — just remember the ground rules.

This letter to the editor was written jointly by Connie Ehrlich and Gail Lambert. Ehrlich lives in Lafayette but owns farmland in Pulaski County Ind. and is the fourth generation involved in agriculture. Two of the proposed projects are close to Lambert’s home in Pulaski County. Her grandson is the sixth generation to live on a section of the family farm. The letter was edited to meet space requirements.

Letter to the editor

Dear editor:

Thank you for your willingness to have a discussion regarding large commercial solar energy systems on ag land. Few people are willing to look past the potential opportunity for money to see the impact large scale solar will have in our communities.

Solar energy generation is a poor source of energy for multiple reasons. Solar energy has one of the lowest efficiency ratings of renewable energy sources. Multiple sources state an 11% to 15% energy rate for solar. The highest efficiency rating we found was 21%. Solar and wind are not reliable sources to produce energy which we require 24/7/365. Very little if any is produced when the sun isn’t shining and the wind stops blowing. We need more reliable sources of energy.

Nuclear energy is a clean renewable and reliable source of energy with an extremely high efficiency rate. However the federal government is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to promote solar and wind generation with very little mention of nuclear generation. Why?

Solar energy requires more land per megawatt with only hydro being worse. Solar takes approximately 9.3 acres to produce 1 megawatt. Nuclear energy requires a small fraction of land to produce the same megawatts and is far more dependable and predictable.

Northern Indiana is one of the lowest areas for sun exposure with only 10 states with less sun exposure. On average northern Indiana has only 83 days of sunshine per year. It will require more solar panels and land in states with less sun exposure.

Solar and wind generation will create a horrendous issue with disposal of solar panels and wind turbines in the very near future. Currently the U.S. does not have an answer to properly dispose of solar panels. Studies show life expectancy is approximately 40% less than originally forecast. Technology will also cause solar panels to become obsolete.

Solar developers state their panels will not contain any toxic materials. However solar panels are considered hazardous material and currently not allowed in landfills. An attorney for NextEra recently stated during a public hearing that she has faith in the private sector that a solution will be found to dispose of them. Doral Renewables an Israeli company has installed solar panels for 13 years abroad and says they don’t have an answer to the waste created by this clean renewable energy source.

Project details

Mammoth Solar is claiming its first U.S. solar project planned for Starke and Pulaski counties will be the largest in the U.S. producing 1.3 gigawatts involving 13000 acres of farmland.

Moss Creek Solar LLC recently received approval from Pulaski County’s Board of Zoning Appeals for its solar project generating 200 megawatts and removing another 1600 acres from crop production. To date 10381 acres have received approval from the BZA. The county has received calls from up to nine other solar developers.

Pro-solar “yaysayers” claim farmers have the right to do whatever they want with their ground. However their property rights end when their decisions affect neighboring properties and limit their neighbors’ opportunities to successfully utilize their property. Some rural homes will be surrounded on one two or three sides by solar panels. Do solar landowners have the right to negatively impact neighboring property values?

Solar developers use the Cohn Reznick study to justify their claim that property values will not be negatively impacted. That study cites significantly smaller solar installations and locations are not comparable. Isn’t protecting all landowners’ property rights one of the major reasons we have zoning laws?

Pulaski County and many other counties’ ordinances do not limit the number of acres that could be removed from agriculture for solar energy. Solar-friendly ordinances make those counties easy targets for solar developers … who prey on financially struggling counties.

One major issue of removing large acreages from crop production is the “ripple effect” on local businesses and communities that support agriculture. Counties are quick to accept solar applications without conducting economic impact studies. Pulaski County is a rural community which depends on ag and supporting ag businesses. Removing over 10300 acres will negatively affect most local businesses.

Solar energy generation is not the best use of prime farmland groomed and developed for crop production. Many acres have tiles wells and irrigation systems. Solar developers pitch the idea that the ground needs rest. It is questionable if the ground will be suitable for crop production after 30-plus years of “resting.”

Solar developers’ land contracts are very long. One contract is 30 years with a renewal clause for an additional 30 years at the sole discretion of the solar developer. The landowner had lost control of their ground for potentially 60 years.

Tim Pingley regional external affairs consultant for FirstEnergy said this was the third check First Energy has given to the project.

“We have done this for the past couple of years so we’re happy to be able to continue the tradition and support the arts here in downtown Buckhannon” Pingley said. “I think it’s great for the town and Upshur County as a whole. It’s amazing what’s going on here and the work that’s been done by Bryson (Van Nostrand city architect and president of ART26201) and the town council I think it has really helped to develop downtown Buckhannon.”

FirstEnergy has donated a total $15000 over the last three years.

“It’s been amazing. I’ve been here on and off over the past three years and I’ve seen the growth of this building from the start and all the progress that has been made. It’s just fantastic” Pingley said. “We’re hoping this will help with the educational programs that are going to benefit the students of the community who come here and work on a day-to-day basis.”

Bryson Van Nostrand president of ART26201 said this particular donation will most likely go toward installing façade panels to the theater.

“The Colonial Art Center Board of Directors will have to talk about how they want to use the money but I think will go to the facade installation” Van Nostrand said. “We’ve gotten most of the material for the facade panels and we’ve been waiting. We raised a little bit of money privately about a month ago.”

He said back in the 1930s the building had horizontal white panels with red stripes so they hope to match that historic look.

“We’ve been spending a lot of time trying to work out the operations of the building how it will be run how many people will be here who’s being paid who’s a volunteer and what kind of programming is being developed” Van Nostrand said. “Our programming policy lays out who gets priority to use the space and the highest use of the whole property is for education of the arts for youth.”

He noted Buckhannon City Council and Upshur County Board of Education recently posted separate new job descriptions for positions within the building.

“The council voted last night (Thursday Nov. 18) to proceed with posting the position for the managing director of the facility and the Board of Education has posted their position for a full-time art teacher in the building designing programs and teaching programs” Van Nostrand said. “Between those two full-time people plus the artists in their teaching studios downstairs we expect this to be a hub of creative thought and activity.”

The Colonial Arts Center restoration project is partnership between the City of Buckhannon ART26201 and Buckhannon Community Theatre.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvbGlvbnMvMjAyMS8xMS8yMS9kZXRyb2l0LWxpb25zLWdhbWUtY2xldmVsYW5kLWJyb3ducy1iZXN0LXBob3Rvcy0yMDIxLzg3MTEzODMwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cleveland Browns 13 Detroit Lions 10: Best photos from Cleveland,"Cleveland Browns 13 Detroit Lions 10: Best photos from Cleveland

As it turns out it was because one of Dan Campbell’s players “said something about somebody’s mother.”

The Lions coach briefly explained why Detroit was given a 15-yard penalty between the third and fourth quarters after a 13-10 loss to the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. Though he didn’t explain what offensive lineman Jonah Jackson said specifically it was directed at Browns defensive end Jadeveon Clowney's mother.

""I don’t know what to tell you"" Campbell said via the Detroit Free Press. ""It was something that is said. It was something about somebody’s mother OK? And there was a lot of talking going on out there but so it was a penalty.""

The penalty was enforced between downs which pushed the Lions back into their own territory to start the fourth quarter — and eventually led them to punt.

The Lions made a solid push at the end of the game and nearly escaped Cleveland with their first win of the season. After falling into a 13-0 hole at halftime D’Andre Swift scored on a massive 57-yard touchdown run and Aldrick Rosas kicked a 43-yard field goal in the fourth quarter after an interception to bring Detroit within three points.

That was as close as the Lions could get.

Backup quarterback Tim Boyle started in place of an injured Jared Goff and went 15-of-23 for 77 yards and two interceptions. Swift ran for a career-high 136 yards to keep the Lions in it as long as he could.

""It hurt"" Campbell said of the penalty via the Free Press. ""And look he knows it. He knows it. He knew it when it came off but there was a lot of talking going on. And as a matter of fact while I’m getting told that I’m hearing talking. But that’s part of it.""

While the end result can't be blamed on whatever Jackson said his penalty was certainly a costly and unusual one. He said he apologized after the game to Clowney too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoZWFzdG9oaW9wYXJlbnQuY29tL3dvcnRoLW5vdGluZy9jbGV2ZWxhbmQtYnJvd25zLWp1bmlvci1yZXBvcnRlci1hbm5vdW5jZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cleveland Browns' Junior Reporter Announced -,"Six-year-old Katie from Avon is this year’s winner of the Cleveland Browns Junior Reporter Sweepstakes presented by Wendy’s.

The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) on Friday commended the Medical Director of Federal Medical Centre Lokoja (FMCL) Dr Olatunde Alabi for his outstanding performance as one of the best Corps Employers in Kogi State.

The state NYSC Coordinator Pastor Mrs Mofoluwaso Williams stated this while presenting a Letter of Commendation to Alabi during the 2021 Corps Employers’

The Workshop was tagged: ”Optimizing the NYSC and Corps Employers’ Partnership for National Development in the Context of the New Normal”.

”The management and staff of NYSC Kogi State wish to commend you for your outstanding performance as one of the best Corps Employers in Kogi State.

”This commendation is in recognition of your immense contribution and support for the development of NYSC in the state.

”It is hoped that this commendation would further spur your organization to continue to collaborate with the noble Scheme in Kogi State and sound a wake up call to other corps Employers” Williams said.

The coordinator explained that the medical director had helped the NYSC to equip their clinic with many equipment that were lacking.

She added that the FMCL had also been sending medical personnel to NYSC clinic at every Orientation course to run the clinic and give supervisory role to our corps doctors.

”Dr Alabi comes to camp every week to monitor the medical personnel and has keep donating drugs to the clinic during the orientation course.

”The medical director is a father and employs the largest corps members in Kogi State.

”Once they come to him he employs them and he has been retaining the corps members that did well during the one year mandatory service” she said..

She therefore urged other employers to emulate the gesture saying ”doctor Alabi is an outstanding employer to beat”.

Responding to the commendation Alabi thanked the NYSC coordinator for the honour saying ”it is a nice award which is just showing the role that FMC Lokoja is playing in the state and also in the health sector.

”So it is heartwarming to commend the FMC Lokoja for the role playing in keeping corps members and make them happy while they are serving in Kogi State.

”Some of the corps members that are fortunate are part of our work force because when they come to serve and distinguished themselves and there is opportunity; we gracefully employ them.

”Some of them are still here they came to Kogi to serve but they didn’t go back again. They also like the environment” he said.

Alabi noted he did his own youth service in 1991 in Ogu in Enugu State where they had their orientation course and his primary assignment in Aguata LGA.

Alabi said that he had a wonderful time during his service year saying he was retained immediately after his service and work for over ten years in the state

”I am product of youth service so whatever I become today the Scheme has contributed immensely to it.

”The relationship between FMC Lokoja and NYSC has been very long and cordial. Our duty is that any corp members that is posted to our hospital we make them happy.

”Though the economic climate is not easy now we try to do the best while the corpers are with us because it is just one year mandatory service so we make them happy” Alabi said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Special to The Desert Sun

""Harry Bennett had been watching his back trail most of his life but finally — atop a winding driveway on a high knoll in Desert Hot Springs — he could rest. He picked up his binoculars and scoped his kingdom. The long views in every direction would reveal a car's dust trail miles before anyone could reach him. Assured he was safe Bennett settled behind his easel and gazed at San Jacinto peak across the valley.""

So starts another fascinating tale written by Ann Japenga this time about Harry Bennett. Japenga's writings bring desert artists into focus obscure and famous. Bennett qualifies as both — and much more.

Japenga's musing continues: ""Picking up his paintbrush he leaned in just inches from the canvas to accommodate his failing eyesight. In this pose he felt powerful again — as he had felt in Detroit when he was Henry Ford's enforcer an heir to the Ford Company throne known by the nicknames 'The Little Giant' or 'Little Fella.' With his horses pacing in the corral below Bennett relaxed into the simple rhythm of landscape painting.""

""He'd always had a rich fantasy life and now he could imagine he was an exceptional western artist like Charles Marion Russell. The Old West had plenty of room for bad guys with hearts of gold and Bennett was a bad guy by any measure. 'America's Most Reviled Corporate Thug' a headline once called him.""

Japenga's full article may be found on her California Desert Art website where she reveals decades of research by writer Thomas DeWald about Bennett. DeWald explores Bennett's life before art when he was working for Ford. He built weird and exotic retreats what DeWald calls his ""ninja houses"" including a Gothic castle near Ypsilanti a pagoda boathouse on an island in the Detroit River a log-shaped cement bunker and a compound in Desert Hot Springs. He kept lions as pets practiced shooting in his basement office and made sure his outposts featured escape tunnels gun turrets trap doors hidden passageways and even a moat.

Bennett first arrived on the desert in 1939 taking a room at the El Mirador Hotel in Palm Springs. According to Japenga he promptly rented a horse from McDonald Stables on Ramon Road and when ""his horse climbed up out of the Araby wash and into the mountains Bennett must have had a revelation: Here he could escape the cold and the killing and live like a cowboy.""

Bennett returned in 1940 to supervise the work on a new hideout to be built on 80 acres of land given to him by Henry Ford just outside of Desert Hot Springs in a place then called Seven Palms Valley. The site was remote enough not to require a moat. Nevertheless Bennett's usual security precautions were taken. Curious strangers were definitely not welcome.

Once the leading contender to run Ford Motor company Bennett lost the power struggle for control and by 1945 he was living full-time in his new desert digs. The house was ""way out in the middle of nowhere"" accordingly to DeWald. ""There was the B-Bar-H (Ranch) and Janet Gaynor lived nearby. Harry's place was way way out.""

Bennett called his desert compound S-Star Ranch derived from his name and his wife's Esther: Est-Har or S-Star. It was certainly isolated. There was no telephone. Armed guards with dogs patrolled the surrounding washes. Shots were fired into the air warning people to stay clear. Secrecy and security shrouded his presence a lifetime of those habits being hard to break even in the remote desert.

Bennett had numerous underworld associations cultivated over decades of awful and now unlawful activities. ""A parade of Detroit ex-cons and gangsters came to ride horses and play cowboy at the getaway on the hill."" Many believe the myth of Al Capone hiding out in Desert Hot Springs actually got its start due to Bennett's presence and infamous bad acts.

Japenga notes the ""juxtaposition of evil and family life gives a Sopranos feeling to Harry Bennett's story. Like Tony Soprano — who could dismember a guy and then dash home for ziti — Bennett maintained a respectable veneer despite a tendency to torture people with pliers.""

The juxtaposition within Bennett's own personality of brutal thug and aspiring artist fascinated DeWald who discovered Bennett's own art training as a teenager his detour to the Navy a stint in boxing and reputed introduction to Henry Ford by famous newspaperman Arthur Brisbane.

DeWald chronicles Bennett's friendship with Palm Springs artist Paul Grimm master landscape painter and keen observer of the subtleties of the desert who had an art studio on Palm Canyon. In April 1942 The Desert Sun carried an article about Grimm completing a huge canvas for a wealthy Chicago businessman. ""While it is of unusually great size the canvas is extremely appealing depicting a favorite Grimm desert scene of mountain background with sandhills verbenas primroses and greasewood in the foreground.""

After the particulars of the gallery and the Chicago commission the article continued ""just recently Grimm also finished another large canvas this for Harry Bennett personnel director in Detroit for the Ford motor concern. Bennett has an extensive and elaborate new ranch establishment across the Coachella Valley from Palm Springs and near the B-Bar-H. A lover of the desert he ordered one of his favorite scenes placed on canvas to be hung in his Detroit residence.""

Interestingly Grimm also counted fellow painter President Eisenhower as a friend and Eisenhower would regularly drop by his studio as well. One wonders if Eisenhower and Bennett ever met. Known for landscapes Grimm's portrait of Bennett with his horse Sonny painted in May 1944 as they painted together is highly unusual and a testament to a genuine friendship.

Bennett became known as a bona fide desert artist according to Japenga and ""was invited to exhibit at the Little Gallery of The Desert appearing in a show alongside Axel Linus and curated by J. Marie Ropp. Ropp was a major figure in desert art. She established the Little Gallery in Cathedral City before moving the shop to Desert Hot Springs. She later ran the Desert Magazine Art Gallery."" Ropp knew both Cabot Yerxa and Agnes Pelton ""so it's likely the Little Giant rubbed shoulders with his pueblo-building neighbor and with Pelton too.""

In 1968 Bennett sold the S-Star ranch and moved to Las Vegas. His eyesight diminished he stopped painting. The massive hilltop hideout at 19900 Bennett Road remains just past Ford Avenue named for Henry himself. The indoor swimming pool is barely recognizable. Gone is the full-size antique rickshaw converted into a movable bar in the dining room but as Japenga notes the view of the Mt. San Jacinto from Bennett's hilltop perch is unrivaled.

Landscape painting in the desert seems an unlikely and quiet end for the notorious Bennett too strange to be true. More of his story may be resurrected by a visit to Japenga's website and the Desert Hot Springs Historical Society for discussion with the experts there.

Rivian; Ford

Ford and Rivian no longer plan to develop an electric vehicle together Automotive News reported.

Ford CEO Jim Farley suggested his company had ""confidence"" to build EVs without Rivian's help.

""We've mutually decided to focus on our own projects and deliveries"" Rivian told CNBC.

Ford and Rivian have scrapped plans to develop an electric vehicle together the companies confirmed Friday.

The two companies mutually decided to focus on their own projects instead axing plans to co-create a new model envisioned under a deal struck in early 2019 Automotive News first reported.

Ford CEO Jim Farley pointed to the automaker's ""growing confidence"" to ""win in the electric space"" without the help of Rivian the outlet reported.

""We want to invest in Rivian — we love their future as a company — but at this point we're going to develop our own vehicles"" Farley said.

Ford said in an emailed statement to CNBC: ""We respect Rivian and have had extensive exploratory discussions with them however both sides have agreed not to pursue any kind of joint vehicle development or platform sharing.""

Electric-truck maker Rivian also emailed a statement to CNBC. ""As Ford has scaled its own EV strategy and demand for Rivian vehicles has grown we've mutually decided to focus on our own projects and deliveries"" it said.

Ford and Rivian did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Ford originally announced its intentions to produce a Rivian-powered electric vehicle in 2019 when it made its first investment of $500 million in the startup.

In 2020 Ford dropped plans for a different model for the automaker's Lincoln luxury brand which would have been developed using Rivian's technology The Wall Street Journal reported.

The turnaround comes after Rivian went public this month with a blockbuster IPO that raised $11.9 billion — one of the biggest market debuts in history.

The electric-car maker reached a market value near $100 billion on a fully diluted basis as its shares soared making it more valuable than Ford and General Motors as Insider previously reported.

WASHINGTON - Detroit's Big Three automakers General Motors Ford Motor Co and Chrysler parent Stellantis lag other automakers in fuel economy performance as they sell a rising number of large trucks and SUVs a government report released on Friday shows.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said fuel economy for new vehicles hit a high in the 2020 model year at 25.4 miles per gallon but added that projected industry fuel economy for the 2021 model year will decline to 25.3 mpg.The three U.S. automakers have the lowest fleet wide fuel economy of 14 major car companies.GM is projected to be the lowest of all automakers in 2021 with a fleet average of 21.5 mpg for all its vehicles just behind Stellantis at 21.6 mpg with Ford Motor Co at 22.7 mpg.The report said since 2004 carbon dioxide emissions have decreased by 24% as fuel economy has improved by 32%.The report said only Tesla Inc Subaru and Honda Motor met requirements without using credits. Automakers can either purchase credits or use credits earned from earlier model years.The report shows GM Daimler AG's Mercedes and Stellantis all bought significant credits in 2020 while Tesla Honda and Toyota Motor all sold credits.In August the EPA proposed reversing the Trump-era loosening of vehicle emissions rules with a new plan to boost efficiency 10% in the 2023 model year aiming for a fleet average of 52 mpg by 2026.The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said ""automakers are producing cars that are barely more fuel efficient on average than what they sold a year ago.""Dan Becker director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign said the report shows ""auto companies have made sky-high promises to turn out clean cars but the EPA's report shows they have produced very few.""He said the 2020 improvement - just 1.9% over 2019 - showed that ""with weak rules automakers will keep pushing gas guzzlers sticking consumers with high gas bills and plentiful pollution.""For 2020 GM and Ford both averaged 23 miles per gallon while Stellantis averaged 21.3 mpg. Tesla which makes only electric vehicles led the industry while Honda averaged 29.1 mpg which was first among automakers building gas-powered vehicles.The report showed that over the last five years GM's and Ford's performances barely improved while Stellantis' fell by 0.5 mpg.Stellantis said on Friday it is investing more than $35 billion through 2025 to develop battery electric vehicles but said ""consumer and manufacturing incentives and recharging infrastructure"" are needed to move the market toward EVs.The report also showed average vehicle weight in 2020 rose to another all-time high of 4166 pounds while average horsepower and size both also set records."

IoT security is where endpoint detection and response (EDR) and enterprise mobility management (EMM) meet the challenges of a rapidly expanding edge computing infrastructure. As the enterprise attack surface grows IoT is yet another attack vector organizations aren’t fully prepared to defend.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the smart consumer and business systems powering the homes factories and enterprise processes of tomorrow. By year-end total IoT device installations will surpass 35 billion and extend to 55 billion by 2025.

Enterprise organizations recognize this shift and need to invest in device management and endpoint security capabilities. In 2016 $91 million was spent on IoT endpoint security solutions. Five years later that number has skyrocketed to $631 million. With the growth of segments like industrial IoT (IIoT) Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and industrial control systems (ICS) IoT security will continue to be critical to business continuity vulnerability management and threat remediation.

This article looks at the top IoT security solutions current commercial features associated risks and considerations for organizations choosing an IoT vendor.

What Are IoT Security Solutions?

IoT security solutions are the software and embedded tools used to monitor edge devices proactively detect threats and facilitate remediation. As such current IoT security solutions are a mix of standalone and bundle plans that include existing tools like EDR encryption IAM EMM and more to protect connected devices and networks.

What Are IoT Devices?

IoT is the broad label given to all devices capable of communicating with each other often at short range with unique identities and few components outside its operational intent including security features. Because of this several organizations are building security into a new generation of IoT devices (embedded security) while other vendors offer agent-based software to monitor and protect IoT devices.

Examples of IoT devices include most consumer smart systems autonomous machinery and vehicles office appliances and a multitude of healthcare devices.

Considerations for Choosing an IoT Security Solution

How does the solution isolate IoT devices and access from critical segments?

What protocols and tools are available for secure transactions? (TLS encryption Auth0)

Are there embedded or built-in IoT security requirements to address exposure?

What policy controls can administrators configure for unmanaged devices or users?

Does the solution issue and manage secure credentials like PKI and code signatures?

Can solution operators identify categorize and provision new devices?

How does the solution establish trust between devices? (e.g. key injection or HSMs)

IoT Security Solution Features

Network scanning device identification and discovery of active connections

Identify users data devices locations and more to identify and assess risk categories

Threat intelligence informs the status of malware and available patches

Security gateways to isolate network segments between ports servers and IoT devices

Baseline responses to anomalous behavior for individuals or clusters of devices

Define and enforce policies across device and access types for hybrid infrastructures

Automated onboarding configuration and threat response policies for new IoT devices

Certificate issuance and management for granting secure credentials and access

Because securing IoT devices is a budding cybersecurity segment the above list is not all-encompassing and several vendors present unique approaches to addressing IoT security challenges.

IoT Device Risks and Vulnerabilities

Once isolated from other devices and an organization’s larger IT environment IoT devices like sensors doorbells and printers are now at risk of compromise. With proper segmentation organizations can avoid access to an IoT device turning into something more but that won’t stop threat actors from using the device and others like it in a botnet attack.

Other identified risks associated with IoT device management include:

Insufficient security or data protection capabilities for devices

Inability to add additional security software

Insecure interfaces easily accessible to a persistent threat

Poor password protection with default credentials staying put

Unreliable patch or update mechanism

Nonexistent or lacking inventory of IoT devices or monitoring IoT traffic

A gap in IoT security management skills for edge systems

Disparate management of IoT and OT systems creating data silos

IoT Security: Not Going Away

The proliferation of IoT devices means securing the next generation of IT environments will require IoT-specific security strategies and solutions. Organizations actively deploying IoT devices should be prudent about the security risks of insecure edge devices and proceed with caution.

Organizations need to visualize IoT assets under management profile their risk apply adequate protections and monitor IoT traffic for unknown threats. Like so much else in cybersecurity visibility informs action and strategy – making the upfront work of selecting an IoT security solution or assembly a strategy that much more valuable in avoiding unnecessary risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,

FOXA,Fox Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvbm92LzIxL3dhdGNoaW5nLXN1Y2Nlc3Npb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPINION | PHILIP MARTIN: Watching 'Succession' | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



I'm thinking about what Roman Roy's new watch might mean.

Roman is a character on HBO's ""Succession"" a soapy series about the miserable lives of a family of billionaires who like the Murdochs or the Redstones own a global media and entertainment conglomerate.

The fictional WayStar/Royco concern is a lot like Disney and the Fox Corporation; it has broadcast news and entertainment divisions as well as theme parks and a cruise line.

Portrayed by Kieran Culkin Roman (whose real name is Romulus) is the youngest son of 80-year-old family patriarch and company founder Logan Roy (Brian Cox). Roman is callow and hilariously profane in order to compensate for his bone-deep insecurity and legitimate lack of talent for anything other than the acerbic putdown.

At first blush he'd seem the least likely of the Roy clan to succeed his father as the leader of the company but--because this is episodic television--he'll have his turn as the favorite to win this particular game of thrones.

Right now his star seems ascendant thanks to his alliance with acting CEO Gerri Kellman (J. Smith Cameron) who seems bent on making the youngest son--once referred to by his siblings as the weakest dog in their pack--into a viable human being who might be able to handle some adult responsibility.

The Gerri-Roman relationship is a fascinating subplot in ""Succession"" which is like ""King Lear"" transposed into a modern black comedy mode. There's a sexual component to the relationship which from Roman's point of view is a genuine romance.

But Gerri is a couple of decades older and a lot wiser than Roman and while she obviously feels something for him she' not about to compromise her position by actually having an affair with Logan's baby boy (even if Logan is the sort of parent who can blithely allow his kids to go to prison if it benefits the bottom line).

Maybe she sees in Roman a potential ally. With her expertise and his uh name perhaps they could rule the empire together.

Anyway on last week's episode Roman was wearing a new watch.

I couldn't catch what make and model it was but a gold watch on a leather strap replaced the 41mm Rolex Datejust on an oyster bracelet.

Any reasonable person might shrug at this information. But ""Succession"" is a show where much is made of wristwatches and what they might or might not mean. One major point of the pilot episode was the $160000 Patek Philippe that Logan's future son-in-law Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) gives Logan as a birthday gift. Tom is obviously trying to ingratiate himself with Logan who barely looks at the watch. (""It's incredibly accurate"" Tom tells Logan as he hands it over. ""Every time you look at it it tells you exactly how rich you are."")

The Patek Philippe ends up at the end of the episode being given to a family of poor Latinos to induce them to sign a non-disclosure agreement after Roman has humiliated their child during a softball game. At the end of the episode the expensive watch sits on a table in their working-class house.

The watch meant next to nothing to billionaire Roy; just another thing and he can have all the things he wants. The character isn't a flashy dresser; he often wears a baseball cap and understated (but expensive) cardigans and jackets. He's worn a pilot's watch with a diamond-shaped crown from Swiss manufacturer IWC Schaffhausen which would probably cost at least $20000 while looking like an ordinary white dial watch.

It's worth thinking about what the Patek Philippe could mean to the family that received it too. Did the NDA specify they couldn't say who gave them the watch? Certainly they could sell it but only for a fraction of what it's worth and the off-loading of such a luxury item could raise the suspicions of law enforcement and the IRS.

And in an episode earlier this year the bumpkinish poor relation ""Cousin"" Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) found himself in an awkward situation when he realized that having family black sheep Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) ""hook him up"" with a watch did not mean that Kendall was actually buying him the watch. Instead Kendall was putting Greg in contact with a seller who had what appeared to be a Rolex Deepsea on offer.

This makes sense if you know how hard it is to obtain a stainless steel tool watch from Rolex these days. Authorized dealers' waiting lists are years long and a lot of buyers resort to paying far more than retail on the so-called gray market to obtain the models they want. (Even so the $40000 Greg paid was a heck of a premium; the Rolex Deepsea has a suggested retail price of $12600.)

Kendall by the way wears the show's most expensive watches -- the Patek Philippe Nautilus and Vacheron Constantin chronographs he wears go for between $100000 and $700000. Tom has been known to wear a Cartier Santos (in the $3000-$7000 range) a Panerai Luminor Marina (around $7000) and most intriguingly a Cartier Ballon Bleu that some watch bloggers insist was fake. (Tom seems to have given up the Ballon this season which is mildly disappointing because some of us expected a scene where he'd be outed for wearing a counterfeit.)

Tellingly the show's most grounded character Shiv the youngest of the Roy children and Tom's wife wears a practical quartz-movement Cartier Panthere. Nice watch but hardly exotic. She has one in gold and one in steel depending on her outfit.

It seems obvious that care goes into selecting the characters' watches and makes it reasonable to wonder what Roman's new timepiece might signify. While his old Rolex was by the standards of his family relatively inexpensive (on the secondary market you can get a platinum Datejust for around $15000; Rolex seems not to be offering the watch in platinum at the moment but the MSRP is $7650 for the steel model and $9650 for white gold).

Yet it's still flashy by some lights--a salesman's watch a politician's watch. Everyone recognizes it as an expensive watch. It's the antithesis of the old money shibboleth that a gentleman's watch is ""thin and gold"" and that second hands are for people who have to worry about time. (Cue the dowager from ""Downton Abbey"": ""What is this 'weekend'?"")

My theory is Gerri is remaking Roman as a more serious less obnoxious version of himself. She's making a man of him because that's what women do for us. Something watches never can.

FOX,Fox Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvbm92LzIxL3dhdGNoaW5nLXN1Y2Nlc3Npb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPINION | PHILIP MARTIN: Watching 'Succession' | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



I'm thinking about what Roman Roy's new watch might mean.

Roman is a character on HBO's ""Succession"" a soapy series about the miserable lives of a family of billionaires who like the Murdochs or the Redstones own a global media and entertainment conglomerate.

The fictional WayStar/Royco concern is a lot like Disney and the Fox Corporation; it has broadcast news and entertainment divisions as well as theme parks and a cruise line.

Portrayed by Kieran Culkin Roman (whose real name is Romulus) is the youngest son of 80-year-old family patriarch and company founder Logan Roy (Brian Cox). Roman is callow and hilariously profane in order to compensate for his bone-deep insecurity and legitimate lack of talent for anything other than the acerbic putdown.

At first blush he'd seem the least likely of the Roy clan to succeed his father as the leader of the company but--because this is episodic television--he'll have his turn as the favorite to win this particular game of thrones.

Right now his star seems ascendant thanks to his alliance with acting CEO Gerri Kellman (J. Smith Cameron) who seems bent on making the youngest son--once referred to by his siblings as the weakest dog in their pack--into a viable human being who might be able to handle some adult responsibility.

The Gerri-Roman relationship is a fascinating subplot in ""Succession"" which is like ""King Lear"" transposed into a modern black comedy mode. There's a sexual component to the relationship which from Roman's point of view is a genuine romance.

But Gerri is a couple of decades older and a lot wiser than Roman and while she obviously feels something for him she' not about to compromise her position by actually having an affair with Logan's baby boy (even if Logan is the sort of parent who can blithely allow his kids to go to prison if it benefits the bottom line).

Maybe she sees in Roman a potential ally. With her expertise and his uh name perhaps they could rule the empire together.

Anyway on last week's episode Roman was wearing a new watch.

I couldn't catch what make and model it was but a gold watch on a leather strap replaced the 41mm Rolex Datejust on an oyster bracelet.

Any reasonable person might shrug at this information. But ""Succession"" is a show where much is made of wristwatches and what they might or might not mean. One major point of the pilot episode was the $160000 Patek Philippe that Logan's future son-in-law Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) gives Logan as a birthday gift. Tom is obviously trying to ingratiate himself with Logan who barely looks at the watch. (""It's incredibly accurate"" Tom tells Logan as he hands it over. ""Every time you look at it it tells you exactly how rich you are."")

The Patek Philippe ends up at the end of the episode being given to a family of poor Latinos to induce them to sign a non-disclosure agreement after Roman has humiliated their child during a softball game. At the end of the episode the expensive watch sits on a table in their working-class house.

The watch meant next to nothing to billionaire Roy; just another thing and he can have all the things he wants. The character isn't a flashy dresser; he often wears a baseball cap and understated (but expensive) cardigans and jackets. He's worn a pilot's watch with a diamond-shaped crown from Swiss manufacturer IWC Schaffhausen which would probably cost at least $20000 while looking like an ordinary white dial watch.

It's worth thinking about what the Patek Philippe could mean to the family that received it too. Did the NDA specify they couldn't say who gave them the watch? Certainly they could sell it but only for a fraction of what it's worth and the off-loading of such a luxury item could raise the suspicions of law enforcement and the IRS.

And in an episode earlier this year the bumpkinish poor relation ""Cousin"" Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) found himself in an awkward situation when he realized that having family black sheep Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) ""hook him up"" with a watch did not mean that Kendall was actually buying him the watch. Instead Kendall was putting Greg in contact with a seller who had what appeared to be a Rolex Deepsea on offer.

This makes sense if you know how hard it is to obtain a stainless steel tool watch from Rolex these days. Authorized dealers' waiting lists are years long and a lot of buyers resort to paying far more than retail on the so-called gray market to obtain the models they want. (Even so the $40000 Greg paid was a heck of a premium; the Rolex Deepsea has a suggested retail price of $12600.)

Kendall by the way wears the show's most expensive watches -- the Patek Philippe Nautilus and Vacheron Constantin chronographs he wears go for between $100000 and $700000. Tom has been known to wear a Cartier Santos (in the $3000-$7000 range) a Panerai Luminor Marina (around $7000) and most intriguingly a Cartier Ballon Bleu that some watch bloggers insist was fake. (Tom seems to have given up the Ballon this season which is mildly disappointing because some of us expected a scene where he'd be outed for wearing a counterfeit.)

Tellingly the show's most grounded character Shiv the youngest of the Roy children and Tom's wife wears a practical quartz-movement Cartier Panthere. Nice watch but hardly exotic. She has one in gold and one in steel depending on her outfit.

It seems obvious that care goes into selecting the characters' watches and makes it reasonable to wonder what Roman's new timepiece might signify. While his old Rolex was by the standards of his family relatively inexpensive (on the secondary market you can get a platinum Datejust for around $15000; Rolex seems not to be offering the watch in platinum at the moment but the MSRP is $7650 for the steel model and $9650 for white gold).

Yet it's still flashy by some lights--a salesman's watch a politician's watch. Everyone recognizes it as an expensive watch. It's the antithesis of the old money shibboleth that a gentleman's watch is ""thin and gold"" and that second hands are for people who have to worry about time. (Cue the dowager from ""Downton Abbey"": ""What is this 'weekend'?"")

My theory is Gerri is remaking Roman as a more serious less obnoxious version of himself. She's making a man of him because that's what women do for us. Something watches never can.

Biden established the firm Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) Equity Investment Fund Management Company with two other Americans and some Chinese partners in 2013. The American members controlled 30 percent of the Shanghai-based operation and served on the board.

The company notably completed a deal in 2016 that saw a Congo cobalt and copper mine transfer from American company Freeport-McMoRan to Chinese outfit China Molybdenum for the sum of $2.65 billion.

BHR served as a minority stakeholder to buy out around $1.14 billion of shares from Lundin Mining of Canada who owned a portion of the Congo mine.

China Molybdenum then bought BHR’s shares of the mine two years later according to Hong Kong filings. The deal resulted in China Molybdenum owning 80% of the mine with the remaining portion owned by Congo’s state mining enterprise.

Hunter Biden’s business ties remain an item of intense scrutiny for the media particularly his activity in China. President Biden particularly warned about China’s growing dominance of cobalt as a stumbling block to America’s attempts at shifting from petrol gas to electric cars as cobalt is a key ingredient in electric car batteries.

The president's son was one of three Americans who joined Chinese partners in establishing the Bohai Harvest RST Equity Investment Fund Management Company or BHR in 2013.

The Americans controlled 30 percent of the company and made successful investments that culminated in aiding China Molybdenum purchase the Tenke Fungurume cobalt mine in the Congo from the American company Freeport-McMoRan in 2016 the New York Times reported.

The news comes after President Joe Biden had warned that China could use its dominance of mined cobalt to disrupt America's development of electric vehicles.

It also adds to the scrutiny Biden and his father have faced for his dealings with Chines and Ukrainian companies while Joe was vice president and later running for president.

Hunter Biden (pictured on November 10) was one of three American founders of a investment firm primarily owned by Chinese partners. The firm helped secure the richest cobalt mine in the world for a Chinese company in 2016

Biden founded BHR with two other Americans and Chinese partners in 2013. He was no longer part of the board as of April 2020

Biden's firm made the deal with Joe Biden right was still vice president. The now president has warned that America's electric vehicle production could he stunted by China's dominance over cobalt one of the key components of the electric batteries

BHR slowly made its way into an investment powerhouse after helping finance an Australian coal-mining company controlled by a Chinese state-owned firm the paper reported.

The investment company's big break came in 2016 when it bought and sold a stake in CATL a Chinese company that is now the world's biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles.

That same year China Molybdenum - one of the world's leading producers of the precious metals molybdenum and tungsten - announced it would purchase the Tenke Fungurume cobalt mine from Freeport-McMoRan an American mining company.

But in order to purchase the mine the Chinese company needed a partner to buy out one of the stakeholders Lundin Mining of Canada.

That's when BHR came in to buy out Lundin with $1.14 billion raised entirely from obscure Chinese state-backed companies according to the Times.

Biden still controlled 10 percent of BHR when its shares of the mines were sold to China Molybdenum in 2019.

The Tenke Fungurume cobalt mine in the Congo is worth $3.8 billion and holds the largest deposit of the metal

The mines were purchased from the American-based Freeport-McMoRan company which owns mines across the nation (pictured a Freeport-McMoRan mine in Colorado)

Chris Clark one of Biden's lawyers said the president's son 'no longer holds any interest directly or indirectly in either BHR or Skaneateles' a firm Biden used to control his BHR shares.

Chinese records show Biden was no longer on BHR's board as of April 2020 and a former board member told the Times that the American founders were not directly involved in the mine deal and supposedly earned only a nominal fee from it.

'We don't know Hunter Biden nor are we aware of his involvement in BHR' Vincent Zhou a spokesman for China Molybdenum said in a statement.

A White House spokesman told the Times that President Biden has not been made aware of his son's connection to the sale.

The president has often faced backlash for Biden's dealings with Chines and Ukrainian companies through banks lobbies and investment firms.

The necessity for cobalt by American companies was made even more vital after the president signed an executive order in August outlining a goal to have electric and other zero-emissions vehicles make up half of the new cars and trucks sold in the U.S. by 2030.

The 50 percent goal is nonbinding and mostly symbolic but it sets the expectation for U.S. automakers to begin the transition from building gas-powered vehicles to electric ones.

It includes battery electric plug-in hybrid electric or fuel cell electric vehicles. Biden also included the first-ever national network of electric vehicle charging stations in his $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGZpZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yMS9odW50ZXItYmlkZW4tc2VjcmV0cy10aGF0LWNoaW5hLXVzZXMtYXMtYS1sZXZlcmFnZS1hZ2FpbnN0LXRoZS11cy_SAWtodHRwczovL3RmaWdsb2JhbG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEvaHVudGVyLWJpZGVuLXNlY3JldHMtdGhhdC1jaGluYS11c2VzLWFzLWEtbGV2ZXJhZ2UtYWdhaW5zdC10aGUtdXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hunter Biden ‘secrets’ that China uses as a leverage against the US,"Hunter Biden is a notorious man. Hunter’s daddy Joe Biden knows this. Jill Biden Hunter’s mom knows it too. Everyone close to Hunter Biden knows that the man is dirty. But among many of the Biden family’s friends who know Hunter is a naughty corrupt and dirty man the Chinese Communist Party knows it best. The Biden family and China have been in bed with each other since before 2010. We are talking about the Obama Presidency here when Joe Biden was Vice President and Hunter Biden used his father’s position to make massive profits around the world. But now one card after the other is falling and it seems China is behind it all.

When Joe Biden became President China thought it had a friend in the White House. However public perception of China in the United States is highly negative. Leave alone Republicans and Conservatives even Democrats are no fans of China and view the Communist nation as an imminent threat to the United States. This public pressure against China has forced Biden’s hand into taking some anti-China moves which the CCP has hardly been appreciative of. So the CCP has taken upon itself the task of exposing the Biden family’s dealings with it over the past 10 years.

Hunter Biden Gifts China a Cobalt Mine

Many of you would remember Joe Biden as saying China’s growing dominance of cobalt is a stumbling block to America’s attempts at shifting from petrol gas to electric cars as cobalt is a key ingredient in electric car batteries. Well guess what? As it turns out Hunter Biden had gifted one of the world’s largest cobalt mines to China in 2016 although the deal was struck when Joe Biden was still Vice President.

According to a report by the New York Times an investment firm that counts Hunter Biden among its founders helped a Chinese company purchase one of the world’s most lucrative cobalt mines from an American company. The company completed a deal in 2016 that saw a Congo cobalt and copper mine transfer from American company Freeport-McMoRan to Chinese outfit China Molybdenum for the sum of $2.65 billion.

Hunter Biden continues to hold a 10 per cent stake in the Chinese private equity firm Bohai Harvest RST Equity Investment Fund Management Co. (BHR Partners). What is even more shocking is that BHR Partners is no ordinary private equity firm. This fund was actually founded in 2013 by Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co. Ltd. which is itself controlled by the Bank of China one of the four biggest Chinese State-owned commercial banks. This is the same deal that sold the Cobalt mine to the Chinese Communist Party.

According to Fox News China Molybdenum then bought BHR’s shares of the mine two years later according to Hong Kong filings. The deal resulted in China Molybdenum owning 80% of the mine with the remaining portion owned by Congo’s state mining enterprise.

Hunter Biden faces severe allegations of misusing the Vice Presidency of his father Joe Biden to land lucrative deals for himself world over from Ukraine to China. China knows just how deeply involved Hunter Biden was with it until his father became President this year. Now the CCP has a gun to both Hunter and Joe Biden’s heads. And it is pulling the trigger one bullet at a time. This is Joe Biden’s punishment for not completely toeing the CCP line as President of the United States of America.",,,,,,

After focusing on the road market for years the new Rally XC 100 and 200 systems added an option targeted at cross country mountain bikers and gravel riders.

Garmin made its first power meter pedal way back in 2013. With nearly a decade of experience the new Rally XC pedals have come a long way from the early Vector models. After six months of testing the new Rally platform has proven to be durable and easy to use. With interchangeable pedal bodies it’s an appealing option for any rider that switches between bikes including cleat styles but still wants to train with power all year.

Update: In October Garmin released a software update to the Rally XC pedals adressing two issues the pedals were having. The update is free to download through the Garmin Connect app – or will automatically update if you’re already using the pedals. Details down below. [This review was published on Sept. 8. Updated Sept. 19]

Garmin Rally XC200 A tough metal battery cap replaces the Vector's plastic cap Green means go. Or that the pedals are awake and communicating with your head unit Each pedal has a unique ID so you know you're connecting to the correct set of pedals not your friends The Garmin's have a slightly taller stack height than Shimano XTR's. Similar to some gerations of XT. Clear and effective cleat tension adjustment Garmin give's the Rally's a slightly more substantial body than say an XTR. It's doesn't add ton of support but maybe a very little bit.

The Pedals: Garmin Rally XC 200

This is Garmin’s first mountain bike or gravel bike-specific power pedal. It uses an SPD cleat though an interchangeable pedal body means you can turn this into a road pedal (SPD-SL or Look Keo are the two clean options on tarmac). The Rally XC is available as a single-sided (XC 100) or dual-sided (XC 200) power meter. The XC 200 option which measures each legs power output independently is tested here.

We covered all the details on the Rally pedals during their launch. The general idea is one pedal that can be used for cross country mountain biking gravel riding and with a change of pedal body road riding as well. Garmin does say they designed the Rally pedals around cross country riding not more aggressive styles. So the small segment of hardcore enduro athletes who train and race with power will have to look elsewhere.

Connections: Setting up the Rally XC 200

Setting up Garmin’s power pedals is impressively simple and quick. This is important as Garmin is targeting the gravel and cross country audience and expects these pedals to be transferred between bikes.

Both initial setup and switching between bikes is straightforward even if you’re changing crank lengths between bikes. Thread the pedals on with a pedal wrench (since the electronics are housed in the spindle a hex key won’t work) calibrate and ride.

Connecting the pedals with a head unit and calibrating them is quick and simple. As long as you keep the bike and pedals quite still they connect and calibrate first try. I tested the Rally XC’s with an Edge 530 head unit Garmin watch and a Wahoo head unit. All paired and calibrated successfully.

Power to the trails: Riding the Rally CX 200s

Once installed the Rally XC pedals feel well exactly like any SPD pedal should. There’s a good range of adjustment to the cleat tension. It’s clear when you’re clipped in and unclipping is predictable. The platform is a hair wider than a Shimano XTR pedal and feels solid underfoot. Stack height is 13.5 mm which is somewhere between XTR and XT depending on which generation you’re comparing to.

Really there are no surprises with the Rally XC pedals and that is a good thing. It makes it easier to switch between other pedals and the Rally’s as most riders will already be familiar with the SPD cleat system.

As for battery life the Rally’s hold a charge quite well. One charge should last 120 hours depending on use according to Garmin and that seems accurate so far.

Garmin Cycling Dynamics

Garmin includes much more than just straight power numbers in the Rally. There’s a huge array of data fields you can select and see live on the head unit with a more detailed breakdown available after on Garmin Connect. The most immediately interesting is the cycling dynamics.

Cycling dynamics goes beyond showing how much power each leg is producing to show power phase (where in the pedal stroke you’re applying power) and peak power phase (where you’re applying the most power). All of this shows up on Garmin head units as a full colour live graphic that gives you feedback while you ride. Garmin also measures platform center offset where on the pedal – inboard center or outboard – you are applying power.

Having these cycling dynamics was more interesting than I thought. I learned that I pedal centered when riding hard but one leg is off-center when spinning easy. I was also able to change my cleats to help get my foot properly centered on the pedal (which helped alleviate some lingering knee pain). Seeing where in the pedal stroke I was applying power and where I was applying the most power is fun though I’ll admit I haven’t done much with it yet.

Cycing Dynamics in Garmin Connect

You can also get quite a bit more information when you look at your rides on Garmin’s Connect platform. The power and cycling dynamics are automatically broken down into all kinds of narrower fields (standing power seated power l/r balance power phase peak power phase and numerous others all by lap as well as ride).

The only cycling dynamic I didn’t find particularly accurate was standing vs. seated time. It really only accurately shows the amount of time you spend pedalling while standing. All other ride time – including standing while descending – is rolled into seated time. It doesn’t impact seated power metrics but it would be useful if Garmin could devise a way to get a third category of inactive moving time to cover time spent moving but not pedalling.

The Durability factor

A big question when the Rally pedals were released was around durability. The pedals are a solid 444 grams for the dual-sided version and Garmin says the focus was on durability not hitting a low weight. That decision pays off on trail.

At this point the pedals have been tested in all weather on trails and some gravel. I accidentally exceeded their cross country intended use for several rides before I clarified that with Garmin so they’ve been pushed beyond what they were designed for too.

Over six months I’ve bounced the Rally XC’s off numerous rocks not on purpose and roots again not on purpose. They’ve seen action in thick mud and rain as well as over a very dry dusty summer here in B.C. Both in function and appearance the Rally’s are doing just fine. One battery cover has a small scratch and there are some small scratches to the pedal body. These are on par with or better than the standard wear I’d expect from any other non-power pedals. In terms of data the pedals are still reading predictably and consistently.

Garmin Rally XC 200: Issues

While I’ve been quite impressed with the Rally XC pedals overall there are a couple small issues. Both are on the data side. Garmin is aware of both and working on updates.

Power spikes. The Rally pedals seem to deliver reliably accurate power numbers. Based on what my co-worker found in her review of the Rally RS200 pedals they compare well with other pedals on the market. One issue I did have is occasional power spikes when riding on trails. These tended to happen when transitioning from coasting downhill to pedalling flat or uphill when I spun at a higher before catching up with the bike. The power spikes are momentary less than a second and infrequent and usually accompanied by the pedals reading cadence much higher than actual cadence. It’s also an issue Garmin is aware of and is working on an update for. I didn’t see these types of spikes on the road or on gravel.

Update: As mentioned above Garmin’s released a software update for the Rally pedals. I’ve had a couple of weeks riding the pedals since updating both mountain biking and a couple of horrifically wet and muddy cyclocross races. I haven’t had the same mis-reading of cadence or power spikes. The pedals are reading consistently and predictably. It is great that Garmin were able to not only fix the problem but make the update so easy to perform.

Dropped power. When I was using the Rally XCs outside their intended use they did drop power on one foot a couple times. Both times stopping and re-calibrating resolved the issue. Both times involved significant features that you would not find on a cross country course and which other parts of most XC bikes would not be happy riding either.

Since staying (mostly) within the limits of XC I haven’t had that problem again since. Even with several less-than-perfect landings and numerous rock and root strikes at speed. There were no problems on any gravel or road rides.

Conclusions: Garmin Rally XC200

Garmin’s Rally XC 200 pedals are durable accurate aside from very occasional spikes – which seem to have been resolved – and easy to use. There’s a wide range of data collected and displayed through a head unit or Garmin’s Connect platform. With limited pedal-based power meters available for the off-road crowd these are an excellent option for anyone looking to add power to their cross country training.

The main appeal of the Rally XC pedals will likely be for riders that want to use power on multiple bikes. You can switch easily between gravel cyclocross and mountain bikes with little fuss. Add the occasional switch between SPD and SPD-SL or Look pedal bodies and the Rally platform is an excellent option for anyone looking to mix off-road training in with paved miles without giving up power data.

At $1560 for the dual sided Rally XC200 Garmin’s power pedals aren’t inexpensive. But they are on par with other XC focused pedal-based power options like SRM’s X-Power pedals. When you factor in the extra pedal body option which is adds $325 you are getting two pedals in one. If you use that feature it improves the Garmin’s value.

I find it fascinating to capture data during my runs and spend time studying my trends figuring out ways to improve my health and performance and using various mobile devices to see which performs the best for me. For the past couple of months I've been running with a couple of pairs of Under Armour connected shoes and am enjoying the seamless nature of capturing data with shoes that are always with me.

Smartwatches have significantly improved when it comes to tracking the details of running but you have to make sure you have an adequately charged watch before heading out. With a pair of UA connected shoes you can rely on the shoes being ready to go all the time and then use your watch or phone as a companion if you like. You can also just leave the phone or watch at home and gather useful data with the shoes in an independent mode.

While I like the convenience of these connected shoes I think the demographic for these are casual recreational runners who don't put too many miles a week on their shoes. Serious runners could burn out the integrated sensor's battery in six weeks to two months and even average runners might have the sensors expire long before the shoes themselves are worn out. If you understand that the shoes can help coach your form for a few months and then serve as regular running shoes after that then these might be a good fit for you.

UA All Out Mile campaign

Under Armour's PR folks reached out to me in August to invite me to join a team for the UA All Out Mile campaign that was designed to guide you through training and achieve a PR for a one mile run. I'm a sprinter who has run a full marathon and several half marathons but I've never timed myself in a mile. I accepted the challenge and was then sent some Under Armour gear to train with including a pair of the UA Flow Velocity SE and UA HOVR Mega 2 Clone running shoes. I installed the MapMyRun app on my Android smartphone and started training.

Under Armour connected shoes review: in pictures

As part of the campaign weekly training plans were provided and by connecting your FitRankings account to MapMyRun you could check on the status of your team and other participants. There were about 10 members of the UA Media team and it looks like I did well within the team. After two weeks of training I suffered a medical emergency and had to have my gall bladder removed. This put a halt to my active training but I recovered quickly and was able to get in a couple more training runs before the week that we were supposed to run the All Out Mile. I ended up with a 7:53 mile but kept training after the campaign and have been able to get my mile down to 7:20 thanks to guidance from the shoes. That's not even close to the fastest runnes who ran faster than 4 minutes per mile.

UA Flow Velociti SE

For many years the Brooks Ghost shoes have been my default running shoe so it's been a long time since I've tried running in anything else. However I was open to trying something new especially something that can be considered mobile technology. A pair of White/Phoenix Fire UA Flow Velociti SE running shoes in size 12 arrived at the start of the training period. 12 is my standard size and this UA pair fit perfectly so sizing is consistent with other shoes I wear. I love the color scheme with bright orange transitioning into white along the bottom edge of the shoe.

The shoes are available in nine cool color options for $130 which is the price I pay for my Ghost shoes that have no connectivity. The first thing I noticed other than the color when I pulled the shoes out of the box was the light weight (8.3 ounces) and the cool knit upper with unique lace system. The upper material also has a bootie elevation around our ankle so they are easy to pull on and feel very secure when laced up. The sole material extends up the sides and back a bit and has serious grip and tackiness providing a seamless surface to run on. The inner lining is very comfortable and UA states this is a one-piece FLOW midsole.

Under Armour has embedded a sensor in the midsole of the right shoe that connects via Bluetooth LE (BLE). There is no ability to recharge the sensor. While Under Armour states the sensor is rated to last the lifetime of the shoe if you run 25 miles a week that means the lifetime is only 3 months (300-mile battery life). I run two to three times a week and my shoes usually last me a year before the bottoms are worn down and the shoes need to be replaced. Even at a leisurely 10 miles a week 300 miles is only 30 weeks or about seven months.

After installing the smartphone app you simply select to add a shoe and the app will detect the shoe and show an image of the UA Flow Velociti SE in the proper color scheme right in the app. If you have trouble the app guides you through setting the shoe on its side and then connecting it again.

For several of my runs I didn't take my phone along and was pleased to see that the shoes recorded the workout and captured all of the running form data. There was no GPS track associated with the run since a GPS chip is not in the shoe sensor. You need to start your run by running and not walking for the shoe to start recording the workout. Your shoes can store up to five runs before you need to sync to the smartphone app.

UA HOVR Mega 2 Clone

After a month of training I was also sent a pair of HOVR Mega 2 Clone running shoes in Concrete/Phoenix Fire to try out. These shoes are priced at $140 and are available in five color combinations.

The HOVR Mega 2 Clone shoes have a substantial heel and bottom cushioning. The heel is well supported with sturdy outer material on either side. The uppers are made with an interesting weave pattern that make the shoe breathable and adaptable to the shape of your foot. The upper is well made and holds my foot securely. This model is a bit heavier than the Flow Velociti 10.9 ounces total but are still quite light.

MapMyRun smartphone software

Under Armour conducted a survey of 87000 users on MapMyRun and found that the app and digital coach helped people run 7% faster and 3% farther than the average for all runners using the app. I've only been using it for a couple of months but I like analyzing the data and reading the coaching tips as I try to improve my low cadence and high stride length. I understand that this combination may lead to injury over time but it's my natural form and I've never had any issues or injuries due to running. I've never found it easy to increase my cadence and find the advice to ""Imagine you are a puppet on a string being pulled up into the sky with each step."" a good image to try to emulate as I increase my cadence.

The application is available for Android and iPhone devices for free. There is a ton in the app including the ability to connect to a number of apps (Garmin Connect Withings Suunto Samsung Health and more) manually log workouts discover workouts and routines view regular runs as routes interact with friends live track with your phone set goals and dive into the workouts you performed.

Within a workout you can see the GPS track if included personalized coaching tips and summaries of your pace cadence stride length ground contact time and foot strike angle. This data is collected by the shoes and synced to your phone via Bluetooth. You can also view this running form data through different split time frames to help you hone in on the areas where you did well and areas where you need to improve.

The time you were in target ranges is shown as well as trends in your data over time. Since cadence is one of my biggest challenges it is also interesting to see how adjusting your pace leads to a faster required cadence. This was eye opening as I work to speed up my distance pace and now see how much I need to increase my cadence to achieve that target pace. The application also does a good job of explaining how stride length cadence ground contact time foot strike angle and pace impact your body and guide you on target ranges and what to strive for. Since I do not train with a coach and I am not a professional runner I like seeing this type of information and guidance.

Running experiences and conclusions

I was very pleased with the UA Flow Velociti SE especially when traveling for business where I typically run for just three to five miles as I explore the cities I am visiting. I appreciated their light weight comfort and ability to add data to my other wearables. The run coaching has been helpful as I try to increase my cadence as no other method has helped me adapt this part of my form.

As much as I like the looks of the US HOVR Mega 2 Clone I found they don't work that well for me as a regular running shoe. There is something going on where my heel experiences a bit of a high spot while running for longer than four miles so I only wore these for shorter runs or when using the elliptical inside. I normally wear size 12 shoes and the UA Flow Velocit fit well. However the HOVR is a half size too small and my toes get pushed against the front too easily with the soft uppers.

Using these shoes introduced me to the MapMyRun application and I may keep using it after this review. I like that it captures the total distance I've run with the shoes provides interesting running form data and helps me relive my recent runs so I can improve on future outings. The application is useful for setting goals exploring workouts and routines competing with friends and using the integrated coaching features to help you improve in key areas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvYWNod2ViLmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLWFwcHMvOTEzMS9zdHJhdmEtcmV2aWV3LWlzLXN0cmF2YS1wcmVtaXVtLXdvcnRoLWl00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Strava Premium Worth It?,"General Strava Premium FeaturesStrava Premium Features For RunnersStrava Premium Features For Cyclists

If you’re a runner or cyclist there’s a good chance that you already use Strava (or you’re at least aware of the fitness social media platform with the orange logo). The app has more than 80 million users worldwide and is hugely popular because of its ability to not only track and log runs rides and swims but share them with friends – earning you kudos as you go.

The free version is a great introduction to Strava. As well as providing you with stats and summaries from every workout it gives you access to clubs challenges and the all-important kudos (essentially the ability to “like” another user’s activities).

But there comes a time in every free subscriber’s journey when they might consider subscribing to Strava Premium – unlocking additional features in the process. So what do you actually get for your £47.99 a year (or £6.99 a month)? And is it worth it?

Before we go through the Premium features aimed specifically at cyclists or runners here are a selection of those that apply to both.

General Strava Premium Features

Strava Segments

One of Strava’s best-known and best features is its segments. Created by users segments are a defined route between two points. Your elapsed time between the start and finish markers along these predetermined paths is logged and ranked against other Strava athletes – with the fastest times earning the title of King/Queen of the Mountain (cycling) or Course Record (running). Although there are thousands of segments to take on the main ones that we focus on are hill climbs or a circuit that you would complete laps of during training.

These were previously fully available to all Strava users but now those who are not paid-up subscribers can see only their overall position on a segment. While this is fine for most the additional ability to analyse and compare efforts against others’ is a useful tool if you’re striving for the top spot (either overall within your age bracket or among friends).

The biggest benefit of Premium is Live Segments though. This allows you to see your performance on any starred segment in real time on the Strava mobile app and compatible devices. When it’s paired with a bike computer or running watch we’ve found this is a great way to beat PBs (or take it easy if we’re not close to matching our fastest time).

Custom Goals

It might sound primitive but creating a goal can be all the motivation you need if you’re not training towards an event but want to keep your fitness level up. Strava Premium’s custom goals feature allows you to set targets for segments cycling power duration or distance – both weekly and yearly.

We found this to be an extremely useful tool while COVID kept events off the calendar. In January we set ourselves the target of running 25km and cycling 100km a week and while there have been times when we let it slip (wedding planning and long weekend rides don’t go hand in hand) the desire to keep on track gave us the boost we needed – even when the weather’s not playing ball.

What’s more because Strava collates data from a number of third-party devices it helps you to view all of your activities in one place – handy if your running watch and bike computer aren’t the same brand.

Relative Effort

When following a training plan it can be easy to stick rigidly to a schedule without listening to the needs of your body. Enter Relative Effort. Based on your heart rate data (if you use a heart rate monitor) or perceived exertion the Premium feature analyses the impact of your activities on your body and can provide early warning signs if you’re doing too much too soon or need to lower the intensity – helping to prevent overtraining and potential injury in the process.

We find the Relative Effort feature a useful guide but when near the upper end of the recommended range we don’t let it stop us going for a run or ride. It does however help to moderate the level of intensity during those activities.

Routes

(Image credit: Unknown)

Each training wearable or cycle computer is likely to have its own online route-plotting platform while companies like Komoot have opened up a more user-friendly experience for exploring the unknown on a ride or run. But most of these require you to have a destination in mind. Strava’s Premium offering allows you to craft a route from scratch on desktop but also has a handy tool on the mobile app that generates routes depending on a number of customisable preferences (such as sport distance and elevation). From experience the routes are pretty good too because they rely on other users’ data to keep you on popular paths rather than forcing you on to busy roads – particularly important when cycling.

Workout Analysis

If you’re working towards a race and have a time in mind or you just want to break down each mile or kilometre of a training run this is a highly useful feature especially for pacing. The information is also available by using tools like Garmin Connect and Wahoo Fitness but if you’re using the Strava app you’ll need to go Premium.

Strava Premium Features For Cyclists

Power Analysis

The only cycling-specific feature of Strava Premium is its power analysis which uses the data collected from a power meter and provides information such as training load intensity power curves and time spent in each power zone.

We’ve only trained with a power meter when using a turbo trainer that had one built into it but we can see why it might be useful to have all this information readily available in one place. While this feature alone wouldn’t be worth the subscription the more general features such as Strava Segments Relative Effort and Routes are good enough to warrant the small fee each month.

Dataiku

Approximately 80% of an organization’s data is semi-structured or unstructured according to Gartner. Unlocking the value from unstructured data can help organizations stay competitive and make smarter business decisions.

Many businesses have started to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to derive insights from unstructured data such as text images and videos. Building a model for such use cases however often remains a challenge for citizen data scientists and analysts due to resource constraints.

With deeper integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools from Amazon Web Services (AWS) Dataiku enables citizen data scientists and analysts to augment their analytics workflow with pretrained NLP and computer vision models.

In this post we’ll explore how you can use Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Rekognition plugins on Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS) to build a simple workflow of NLP and computer vision use cases respectively.

Dataiku is an AWS Partner with the Machine Learning Competency that orchestrates the entire machine learning (ML) lifecycle and makes it accessible to data scientists and analysts alike.

An AI and analytics production platform Dataiku was named a Leader in both the Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms and the Forrester Wave: Multimodal Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning Solutions Q3 2020.

AWS AI Services

Amazon Comprehend is a fully managed NLP service that enables you to extract insights from the content of documents. It supports custom classification and enables you to build custom classifiers that are specific to your requirements without requiring machine learning expertise.

Amazon Rekognition is a fully managed service that provides computer vision capabilities for analyzing images and video at scale using deep learning technology without requiring ML expertise

Use Cases

Unstructured data is ubiquitous across all industries and (generally speaking) images and videos are used for computer vision use cases and text data is used for natural language processing.

You want to start from a business problem and then look for the machine learning use cases that partially or fully addresses the problem. For example NLP could be used to improve customer satisfaction by finding out a sentiment of the conversation happened between the customer and sales support representative.

Computer vision meanwhile can be used to solve production management or quality control in manufacturing.

Here are some other use cases for NLP and computer vision:

Medical data as images like scan reports and MRIs patients’ medical history and text records and other types of imagery or videos for diagnosis.

Product and customer sentiment is revealed from service center calls online reviews social media references and survey questions.

Financial sector processes often deal with paper-based invoices quotes orders and receipts such as procure to pay or order to cash processes.

Energy companies have a wealth of information in well files pipeline and instrumentation diagrams (PIDs) and images.

Utility companies rely on manual inspections of captured images of utility infrastructure and their surrounding environments.

By enabling Amazon Comprehend or Amazon Rekognition as plugins in Dataiku citizen data science teams are enabled with intuitive tools for data wrangling analyzing and visualizing unstructured datasets without building own models from scratch. Business analysts meanwhile can reveal new insights and make the right decisions based on data.

Solution Architecture

The architecture diagram in Figure 1 highlights how Dataiku integrates with AWS. There are multiple AWS services plugins available through Dataiku DSS. In this post we are going to talk specifically about the Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Comprehend plugins.

There are three categories of how AWS services integrate with Dataiku DSS:

DSS ML platform: Design node automation node and API deployer hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

Design node automation node and API deployer hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Data lake: AWS Glue as a meta store and Amazon Athena for SQL queries against Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data.

Figure 1 – Dataiku DSS reference architecture.

Predict Customer Sentiment Using Amazon Comprehend Plugin

Let’s first look at how you can leverage Amazon Comprehend in Dataiku. We’ll be using the Amazon product review dataset where the business goal is to predict customer sentiment so marketing or customer teams can take the best preventative action.

The dataset consists of over 130 million consumer reviews from Amazon.com marketplace over a period of 1995-2015. The dataset includes metadata but only the review text is needed for this use case.

Amazon Comprehend capabilities in Dataiku allow users to analyze unstructured text content for language detection named entity recognition key phrase extraction and sentiment analysis.

Note that plugins are enabled for Dataiku projects by a Dataiku administrator. If you’re unable to find the plugin in your project ask your admin to enable the same.

Once installed the Amazon Comprehend plugin is configured to call the Amazon Comprehend API through your AWS account.

The preset information required to enable this connection from the Amazon Comprehend plugin includes your AWS credentials; namely access key secret key and region and Amazon Comprehend configurations like API quotas and parallelization settings.

Figure 2 – AWS AI services plugin setup.

Once the configuration is complete you can implement the use case.

Figure 3 – Amazon Comprehend workflow.

Next load the dataset onto your Dataiku project. Our interest for this use case is the “Text Column” feature of the dataset. This feature has all of the customer comments for the products.

Data preparation is an optional step for this use case. You can choose to filter the products of interest and remove any unwanted columns.

You can now drag and drop Amazon Comprehend to the workflow. For our use case we’ll use the “Sentiment Analysis” option.

Note that Amazon Comprehend provides capabilities to create custom entity detection and custom classifiers. The initial release of the Amazon Comprehend plugin for Dataiku supports only the built-in classifiers. Future upgrades will include custom classifiers.

Run the workflow and capture the results. The Amazon Comprehend plugin provides the sentiment prediction (“Positive” “Negative” “Neutral”) and a sentiment score for every review of the product.

Figure 4 – Amazon Comprehend results.

The sentiment prediction can be charted for every product to identify your business strategy around retire retain replace or re-engineer.

Predicting Unsafe Content Using Amazon Rekognition Plugin

Now let’s look at how to leverage Amazon Rekognition in Dataiku. We’ll be using COCO dataset where the business goal is to detect objects and moderate unsafe content so customer teams can take action and filter the images.

COCO is a large-scale object detection segmentation and captioning dataset. It features 330000 images and among that more than 200000 are labeled. It has 80 object categories with 1.5 million object instances and 250000 people with key points.

The Amazon Rekognition plugin for Dataiku allows users to analyze images and videos for object detection and labelling text detection and unsafe content moderation.

Install the Amazon Rekognition plugin in your Dataiku project and load the dataset onto your Dataiku project. Our interest for this use case is detecting the objects in the image and identifying if any are unsafe.

You can now drag and drop Amazon Rekognition to the workflow. For our use case we’ll use the object detection and unsafe content moderation options.

An illustration of an Amazon Rekognition pipeline is shown below. Load the dataset and add the Amazon Rekognition plugin to the workflow; one for object detection and one for unsafe content moderation.

Figure 5 – Amazon Rekognition workflow.

For object detection the result set provides you with a folder with bounding boxes around the objects detected with a confidence score. In addition a .csv file is generated with detailed information and response APIs for programmatic use.

Figure 6 – Amazon Rekognition label detection.

For unsafe content moderation Amazon Rekognition provides a suggestive score for content; a higher score indicates the content is unsafe. With the score you can create a threshold and choose to blur the image or filter it from processing downstream for any score above the threshold.

Conclusion

With the augmentation of AWS artificial intelligence capabilities in Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS) citizen data scientists can collaborate on the power of pretrained natural language processing and computer vision models to deliver end-to-end AI projects and initiatives.

Longer than a football field the sinuous blades stretch 107 meters from end to end enabling them to wring megawatts of renewable energy from offshore winds.

LM Wind Power a subsidiary of GE Renewable Energy shipped the first one in 2019 from a new factory in Cherbourg France. Now with demand for the turbines rising the plant is set to expand production.

GE Renewable Energy said last week that it has added a second mold for making the blades to the Cherbourg plant. The company is also building an additional hall for finishing blades before they are shipped. The factory is also planning to hire 200 workers which would bring the total number of employees at the site to 800. “Our teams here in Cherbourg are thrilled to take an active role in the energy transition and to be part of the successful journey for GE’s Haliade-X offshore wind turbine” said Olivier Fontan president and CEO of LM Wind Power.

Typically workers make blades from layers of fiberglass fabric and balsa wood. The result which looks like squished phyllo dough is called a composite. They line the individual sheets and wood inside special molds honed and polished to produce the right aerodynamic shape. Next they cover the layers with foil pump the air out to create a vacuum and inject a special resin to fuse them together. The vacuum helps the resin seep into the tiniest nooks and create a solid shell.

The process sounds straightforward but workers wearing white Tyvek coveralls respirators and protective eyewear must work fast and infuse the huge mold with resin that quickly turns from liquid to solid.

When the blade shells harden crews remove them from the mold and join them together — two half shells to make a blade — inside a long curving clamp that looks like a piece from the set of the movie “Alien.” Finally they sand polish and paint the blades and dispatch them to customers.

GE is also building another plant for the long blades in Teesside an industrial port on England’s North Sea coast. Workers at the plant which is scheduled to open in 2023 will supply blades for Haliade-X turbines at the Dogger Bank Offshore Wind Farm. When completed in 2026 Dogger Bank is expected to be the world’s largest offshore wind farm with a planned installed generation capacity of 3.6 gigawatts.

Nov. 20 2021 © Leeham News: Flying Blind The 737 MAX Tragedy and the Fall of Boeing is the sad story of how The Boeing Co. once renowned for its engineering prowess descended into the depths of crisis with its most profitable airplane.

Authored by Bloomberg news reporter Peter Robison much of the story is well known on the proverbial 35000-foot level. Congressional hearings investigative reporting crash coverage of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 310 provided plenty of grist for the mill.

Robison delves deeper into the crisis that encompassed Boeing from March 2019 with the ET 310 crash from which it won’t recover for years. I point to the Ethiopian crash as the start of the crisis because for the most part the Lion Air crash was viewed as just another crash—until Ethiopian’s tragedy made it clear there was something deadly wrong with the 737 MAX.

The fall of Boeing

The fall of Boeing however was rooted in events long before the MAX accidents. Many within Boeing complained for years that the 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp. (MDC) was the beginning of the long descent. I agree and Robison takes a dive into this merger and the cost-cutting philosophy that came with it. Critics and many Boeing employees complain the MDC merged with Boeing using Boeing’s money. (It was actually a stock deal not in cash.) Further they complain the McDonnell Douglas philosophy overwhelmed the Boeing engineering prowess.

But the descent doesn’t stop there. It continued with the “GE” philosophy of maximizing shareholder value at the expense of developing new airplanes—and with the two MAX crashes allegations that shareholder value also was at the expense of safety.

Robison also takes a detailed look at the GE philosophy and how it infected Boeing.

Yet as one gets deep into the book for all the sordid news to come out during the two years since the Lion Air crash in some ways which was only the tip of the iceberg. Only one person is being held accountable by authorities for Boeing’s misdeeds: mid-level pilot Mark Forkner whose impertinent emails deriding the Federal Aviation Administration and others landed him at the center of the scandal. Forkner was the only Boeing official indicted. His attorney is a high-powered high-profile guy named David Gerger. Forkner’s salary at Boeing and later as a pilot for Southwest Airlines (he no longer works here either) couldn’t possibly afford Gerger. Robison reports that Boeing is paying Gerger’s legal fees. For his part Gerger says Forkner is a scapegoat.

Robison’s story is revealing despite all the other information investigations and hearings that are already in the public domain.

Compatible books

When Robison began his work I was already well into writing my book Air Wars The Global Combat Between Airbus and Boeing. Air Wars covers 35 years of the sales marketing and product strategy battles between the Big Two. I had to delay the book to include a chapter on the MAX tragedies and the COVID-19 impact but the two books take different approaches and are compatible. I go into more detail about the development of the Airbus A320neo which maneuvered Boeing into re-engining the 737 to become the MAX. Air Wars also has more detail about the debate within Boeing about the battle whether to re-engine the 737 or develop an entirely new airplane. Flying Blind goes deeper into the McDonnell Douglas influence and discusses the GE philosophy more than Air Wars.

There is a third book Fall from the Skies¸ The Descent of Boeing and the 737 MAX and still other books about the MAX crisis which I’ve not read. Robison’s book is a must-read. And of course I would say the same about Air Wars which is rated 4.5 stars by Amazon reviewers.

The LEAP-1B engine is the sole powerplant for the B737 MAX and entered service on the type in 2017. Airbus however offers its A320neo (new engine option) family of jetliners with the choice of either CFM LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney (P&W) PW1100G-JM engines.

Akasa Air’s order for 144 engines adds to CFM International’s LEAP family orders placed by SpiceJet IndiGo Air India Air Asia India and Vistara.

Previous generation single-aisle jetliners operated by Indian carriers such as the Boeing 737NG are powered by CFM56-7B engines whereas the A320ceo (current engine option) family of jetliners are powered by CFM56-5B or International Aero Engine V2500 engines. Total LEAP engine orders and commitments now exceed 16300 machines and CFM has delivered over 3000 LEAP engines to 143 different customers and operators.

Growing Orderbook

Akasa Air’s CFM LEAP-1Border is valued at nearly $ 4.5 billion at list prices; however airlines typically secure discounts on such orders. The Akasa Air contract includes 144 new LEAP-1B engines to power 72 B737 MAX jetliners in addition to spare engines. The Ultra Low-Cost Carrier (ULCC) has also entered into a long-term engine services agreement with a comprehensive maintenance programme that will include real-time engine monitoring and predictive maintenance planning. The LEAP-1B engine offers Boeing 737 MAX operators enhanced performance in fuel consumption and 15% lower CO2 50% lower NOx emissions and reduced noise levels.

SpiceJet is presently the sole Indian B737 MAX operator and the LCC placed LEAP-1B engines orders with CFM International worth $ 12.5 billion and $1.1 billion in March 2018 and March 2014 respectively. These engines were to power 197 B737 MAX aircraft that it had on order. SpiceJet’s March 2018 order also included spare engines to support the fleet and a 10-year Rate per Flight Hour (RPFH) agreement with CFM Services covering all of the airline’s LEAP-1B engines. A part of CFM’s portfolio of flexible aftermarket support offerings RPFH agreements guarantee maintenance costs for LEAP-1B engines on a pay-by-the-hour basis.

IndiGo is India’s largest customer for LEAP-1A engines and has placed orders with CFM International for 1180 machines. The airline initially inducted its A320neos with PW1100G-JM engines; however a trying period of engine-related troubles with the revolutionary Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines led to a change of heart within the airline. Earlier in May IndiGo ordered 620 LEAP-1A engines to power 310 new A320neo A321neo and A321XLR aircraft. IndiGo will start taking deliveries from 2023 onwards. It had placed a $20 billion order with CFM International in June 2019 for 560 LEAP-1A engines to power 280 new A320neo and A321neo aircraft along with spare engines and overhaul support agreements. IndiGo is moving to replace all its A320ceos with A320neo family jetliners by the end of 2022.

Wadia Group run Go First (formerly GoAir) another A320neo operator has chosen to continue with P&W GTF engines unlike IndiGo. In November 2019 Go First selected PW1100G-JM engines for its order of 72 A320neo family aircraft along with a long-term ‘EngineWise’ comprehensive services agreement. Go First’s fleet comprises 50 A320neo and seven A320ceo (as of Sept 30 2021). The airline has 94 A320neos remaining on order and plans to take delivery of two more A320neos before the end of the year and ten aircraft each in 2022 and 2023 respectively. The first Indian airline to introduce the LEAP engine into service was Air India which started commercial operations with a LEAP-1A-powered A320neo aircraft in April 2017.

Leap Of Faith

CFM International is a 50-50 joint venture between General Electric (GE) and Safran Aircraft and is one of the most successful partnerships in the aviation industry. The LEAP-X engine programme was officially launched in July 2008. Chinese aerospace firm Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) was the first to opt for the LEAP engine choosing it as the powerplant for its new 150-passenger C919 in December 2009. Airbus opted for the LEAP-1A engine in 2010 and Boeing decided to proceed with the LEAP-1B in 2011. The LEAP-1A engine entered commercial service with the A320neo in 2016 followed by the LEAP-1B engine entering service on the B737 MAX in 2017.

The LEAP engine family has successfully introduced cutting-edge technology while maintaining the high reliability sought after by airline operators. Jet engines operate more efficiently at higher temperatures and as a result CFM introduced the use of engine parts made from advanced lighter-weight more heat-resistant materials including ceramic matrix composites (CMC). These materials can handle extreme temperatures approaching 2400 degrees Fahrenheit in the core of the engine.

Safran Aircraft Engines developed and patented the use of a 3D woven Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) carbon fibre composite that made it possible to produce lighter stronger and durable fan blades. The low-pressure turbine blades are more resistant to high temperatures as they are machined from an innovative titanium-aluminide alloy that is also lighter in weight. The engine’s low-pressure turbine rings and airfoils are made of CMC materials while 3D printed fuel injectors deliver weight savings of approximately 25%. Each LEAP engine has nearly 20 such fuel nozzles.

The shift to additive manufacturing reduced the number of parts in a single fuel nozzle tip to just one against 20 pieces that needed to be welded together. GE Aviation manufactures the 3D-printed fuel nozzle tips for the LEAP engine at its Alabama facility which is the aerospace industry’s first site for mass production using the additive manufacturing process.",,,

With Roberta Katz Jane Shaw and Linda Woodhead she is the author of Gen Z Explained: The Art of Living in a Digital Age which paints an optimistic portrait of a much misunderstood generation that has never known a world without the internet.

Define Gen Zers.

They are people born from the mid-1990s to around 2010. They’re followed by Generation Alpha who are aged 10 and under though there’s a bit of an overlap.

What unites them?

They’ve grown up in a fundamentally different environment than anyone before them – a digital world which we’re all trying to negotiate for the first time. The rest of us have known what the world was like before the internet whereas this generation doesn’t which I think makes them special. And it means that the rest of us can learn from them. With the Covid lockdowns [which have forced us all to go more digital] it’s shown that the rest of us have only just begun to catch up with them.

What did you and your co-authors hope to achieve?

We wanted to listen to Gen Zers – to let them speak in their own words to find out more about their view of the world their mindset their attitudes their values – and then try to describe what we found. It wasn’t a cross-generational study it was more of a snapshot of a moment in in time. Then we were then able to put that in a historical frame.

Gen Zers devise social codes for texting. Full stops are seen as expressing hostility and caps can be shouty

People might raise their eyebrows at the thought of four older academics pronouncing about young people. How did you get around that?

First of all we didn’t want to rely on one data source so not just interviews. And when we did the interviews we didn’t actually conduct them we trained their peers to do them. That was a really important way of avoiding the older lens. We then complemented the in-person interviews with large national surveys. And I constructed a 17m-word iGen Corpus – a big collection of language from this age group.

What are the biggest misconceptions older people have about Gen Zers?

They might judge them as narcissistic individualists. Which of course is false because they actually love to collaborate and they really care about other people.

It’s often claimed that Gen Zers are too relaxed about sharing intimate personal information online and that they have shorter attention spans and reduced capacity for deep thinking owing to their immersion in the digital world. What do you make of that?

It’s a lot more complex. We found that the Gen Zers were far more savvy about their privacy and their security online than their elders are. They are so much better at multitasking – they’ve always got just so many screens open and they’re engaging across them all simultaneously. They’re far better at merging their online and offline life.

There’s a story in the book about students skipping in-person lectures and watching the recorded lectures at home on triple speed. What was the thinking behind that?

When I was first told that story I thought that it was a time-saving device because the students explained how they timed how long it took them to cycle from their dorm to the lecture to attend the lecture and then to cycle back – and so they calculated that it was far easier to just watch the video of the lecture instead. But they were watching it in triple speed because that forces them to concentrate because it’s so hard to understand what the lecturer is saying and they’re not tempted to go and look at their social media. That’s an example of just how savvy they are about the economy of the internet.

Why are many Gen Zers averse to sending emails?

Because emails are too formal and not as instant as other forms of communication. So it takes too much time to compose the messages and then it’s difficult to get the formal tone correct which causes anxiety.

But in other quicker forms of messaging tone is still a highly sensitive factor.

Gen Zers devise social codes for expressing tone when they are texting. Full stops are seen as expressing hostility and caps can be shouty. Just communicating “OK” can be a minefield. There are at least five different ways of writing it – “okay” “ok” “K” “kk” and “k” – and each signals a different tone of voice. “K” is neutral because you’ve accepted that default capitalisation of the letter. But if you text “k.” that means “you’re in trouble” for two reasons: the first letter is lower case indicating that you took the time to undo that default capitalisation and then there’s a full stop. If you took that extra time to personalise the response in such a way it conveys that you’re not happy. Whereas “kk” is a very positive cheerful way of saying OK – it’s a low-effort way of softening the curtness of a single letter.

With the iGen Corpus you created a huge data bank of Gen Z language drawing from various sources including social media exchanges. What did it help you understand?

It enabled us to compare the salience of Gen Z language against general language: by finding out what’s known as a keyness measure we could calculate how salient certain words and concepts are for this generation compared with the general population. A very obvious example would be “lol”: you would expect “lol” to occur far more frequently within this age group than outside it and that was the case. But there were other examples: “collab” “collaboration” and “collaborate” are far more frequent. “Relatable” “friend” and words to do with authenticity such as “real” and “true” and “honest” and therefore “fake” as well are far more salient. Also the first person pronoun “I” was three times more frequent in iGen when compared with the general corpora.

The prevalence of “I” could suggest that Gen Zers are more individualistic and self-obsessed.

It could also be that they’re better at expressing their own opinions.

You found that Gen Zers place particular value on collaboration. Why is that and how does it manifest?

I think that tech has really facilitated collaboration among them since they were young. It has helped them find people who are like them it has facilitated community for them it’s provided platforms for joint activities. It’s how they socialise and find hook-ups it’s how they do activism it is how they learn. We certainly find in the teaching environment that students prefer group projects to working solo.

Why are matters of identity so charged for Gen Z?

I think it’s probably because gender and sexuality is in flux currently and Gen Zers really recognise that. It’s just very interesting to them.

With your linguistics class at Stanford you compiled a dictionary of words relating to sex and gender that they considered unique or characteristic of Gen Z. Could you pick out a few that you’d never encountered before?

I thought that a “unicorn” was a successful tech startup not a bisexual woman who non-committally joins a straight couple for sex. I also wasn’t familiar with much to do with fan fiction so expressions like “slash shipping” and “femslash shipping” which is when you advocate for romance between either two male or two female fictional characters or celebrities.

What about “sapiosexual”?

I loved that. That’s someone who’s attracted to intelligence.

Do you find that Gen Zers are more inclusive and tolerant of difference than older generations? Or is that just a facet of youth?

I think they definitely are more accepting. They are very sensitive and mindful of other people and they care about them and that can manifest itself in ways that older generations might find surprising. In 2019 the Oxford student union decided that rather than clapping after someone speaks they would do jazz hands because that was more considerate to people who are neurodiverse for whom the noise and the vibration of clapping might be disturbing. And I can remember being part of a conversation where an older person was saying that she found that ridiculous but then a younger student said: “It’s no biggie for me to do jazz hands rather than clap. If it helps someone else why not do it?”

Gen Z are facing a confusing present and a terrifying future. Did you find a lot of resentment towards older generations?

We didn’t encounter direct negativity but they certainly see themselves as having inherited a lot of problems from previous generations especially the environmental challenges and what plays out is scepticism about institutions.

What generation do you belong to and do you find it’s a useful label?

Interesting question. I’m a Gen X. And I’d probably find that label more helpful if someone had written a book like ours to explain it. But having said that I think that there’s something very particular about Gen Z purely for the fact that they are the first generation to never know a world without the internet and that does make them special.

Is there anything about Gen Z that you still find hard to understand?

I guess if I still don’t get something it’s memes – I don’t get the humour around some of the Gen Z memes.

And they’re also gaining a reputation for generating the majority of workplace complaints.

It is a source of growing frustration among many of my fellow Human Resources professionals that the youngest people in offices tend to bring grievances and misunderstandings no matter how minor to the desk of HR.

One HR Director recently told me: “We stopped offering free soda and you would think we imposed a pay cut. The complaints from the junior staff to HR were unreal. They act more entitled than anyone else.”

Another HR executive shared: “We had an employee who wasn’t performing well and was given a performance improvement plan. The next day I got a call from reception that the employee’s mother was there to see HR. She had brought a binder along with what she felt were performance examples to dispute the company’s assessment of their child.” This generation she added seems to allow “parental oversight/enablement” for a “much longer” period than previous ones.

“Maybe it’s a result of all those participation trophies!”

Attitudes in the workplace evolve as people age and one thing millennial and Gen X managers share is their frustration with their Gen Z workers. Getty Images

There was a time when millennials were criticized for being too sensitive in the workplace. But the eldest members of Gen Y are now well into adulthood and pushing 40 — old enough to be covered by age discrimination laws. Millennials still have more in common with their junior counterparts than with the older Gen X crowd (they both grew up in the digital age and are more comfortable with technology and more motivated by work that does societal good). But attitudes evolve as people age and one thing millennial and Gen X managers share is their frustration with their Gen Z workers.

“We had an employee complain to HR that they were being bullied” one frustrated millennial manager confessed to me. “Why? Because their manager told them that ‘flexibility’ didn’t mean they could just make their own hours and be offline whenever it suited them. Instead they had to discuss their schedule with their manager and be reachable during the company’s core working hours. That apparently is ‘bullying.’”

Perhaps Gen Z’s behavior in the workplace is not surprising. This youngest generation is the most diverse most educated most progressive and most pro-government in history. According to Pew research 70 percent of Gen Zers say the government should do more to solve problems rather than businesses and individuals. In short they want a higher power to intervene and fix their problems.

Plus they have come of age when so many aspects of life are viewed as matters of identity — and where “safety” means protection not just from actual harm but from perceived harm. If members of Gen Z see HR as the function designed to protect them as they move from college to the office it makes sense that HR is the first place they go to air their grievances.

Gen Z seems to allow “parental oversight/enablement” for a much longer period than previous ones. Getty Images

But constantly bringing minor issues to HR has major consequences. HR professionals are obligated to probe and report every problem that crosses their desk. More cases means less time for matters that involve serious issues like discrimination and sexual harassment which require a great deal of attention to investigate properly.

Culture is critical – and HR plays a leading role — but culture is defined by everyone’s behavior from executive leaders to the most junior people in the company. Gen Z in short needs to take some responsibility for their own personal growth. Before rushing to HR to complain young employees should try spending more time talking to their bosses and colleagues first. Most workplace conflicts (particularly those that don’t rise the level of unlawful conduct) are best solved between coworkers.

If that doesn’t work they should go to HR for help — but never ever ask their parents to intervene!

Aadhaar Seva Kendra inaugurated by Rajeev Chandrasekhar and General (Dr) V.K Singh (Retd) at Ghaziabad U.P.



A step in taking forward PM Narendra Modi’s vision of empowering people with technology



This is the 5th ASK in UP 4 more to be inaugurated soon



Rs 1.78 lac crore - savings made to public exchequer owing to use of Aadhaar and DBT : Rajeev Chandrasekhar

Rajeev Chandrasekhar Minister of State for Skill Development & Entrepreneurship and Electronics & Information Technology and General (Dr) V.K Singh (Retd) Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways and Civil Aviation jointly inaugurated the 5th Aadhaar Seva Kendra in UP at Ghaziabad today. The ASK has a capacity to handle request from 1000 residents per day.

On this occasion Rajeev Chandrasekhar congratulated everyone and said that this public facility is dedicated purely to the residents of Ghaziabad. He mentioned about his old connect with the city as he spent 2 years of his life as a student staying at the Hindon airbase since his father was an officer in the Indian Airforce.

He spoke about the vision of PM Narendra Modi on Digital India which lays out 3 broad outcomes for Technology to achieve in a developing country like India. These are :-

Technology to transform the lives of citizens To expand Economic opportunities To create strategic capabilities in certain technologies

He highlighted the achievements of the Digital India Campaign over the last 6 years and remarked that 100 paise released from the Government of India towards welfare of poor and needy now reach into their accounts at the click of a button. This he contrasted with the statement given by a former PM back in the 80’s where he admitted that only 15 paise out of 100 paise released by the Central Government reaches the beneficiaries.

He also cited the example of indigenously developed CoWIN platform that has facilitated vaccination of over 100 crore people in India and is now the most sought after platform among various counties for managing their vaccination programme.

He credited the success of this transformation to the vision of PM Narendra Modi towards use of technology for Direct benefit transfer by making use of Aadhaar that has plugged all leakages from the system and prevented corruption.

Talking about Aadhaar he said that around 313 central government schemes have been notified to use Aadhaar for leak-proof delivery of various social welfare benefits like PM-KISAN PM Aawaas Yojana PM Jan Arogya Yojana PAHAL MGNREGA National Social Security Assistance Programme PDS (in-kind benefits through Aadhaar authentication)etc.

He later added that the savings made to public exchequer owing to use of Aadhaar and DBT primarily due to weeding out of fake and duplicate beneficiaries have been estimated to be to the tune of Rupees 1.78 lakh crores (as on Mar 2020; as per DBT Mission Cabinet Secretariat).

Speaking on the occasion General (Dr) V.K Singh (Retd) thanked government for starting the ASK in Ghaziabad. He said that this centre will make aadhaar related services for residents easy. Now people can update their aadhaar and also enroll for Aadhaar at the centre.

Shri Saurav Garg CEO UIDAI said that UIDAI plans to operate 166 ASKs in 122 cities throughout India. So far establishment of 58 ASKs completed and started functioning. All the ASKs are air-conditioned designed with adequate seating capacity and also Divyang friendly.

He emphasized that UIDAI is moving forward by making aadhaar services easier for citizens. In this direction we are focusing on online aadhaar updation services where residents can update their aadhaar using mobile app and also by visiting the self service update portal of UIDAI he added.

Deputy Director General UIDAI Regional Office Lucknow Shri Prasant Kumar Singh said that new ASKs are also planned for Gorakhpur Kanpur & Greater Noida and likely to be completed during the current financial year itself.

Speaking on the occasion Shri Nitish Sinha ADG UIDAI RO Lucknow said this that this is the 5th Aadhaar Seva Kendra in UP after Agra Lucknow Prayagraj & Meerut. He further further said that dry run has started in ASKs at Gonda & Varanasi and very soon the dry run will start at Moradabad & Saharanpur.

UP has achieved Aadhaar saturation level of 90.66% (with respect to projected population of 2021).

To provide Aadhaar related services 10400+ Aadhaar kits are functional in UP (which includes 2700+ CSC BCs and 3000+ IPPB CELC Kits). These kits have carried approximately 5.17 Lakhs new Aadhaar enrolment and 22 Lakhs updates during last one month.

In Ghaziabad district itself 145 Aadhaar kits are functional (which includes 21 CSC BCs and 38 IPPB CELC Kits). These kits have carried approximately 9 thousand new Aadhaar enrolment and 33 thousand updates during last one month.

As we wrote in mid-November in October this year the US Air Force conducted tests of this gun in Arizona. The systems were tested on a modified Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter which is used as a “flying laboratory” instead of the FARA helicopter. It is noted that the new weapon will be much more powerful and effective than the one used in the predecessor. For example the new 20-mm cannon XM915 has three barrels and an electric drive thanks to which the pistol can fire 1500 shots per minute [in the single-barrel system of the Bell OH-58D Kiowa helicopter this figure is 1025 rounds].

“It shoots fast it shoots well and it shoots accurately” Army Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Keogh the Chief of Flight Test for U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command did say about the XM915’s performance in a statement released earlier this month. “As a previous attack and recon pilot I like it.”

Information on the XM915 20mm Gatling-type automatic cannon is still scarce as it is under development but BulgarianMilitary.com sources have brought more light around the product. What we do know is that it was successfully mounted on a helicopter and showed very good performance during the shooting demonstration.

The XM915 20mm Gatling will weigh 115 pounds and works with an electric propulsion system that will fire 20x102mm electrically loaded ammunition.

XM915 20mm Gatling is a small part of the large-scale FARA project. Under this program in addition to the XM915 20mm Gatling-type automatic cannon developers will have to integrate other weapons capabilities such as launching stray ammunition AGM-179A air-to-surface missiles drone swarms and more. Successful tests of the XM915 20mm Gatling-type automatic cannon do not mean that it will find a place in the final design of future helicopters.

The other participant in this program is Northrup Gruman who already presented in March this year a 20 mm single-barrel Sky Viper cannon. General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems believe that if their product is not approved for part of FARA’s armaments they will target international markets and offer it like a monkey to customers who have already purchased American helicopters.

Eventually the MCX Spear will be fitted with a fire control group called the Vortex system.

The United States military is finally replacing the beloved M4 along with the M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW). This change is said to be coming in 2021. This will be the first major weapons platform change since 1994 when the M4 became the standard issue rifle for the United States military. Now it’s time for a change. Not only is the military swapping out platforms but it’s also changing calibers.

The military was seeking out something that had manageable recoil and high velocity like 5.56 but also wanted something with superior stopping power like 7.62. Despite having lethality on its side the U.S. wanted to avoid the heaviness and higher recoil of the 7.62 cartridge. This ended with the selection of 6.8 mm.

6.8 mm was specifically designed to address the long-distance ballistics issues of 5.56 NATO and serve as a way to close the gap between 5.56 and 7.62. It can’t match the stopping power of the 7.62 but it’s lighter faster and has less recoil. 6.8 is also more easily controlled in burst fire.

There are 3 contenders bidding to be the new platform for the new 6.8mm: Sig Sauer General Dynamics and Textron Systems.

Sig Sauer brings the MCX Spear to the table sporting a familiar design to the M4. Meaning little additional training will be necessary for soldiers to adapt to the new platform. Its weight is probably the same as the M4 as well but no specifics have been given except that it’s under 10 pounds. What’s interesting is that all Spear rifles come with a built-in suppressor to counter the muzzle blast (recoil) from the new cartridge. Eventually the MCX Spear will be fitted with a fire control group called the Vortex system. It’s a suite of optics rangefinders and even a ballistic computer. This technology could lead to the average soldier having superior shooting ability even without sharpshooter training. The computer determines the trajectory of the bullet before it’s fired making it almost trivial to land shots.

They also have the 6.8 LMG on the table but even fewer details have been given out about the MCX Spear’s sibling firearm. Sig Sauer claims that its new LMG platform weighs 40 percent less than its predecessors. Recoil is also said to be “dramatically” reduced in the new platform. The new LMG will also feature quick-detach magazines more M-LOK rail space the aforementioned suppressor and “vastly improves upon the operation and function of the legacy M249.”

The military will be selecting one of the three companies by October of 2021. After that the selected company will have a year to make rifles for the 2022 rollout. These rifles won’t be given out to all U.S. soldiers though. Special forces and recon are among the first to receive the rifles with the rest to receive them in the following years.

The US Army has announced plans to buy an additional eight Directed Energy Mobile Short-Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD) vehicle prototypes through fiscal year 2024.

According to an announcement from the service’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) Kord Technologies a KBR subsidiary will deliver four Stryker vehicles equipped with laser weapon systems in FY2023 and another four in FY2024.

RCCTO said the DE M-SHORAD prototypes will incorporate design changes to reduce overall weight and increase maintainability on the system.

The contract value is yet to be either determined or revealed.

The army announcement on the purchases follows the completion of a DE M-SHORAD “combat shoot-off” from earlier this year which culminated with US Army soldiers executing a series of vignettes demonstrating the capabilities of a laser-equipped Stryker against representative threats in a realistic environment.

DE M-SHORAD is a fully mobile 50-kilowatt (kW)-class high energy laser (HEL) capable of delivering sustained counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS) and counter-rocket artillery mortar (C-RAM) firepower to the modern battlefield.

Kord is the prime contractor and lead integrator for the program. The army said in August this year that a platoon of four laser-equipped Strykers remains on track for delivery by FY2022.

The laser weapons that are employed by the system are being supplied by Raytheon after Northrop Grumman dropped out of the competition during the combat shoot-off.

The DE M-SHORAD prototyping effort is part of the Army’s larger modernization strategy for air and missile defense. It promises to offer lethality against unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and rockets artillery and mortars (RAM) while reducing total system lifecycle cost through reduced logistical demand.

In a separate effort General Dynamics Land Systems and Epirus have joined forces to integrate a laser weapon system on the US Army’s Stryker vehicle for enhanced mobile short range air defense (SHORAD) capabilities. The Leonidas directed energy weapon and broader high-power microwave technology will aim to introduce a capability to counter drone swarms.",,,,,,
GIS,General Mills,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtZ3JvY2VyeS1pdGVtcy1oYXZlLXNocnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shoppers Say These 6 Grocery Items Have Majorly Shrunk in Size,"By now shoppers have become well acquainted with this year's rising grocery prices. With supply chain delays the decreased labor market and production shortages costs of goods have increased—and they aren't expected to go down anytime soon. In fact one supermarket CEO predicted another 10% spike in food prices before the end of 2021.

But there's another way that food suppliers are eating away at your budget that you may not have even noticed. It's called ""shrinkflation."" Instead of explicitly marking up prices companies deliver a slightly smaller product for the same dollar amount. According to News Nation Now it's one method for avoiding shortages when production costs are high an indirect form of rationing.

Consumers saw product shrinkage in the first half of 2021. But as inflation ticks up businesses still have to decide how to best provide their goods to consumers. We noted six popular grocery items that have shed a few ounces in recent months.

Cereal

If your box of Rice Krispies seems to be disappearing faster than usual you're not imagining it.

Consumer advocate and founder of consumerworld.org Edgar Dworsky discovered evidence of General Mills downsizing their cereal boxes in July 2021 NPR says. The family-sized packages of Cocoa Puffs and Cheerios had new designs but were missing 1.2 ounces (from 19.3 to 18.1 ounces). Meanwhile the checkout price remained the same.

Revamped packaging can disguise shrinkage. According to the article by NPR another shopper posted on social media that a brand-new version of Cinnamon Toast Crunch was taller than the old one but even this box had lost half an ounce.

General Mills' press statement at the end of June 2021 explained their measures to combat an expected 7% inflation for cost of goods in 2022 through these ""pricing actions.""

Tostitos Tortilla Chips

Dworsky found another Frito-Lay downsize in August. According to his blog mouseprint.org a bag of Tostitos Hint of Lime cut its regular 13 ounces to 11 and Hint of Guacamole dropped from 13 to 12 ounces.

Bounty Paper Towels

In June 2021 Costco lovers noticed a reduced sheet count in Kirkland Paper Towels along with other quality and quantity changes in several products sold at the bulk warehouse.

Now Bounty is cutting back on their paper goods. Dworsky reported in August at mouseprint.org that the ""quicker-picker-upper"" removed 8 paper towels per roll. ""Last winter paper products manufacturers alerted shoppers that prices would go up this past June because of higher manufacturing and distribution costs"" he wrote.

Metropolis Coffee

Twitter user @WallStreetSilv put two bags of Metropolis Coffee Company's blend of Xeno's Decaf side by side to compare the whole bean roasts. The previous package held 12 ounces but the new one has only 10.5 ounces. The company began in Chicago in 2003.

12 oz –$12.49

10.5 oz –$12.49 Change the bag a little bit make it taller.

Take away 1.5 oz and keep the same price. #shrinkflation #inflation pic.twitter.com/ig9MkXr9HC — Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) November 16 2021

Since May 2021 there have been coffee shortages from Brazil due to lower levels of rainfall. As one of the world's largest producers of the caffeinated beans the decreased supply may have pushed coffee distributors to make up the cost one way or another.

Barilla Pasta

A box of Barilla Rigatoni used to make a full pound (about 454 grams) of pasta. Redditor u/Emander712 picked up the new box that Barilla stocked on shelves in September—only this one was 44 grams lighter.

Pearl Milling Company Maple Syrup

The October 2021 rebranding of Aunt Jemima Maple Syrup presented consumers with a taller thinner bottle. However as noted by the Reddit user u/RocketGoBoom this included Pearl Milling Company filling the container with just 710 milliliters of golden syrup meaning technically the bottle at the grocery store shrunk. That's 40 milliliters less syrup than the original.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9tZXJjaGFudHMtZmxlZXQtb3JkZXJzLTU0MDAtbW9yZS1icmlnaHRkcm9wLXRydWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merchants Fleet orders 5400 more BrightDrop trucks,"The US fleet management company Merchants Fleet has placed another large order for electric delivery vans with the General Motors brand BrightDrop. Having already ordered 12600 EV600s Merchants Fleet is now ordering 5400 of the recently unveiled smaller EV410 offshoot.

With the current order and the 12600 EV600s already ordered in February Merchants Fleet has now ordered a total of 18000 electric vans from the GM brand. The BrightDrop EV600s are known to be delivered to Merchants Fleet from 2023.

BrightDrop announced the EV410 at the end of September with production scheduled to start in 2023. As an offshoot of the EV600 the EV410 adopts some features of its big brother: the range is also said to be 250 miles (402 kilometres) which suggests that the EV410 also incorporates Ultium’s battery technology. The dimensions are naturally somewhat smaller. The cargo space holds 400 cubic feet (11.3 cubic metres) with an overall vehicle length of 20 feet (six metres) and a wheelbase of just over 150 inches (3.8 metres). BrightDrop puts the gross vehicle weight rating at “less than 10000 pounds” or less than 4.5 tonnes.

“Merchants Fleet’s plan to purchase such a large order of our electric commercial vehicles shows they are serious about leading the fleet industry’s transformation to an all-electric future and confident in BrightDrop’s ability to bring that vision to life” said Travis Katz BrightDrop president and CEO. “The collaboration with Merchants Fleet opens the door for other companies that want to electrify their fleets by providing access to our portfolio of electric vehicles which is a critical step toward decreasing vehicle-related emissions in the communities where we live.”

Merchants Fleet describes itself as the “fastest-growing fleet management company in the country.” The company offers flexible financing and service options for organisations that want to use but not buy vehicles.

“We are dedicated to meeting our fleet clients’ EV needs from top to bottom” said Merchants Fleet CEO Brendan P. Keegan. “Every fleet has different requirements so we need to provide flexibility and offer best-in-class solutions at every level. The electrification of fleet is no longer in the future – it is here and we are proud to work with BrightDrop to reach diverse segments and drive this transformation forward.”

After WWII ended in 1945 the American automobile industry which had largely been re-tasked for producing vehicles and goods for the war effort was released to return to their former line of business. There was much being said about what the new line of post-war vehicles would look like and the late 1940s were a time of major upheaval on both sides of the Atlantic.

As the United States prepared to enter the 1950s a new decade of hope with the war far in the rearview mirror American car designers were given more freedom than ever before. They created what we now call the “Jet Age.”

Based in 1949 this film captures the design process right as the country was on the cusp of the 1950s. It’s fascinating to see the purely analogue design process long before computers and CAD made their appearance in the development studios.

We’ve included another film in this series below called Up From Clay this is another General Motors design film but it’s from exactly 10 years later in 1959. It’s interesting to see all of the differences in design between the two eras just a decade apart.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vbmV3cy9hdXRvL3VzLXByZXNpZGVudC1qb2UtYmlkZW4tdHJpZXMtaGlzLWhhbmRzLW9uLXRoZS1uZXctZ21jLWh1bW1lci1ldi13YXRjaC12aWRlby00NDU3OTg3Lmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2F1dG8vdXMtcHJlc2lkZW50LWpvZS1iaWRlbi10cmllcy1oaXMtaGFuZHMtb24tdGhlLW5ldy1nbWMtaHVtbWVyLWV2LXdhdGNoLXZpZGVvLTQ0NTc5ODcuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US President Joe Biden Tries His Hands on the New GMC Hummer EV - Watch Video,"The president of the United States Joe Biden is one of the most influential people in the world and naturally he is surrounded by an abundance of security personnel. Biden’s convoy is heavily guarded and we do not think he ever gets a chance to drive the heavy vehicles himself. So when he got the chance to actually get his hands behind the wheel of a Hummer he made sure that he got the best out of it.

Recently Biden was present at the inauguration of the General Motors Factory ZERO EV which marks a major milestone in the journey of General Motors towards becoming an all-electric automaker. The company hones the production line of the Hummer EV and Biden got the chance to drive one of the first production by the company.

In the video sourced from C-Span Biden is seen listening to the initial instructions intently. Moments later Biden pushes the pedal slowly and the EV starts moving. However after making a turn towards a clear path he zooms off with the Hummer EV as if he is a well-trained drag racer. At the end of his ride Biden looks immensely impressed with the performance of the GMC Hummer EV and calls the Electric Truck “Incredible.""

General Motors started the production of the first-ever all-electric vehicle somewhere around September and believes that the trucks will be delivered to interested buyers by the end of this year. The company claims that almost 80% of the production line is similar to other production lines owned by the company and hence it will take an equal time to produce the EVs as it takes to produce other vehicles by the company.

Also Watch:

The GMC Hummer EV is powered by three electric motors which push an estimated 1000 horsepower and a torque of 15591 Nm pulling the truck from 0-100 in 3 swift seconds. The car is expected to cover a distance of roughly 563 kilometres on a full charge.

Some need four and in America drug companies charge about $100 a vial—nearly seven times more than in any other OECD country. Older Americans a third of whom live with diabetes could soon pay as little as $35 a month thanks to a bill that the Democrats are trying to fast-track through Congress much to the dismay of the pharmaceutical industry which argues that the cost caps will damage innovation.

Prescription drugs in America cost two and a half times more on average than in other developed countries. At the moment the federal government cannot negotiate with pharma firms over the prices of the drugs they sell as other countries do. In Britain for example the NHS negotiates discounted prices with pharmaceutical companies and only after another public body has determined if a drug is beneficial enough to justify the price. In America pharmaceutical companies are in effect the price makers. If passed this bill would allow the government to have some say in drug prices for the first time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzIwL2lzLW1lcmNrLXN0b2NrLWEtYnV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Merck Stock a Buy?,"The company's financial results are rebounding from their pandemic lows.

Many drugmakers suffered at the height of the pandemic as sales volumes for prescription drugs decreased. Pharma giant Merck (MRK -0.13%) was one of those companies that saw financial results took a hit due to the outbreak. As a result the company's shares have significantly lagged the market in the past year.

However a couple of recent developments could help Merck turn things around. With that as a backdrop let's look at Merck's overall business and decide whether it is worth buying the company's shares today.

Solid growth drivers

Merck's business has become almost synonymous with its flagship product Keytruda. This cancer drug is one of the best-selling medicines in the world and it continues to rack up label expansions. In terms of revenue Merck is far from having peaked too: During the third quarter ending Sept. 30 sales of the drug jumped by 22% year over year to $4.5 billion.

Keytruda is still undergoing a raft of clinical trials and it is expected to become the top-selling drug in the world within the next few years. That's why it will continue to feature squarely in Merck's growth strategy. But the company does have other opportunities. Most notably Merck's animal health segment is performing well. During the third quarter sales of the company's animal health business increased by 16% to $1.4 billion.

Merck is one of the most prominent players in the animal health space. According to some estimates the animal health market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% through 2028.

Let's not forget about Merck's human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines Gardasil and Gardasil 9 the combined sales of which soared by 68% to $2 billion during the third quarter. The drugmaker's total sales came in at $13.1 billion 20% higher than the year-ago period. Merck's current lineup of products is robust and it is about to get even better.

More opportunities ahead

Recent events have made Merck a more attractive investment. First there is molnupiravir a coronavirus drug it developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Merck released positive results from a phase 3 clinical trial for molnupiravir in October. The company reported that the therapy decreased the risk of hospitalization or death by 50% in patients with mild to moderate cases of COVID-19.

None of the patients treated with this medicine died during the study while eight deaths were recorded in the placebo arm. These results are significant since most leading COVID-19 therapies have severe limitations. Veklury marketed by Gilead Sciences is administered by intravenous infusion while REGEN-COV -- which was developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals -- is administered via infusion or subcutaneous injection.

A pill is much easier for patients to take and that's why molnupiravir could capture a decent share of this market. The medicine was recently approved in the U.K. and Merck is awaiting word from health authorities in the U.S. and the EU. The company also announced agreements to supply several governments (including the U.S.) with millions of courses of molnupiravir pending regulatory approval. This medicine will have a meaningful impact on Merck's top line for much of the rest of the pandemic -- and perhaps beyond if COVID-19 becomes a seasonal illness.

Lastly Merck plans to acquire all outstanding shares of Acceleron Pharma for $180 per share in cash. The company hopes to close this deal in the fourth quarter -- that is between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31. Merck has big plans for Acceleron's leading pipeline candidate sotatercept. According to Merck's CEO Rob Davis ""Sotatercept has the potential to become foundational as an add-on therapy in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension where there is a strong need for a new agent that can potentially address the underlying illness and not just the symptoms of this grievous disease.""

Investors can expect the deal to strengthen Merck's pipeline and therefore its overall business.

Why Merck's stock is a buy

Merck's flagship product Keytruda still boasts a long runway for growth and the company's HPV vaccines are expected to bring in increasingly high sales over the next several years. Then there is the company's animal health business its promising coronavirus drug molnupiravir and the pending acquisition of Acceleron Pharma that will add more fuel to its growth engine.

Merck's business looks rock solid and with a forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.4 compared to an average forward P/E ratio of 13.9 for the pharma industry Merck is reasonably valued. That's why despite its poor showing in the past year I believe that Merck is well-positioned to perform much better in the long run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzIxLzEtY2FuY2VyLXN0b2NrLW9uLWJ1eW91dC13YXRjaC1pbi0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 Cancer Stock on Buyout Watch in 2022,"Cardiff Oncology is a prime takeover target heading into 2022.

The pharmaceutical industry appears poised for a record-breaking level of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in 2022. Four emerging trends back up this assertion.

First Pfizer (PFE -0.60%) and Moderna are both flush with cash thanks to their novel coronavirus vaccines. Second Novartis recently banked $21 billion after selling its two decade long position in Roche. Third Amgen AstraZeneca Biogen Bristol Myers Squibb Gilead Sciences Johnson & Johnson Merck Moderna Pfizer and Sanofi are all expected to pursue bolt-on acquisitions next year to flesh out their clinical pipelines and product portfolios. Fourth Novo Nordisk and Roche can both be counted on for at least one small to mid-sized acquisition per year.

Which segment of the pharmaceutical space will see the most business development activity in 2022? If history is any guide promising early stage cancer companies will continue to be a particularly hot area for M&A next year. Cardiff Oncology (CRDF 0.30%) for instance is a small-cap cancer company that comes across as uber-attractive takeover target. Here's a look at upside potential and downside risk associated with this promising biotech stock.

A look at Cardiff's upside potential and downside risk

Cardiff Oncology is a tiny developmental stage cancer company at this point in its life cycle. The star of the show for the company is its Polo-like Kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor ovansertib.

PLK1 inhibition has shown promise in the clinic before with other molecules but the toxicity of these earlier generation drugs kept them from hitting the market. Ovansertib for its part has so far shown a high degree of on-target specificity and low levels of toxicity in early stage trials.

The drug is presently in a basket of early to-mid stage trials for advanced forms of colorectal pancreatic and prostate cancer. Its lead indication is KRAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer which is on track to yield top line data in May of 2022 according to clinicaltrials.gov.

Why is Cardiff on buyout watch heading into this all-important data reveal? Last week the company announced that Pfizer bought a $15 million equity stake in the company and agreed to appoint one of its key executives to Cardiff's Scientific Advisory Board once formed.

What's noteworthy about this partnership is that it appears to be a nearly identical repeat of Pfizer's initial interest in Trillium Therapeutics last year. Specifically Pfizer first took a $25 million equity stake in Trillum and helped the drugmaker form a Scientific Advisory Board. Eleven months later Pfizer decided to buy Trillium for approximately $2.2 billion. Early shareholders in the clinical-stage biotech thus walked away with gains in excess of 4800% in roughly two years' time although the bulk of these gains occurred before Pfizer entered the picture.

Now Cardiff isn't guaranteed to fetch a tender offer from its newfound partner. But if ovansertib hits the mark in advanced colorectal cancer next May Pfizer probably won't hesitate to call the exact same play for Cardiff. Underscoring this point Pfizer also worked the right of first access to the company's clinical data into this deal. That's a strong sign that this smallish equity investment may turn out to be a prelude to a formal buyout offer down the road.

So if all the stars align Cardiff's stock might be gearing up for a Trillium-like run over the next six months.

The main downside risk here is that early stage cancer assets fail more often than not. And Pfizer is in no way obligated to stick around if ovansertib flops. In turn a clinical setback for ovansertib would almost certainly wreck havoc on its share price. Driving this point home this singular drug candidate is essentially the company's entire value proposition at this stage of the game.",,,,,,

Contactless payment technology is one of these advancements which is becoming increasingly popular with mobile payments such as Apple Pay and Google Pay joining in alongside contactless credit and debit cards.

The convenience of contactless payment technology has made it an easy way to make purchases without dealing with the hassle of pulling out cash. This article explores the potential of contactless payment technology and where it may be heading in the future.

The rise of contactless payments and a cashless society

Contactless payment technology is a unique advancement that has completely changed how people transact for goods and services on the go. With the popularity of mobile payments contactless credit cards and other payment systems taking off in recent years it is clear that this trend will not be slowing down anytime soon.

According to a recent report by investment management firm Bailard ""In recent years we have seen rapid global adoption of a superior form of digital payments: contactless payments (also known as “contactless” “tap to pay” “NFC payments”). Currently consumers interact with contactless payments through two primary forms – contactless-enabled credit and debit cards and mobile wallets (such as Apple Pay Google Pay and Samsung Pay).""

The steady reduction in the number of cash points and the shift towards online banking and modernised payment processes according to Michael Schrezenmaier CEO Europe at SumUp has accelerated the move toward a cashless society in recent years. He said ""There's no doubt that some of the biggest innovations in regards to merchant products and services being utilised in the industry have been around contactless payment solutions. What's more the onset of COVID-19 and the need for merchants to respect social distancing measures and health guidelines put in place by the government has meant that this reliance on contactless payment solutions has become even more important over the past 18 months.""

A cashless society has many benefits for both individuals and businesses. From an individual perspective it is much easier to make purchases without physically carrying cash around when they are out shopping or dining at a restaurant. Furthermore making payments in this way prevents the risk of losing money if their wallet is stolen while on the go. It also goes a long way in terms of tracking payments so law enforcement agencies can easily identify individuals who are involved in illegal activity.

The significant increase in contactless payment technology also benefits businesses. For example with the rise of mobile payments systems such as Apple Pay and Google Pay retailers are finding it much easier to accept card transactions on the go without the need for an expensive payment terminal or contactless terminal machine. As well as this the time it takes to make payments is much faster than paying with cash or cheques and there's no need for change when making small purchases.

The difference between contactless cards and smartphones

There are three main differences when it comes to NFC on a powered device such as a smartphone over contactless cards according to Dickson Chu CEO at Copper and a former Managing Director at Citibank;

1) Peer-to-peer so two NFC-enabled devices can establish a connection and share data;

Peer-to-peer so two NFC-enabled devices can establish a connection and share data; 2) Read/write so an active device such as a phone can pick up data from a passive device without the capability of reading information itself such as a contactless piece of plastic;

Read/write so an active device such as a phone can pick up data from a passive device without the capability of reading information itself such as a contactless piece of plastic; 3) Card emulation so people could create digital copies and reproductions of physical cards.

This difference means smartphones hold a lot of potentials when it comes to playing in this space. With the rise of smartphones and mobile devices there is a lot more opportunity for unexpected use-cases of contactless payment technology.

In terms of security with card emulation on Android devices users get all the benefits that come from physical cards (such as tokenisation) without the drawbacks. For example unlike contactless cards where people are limited to certain types of payments or have restrictions on how much they can spend per transaction there is no such limitation with mobile devices.

The future of contactless payments

According to Greg Goldfarb VP of Commerce Products at GoDaddy ""Although many social distancing restrictions have eased in the last two years consumers developed new habits that have become expectations for how they shop —one in particular is a shift to contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Consumers are becoming a lot more comfortable relying on a digital wallet and reducing the usage of their physical credit cards.""

While there have been many advancements in contactless payment technology in recent years this is just the beginning of what seems to be a considerable shift towards cashlessness. As society becomes more reliant on mobile devices and contactless payment solutions are integrated into everyday life it will not be long until we enter an era where physical money feels antiquated.

""The push from regulators to go cashless will speed ahead and we're certain to see the continued closure of branch banks in small towns across Europe eliminating easy access to cash and further reinforcing the reliance on contactless payment solutions. Concurrently as consumer behaviours keep demanding better and more innovative products as well as the continued growth of ecommerce we're likely to see a wider variety of mobile payment solutions such as further NFC-enabled payment trends (such as wearable payment devices like watches and rings) in addition to innovations in QR code payments"" adds Schrezenmaier.

In summary the future of contactless payment technology is bright and it seems these innovations will only continue to grow into the foreseeable future. With many people already preferring digital forms of payments to card transactions the fact that there are now more contactless payment terminals than ever before is just another step in this process. As well as this with new developments such as Apple Pay moving to a cashier-less store concept which does not require any NFC hardware at all but instead uses Bluetooth technology and facial recognition software means people could be living in a cashless society in a matter of years.

(That could be an undercount because not all Facebook pages are tracked by CrowdTangle.) Many have millions of followers and likely reach even more users. In his 2019 report Allen found that 75% of users who were exposed to clickbait content from farms run in Macedonia and Kosovo had never followed any of the pages. Facebook’s content-recommendation system had instead pushed it into their news feeds.

When MIT Technology Review sent Facebook a list of these pages and a detailed explanation of our methodology Osborne called the analysis “flawed.” “While some Pages here may have been on our publisher lists many of them didn’t actually monetize on Facebook” he said.

Indeed these numbers do not indicate that all of these pages generated ad revenue. Instead it is an estimate based on data Facebook has made publicly available of the number of pages associated with clickbait actors in Cambodia and Vietnam that Facebook has made eligible to monetize on the platform.

Osborne also confirmed that more of the Cambodia-run clickbait-like pages we found had directly registered with one of Facebook’s monetization programs than we previously believed. In our analysis we found 35% of the pages in our clusters had done so in the last two years. The other 65% would have indirectly generated ad revenue by heavily promoting content from the registered page to a wider audience. Osborne said that in fact about half of the pages we found or roughly 150 more pages had directly registered at one point with a monetization program primarily Instant Articles.

Shortly after we approached Facebook operators of clickbait pages in Myanmar began complaining in online forums that their pages had been booted out of Instant Articles. Osborne declined to respond to our questions about the latest enforcement actions the company has taken.

Facebook has continuously sought to weed these actors out of its programs. For example only 30 of the Cambodia-run pages are still monetizing Osborne said. But our data from Facebook’s publisher lists shows enforcement is often delayed and incomplete—clickbait pages can stay within monetization programs for hundreds of days before they are taken down. The same actors will also spin up new pages once their old ones have demonetized.

Allen is now open-sourcing the code we used to encourage other independent researchers to refine and build on our work.

Using the same methodology we also found more than 400 foreign-run pages targeting predominantly US audiences in clusters that appeared in Facebook’s Publisher lists over the last two years. (We did not include pages from countries whose primary language is English.) The set includes a monetizing cluster run in part out of Macedonia aimed at women and the LGBTQ community. It has eight Facebook pages including two verified ones with over 1.7 million and 1.5 million followers respectively and posts content from five websites each registered with Google AdSense and Audience Network. It also has three Instagram accounts which monetize through gift shops and collaborations and by directing users to the same largely plagiarized websites. Admins of the Facebook pages and Instagram accounts did not respond to our requests for comment.

The LGBT News and Women's Rights News pages on Facebook post identical content from five of its own affiliated sites monetizing with Instant Articles and Google AdSense as well as from other news outlets that it appears to have paid partnerships with.

Osborne said Facebook is now investigating the accounts after we brought them to the company’s attention. Choi said Google has removed AdSense ads from hundreds of pages on these sites in the past because of policy violations but that the sites themselves are still allowed to monetize based on the company’s regular reviews.

While it’s possible that the Macedonians who run the pages do indeed care about US politics and about women’s and LGBTQ rights the content is undeniably generating revenue. This means what they promote is most likely guided by what wins and loses with Facebook’s news feed algorithm.

The activity of a single page or cluster of pages may not feel significant says Camille François a researcher at Columbia University who studies organized disinformation campaigns on social media. But when hundreds or thousands of actors are doing the same thing amplifying the same content and reaching millions of audience members it can affect the public conversation. “What people see as the domestic conversation on a topic can actually be something completely different” François says. “It’s a bunch of paid people pretending to not have any relationship with one another optimizing what to post.”

Osborne said Facebook has created several new policies and enforcement protocols in the last two years to address this issue including penalizing pages run out of one country that behave as if they are local to another as well as penalizing pages that build an audience on the basis of one topic and then pivot to another. But both Allen and Rio say the company’s actions have failed to close fundamental loopholes in the platform’s policies and designs—vulnerabilities that are fueling a global information crisis.

“It’s affecting countries first and foremost outside the US but presents a massive risk to the US long term as well” Rio says. “It’s going to affect pretty much anywhere in the world when there are heightened events like an election.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3N3YXJhanlhbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzLWJyaWVmL3VwaS1pbi1kdWJhaS1ucGNpcy1nbG9iYWwtYXJtLWFuZC1uZXR3b3JrLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc2lnbi1wYWN0LWZvci11cGktcGF5bWVudC1zeXN0ZW0taW4tdWFl0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vc3dhcmFqeWFtYWcuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLWJyaWVmL3VwaS1pbi1kdWJhaS1ucGNpcy1nbG9iYWwtYXJtLWFuZC1uZXR3b3JrLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc2lnbi1wYWN0LWZvci11cGktcGF5bWVudC1zeXN0ZW0taW4tdWFl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPI In Dubai: NPCI's Global Arm And Network International Sign Pact For UPI Payment System In UAE,"Network International the leading enabler of digital commerce across the Middle East and Africa has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL) the international arm of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to discuss their collaboration on acceptance of NIPL's mobile-based real-time payment system Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

ARLINGTON Texas — After a first half filled with twists turns momentum swings and lead changes DeSoto just needed to hold on for a few more minutes.

But rather than simply maintaining their slim lead against Rockwall the Eagles doubled down defensively.

With the Yellowjackets desperately trying to claw their way back into the contest senior safety Devyn Bobby made a diving catch to secure his second interception of the game.

Bobby a Baylor commit led a lockdown performance for DeSoto’s secondary against one of the state’s highest-flying offenses to help the Eagles soar past Rockwall for a 49-28 win in the area round of the Class 6A Division I playoffs Saturday evening at Globe Life Field.

“It was a great win. We game planned for today very well. We knew they were going to try to trick us with some stuff so we tried to limit that but we only gave up 14 points (during the first half)” Bobby said.

“We went to the bench talked about it adjusted well and came out to finish the second half. … (The halftime message was) keep your composure don’t stop fighting and hold them until there’s 4 minutes left.”

Bobby headlined a banner game for DeSoto’s secondary which played airtight defense against a talented Rockwall receiving corps.

The Eagles wrestled away four turnovers all interceptions throughout the contest beginning with a pick on the first drive of the game courtesy of senior cornerback Elijah Shaw.

The team added three more interceptions during the fourth quarter including both of Bobby’s picks and a third by junior defensive back Caimon Mathis.

All three of the Eagles’ fourth-quarter interceptions came off deflected passes that halted promising Yellowjackets’ drives.

DeSoto also held Rockwall to its lowest completion rate (41.7%) of the season as a team and joined Mesquite as the only squads to limit the Jackets to 30 points or less this year.

“With those two high safeties we wanted to make sure we made a wall on their slot (receivers)” Bobby said. “They liked running RPOs so we had to make sure we walled those slots off and the safeties stayed deep. Our defensive line and LBs got some play too and that helped us get our picks.”

On the offensive side of the ball DeSoto senior running back Chris Henley Jr. stole the show entirely.

Henley gashed Rockwall’s defense with his power running en route to a gargantuan game on the ground. He ran 36 times for 232 yards and four rushing touchdowns all of which were game highs.

The Eagles’ workhorse back grew stronger as the game progressed.

He got DeSoto on the board initially with a 12-yard touchdown run about 9 minutes into the first quarter to tie the game at 7 and found the end zone again midway through the second quarter on a 5-yard rushing score to give his team its first lead.

Henley however really let loose during the fourth quarter.

He raced to the goal line for 52- and 22-yard touchdown runs during the final 6 minutes of game time to cement the Eagles’ victory.

“They were awesome tonight. The O-line is the heart of this team especially with Chris Henley running behind them” Bobby said. “A lot of people are sleeping on Chris but he’s a dawg and today he really helped us out.”

Rockwall was able to consistently move the ball downfield but the Yellowjackets were stung by turnovers that stymied a late comeback attempt.

The Jackets faced a 17-14 halftime deficit that quickly ballooned to a 13-point DeSoto advantage following a pair of Eagles’ scores.

Junior quarterback Lake Bennett’s 6-yard touchdown run on the final play of the third quarter however placed the Yellowjackets just six points behind the Eagles.

Rockwall even recovered a fumble to start its next drive defensively but three of the Jackets’ last four possessions on offense ended in tipped ball interceptions.

Senior quarterback Braedyn Locke — the all-time leader in career passing yards (11173) and touchdowns (128) in Class 6A Texas high school football history — finished with 252 yards and a touchdown pass while completing 20 of 48 pass attempts.

Bennett tallied 15 yards and three rushing scores on four carries for the Yellowjackets while senior wide receivers Caden Marshall Aiden Meeks and Brennan Ray caught five passes apiece for a combined 227 receiving yards and a touchdown.

Senior quarterback Matt Allen was sharp for DeSoto behind center too.

He finished with 217 yards and a pair of touchdowns through the air on 17-of-25 passing in addition to 48 rushing yards on six carries while senior wideout Jaylan Bean led all receivers with seven catches for 91 yards and a receiving score.

The season-ending loss concluded Rockwall’s 2021 campaign at 9-3 overall as the Yellowjackets were eliminated from the postseason by DeSoto in the area round of the 6A DI playoffs for the second straight season.

The Eagles improved to 10-2 this fall with the second-round playoff victory and advanced to the third round for the 16th straight season.

DeSoto will face Spring Westfield (12-0) in the Region II semifinals of the 6A DI playoffs at 4 p.m. Saturday at the Alamodome in San Antonio.

“We just need to play DeSoto football” Bobby said. “We’ll watch film and everything else will take care of itself.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1zcG9ydHMvZm9vdGJhbGwvMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9kZXNvdG8tc3Rvcm1lZC1wYXN0LXJvY2t3YWxsLTQ5LTI4LWJlaGluZC1mb3VyLWludGVyY2VwdGlvbnMtYW5kLWZvdXItdGRzLWZyb20tY2hyaXMtaGVubGV5LWpyL9IBsAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1zcG9ydHMvZm9vdGJhbGwvMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9kZXNvdG8tc3Rvcm1lZC1wYXN0LXJvY2t3YWxsLTQ5LTI4LWJlaGluZC1mb3VyLWludGVyY2VwdGlvbnMtYW5kLWZvdXItdGRzLWZyb20tY2hyaXMtaGVubGV5LWpyLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Behind four interceptions and four TDs from Chris Henley Jr. DeSoto stormed past Rockwall 49-28,"Click here to view box score

ARLINGTON — Not every week of practice begins on a high note. DeSoto’s didn’t as it prepared for a playoff game against Rockwall.

“Our kids got pissed off at us on Monday” DeSoto coach Claude Mathis said. “They felt we were giving [Rockwall] too much credit. They felt they could hold their own. It was a big blowup at practice on Monday.”

Mathis said he and the coaches slept on it came back to practice Tuesday and worked it all out. Maybe the players of DeSoto had a legitimate grievance. Maybe they could hold their own with Rockwall as they pleaded to the coaching staff.

“Lo and behold it happened” Mathis said. “Because we believe in those guys.”

DeSoto (10-2) held its own and then some against Rockwall (9-3) the 12th-ranked 6A team in the state on Saturday at Globe Life Field in Arlington. DeSoto’s defense intercepted Rockwall quarterback Braedyn Lock four times Chris Henley Jr. rushed for four touchdowns and DeSoto topped Rockwall 49-28 in the 6A-I Region II area round for the second straight year.

The distance between the two in the final score isn’t totally representative of the entire game though. Both sides scored two touchdowns apiece in the first half and DeSoto’s Angel Diaz kicked a 37-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter to give his side a 17-14 lead.

Things weren’t as competitive in the third.

DeSoto began the second half with the ball and launched a 17-play drive that ended with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Matt Allen to Mike Murphy. The extra point gave DeSoto a 24-14 lead.

Then DeSoto’s defense kicked in. It forced Rockwall to punt after three plays on the following possession. DeSoto followed with an 8-play 64-yard drive which ended with a Diaz field goal.

Rockwall punted to end its next drive but scored soon thereafter Robert Buck forced a DeSoto fumble and Will Rakow recovered it leading to a Lake Bennett touchdown run.

Rockwall cut the DeSoto lead to 27-21 but never got closer.

DeSoto intercepted Locke a Mississippi State commit three times in the fourth quarter — two by Baylor pledge Devyn Bobby and one from Caimon Mathis. DeSoto scored three times (twice on runs from Henley Jr. and once on a pass from Allen to Jaylan Bean) to storm out of Arlington with a win.

Henley Jr. finished with 232 rushing yards. DeSoto rushed 56 times for 335 yards. Mathis said the game plan wasn’t necessarily to keep the ball on the ground. But as they say if it isn’t broken don’t fix it.

“[Momentum] was on our side a lot [in the second half]” Henley Jr. said. “We just took it and ran with it.”

Rockwall averaged 498.5 yards per game this season. DeSoto held it to 391.

“We wanted to make sure we played as a team today” Mathis said. “And kept those guys in front of us and kept [Locke] in the pocket and make him throw the ball.”

DeSoto ranked 21st in the state 6A poll will play Spring Westfield (12-0) in the regional round Saturday at the Alamodome in San Antonio.

“We’re a very dangerous team” Bobby said. “Especially when both sides are clicking. We’re very hard to beat.”

By Ronni Newton Best Cleaners celebrated the official ribbon cutting of their new location at 17 Sedgwick Road in West Hartford on Nov. 18 welcoming town officials and Chamber of Commerce members and presenting a sizable donation to a local organization that like the business is known for its focus on the environment. Best Cleaners prides itself on utilizing an environmentally-friendly method of dry cleaning and has earned a Green Circle award from the Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Best Cleaners was one of the first cleaners in Connecticut to convert to an eco-friendly dry cleaning process GreenEarth and was recognized in 2002 for voluntarily implementing a facility-wide pollution prevention plan. Best Cleaners Owner and President Shawn McCann presented a $1000 donation Thursday to Westmoor Park the 162-acre environmental education center which is run by West Hartford’s Department of Leisure Services but is self-funded. “We are excited to be in the West Hartford community and truly appreciate the warm welcome we have received” McCann said. “We are impressed with the passion and commitment that community members have for their town and happy to support the educational and recreational programs offered at Westmoor Park. Their mission is important and impacts all of us in Connecticut.”

The third generation 67-year-old family-owned dry-cleaning company leased the vacant location that had previously been occupied by Victoria Cleaners – and prior to that by Sedgwick Cleaners – in June 2021. They completely renovated the interior space and had a soft opening in late October.

WEST HARTFORD CT — The latest Hidden Gem in Connecticut is definitely worth a peek when traveling through the Greater Hartford area. It's the circa 1913 West Hartford Armory a structure steeped in unique history.

According to Historic Buildings of Connecticut.com in 1911 the First Company Governor’s Horse Guards became the Troop B Cavalry regiment of the Connecticut National Guard. Soon after Troop B undertook a project to construct an armory — complete with stables — with private funds at 836 Farmington Ave. in West Hartford. Troop members and architects A. Raymond Ellis and Francis E. Waterman designed the building to be very functional without extra features in order to keep costs down. The armory was build from 1912 to 1913 and then officially acquired by the state.

The West Hartford Armory In 2021. (Chris Dehnel/Patch) Troop B served along the Mexican border in 1916 and in World War I as a machine gun battalion.

In 1940 with the phasing out of the horse soldier the unit became part of the 208th Coastal Artillery Regiment and the Armory was revamped to store large vehicles.

After World War II the First Company Governor’s Horse Guards was reorganized as a state militia unit and today has a facility in Avon. A wall image at the West Hartford Armory shows the building in wartime. (Chris Dehnel/Patch) The Army continued to house various units in the West Hartford Armory until the early 1980s when the building was decommissioned and sold by the state.

It was then turned into professional office suites. ____",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3Rha2UtYS1mdWxsLXRvdXItb2YtZW1lbGlhLWhhcnRmb3Jkcy1jYXItY29sbGVjdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take A Full Tour Of Emelia Hartford's Car Collection,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3Rha2UtYS1mdWxsLXRvdXItb2YtZW1lbGlhLWhhcnRmb3Jkcy1jYXItY29sbGVjdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJhbnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEvZGVzcGl0ZS1wYW5kZW1pYy1tb2ZvbmdvLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtZm91bmRlci1zZWVzLWEtbGluZS1vZi1zdWNjZXNzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Despite pandemic MofonGo restaurant founder sees a line of successes,"During the 20-month stretch that destroyed some Connecticut restaurants and shook many MofonGo thrived in New Britain expanded to Hartford and Windsor and now may open in Waterbury and New Haven too.

Along the way founder Vincent Placeres also donated thousands of meals to frontline workers in and around New Britain especially in the early months of the pandemic when much of the state was staying home.

Placeres 35 has become one of the success stories of New Britain’s drive for a downtown revival creating one of the city’s most popular lunch spots directly across from Central Park. He’s now thinking about eventually franchising the concept a fusion of Puerto Rican cuisine with some mainland American flourishes.

“We have three solid locations. We’re doing more next year and the year after. Knock on wood our goal is one to two (new) MofonGos a year” Placeres said during a break at his New Britain flagship restaurant.

MofonGo owner Vincent Placeres crushes plantains garlic butter and other ingredients to create the restaurant’s signature dish on the opening day of the chain’s Windsor location in 2020.

MofonGo’s corner location once a failing pizzeria is on many days the busiest business for a block in either direction. Locations at Parkville Market in Hartford and on Broad Street in Windsor opened in 2020 and both are succeeding Placeres said.

The model is relatively simple: Serve freshly prepared meals with an interesting cuisine largely for takeout but with enough tables inside to accommodate a decent-sized lunch rush.

Even as he’s looking to franchise MofonGo Placeres is also looking to new possibilities. Last week he opened Creole BBQ a few doors away on Main Street in New Britain.

Gerry Amodio executive director of the New Britain Downtown District has grown to be one of Placeres’ top fans praising his work in bringing life back to the city center.

“He does a lot for New Britain and that’s part of why things are going the way they are. For downtown this is the future they promised us” Amodio said. “And his food is really delicious.”

Like many in the downtown campaign Amodio was disappointed in 2018 when Placeres’ ambitious project known as The Kitchen survived only six months. But Placeres returned his attention to building MofonGo and a strong emphasis on takeout paid off when the pandemic struck Amodio said.

“I think Vincent found out who he was. He’s not a sit-down restaurant guy. MofonGo was still busy during COVID — his model is the Chipotle takeout model with ordering online” Amodio said.

Vincent Placeres who founded the MofonGo chain of Puerto Rican restaurants recently opened Creole BBQ inside The Assembly Room in downtown New Britain.

The start of the pandemic was also a time when Placeres got to show commitment to the city.

Mayor Erin Stewart gave him a Think Beyond Yourself community service award after he donated — and sometimes personally delivered — thousands of meals to hospital workers police and nursing home staff in the first seven weeks of the pandemic. He organized a campaign with several other local restaurant owners to help The Friendship Center as well as the Hospital of Central Connecticut.

“It was definitely something I felt I had to do for my community. So many places were closed down so who was feeding the homeless shelters? It was a tag team of me and a few other restaurants” he said.

“We were also taking care of the hospital every single night: It was a guaranteed 7 o’clock and 11 o’clock delivery. Emergency room ICU respiratory team — the ones who were receiving the COVID patients” he said. “This is when there was no vaccine or anything like that. The doctors and the nurses couldn’t go down to the cafeteria. The beds were packed. They were losing one or two patients every couple of days. It was nuts.”

Placeres said he’s convinced that he and the other restaurant owners had help to succeed in delivering 300 meals a night.

“I’m a God-fearing man always have been. You do good in your community you do good in the world God is going to bless you” he said. “Not only did he protect me from getting sick he blessed me with two more locations in 2020 when restaurants were shutting down.”

He credits his staff for much of the business’s growth and said one key is to treat strong employees well. Unlike many competitors Placeres’ business didn’t cut hours or trim its menu because of the tight labor market.

“I spend a lot of money on payroll trust me. My staff gets taken care of” Placeres said. “I was paying $15 an hour before 15 was a big thing. I’ve never had a staffing issue.

“There are restaurants that can’t even open their doors right now but my staff stayed with me through thick and thin. The whole pandemic we were never closed one day.”"

You’re backing the Plasma Series Spengler’s Proton Pack. You’re just missing something in the middle: the connection hose. No old school (or new school) Proton Pack is complete without one. Those particles are no good if you don’t have something to throw them with and that’s why our Class I unlock includes the hose to connect your Plasma Series Spengler’s Neutrona Wand to your Proton Pack (Plasma Series Spengler’s Neutrona Wand sold separately. Subject to availability). Oh and we couldn’t forget the custom 1984 decals with a brushed chrome look. Wicked.

The hose will not only connect the two pieces but will allow the Spengler Neutrona Wand to run off the power of the Proton Pack.

This Kowakian monkey-lizard may be small in stature but its presence is certainly large. In this unlock The Black Series 6-inch-scale Salacious B. Crumb does not go unnoticed even on its mini Kenner-inspired cardback. The team drew inspiration for this one from The Vintage Collection’s 2011 San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Salacious B. Crumb figure. Now we’re bringing it to an even more special level by putting it on a cardback celebrating the spirit of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. You can’t find Salacious B.

A truly epic addition to any display or collection and an iconic addition to your Rancor display. Without Luke Skywalker’s death-defying encounter how would we know the ferocity of the Rancor??? Hopefully we won’t have to find out. Luke comes with a removable soft goods cloak a blaster and of course a lightsaber. To complete this galactic figure we’ve put Luke on a classic Power of the Force cardback with a Special Collectors Coin.

JOE: A Real American Hero—Saturday Morning Adventures Comic Book Recaptures the Frolicking Fun of '80s ...,"Revisit the Beloved G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero Animated Series with Four-Issue Miniseries from IDW Publishing Beginning February

SAN DIEGO CA (November 18 2021) – With the nostalgic appetite for ’80s pop culture as powerful as ever IDW is giving fans what they want with the February debut of G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero—Saturday Morning Adventures a special send-up of the classic cartoon shipping monthly and featuring the fan-favorite creative team of writer Erik Burnham artist Dan Schoening and colorist Luis Antonio Delgado.

Everyone knows that G.I. JOE is the code name for America's daring highly trained special mission force and that their purpose is to defend human freedom against Cobra a ruthless criminal organization determined to rule the world. But now Cobra has launched the Aladdin Initiative their most versatile weapon yet... challenging Duke Scarlett Snake Eyes and the G.I. JOE team like never before!

“I loved how straight-up weird cartoons can be” says Burnham. “The G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero cartoon allowed for gremlins Egyptian gods and of course a ninja dressed in an 80’s New Wave outfit wig and all. You never knew where the show might take you. Writing a story set in that universe you can do anything… and I’m partnered with artists like Dan Schoening and Luis Antonio Delgado who can draw anything. The idea we came to felt right at home within the world of the cartoon and I can't wait to share it with everyone.”

“As a child of the ’80s I always had a healthy dose of the G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero animated show not to mention the vast line-up of action figures. It's an honor to take the cartoon that I enjoyed (and still do) so much and visually translate it into the comic book medium” says Schoening.

“So many times we fondly remember our past favorites from the world of pop culture through a skewed nostalgic lens only to find disappointment when we revisit them… but in the case of G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero the loyal fandom is still very active the classic comics and cartoons still hold up and the only skewed lens is Dr. Mindbender’s patented monocle” says editor Tom Waltz. “The superstar creative team of Erik Dan and Luis are here to bring us a brand-new adventure that reminds us of why G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero is the exception to the nostalgia rule!”

G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero — Saturday Morning Adventures #1 will be available with multiple cover variants for retailers and fans to enjoy each illustrated by fan-favorite artists long associated with IDW Transformers comics: Cover A by series artist Dan Schoening Cover B by Megan Huang (Tartarus Rangers of the Divide) and a Retailer Incentive edition by Billy Penn.

Additionally fans can check out full episodes of the G.I. JOE: A Real American Hero animated series on the official Hasbro YouTube channel.

With a diameter of 9 inches and a weight of 3.4 pounds it'll make a statement this holiday.

The best part? You can slice up for more indulgence after all that turkey and stuffing.

It’s a good holiday to be a Reese’s fan! Why you may ask? The Hershey’s brand is getting into the Thanksgiving spirit by creating its own pie. Well it’s not really a pie but it is a dessert that people will be talking about for holidays to come. Allow us to explain.

The new Reese’s Thanksgiving Pie is actually a giant Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. With a diameter of 9 inches and a weight of 3.4 pounds this treat is sure to make a statement on your Thanksgiving table. It’s made of peanut butter and chocolate like the cups you already know and love. But now it has been turned into a huge dessert that you can slice up for more indulgence after all that turkey and stuffing.

You’ll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on the pie. There will only be 3000 available for purchase for $44.99. Remember it’s the size of the typical pumpkin or apple pie you enjoy during the holidays so it’ll serve plenty of people.

“When you bring together friends and family for Thanksgiving dinner no table spread is complete without dessert” Bo Jones senior associate brand manager at Reese’s said in a press release. “At Reese’s we wanted to create a dessert that everyone wants a piece of. You can thank us later.”

As fun as the holiday season is we all know that it can get a little uh interesting when you have so many family members (with plenty of opinions) in the mix. One that nearly everyone will agree on? The Reese’s Thanksgiving Pie is damn good.

On a cold night in Hershey the Vikings were trying to win their first PIAA state soccer title but the Talbots were giving them precious few opportunities to find the back of the net.

Wood’s defense wasn’t giving Hampton many good scoring chances either but the Talbots took advantage of one good one. In the 58th minute senior forward Luke Staggers fed senior midfielder Zach Panza with a give-and-go pass on the left side. Panza rifled a shot past Vikings sophomore goal keeper Julian Naumenko into the right side of the frame to give District Seven champion Hampton a 1-0 victory.

In Wood’s only other trip to the state final in 2010 the Vikings also lost to Hampton 1-0.

“It was hard to get touches inside the box” Wood senior co-captain Dom Petruzzelli said. “Their “D” was spectacular. I know that we fought to the end though. We held them. We played hard. We just couldn’t get that final pass into the box to finish our chance.

“I thought it was going to be a one-goal game the entire time. We knew that from the beginning. We knew they were going to be tough and we knew that we had the opportunities. We’re only the second team in Wood history to go here and playing the same exact team again. It’s tough.”

The Vikings who won the District 12 championship were hot early on but the Talbots (23-1) got their legs under them and soon were taking the play to Wood (14-3-1). Hampton outshot the Vikings in the half 8-4 and finished the game with a 15-8 shot advantage.

Neither team could find the range in the first half but the Talbots turned that around with their game-winning goal. Senior defender Lou Daniele tried to knot the score for Wood with 12 minutes remaining but Thomas Bradfield made a spectacular save and that was as good as it got for the Vikings.

It was quite a run for Wood and its 10 seniors. Vikings coach Hugh Kelly has coached at Wood for 40 years and he has not seen a Wood team that compares to them.

“I’m extremely proud” Kelly said. “We had a rough loss in our own playoffs we regrouped these guys rechanneled their efforts and energies and that was the difference in getting where we’re at. They’re a unique group of individuals – not the most talented – but they have a lot of heart.

“From what I could figure out with these guys I thought that we’d match up pretty well. I don’t see anybody blowing anybody out at this level. They’re very organized we were pretty organized. So I knew it would be one or two chances and that would be the difference. They finished and we didn’t.”

It came down to one good opportunity but that didn’t diminish how Petruzzelli felt about his teammates.

“Obviously we would have liked to win but I’m proud of myself my boys my captains especially my seniors” Petruzzelli said. “They are my brothers for life. They are my guys. It is an experience I will never forget for eternity.”

Propelled by the post-pandemic Cloud and IT infrastructure needs companies are driving the adoption of HP Enterprises’ solutions across small and medium businesses its top India executive said.Ancillary units or vendors of large enterprises in manufacturing fintech ecommerce and government sectors are leading this demand as they seek to comply with the IT requirements of clients said HPE India managing director Som Satsangi In fact the company has already reached pre-pandemic demand levels across its SMB market and is rapidly expanding he added.“In India we have seen that enterprises are putting a lot of pressure on their partner SMB ecosystems to improve their IT infrastructure” Satsangi said. “So during Q3 and Q4 which was during the second wave of the pandemic we saw a massive expansion in our SMB base.”The global management was already bullish about the India market after HPE was carved out of the parent company and the enhanced focus on the country planned in 2019 has paid off he said.In 2015 US-based Hewlett Packard Co. was split into HP Inc. to cater to personal devices and HP Enterprises to handle the enterprise services business. In 2019 HPE announced plans to invest $500 million in India over a period of five years to grow its operations manufacturing and employee base as well as increase its R&D and services exports from the country.Satsangi said the company has seen an uptick from new businesses being set up in small cities. “Be it IT companies or startups this pandemic has pushed many to set up base in new locations which has created opportunities for us in the mid-market segment” he said.Further due to the growth in demand for ecommerce fintech and pharmaceutical/healthcare after the pandemic it has led to greater engagement with businesses addressing these markets for HPE.Industry tracker Gartner expects that 60% of midsize enterprise workloads will remain on premise through 2025 because customers need secure single-tenant environments to run their apps and data wherever they reside.HPE’s pay-per-use GreenLake cloud platform has also seen greater uptake due to the digital transformation demand across businesses in addition to recent software acquisitions like SGI and Cray.“Automotive clients implemented heavy IT transformation mandates in recent quarters to automate their processes to reduce human interface. Also SAP Clinical solutions were already popular among the pharma client base and during the pandemic we saw many more shifts to the HPE GreenLake solution as well” Satsangi said.Traditionally about 60% of its client base was from government and large enterprises but HPE has also leveraged solutions such as GreenLake and updated its go-to-market strategies to change this customer segment he said.“Over the past three years we have implemented strategies to go after these mid-market clients and smaller businesses.

So we divided our go-to market strategy across different teams for existing large enterprises new business (including digital native startups) and SMBs and that has led to a more balanced portfolio” Satsangi said.The company has also expanded its partnerships with data centre infrastructure providers to offer flexible public and private cloud solutions for businesses as per their needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

View the current offers here.

Los Angeles is a popular destination whether you're visiting as a family with kids a romantic couple or are on a business trip. The region is actually comprised of a vast expanse of cities and neighborhoods all bundled into a collective area known as LA. Choosing a hotel here can be overwhelming and sometimes expensive so redeeming points for hotels in Los Angeles is a great option.

My cohorts and I have spent huge amounts of time in Greater Los Angeles and stayed in dozens of hotels there. Together we've collected several of our favorites based on location proximity to various points of interest and value.

The hotels noted below are just a smattering of the points properties you can book in the Los Angeles area. Click on the interactive map below to see more details about each property.

Downtown Los Angeles

InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown

A stunning tower that soars 73 stories above the city the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown is located atop the tallest building in the West. Not for the faint of heart the 70th-floor sky lobby is something to be seen with unparalleled 360-degree views.

Rooms feature floor-to-ceiling windows and a sleek contemporary design. This is true luxury and guests here will enjoy being pampered before and after their forays to the nearby sights and attractions at Staples Center (soon to be renamed Crypto.com Arena) and LA Live. Downtown LA (or as locals call it DTLA) is hopping right now and this is the luxurious way to enjoy it.

Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles LA Live

DTLA is chock-full of cool new places to visit and things to see. Fun for the whole family or good for a romantic getaway the Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. Live is close to all the action. The hotel is located within L.A. Live the city's enormously popular sports music and entertainment center. Staples Center (soon to be the Crypto.com Arena) the Grammy Museum Lakers games live music by major acts and more are all steps away. The Courtyard here stays remarkably peaceful despite being in the midst of all that action and the pool here is fantastic.

Points redemption: Marriott Bonvoy Category 5 from 35000 points per night on standard dates or use an up-to-35000-point Marriott annual free night certificate like the one you get with the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card or Marriott Bonvoy Business® American Express® Card (rates from $293). Note that Marriott is eliminating its award chart in favor of dynamic pricing effective March 2022 but there are still a few months left to book a stay with the current pricing.

Hotel Figueroa

If you're eager to be in the thick of things but a bustling high-rise isn't your thing here's an option for you. The Hotel Figueroa is a historic low-key property that holds its own in the shadow of the giant L.A. Live complex and other hospitality stalwarts that loom nearby. The iconic 95-year-old Hotel Figueroa joined Hyatt's Unbound Collection in June 2021. Restored to its Spanish colonial revival style rooms are a bit small but comfortable and well appointed. Attentive service two restaurants a pool a small gym and an art collection add to the charm. The Hotel Figueroa is a great choice if business brings you to DTLA but you'd like an intimate boutique-like stay.

Points redemption: World of Hyatt members earn double points on the room rate and eligible incidental charges when paying the Double Your Points rate of $362 per night for a standard room.

Note that for stays from March 1 2022 onward World of Hyatt's award charts will have three categories — peak off-peak and standard — with redemption rates that will vary across dates.

Beverly Hills and the Westside

Avalon Hotel Beverly Hills a Member of Design Hotels

Beverly Hills is known as a posh destination within Los Angeles and it certainly lives up to that reputation. The Avalon Hotel Beverly Hills is located in a more residential area which is quiet and relaxed. We loved the midcentury design and historic-yet-modern vibe of this stylish hotel. Without being over the top the Avalon exudes LA style and the guests here reflect that. A well-heeled group the Avalon crowd is smartly groomed yet relaxed fun and surprisingly approachable.

Points redemption: Marriott Bonvoy Category 5 from 35000 points per night on standard dates (rates from $332). While Marriott is eliminating its award chart in favor of dynamic pricing effective March 2022 there are still a few months left to book your stay with the current pricing.

With retro design and luxe furnishings the Avalon Beverly Hills is a stylish spot. (Photo courtesy of the Avalon Hotel Beverly Hills/Facebook)

The Beverly Hilton

The iconic Beverly Hilton is one of the original settings for Hollywood celebrities. Home to the Golden Globe Awards each year the Beverly Hilton is positioned at the gateway to Beverly Hills and steps away from Rodeo Drive. Still glamorous this hotel has been home base for families couples and girlfriend getaways for decades. Ask for a poolside cabana room for some added chic or you can relax in the patio furniture overlooking the pool and restaurant.

Points redemption: From 60000 Hilton Honors points for a standard room reward (rates from $248) or use a free weekend night reward certificate like the one that comes with the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card ($450 annual fee; see rates and fees).

The information for the Hilton Aspire Amex card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Kimpton Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills

We love staying at a Kimpton Hotel Palomar because the design is always impeccable and the Kimpton Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills location is no exception. As guests enter the stylish lobby the hotel exudes a plush relaxing mood. With a boutique hotel approach the attentive Palomar staff somehow finds ways to make each guest feel special. The service here was so great we considered camping here all day instead of exploring all the cool restaurants shops and galleries nearby. This hotel is great for romantic getaways and those seeking a chic place to see and be seen.

Points redemption: From 60000 IHG Rewards Club points (rates from $314). Cardholders of the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card get the fourth night free on all award stays.

Fairmont Century Plaza

The landmark Century Plaza hotel is back this time as the Fairmont Century Plaza. The familiar curved facade remains this time replete with high-tech lighting effects at night. The favorite LA waystation of U.S. presidents and presidential candidates is now the centerpiece of a $2.5 billion mixed-use project. In its new iteration it regains its former glamour and then some.

Features we love include a stunning lobby spacious and elegantly appointed rooms and a huge spa. Located amid the Century City office tower complex that houses lawyers financial firms and talent agents this is a prime location for business travelers. Walkable Beverly Hills is next door and if you time it right the beach is a straight shot west (7 miles or so) on Santa Monica Boulevard.

Keep in mind this is one of the most expensive hotels in LA right now. With fees such as $75 to use the spa and $65 for valet parking this isn't our top suggestion for leisure travelers. But if you've got important business meetings lined up on the Westside it's the gold standard.

Booking details: Room rates at the Fairmont Century Plaza start at between $700 and $800 per night. We recommend logging in to your Accor Live Limitless account where you may be able to find member specials. We were able to get a room and daily breakfast for two for $715 per night. Taxes and fees will easily add an extra $100 per night to your tab. Note that if you are a non-elite ALL member you can earn 25 points per 10 euros ($11.65) spent at participating hotels and can redeem them in increments of 2000 for 40 euros ($46.60) off hotel charges.

Try Hollywood or Universal City

W Hollywood

If you're traveling to LA to be part of the action then the W Hollywood is an ideal place. Located right on Hollywood Boulevard along the Walk of Fame the W is hopping with sleekly dressed visitors from all over the world. The music is thumping the Instagram opportunities are plenty and the vibe is Hollywood chic. The rooftop pool and bar is a well-known hot spot for both visitors and locals day or night. You may even catch a celebrity sighting or two.

Points redemption: Marriott Bonvoy Category 6 from 50000 points per night on standard dates (rates from $273). While Marriott is eliminating its award chart in favor of dynamic pricing effective March 2022 there are still a few months left to book your stay with the current pricing.

Thompson Hollywood

For those eager to venture into authentic (as opposed to well-manicured or touristy) LA Thompson Hollywood may be a good fit. Located between the marquee thoroughfares of Sunset Boulevard and Hollywood Boulevard the Thompson is in a Hollywood neighborhood that's transitioning to trendy on the hospitality front.

Sleek rooms a great rooftop pool and bar with views of the Hollywood sign a designer gym and a magazine cover-worthy lobby are a few of the Thompson's most notable aspects.

It's a good choice for anyone looking to stay midway between downtown and the Westside. It's also close to attractions such as Universal Studios and the hiking trails of Runyon Canyon and Griffith Park. Make sure to take a ride-hailing service at night as streets are a tad empty. But the good news is that the Hollywood/Vine Metro station is close by.

Points redemption: World of Hyatt member rates start at $304 for a standard room. A Double Your Points rate is available from $351. Since this is a Hyatt Category 6 hotel award nights for standard rooms are 25000 points. You will pay another $50 per night in taxes as well as a $25 destination fee for complimentary coffee in the morning use of the gym and pool and discounts at some local attractions. Note that for stays from March 1 2022 onward World of Hyatt's award charts will have three categories — peak off-peak and standard — with redemption rates that will vary across dates.

Andaz West Hollywood

We love this hotel for all its racy beauty and legendary '60s past. The rooftop pool is just stunning and guests might recognize it from scenes shot for many a Hollywood production. Rooms are colorful and interesting with eclectic art mirrored furniture and some wild prints. The Andaz West Hollywood (WeHo) also offers one of the better-outfitted hotel gyms in the area. You can even bring Fido along for the stay – the hotel is dog-friendly and so are the guests.

Points redemption: Category 5 from 20000 World of Hyatt points (rates from $259). Note that for stays from March 1 2022 onward World of Hyatt's award charts will have three categories — peak off-peak and standard — with redemption rates that will vary across dates.

Pendry West Hollywood

The cool factor of West Hollywood is on overdrive these days thanks to new hotels such as Pendry West Hollywood. If you're looking to be immersed in LA hipster chic from a Sunset Strip vantage point you've arrived.

Standouts include eye-popping sculptures and other curated public artwork Wolfgang Puck-helmed restaurants gorgeous rooftop lounge and pool areas a bowling alley a 100-seat live entertainment venue and a private membership club known for attracting Hollywood A-listers. Our one-bedroom suite featured walk-in closets a grand entryway a powder room and a soaking tub overlooking the Hollywood Hills. I confess we didn't leave the premises at all during our stay.

Booking: The Pendry doesn't belong to a major loyalty program though it does participate in Chase's Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection. This means that Chase Sapphire Reserve cardmembers and other eligible cardholders can enjoy perks such as complimentary breakfast for two upgrades and more. Standard rates start at $370 for a king room and $735 for the deluxe skyline one-bedroom suite we stayed in.

Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City

If you like movies and amusement parks the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City is located directly next to Universal Studios Hollywood and all the excitement that comes with it. Walk or shuttle to the park to enjoy rides shows and tours sure to please the entire family. When we stayed here recently our kids were wowed by the hotel's over-the-top buffets at every meal. (The chocolate fountain was a huge hit.) The hotel is also close to the famous Hollywood sign and Griffith Park in one direction and Burbank with all its movie studios in the other.

Points redemption: Between 53000 and 60000 Hilton Honors points per night for a standard room reward (rates from $263).

Universal City is literally next door. (Photo courtesy of the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City/Facebook)

Holiday Inn Express Hollywood Walk of Fame

Perfect for families the Holiday Inn Express Hollywood is literally in the thick of the action. We love the no-fuss no-muss offerings of this hotel — especially the great complimentary breakfast options. Walking out the door and down the street guests can visit all the famous sights including the Walk of Fame Hollywood and Highland (home to the Academy Awards) the historic Egyptian Theatre and more. There is so much to do in this area you'll have a hard time choosing favorites. The hotel does not offer a ton of frills but you won't need that with so much to see just outside the doors.

Points redemption: From 40000 IHG Rewards Club points (rates from $225).

Santa Monica

JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot

If the beach is your jam the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot is great for couples families and groups of friends. Located right across from the boardwalk with ocean and palm tree views the hotel is just steps away from the famous Santa Monica Pier the most photographed location in all of LA. Great restaurants and world-class shopping are within walking distance. And did I mention the beach? This is iconic LA straight from the movies and TV.

Points redemption: Marriott Bonvoy Category 7 from 60000 points per night on standard dates (rates from $273). While Marriott is eliminating its award chart in favor of dynamic pricing effective March 2022 there are still a few months left to book your stay with the current pricing.

Santa Monica is a must-visit destination and staying at the JW Marriott there offers rooftop views like this. (Photo courtesy of JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot/Marriott)

Hilton Santa Monica Hotel & Suites

An all-suites hotel can be a great option for families with small kids as there is more space for everyone. The Hilton Santa Monica Hotel & Suites is a quick three blocks from the famous Southern California beaches where guests can rent a bike or surfboard to cruise the shore. There also is a park very close by for the little kids to work off some steam and the Santa Monica Pier and boardwalk are just a couple of blocks away.

Points redemption: Between 56000 to 80000 points per night for a standard room reward (rates from $327).

The Shay

Hyatt has opened The Shay its first Destination by Hyatt property in Southern California. It is located in Culver City which may not be as well known as other areas of LA but it's actually a Westside gem with a historic entertainment industry pedigree. You'll find it due north about 7 miles from LAX.

Culver City has been a film and television production center for the past century. Now it's having a renaissance as a hub for creative types tech and trendy independent boutique outposts.

The Shay's industrial edgy look features lots of open spaces oversized windows two dining venues and quirky touches like a fire pit in the lobby. The pool deck offers sweeping LA vistas and frequent yoga pop-ups. Suites feature large living rooms a work area soaking tubs wet bars and some patios.

If you need to spend an extended time in LA location is one of The Shay's best features. The nearby Culver City station of the LA Metro E Line provides a light rail connection from downtown LA to Santa Monica. So you can stay at the Shay and conveniently explore a wide swath of what LA has to offer.

Points redemption: The Shay is a Category 5 hotel with World of Hyatt so standard rooms are 20000 points per night. Room rates start at $359 per night plus an additional $82 in taxes and fees per night.

Airport lodging

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport

Sometimes it's just easier to stay near the airport particularly if you are just arriving or perhaps leaving very early. Since LAX is such a huge and busy airport we sometimes like to stay in an airport-adjacent hotel the night before we leave — especially if we have an early flight. The Hyatt Regency LAX is one of the best we've visited particularly for design comfort and proximity. It is literally the closest hotel to the airport and we can walk to our flights from the Hyatt Regency lobby. Many choose this as their home base and navigate to the sights of LA from here. Its very nicely appointed spacious rooms and a good restaurant make this a natural choice for this area of LA.

Points redemption: Category 3 from 12000 World of Hyatt points. Note that for stays from March 1 2022 onward World of Hyatt's award charts will have three categories — peak off-peak and standard — with redemption rates that will vary across dates.

Bottom line

Regardless of where you choose to bank your loyalty points there are great redemption options across the Greater Los Angeles area. If you're junkies like us you may have points programs with several (OK maybe all) of the hotel programs. That will allow you to pick and choose your options based on location cost and even mood. Whichever it may be those points are going to save you money on your visit to Los Angeles which you can then spend on those Lakers tickets or convertible Ferrari rental. Splurge! It's LA!

Fayetteville Police Department spokesperson Ann Marie Burdett said officers on Nov. 17 were dispatched to the Home Depot at the Fayette Pavilion in reference to an alleged theft.

“Dispatch provided police with a description of the alleged suspect involved in the alleged theft. Police were told the suspect was at the customer service desk allegedly attempting to return items for cash for merchandise they did not purchase” Burdett said.

Burdett said a Home Depot Loss Prevention Officer informed police the suspect then left the store without paying for merchandise in a shopping cart.

“The officer approached the suspect and gave verbal commands to stop but the suspect entered their vehicle abandoning the merchandise in the shopping cart and fleeing the parking lot in the vehicle” said Burdett.

The patrol officer subsequently obtained a criminal warrant for the alleged suspect identified as 85-year-old Newnan resident George William Fineran.

In another incident Burdett said Fayetteville police on Nov. 17 were dispatched to take the report of alleged explicit content being put on social media.

Police met with the complainant who said a subject allegedly posted an explicit video of them without their consent on social media after Sept. 12 Burdett said.

The officer verified the information provided by the complainant and obtained a witness statement Burdett added.

The case was turned over to the Fayetteville Criminal Investigations Division for further investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvdXJuYWxnYXpldHRlLm5ldC9sb2NhbC9leC1ob21lLWRlcG90LXRvLWJlLXBhaW50YmFsbC1odWIvYXJ0aWNsZV8wZjAyNDlhNS00OTAzLTU5MDctYWI0My1mNTY2NTVkZGNiMmIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Home Depot to be paintball hub | Local | journalgazette.net,"You have permission to edit this article.

HON,Honeywell,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvcmF5LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtdXZjLWRpc2luZmVjdC1haXJjcmFmdC1jYWJpbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RAY the autonomous UVC robot stands ready to disinfect cabins -,"As airlines look to enhance disinfection onboard without the repeated use of harsh chemicals ultraviolet light is having a serious moment in industry. Systems that emit slight violet germicidal light can be installed in lavatories galleys flight decks cargo bays and passenger service units (PSUs) while portable devices that emit intense UVC light can sweep though cabins and cockpits to sanitize seats and other surfaces.

While major players including Boeing Collins Aerospace Diehl Aviation and Honeywell have dominated the headlines about ultraviolet lighting systems for aviation applications a new name has emerged – Aero HygenX which produces a line of autonomous UVC disinfecting robots called RAY.

RAY can be optimized for various aircraft types – from turboprops to widebodies – and comes equipped with “HygenX Stream” a customizable software that records and transmits usage data wirelessly to the cloud providing system health monitoring and status updates to the operator.

A Canadian technology company Aero HygenX first came on our radar in late October when executives from Ethiopian Airlines Group and Aero HygenX signed a memorandum of understanding outlining a plan for both the fleet-wide deployment and regional marketing of RAY.

“Aero HygenX has developed a phenomenal technology that enhances biosafety onboard – in accordance with our ‘Safety First’ policy – and will help Ethiopian attract more customers for a speedy recovery from the pandemic” Tewolde GebreMariam Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines said at the time.

Now Lufthansa Technik has become a non-exclusive global distribution partner for the RAY product line acting as a sales liaison to airlines ground handling companies MRO facilities and service shops that would like to procure the RAY disinfecting robots.

“With more than 800 customers and approximately 4500 aircraft under exclusive contract Lufthansa Technik’s outstanding reputation and presence in 32 countries means it is uniquely positioned to help Aero HygenX penetrate new markets bringing effective chemical-free disinfection to more aircraft in more places” said the MRO giant in a statement.

So what is RAY and how does it differ from say the Dimer LLC ‘GermFalcon’ portable UVC technology being exclusively produced and sold by Honeywell as the Honeywell UV Cabin System?

Both systems bathe an aircraft cabin in UVC light which can destroy the DNA structure of bacteria and viruses and is used in hospitals microbiology labs and other facilities. But whilst the crew-operated Honeywell UV Cabin System has extendable arms that stretch over seats RAY does not.

Rather RAY is marketed as providing 360° coverage. And it does not require a crew member to move it through the cabin (whilst wearing PPE to protect themselves from UVC exposure).

By taking out the human factor the autonomous robot provides a consistent and repeatable solution says a spokeswoman for Aero HygenX.

Honeywell’s latest lightweight UV Cabin System and Aero HygenX’s RAY each boast speed-of-use; the former is billed as capable of treating a single-aisle mid-size cabin in less than ten minutes while the latter markets itself as the “fastest disinfection in the industry” hence enabling operators “to disinfect every turn”.

RAY’s use is not restricted to aircraft cabins. “[It] an be used to disinfect crew rooms jet bridges” noted the spokeswoman adding that no configuration changes are required for such deployments.

Lufthansa Technik is certainly convinced by the technology saying the RAY product line “meets our stringent quality standards is environmentally friendly and offers superior defence against the spread of pathogens onboard”.

Airlines ground handling companies and MRO facilities can ow procure RAY through their local Lufthansa Technik sales team.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023.

Presently I am starting the venture of writing my master's thesis. The subject of my thesis concerns the implementation of robotic process automation (RPA) software in organisations. I'd like to look at critical success factors in different stages of the implementation process. To ultimately deliver a scientifically grounded and validated framework on how to conduct successful RPA implementation projects. To do so I will be conducting qualitative research.

However I could use some help with it from our community as I am presently struggling with finding an appropriate theoretical lens to apply in my thesis.

Therefore I am looking for suggestions for possible lenses to use which can be used in qualitative research. I have come across theories such as diffusion-of-innovation (DOI) technology acceptance model (TAM) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). These however have a quantitative nature and thereby seem less appropriate.

To summarize I am looking for a theoretical lens to study RPA implementation projects which can be used in qualitative research do you have any suggestions on which lens to use? It may also be more broad or sociological lenses rather than strictly technological lenses.

Please let me know your help and advice is highly appreciated!

Kind regards

""I'm looking for an inexpensive Windows laptop for doing basic tasks but it needs to last more than a few years. What should I get?"" It's a reasonable question and one I get all the time. My answer is usually the HP Envy 13. It costs less than $1000 yet acts like a premium notebook.

While I stand by that answer those looking to save even more money (specced to your liking the Envy 13 can get dangerously close to a grand) should go with the HP Pavilion Aero 13. Yes another HP — at this rate the company is close to owning the ""sub-$1K"" Windows market.

It may not feel as premium as its pricier relatives but the Pavilion Aero 13 is every bit as capable. Armed with AMD Ryzen chips the Aero can compete in a performance battle against notebooks costing twice as much. But isn't just about the raw power Accompanying its capable engine is a bright and vivid 13.3-inch display strong battery life and a selection of ports you don't typically see nowadays. There are compromises as is the case with any mainstream laptop but they hardly seem worth mentioning given everything the Aero 13 brings at this price.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 price and configurations

Searching for a sub-$1000 laptop with decent specs can seem futile but the Pavilion Aero might help you along your journey. At $629 for a config with a 1920 x 1200-pixel LCD display an AMD Ryzen 5 CPU 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD the base Aero 13 should satisfy most consumers.

Power users on a budget should upgrade to the $799 model we reviewed which flaunts an AMD Ryzen 7 5800U CPU 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 design

The adage ""You get what you pay for"" comes to mind as I gaze uninterestedly at the anonymous styling of the Pavilion Aero 13. Compared to the Spectre  the Aero seems like the little brother who gets out-of-fashion hand-me-downs while his sibling flaunts the latest clothing. It starts with the logo. On the lid you'll find the meek circular HP branding — not the most aggressive slanty one on Spectre laptops.

I could stop there because the Aero isn't even vanilla; it's the unflavored greek yogurt of laptops. Alas it is my job to describe the nondescript. And with that the Aero is a modestly sized 13-inch clamshell laptop made of a single-colored magnesium alloy. If you want some flavoring you can swap the silver coating on our review unit with either gold or rose gold (a worthy $15 upcharge).

Keeping pricing in mind I should praise the slim (but plastic) bezels surrounding the Aero 13's display and I prefer these color-matched keys to whatever Apple was thinking with the 14-inch MacBook Pro . Also the fingerprint reader on the deck is perhaps the best functional goodie HP brought to this budget-friendly notebook. It quickly and reliably registered my print removing the need for me to create and inevitably forget a password.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

But enough about the looks because the design is all about portability. As mentioned the Aero 13 is made entirely of magnesium alloy a material lighter than aluminum but stronger than plastic. By opting for this specific ore HP kept the weight of the Aero 13 down to just over two pounds. Forget the numbers this thing feels hollow as if HP forgot to put components inside.

At 11.7 x 8.2 x 0.67 inches and 2.2 pounds the Aero 13 is considerably lighter than the Envy 13 (12.1 x 7.7 x 0.7 inches 2.9 pounds) and even weighs in below the Acer Swift 3 (12.7 x 8.4 x 0.6 inches 2.6 pounds) and Asus ZenBook 13 UX325EA (11.9 x 8 x 0.5 inches 2.5 pounds).

HP Pavilion Aero 13 ports

I connected a mouse via a 2.4-GHz USB dongle and my external keyboard to the Aero 13 thanks to the dual USB 3.0 Type-A ports split among each side.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Fitting these legacy ports into the Aero 13 required some clever engineering in the form of a drop-jaw hinge. Inserting the cord can be fiddly but it's worth the minor inconvenience.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Also on the Aero 13 is an HDMI port and USB-C port on the left and a headphone jack on the right. Short of an SD card reader this budget notebook should cover your I/O needs.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 display

As others move to larger panels HP keeps the 13.3-inch display alive on the Aero 13 but modernizes it with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The boxier shape means more vertical viewing area for scrolling down web pages or writing reports.

At this point I'm still searching for the compromises you often find in budget products. Usually with cheaper laptops corners are cut on the display — so many devices pass through my desk boasting powerful performance ruined by god-awful panels. This I'm enthused to say bucks the trend.

The Aero's 13.3-inch 1920 x 1200-pixel IPS display is among the best I've seen at this price. It's sharp bright and colorful — everything you want while watching a movie with more spectacle than plot.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

The faded pastel colors of the groovy '90s button-up shirt worn by the lead character in Licorice Pizza were accurately captured on the Aero's screen. A few scenes later the glowing green red and orange hues of stained glass proved the Aero can produce punchy saturated colors. And the screen is plenty detailed -- I could see the relatable acne on the face of these teenagers as well as individual shards of glass falling to the floor after Bradley Cooper goes apeshit on some car windows.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

As good as this display is HP is charging only $30 more to upgrade to a sharper 2560 x 1600-resolution panel. We suspect a small hit to endurance but given the Aero 13's solid battery life (more on that below) the extra pixels might be worth it.

Our colorimeter shows the Pavilion Aero 13's display to be brighter and more vivid than those on competing laptops. The Aero covered 85% of the DCI-P3 color gamut whereas the Envy 13 (80%) Swift 3 (73%) and ZenBook 13 (76%) fell just short though all topped the category average (72%).

For brightness  the Aero 13 peaked at 451 nits outshining the Envy 13 (361 nits) Swift 3 (300 nits) ZenBook 13 (370 nits) and the average (310 nits).

HP Pavilion Aero 13 keyboard and touchpad

Sometimes unremarkable is better than different. It's why I'm perfectly happy with the Aero 13's standard Chiclet-style keyboard. This is the sort of laptop you can start typing on right out of the box without making any errors. The keys are adequately sized and spaced and there is decent travel for a notebook of this size. Hunt-and-peck typists however might take issue with the color-matched keys because it can be difficult to see the transparent font in certain lighting.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

I typed at an expeditious 112 words per minute at a 95% accuracy rate on the 10fastfingers.com typing test. That's quick by my standards topping my 109-wpm average.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

Oh HP. No more plastic I beg you. Alright so this touchpad while small (4.5 x 2.5 inches) and erm not made of the right material works just fine. I had no problems using it through a full week of work flicking down web pages or using Windows 10 gestures . However my fingers dragged on its plastic surface more than they would on a glass one. I can't imagine that upgrade costing HP or customers for that matter more than a few bucks so let's stop this silliness.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 audio

Earlier I said the Aero 13 felt hollow. I'm glad it doesn't sound that way. While they won't blow you away the Bang & Olufsen-tuned setup pumped out clear balanced jams. When listening to Tora's ""Inundated"" the dual bottom-firing drivers deftly juggled the boops and beeps of the electronic tones as the lead singer's soaring vocals took center stage. Keep in mind that these aren't the loudest so you might want to invest in proper computer speakers for room-filling sound.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 performance

Not long ago I would have winced at the sight of an AMD processor. Now red is one of my favorite colors. The Aero 13 shows why. Armed with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800U CPU with 16GB of RAM  this moderately priced notebook had no problems accommodating my typical workload which consists of having no fewer than 25 Google Chrome tabs open at all times. Playing YouTube Music watching YouTube videos and photo editing in Affinity Photo didn't seem to bother the Aero 13 which quickly loaded web pages launched apps and exported photos.

The Pavilion Aero 13 landed an excellent 5876 on the Geekbench 5.4 overall performance benchmark putting it ahead of the Envy 13 (4930 Core i5-1135G7) Swift 3 (5864 Core i7-1165G7) and the ZenBook 13 (5032. Core i7-1165G7). It obliterated the category average of 4467.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

If that wasn't impressive enough the Pavilion Aero 13 sprinted past the others in our video transcoding test converting a 4K clip to 1080p in just 9 minutes and 5 seconds. That agility nearly cuts the Envy 13 (17:29) and ZenBook 13's (17:51) times in half and saves you several minutes compared with the Swift 3 (12:59). The category average for mainstream laptops is 15:08.

Budget-friendly laptops are too often equipped with the slowest hard drives so it's nice to see the Aero 13's 512GB M.2 NVMe SSD transfer a 25GB multimedia file in just 53 seconds at a rate of 503.4 megabytes per second. While not as expeditious as the Swift 3 (538.2 MBps 512GB PCIe SSD) nor ZenBook 13 (4407 MBps M.2 PCIe 3.0 SSD) the Aero outpaced its sibling the Envy 13 (415.6 MBps M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD). It did however fall short of the category average of 545.4 MBps.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 graphics

There is not much to see here. As expected the ultra-portable Aero 13 relies on integrated Radeon Graphics. This means having enough graphics oomph to use programs geared toward creatives and running lightweight games at low settings — but not much else. So please don't try playing Halo Infinite on the Aero 13. For that we recommend a gaming laptop .

You might run into some lag when playing games at even medium settings as we did when running Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Gathering Storm at 1080p. The Aero played the turn-based strategy game at 26 frames per second falling just short of our 30-fps threshold. It fell between the Envy 13 (18 fps) Zenbook 13 (24 fps) and the Swift 3 (38 fps) a trio of laptops with Intel Iris Xe graphics .

HP's contender didn't do so well in the 3DMark Fire Strike synthetic benchmark test scoring a lowly 3182. It failed to find the podium dropping below the Envy 13 (3709) Swift 3 (5162) and Zenbook 13 (4407). The average (3699) for the category is also higher.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 battery life

Battery life averages are increasing as chips become more efficient. While the Aero 13 doesn't raise the bar it at least lands in the ""more than acceptable"" range at 10 hours and 32 minutes on a charge based on our Laptop Mag Battery Test (continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits).

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

This would normally be viewed as a victory for the Aero 13 but its rivals the Envy 13 (11:15) Swift 3 (14:48) and ZenBook 13 (13:47) are even better marathon runners. At least the Aero 13 topped the average (10:26) even if it was a photo finish.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 webcam

No it wasn't raining in the climbing gym where I snapped the below selfie. All that mushy grainy texture you see in that picture is visual noise a limitation of this subpar 720p webcam.

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

I guess the colors look alright; my naturally rosy complexion is accurately captured (for better or worse) as is the heathered pattern in my workout shirt. But let me cut the compliments short because this isn't a webcam I would use for anything but casual video calls in optimal lighting. Instead I'd turn to my trusty external webcam .

HP Pavilion Aero 13 heat

The Aero 13's fans kicked on when I was setting it up with my accounts and downloading my most-used apps. Since then it has remained pin-drop silent. And based on our heat test those fans don't need to do much work because the Aero 13 warmed to only 93 degrees Fahrenheit after we played a 15-inch 1080p YouTube video.

Even better the bits your skin touches like the touchpad (79 degrees) and keyboard (88 degrees) remained well below our 95-degree comfort threshold.

HP Pavilion Aero 13 software and warranty

Smaller price bigger bloat. It's a formula that never fails and the Aero 13 is the latest victim. But look if uninstalling obtrusive apps like anything McAfee Booking.com (during a pandemic no less) or a program that directs you to a webpage for an Adobe free trial (seriously HP?) is what it takes to save a few hundred bucks then I'm all about it. Not that I'm going to give HP a pass here but the tradeoff is easy to justify.

As for what HP brings to the table there are eight branded apps. That's seven too many because these could easily be lumped together into one app as Lenovo Asus and others have done. Of these HP-branded apps Support Assistant is the one you'll definitely want to keep around as a resource to update drivers check your warranty status and view your device health. HP Smart won't be so useful if you don't own an HP printer and QuickDrop is yet another app for sharing photos across devices.

HP ships the Pavilion Aero 13 with a standard one-year warranty. See how HP fared in our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands special reports.

Bottom line

(Image credit: Phillip Tracy/Laptop Mag)

The Aero 13 is to laptops what Bumblebee is to film. Until that 2018 release every Transformers movie was awful. Then seemingly out of nowhere a spin-off arrives and makes you consider whether something could come of the franchise. I'm not saying Bumblebee was the height of cinema and like that movie the Aero 13 has its faults. But despite those drawbacks you won't find a better laptop for around $700.

Highlights of this notebook include fast performance from AMD Ryzen chips a featherweight magnesium alloy chassis and a bright and vivid 13.3-inch display. You even get a generous selection of ports and a fingerprint sensor for fast login. It hardly seems worth voicing my gripes but a larger glass touchpad an IR camera and quad speakers top my list of ""wants"" for the next model.

I try to enter each review with a blank slate but my expectations for the Aero 13 were admittedly low once I read ""Pavilion"" on the box. That's because HP's budget-to-midrange Pavilion laptops rarely find themselves in the same sentence as ""fast performance"" ""gorgeous display"" or ""portable."" This makes the Aero 13 something of a coming of age for a long-running but overlooked laptop line. I can only hope future Pavilion laptops grow up to fulfill the potential shown by this standout notebook.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9qYWd1YXIteGotY291cGUtcmVib3JuLXdpdGgtNDAwLWhwLXY4LWFuZC1zdHVubmluZy1jYXJib24tYm9keS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jaguar XJ Coupe Reborn With 400-HP V8 And Stunning Carbon Body,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9qYWd1YXIteGotY291cGUtcmVib3JuLXdpdGgtNDAwLWhwLXY4LWFuZC1zdHVubmluZy1jYXJib24tYm9keS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZmVycmFyaS1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLXRoZS1kYXl0b25hLXNwMy1hbi04MjgtaHAtdHJpYnV0ZS10by10aGUtNjBzLTE3NDY4Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ferrari Introduces the Daytona SP3 an 828-HP Tribute to the '60s,"Have you ever heard of the saying: ""Collect moments not things""?

Because you can drive those cars and the resulting memories will wipe away any financial-related doubts.

Over the past 10 years I've had a very diverse set of automotive experiences ranging from drag racing to Hillclimb events to drifting and GT Racing. And it just so happened that for a few years I found myself embedded in a group of Ferrari enthusiasts and collectors. There is an undeniable sense of passion for the brand and fast cars in general among these people. And in a way you could say that supercar collectors are similar to Hot Wheels collectors.They're always looking to get access to the most exclusive most special vehicles. Once they get started it's hard to stop buying more cars. Every single vehicle has its backstory and has led to developing certain special memories. Although it can be financially challenging at times you know that holding on to those vehicles is going to be a rewarding experience in time.That being said few car manufacturers develop such a strong connection with their customers. Granted it's much easier to do so when you're selling about 10000 vehicles per year but still. You can't think of Ferrari without thinking about racing. Although their F1 program is probably their most prominent motorsports venture Ferrari has got a long history of closed-wheel racing as well.In 1966 at the 24 Hours of Le Mans Race Ford managed a spectacular result by having three cars on the podium. But Ferrari made a strong comeback the following year which started with the 24 Hours of Daytona. Lorenzo Bandini and Chris Amon won the race in a Ferrari 330 P3/4 after completing a total of 666 laps! That makes for a total of 2537 miles (4083 km) at an average pace of 105 mph (170 kph)!Mike Parkes and Ludovico Scarfiotti took second place in their Ferrari 330 P4 after a total of 663 laps. Pedro Rodriguez and Jean Guichet were the drivers of the Ferrari 412 P a customer version of the 330 P4. They completed the all- Ferrari podium making for a memorable moment in the company's racing history. And with that in mind the Italian manufacturer has just unveiled the newest vehicle of their Icona heritage series: the Daytona SP3!Ferrari announced the Icona series back in 2018. At the time they wanted to offer collectors the chance of owning a piece of modern technology inspired by legendary vehicles such as the Ferrari 750 Monza 250 Testarossa and 166 MM. The Ferrari Monza was thus created and it was offered in a single-seater SP1 version and a two-seater SP2 version. The chassis was loosely based on the Ferrari 812 Superfast and it featured a slightly upgraded version of its V12 engine.But let's get back to the Daytona SP3. At first glance you'd tend to think that this is a re-designed Ferrari LaFerrari Aperta. But company officials insist on the fact that although some of the elements are shared with the LaFerrari the Icona series provides a different philosophy. This is more a design-driven concept rather than an actual hypercar although performance-wise it's nothing short of impressive.The name of this new Ferrari evokes the company's legendary 1-2-3 finish at Daytona. While the P3/P4 used a 4.0-liter V12 engine that was capable of around 450 horsepower at 8000 rpm the Daytona SP3 is 50+ years ahead in terms of technology. It's powered by a 6.5-liter V12 that was originally intended for the 812 Competizione. But for this application it is now mounted in a mid-rear position.Of course Ferrari being Ferrari  they weren't going to just mount an existing engine on a new car without making it even better than before. At this level of development you need to remove as much excess weight as possible. And they started by using titanium con rods which are 40% lighter than steel. The crankshaft has been tweaked as well and it's now 3% lighter than before. The intake system has been redesigned as well and there are upgrades in regards to both injection and ignition.With all that in mind this V12 engine is now the most powerful internal combustion engine ever built by Ferrari. While the 812 Competizione was rated for 819 horsepower the new Daytona SP3 takes that number up to 828 horsepower. Consider that this car has a dry weight of 3273 lbs (1485 kg) and that it can reach 124 mph (200 kph) in just 7.4 seconds! That's not as fast as a LaFerrari but then again that's not its intended purpose.There is more F1 technology embued in this car than any normal person would expect. The powertrain the aerodynamics and the components used are motorsports reminiscent and you'd need a special degree to understand each and every detail of this car. With that in mind and given that the seats are integrated into the chassis this car should be capable of providing unparalleled levels of excitement. The only problem is that the SP3 might already be sold out.As with previous Ferrari special cars existing customers and collectors always have priority in purchasing these. Reportedly only 599 SP3s will ever be built and the price tag is set at a whopping €2m ($2.2m) before taxes. The good news is that SP3 clients will benefit from Ferrari's 7-years maintenance program which should offer some peace of mind for the given period.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9teS1pcGFkLXdvbnQtcHJpbnQtY2FudC1maW5kLXByaW50ZXItMTk5NDU0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My iPad Won't Print or Can't Find My Printer - Apple,"With an AirPrint-enabled printer printing on the iPad should be as easy as tapping the Share button choosing Print and selecting your printer. The iPad transmits the print job to the printer and you should be good but the process doesn't always go that smoothly.

If you can't print or the iPad can't find your printer try a few troubleshooting steps that resolve the most common problems.

These troubleshooting tips work with iPadOS 14 iPadOS 13 and all currently supported versions of iOS.

If the Printer Isn't Showing Up in the List on Your iPad

The most common problem occurs when the iPad cannot find or recognize your printer. The root cause of this problem is that the iPad and printer are not communicating with each other correctly. Some printers especially early AirPrint printers are a little finicky and require special treatment from time to time.





Try these troubleshooting steps in order:

Make sure your printer is turned on. Some printers auto power off so check the printer's status first. Verify that you are connected to the correct Wi-Fi network. AirPrint works over Wi-Fi so if you are connected to the internet using 4G you can't print to your network printer. You must connect through Wi-Fi and it must be the same Wi-Fi network as your printer. Most homes only have one Wi-Fi network but some routers broadcast on a 2.4 GHz network and a 5 GHz network. Large homes may have a Wi-Fi extender that broadcasts on a different network. Ensure both the iPad and printer are on the same network with the same frequency. Refresh the iPad's Wi-Fi connection. This procedure forces the iPad to look for the printer again. To refresh Wi-Fi open the iPad's settings tap Wi-Fi in the left-side list and tap the green switch to turn Wi-Fi off. Leave it off for a moment and then turn it back on. After the iPad reconnects to the network try printing again. Reboot the iPad. It is surprising how many random problems rebooting the iPad will solve. Rebooting isn't first on this list because many of the other steps here are quick to check. Hold down the Sleep/Wake button (also referred to as the Power button) until the iPad prompts you to slide to power off. Then slide the button. An iPad Pro requires you to hold down the Power button and either of the volume buttons. After it powers down press the Power button again to restart it. Restart the printer. Instead of a problem with the iPad it could be a problem with the printer. Powering down the printer and powering it back up again could correct problems on the printer side. Wait until the printer has reconnected to the Wi-Fi network before testing it again. Most AirPrint printers have a Wi-Fi light or icon on the display to show that it is connected properly. Verify it is an AirPrint printer. If this is a new printer it should say that it is AirPrint compatible on the packaging. Some older printers use a specific app to print from the iPad so refer to the owner's manual. You can see a list of AirPrint printers on Apple's website.

If the Printer Appears in the List

If you can see the printer on your iPad and send print jobs to the printer it is probably not an iPad problem. The iPad should detect standard problems like the printer being out of paper or out of ink but this capability relies on the printer to communicate back with the iPad.

× Expand Andrea Hubbell Photography

Tony Vanderwarker commutes to work every day on a John Deere Gator. He leaves the front door of his home in idyllic Keswick and drives the utility vehicle up a winding path to his writing studio a structure he describes as a variation on a church steeple: 25 feet high 9 feet square and lifted from the ground on four 6-foot by 6-foot posts. Inside is enough room for a small desk his Apple Cube (remember those?) and a few bookcases. The space where he reports each day to write for several hours is spare but comfortable free of distractions but graced with inspiring views.

It was here in sight of Thomas Jefferson’s gentle rolling Southwest Mountains that Vanderwarker wrote his first published novel a thriller titled Sleeping Dogs and Writing with the Master: How One of the World’s Bestselling Authors Fixed My Book and Changed My Life the story of how friend and Keswick neighbor John Grisham mentored the long-unpublished author. Both books were published in February.

Though Vanderwarker 71 dreamed of writing novels since age 15 he never really did much with that dream until he cashed out of the advertising business about 20 years ago. Ending his successful career on a high note as founder and former senior creative director of one of Chicago’s largest advertising agencies—Bayer Bess Vanderwarker—he and his wife Anne decided to pack up their children and move to a small farm outside of Charlottesville to be closer to extended family (Anne is from Richmond) and to enjoy the slower pace offered by country living. At the time two of their four children were still at home—a son Vandy then age 12 and a daughter Krissy then 14. (Older sons Bryan and Keith had already flown the nest.)

This was the perfect time for Vanderwarker to work on his dream of novel writing in earnest. Five years later the couple purchased Chopping Bottom Farm a long and narrow 75 acres—1100 feet wide and a mile long. The family lived in the existing house on the front of the property a small 1950s Cape while they built their dream home and the writing studio.

Charlottesville architect and friend Jeff Dreyfus helped Vanderwarker design both the studio and the 2900-square-foot main house. He and Dreyfus plotted out the design of the studio on a cocktail napkin over drinks and it was actually completed well before the home. Like anyone who works from home Vanderwarker knows all too well the temptations that beckon—there’s coffee to be had radio to listen to house chores to be completed. “I built the studio so I have to use it” he says explaining the accountability that comes with dedicating space for the pursuit of a childhood dream. And use it he does five days a week several hours a day without fail.

The Vanderwarkers designed the main house with equal intentionality. From the start they knew they wanted to create something modern and clean. By this time their youngest son was heading off to college so they felt like they could finally shed some of the trappings that had been necessary for raising children—bedrooms rec rooms storage for sports equipment.

They wanted to create something distinctive but they also wanted an exterior that complemented the traditional architectural styles of Virginia’s foxhunt country. The result is a home inspired by a pristine white barn standing solitary in a field (discovered on a country drive) and based on a design by Hugh Newell Jacobsen a prominent D.C.-based architect known for his deliberately sparse linear style. A genuine reflection of the couple’s taste the home was recognized as the 2001 Grand Prize “Met Home of the Year” by (now defunct) Metropolitan Home magazine. It stands in bold yet quiet relief to the countryside. It comprises three pavilions with steeply pitched roofs connected by pergolas beautiful yet unadorned making a statement yet blending in with the rolling tree-dotted hills of Keswick.

“We have a great art collection so we wanted the home to have a real gallery feel” says Vanderwarker. Fields of white walls alternate with expanses of glass providing a quality of light like no other as well as unobstructed views of the bucolic countryside. (Window treatments aren’t necessary for privacy when one’s only neighbors are wildlife.) Poured concrete floors have acquired just the right patina while a mix of rugs—from antique orientals to a conveyor-belt material runner in the entry—soften footsteps of visitors inhabitants and the couple’s four dogs.

The home may be clean sleek and contemporary but there is nothing cold about it even in the depths of winter. It’s infused with the Vanderwarkers’ sense of warmth—their desire to surround themselves with good company and to showcase and enjoy their hobbies and talents without the clutter of everyday life.

The house is laid out in the footprint of the letter “H”: The long entry hall leads into two pavilions off either end. Behind the wall of the entry hall is the third pavilion encompassing the kitchen dining and living areas. Knowing that guests tend to congregate in the kitchen even in an open space like this the couple focused on making this area as inviting and visually pleasing as possible. “We realized that what really makes a kitchen look too much like a kitchen are the cabinets so we got rid of them” says Vanderwarker. Storage below the counters provides plenty of room to stash cooking gear. The couple’s serving pieces are hidden in a clever “plate garage” tucked underneath the counter of the island that separates the food prep area from the dining space. Initially they worried that making the island tall enough to house the plate garage would result in a too-tall countertop. But at 48 inches the island is the perfect height for guests to gather round—a comfortable spot for leaning and gabbing while visiting with the cooks.

The kitchen and eating area opens into a serene living area featuring a 25-foot ceiling with three elegant slim dormers that are signature Jacobsen providing yet another layer of light. Neutral slipcovered chairs and a sleek chaise provide places for reading and relaxing. A Sally Mann landscape photograph hangs over the often-used fireplace.

On either side of the main living space are two more pavilions. One houses the master bedroom a guest room two full baths and Anne’s office space in a hallway nook. (Anne owns Fearless Flowers a virtual flower-arranging workshop.) The master bedroom has amazing views of the farm and the 70-foot lap pool and features a bed with built-in storage and lighting. In the master bathroom cubes of cabinets hang on the wall and a sink set atop a stone slab doubles as a wine cooler. With design like this the Vanderwarkers can use the whole house to entertain. “We had a party and a guest asked ‘What room is this?’ I said ‘It’s the master bath’” Vanderwarker laughs. A collection of Indian fish decoys and a green glass tile shower add whimsy to this spa-like space.

In the pavilion on the other side of the house a gallery of photographs by Sebastiao Salgado featuring a Brazilian gold mine frames an antique grandfather clock. Around the corner a TV room doubles as a guest room with a sleeping and storage loft above the media area.

If every bit of the couple’s home is put to use the same can be said of the property. Vanderwarker jokes that what started as two gardens to satisfy Anne’s talent and passion for floral design has grown to 17 gardens providing plenty of material for the stunning arrangements she creates in a studio above the garage.

Indeed the pristine countryside is important to the Vanderwarkers. The couple champions the Piedmont Environmental Council (Vanderwarker recently served as its chairman for six years) which works to promote and protect the area’s rural economy natural resources and history.

Writing however is Vanderwarker’s main pursuit. In addition to a new novel he’s writing about a bioterror threat—his ninth book—Vanderwarker is busy promoting Writing with the Master and Sleeping Dogs—the novel that inspired the memoir.

Vanderwarker met Grisham when their sons played football together in high school. Over the years they became friends as athletes’ parents often do spending time together socially and taking occasional vacations with one another. If the friends talked about writing it was usually about Grisham’s writing until one fateful lunch he offered to help Vanderwarker with his book. Writing with the Master details Vanderwarker’s journey from aspiring writer with seven books languishing on his computer’s hard drive to published novelist with the guidance and encouragement of one of the greatest thriller writers of all time.

If it’s hard to say which book to read first it’s easy to say that both are fascinating and compelling and the experience of reading each provides context for the other. Sleeping Dogs is a page-turner in which relatable strong characters both male and female navigate a twisty plot in a race with the bad guys to recover a lost nuclear bomb while Writing with the Master details the behind-the-scenes process of writing and editing Sleeping Dogs—interwoven with mostly funny sometimes poignant personal stories giving a more complete picture of the life of a writer.

If you’re expecting Don Draper swagger from this former ad man you may be surprised by Vanderwarker’s gentle unassuming manner. But if you’re into Mad Men you’ll have to check out his forthcoming book Ads for God in which a down-on-his-luck ad man takes on the biggest client imaginable. Also coming this year look for his comic novel Say Something Funny. To be sure this is a man who likes to tell stories.",,,,,,,,,,,,

HBAN,Huntington Bancshares,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlcnNldGlja2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbW9saXRpb24td29yay1wbGFubmVkLWZvci1yb3Rhcnktc3F1YXJlLW1vcmUtZG93bnRvd24tcHJvamVjdC11cGRhdGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demolition Work Planned For Rotary Square; More Downtown Project Updates,"Demolition work is slated to begin this winter on the future site of Rotary Square on the corner of Union and State streets after the Traverse City Downtown Development Authority (DDA) finalized a purchase agreement with Huntington Bank for the property this week. Rotary Square is one of several projects moving ahead – from parking lot redevelopment to planning for a new riverfront plaza to a new luxury short-term rental complex – in the downtown area.

DDA CEO Jean Derenzy tells The Ticker her organization will put out a request-for-proposals (RFP) next week for the demolition of the bank building on the Rotary Square property (pictured). Another RFP is also planned to go out to find a consulting firm to lead the DDA through a community visioning process to determine the design and uses of the long-planned civic square. “I’m hoping demolition can start by February and the visioning process can start in February or March” Derenzy says.

Uses proposed for the space have ranged from a winter ice skating rink and dedicated site for the downtown Christmas tree to a space for live music and public performances to park amenities like benches and fountains. The visioning team will help narrow the ideal design and amenities down ahead of a potential 2023 construction start date Derenzy says. The DDA already has $3 million committed to the project including a $1 million gift from Rotary and a $2 million allocation from the state of Michigan. Some initial estimates have put the total price tag at $5 million for Rotary Square a cost that will be refined through the visioning process but will still likely require additional fundraising or allocations to realize.

An initial bank deal would’ve required the DDA to build a new mixed-use building on Lot G the city-owned parking lot next to Mode’s Bum Steer to relocate the TCF headquarters across the street to make way for Rotary Square. However the merger of TCF and Huntington Bank meant a new bank location was no longer needed. Instead Huntington agreed to sell the Rotary Square property outright to the DDA. Without having to build a new bank headquarters first the DDA can now move significantly faster on Rotary Square demolition and construction.

The move also means the DDA can explore other infill options for Lot G with three proposals currently on the table from developers to partner with the city on a mixed-use project that would include commercial space and workforce housing. Derenzy says an ad hoc committee will be working with the three firms to narrow options down to one proposal to go to DDA board members and city commissioners for approval. The DDA is also targeting the redevelopment of parking Lot O next to The Omelette Shoppe with HomeStretch and Goodwill Inn selected as a prospective development team to bring a five-story 64-unit building to that site. The city is working through negotiations with developers on that project with the ultimate goal of producing a contract that comes to downtown and city leaders for approval.

The DDA has long aimed to redevelop surface parking lots into more productive multi-story retail and housing uses. However that goal has also been tied to the construction of a new third public parking deck downtown planned to be built on West Front Street. Redeveloping Lots G and O would result in the loss of 81 parking spaces downtown. Derenzy acknowledges that the DDA “can’t lose all of that parking without that plan for the west end parking deck.” Numerous design and funding questions remain for the deck – which had a most recent cost estimate of $15-$20 million – but Derenzy says the DDA has been working with consultants on options and could bring a design and funding recommendation forward to city leaders in the first quarter of 2022.

Other projects are also moving ahead downtown. Derenzy told board members Friday that the DDA issued an RFP last week – with bids due December 3 – for consulting services to develop full design and engineering plans for a new riverwalk and pedestrian plaza in the alley along the 100 block of Front Street. The retaining wall along the Boardman River in that alley block is deteriorating requiring a sewer main to be relocated away from the wall and closer to the buildings as well as replacing the service lines connected to the main. That major project could allow the DDA to redesign the alley at the same time taking out the wall completely and opening up public access to the Boardman with a green riverfront plaza.

As part of the RFP consultants will also look at design options for the 200 block alley of Front Street where the retaining wall also needs to be addressed but is in better shape than the 100 block. Derenzy notes the final draft of the Lower Boardman River Unified Plan – a master plan for the 1.6-mile urban river stretch between Boardman Lake and Grand Traverse Bay – will come to city leaders for approval during multiple meetings in December and January. That plan specifically supports projects like the alley redesign to better connect the community to the Boardman. “The number one priority (in the plan) is improving riverfront access” Derenzy says.

In addition to public projects private developments are also underway in downtown Traverse City. On Thursday Golden Swan Management and the Golden family – including Golden Shoes co-owner Bill Golden – announced plans to revitalize the space above the shoe store at 122 East Front Street into a new luxury rental complex called Golden Lofts. Four units – two two-bedroom and two one-bedroom units – with “high-end amenities and decorative interior finishes created from repurposed elements of the building’s past incarnations” will occupy the upper building space. The historic building built in 1883 has hosted numerous uses on its upper floors over the years including Chamber of Commerce functions the National Cherry Festival and a draft during the Vietnam War.

Downtown visitors will see work underway on the building starting Monday when the current façade is slated to be removed.

This modification brings the total advance funding for LHA 9 to $651 million.

“We appreciate the partnership we have with the Navy and their continued commitment to this important ship” Ingalls Shipbuilding President Kari Wilkinson said. “Not only will it provide capability to our Navy fleet but it also sustains hundreds of jobs across the country within our vast network of suppliers in support of construction.”

LHAs are the centerpiece of the Navy amphibious ready groups and Marine Corps air ground task forces. In addition to serving as maintenance and logistics facilities LHAs are top-of-the-line medical facilities with full operating suites and triage capabilities.

Ingalls is the sole builder of large-deck amphibious ships for the Navy. The shipyard delivered its first amphibious assault ship the Iwo Jima-class USS Tripoli (LPH 10) in 1966. Ingalls has since built five Tarawa-class (LHA 1) ships eight Wasp-class (LHD 1) ships and the first in the new America class of amphibious assault ships (LHA 6) in 2014. The second ship in the America class USS Tripoli (LHA 7) was delivered to the Navy in early 2020.

Ford,"WASHINGTON – The reason is prosaic – the US military does not seem to have provided a regular supply of spare parts for the latest “floating airfield” worth $ 13 billion learned BulgarianMilitary.com citing Defense News.

Photo credit: Daily Press

The U.S. Navy was forced to resort to a partial “spare parts cannibalism” to speed up the commissioning of the newest aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford which is due to launch its first military campaign next year.

The “victim of cannibalism” was the hull of the promising aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy [CVN-79] which was launched in 2019 and the commissioning of the US Navy is being prepared for 2024.

The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy “cannibalized” mainly the elements of the power supply system for the USS Gerald R. Ford in particular – controllers for engines and other power supplies pumping units valve actuators and switches for various systems throughout the ship.

In other words we are talking about a sudden shortage of components the production of which does not require the possession of critical technologies.

The US military boasts that the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy will be a platform for 23 high-tech systems at once such as an electromagnetic catapult to launch EMALS aircraft or elevators to supply ammunition. And the lack of components for the ship’s power supply systems looks at least an annoying failure.

Officially the US Navy shipbuilding company Huntington Ingalls Industries [NSI] the manufacturer of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford say that the sudden problem with components for the ship’s power systems was a surprise for them “which could not have been foreseen.”

The American ships and the military say that the “cannibalism of spare parts” from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy at the stage of completion – and will remain a “single episode.” As a result the US Navy and NIS are preparing a contract for the regular supply of components to equip power systems and other systems for promising aircraft carriers such as the USS Gerald R. Ford.

There are other aspects to this story of “spare parts cannibalism” for the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford. The US Navy managed to certify the flight deck of the ship and the air group so the “borrowing” of spare parts in general did not create bureaucratic problems.

The US Navy did not disclose the reason under which the problem arose with the lack of spare parts for the ship’s power supply systems in particular – during which stage of the tests this problem “got out”. It seems that this problem “came out” after the last stage of the cycle of underwater blasting tests [FSST] which took place in early August 2021.

Then the US Navy detonated a charge weighing 18 tons the explosion of which was able to simulate an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.9. The US Navy announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford’s system for fighting the survival of the aircraft carrier was a success but the US military was diplomatically silent about the state of the ship’s other systems.

In theory the US Navy could order the production of new components for the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and not resort to “cannibalism of spare parts” from the future aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy.

But here the financial factor seems to have played a role – instead of the planned $ 10.5 billion the actual cost of building the USS Gerald R. Ford has already reached $ 13 billion and here the US Navy could decide not to go beyond budget constraints.

IBM,IBM,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzIxL2JldHRlci1idXktaWJtLW9yLWt5bmRyeWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: IBM or Kyndryl?,"Many investors are wondering what to do with this new Kyndryl stock. Is it a better buy than the parent company IBM?

Technology giant International Business Machines (IBM 0.53%) recently completed a long-awaited spinoff setting Kyndryl Holdings (KD 3.37%) apart as a separate business and independently traded stock. IBM shareholders including Yours Truly received 1 Kyndryl share per 5 shares of IBM in the process.

So now I'm both an IBM investor and a Kyndryl shareholder. Should I hold on to both of them or is it time to sell one and reinvest that cash in the other? And then we have investors who didn't own any IBM stock on Nov. 4 2021 asking a different question -- which slice of the former IBM entity is the better place to park new money?

What is this Kyndryl company anyway?

Kyndryl was created in late October when IBM followed through on a spinoff plan that was first announced more than a year earlier. The original idea was to detach the company's managed infrastructure services from IBM's cloud computing ambitions. At arm's length from Big Blue's cloud-based services and artificial intelligence (AI) tools the new company would be a sensible service provider regardless of which brand name appears on the client's servers and cloud computing contracts.

The managed infrastructure company started life with a $9.1 billion market cap in late October. However IBM's market cap shrank from $127.3 billion to $115.1 billion that day -- a $12.2 billion reduction. As a result $3.1 billion of shareholder value simply disappeared as investors pondered how this experiment might turn out in the long run.

You might wonder what exactly a managed infrastructure business is. Kyndryl's assets and operations used to be known as the managed infrastructure services part of IBM's global technology services segment. This business plan involves developing and maintaining the software that runs behind the scenes of any modern business along with a plethora of support services for those crucial software assets. Kyndryl provides a wide variety of valuable IT management expertise from network design and cloud computing to data security and IT planning.

The story so far

So far the bears are winning the Kyndryl debate. By the end of Friday Oct. 19 Kyndryl's stock had fallen another 55% since the date of record in October or 30% from the first day of public trading. IBM's stock only declined by 4% over the same period while the S&P 500 market index didn't change at all.

There was no clear reason for Kyndryl's month-long slide. The company is not sitting on its hands announcing new or expanded partnerships with household names Microsoft Pitney Bowes and VMware along the way. Investors and analysts aren't exactly bursting with excitement over this unknown new investment vehicle.

Is Kyndryl undervalued?

It remains to be seen exactly how effective Kyndryl can be as a stand-alone business. The company has not reported financial results since the spinoff was completed. Moreover the first few reports will be burdened with expenses related to the spinoff transaction not to mention the adjustment to a different way of doing business.

However it seems obvious that Kyndryl's stock deserves to trade at a higher price level. The IBM operations that would later become Kyndryl reported $19.4 billion in revenue for 2020. You can pick up shares at the bargain-bin valuation of 0.22 times that sales figure. Even if revenues are shrinking quickly that's too low. I can't find a close competitor trading below 0.48 times trailing sales and the IBM mothership commands a P/S ratio of 1.41 -- and I see IBM as a deep-value investment.

The dividend question

IBM is known as a generous dividend investment offering a yield of 4.6% before the Kyndryl spinoff. The yield has surged to 5.6% today while Kyndryl hasn't declared any payouts at all.

That situation is likely to stick around for the long haul. Kyndryl's pre-spinoff operations generated just $0.6 billion of free cash flows in 2020 out of $15.0 billion for IBM as a whole. The combined operation's cash machine is staying under the Big Blue banner leaving little room for shareholder-friendly dividend policies at Kyndryl. Management promised that the combined initial dividends of Kyndryl and IBM would at least be equal to the old IBM entity's payouts per share.

So if you wanted to own the old IBM for its generous dividend yields you should stick with the IBM name today as well.

The final verdict

All things considered Kyndryl doesn't have much to offer investors right now. This operation was IBM's least exciting asset in terms of long-term growth potential. It's not a massive cash generator. The big dividend payouts will continue to flow through the IBM stock not Kyndryl.

I do see one reason to pick up some Kyndryl shares right now or hold on to the shares that were created by the spinoff. The stock is just too darn cheap even if Kyndryl's growth prospects are dim. Among 1618 stocks on U.S. exchanges with a market cap of at least $4 billion (Kyndryl stands at $4.2 billion) only 12 carry lower price-to-sales ratios than this ticker.

So I think it would be unwise to sell my Kyndryl shares at these unreasonably low prices and bargain hunters might even want to pick up some Kyndryl stock expecting an upward price correction relatively soon. A price mismatch this large rarely lasts very long.

Other than that valuation wrinkle I see no reason to get excited about Kyndryl's stock and would much rather focus on IBM -- which still strikes me as a fantastic growth stock at a reasonable valuation plus one of the richest dividend yields in the tech sector.

IBM is the clear winner here from almost every conceivable angle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlibS5jb20vYmxvZy9leHBlcmllbmNlLXBlcnNvbmFsaXphdGlvbi10aGUtbmV3LWVudGVycHJpc2UtbWFuZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experience personalization the new enterprise mandate,"Consumers continue to demand personalized experiences that deliver on their needs and preferences. Driven by key industry changes this mandate is more important than ever.

Cookies are crumbling

The rise of the “platform economy” is exponentially increasing the life time value of customers and a cookie-less world is going to make targeting more challenging. Consumer privacy regulations are also continuing to challenge the ability for brands to drive marketing ROI. We think the battle ground for consumer mindshare will accelerate its shift from personalizing media platforms to personalizing a brand’s customer experience platforms.

I nvestment priorities are shifting

There’s a persuasive case for CMOs to start rethinking how they deploy their working dollars to drive ROI. There is also plenty of evidence to demonstrate how investing in the improvement of holistic customer experience delivers better ROI than investing in low performing media or advertising outlets. Organizations that have elevated the customer experience transformation to a formal business priority report a 3x higher revenue growth.

Synchronization is what matters

Driving personalized customer experiences is not a strategic challenge it’s an operational challenge that brands have struggled to address. It requires process data and technology synchronization and integration across the entire value chain — marketing sales manufacturing logistics finance and more. Fundamentally companies lack the proper operating model that cuts across and integrates across enterprise functions in order to deliver customer personalization at scale.

Implementing e nterprise-wide customer experience

We believe CMO’s must rise to own the enterprise-wide customer experience and not just the omni channel communication engagement. Key enabling pillars must be implemented to enable a personalization operating model within companies. This includes:

Moving customer ownership out of the front office and into the back office where it is a business operations priority and focus for every employee

Creating a unique and persistent customer ID across the enterprise including demand platforms supply chain and finance

Embracing new ways of working including agile and cross-functional teams

Integrating technology across platforms and business units

Maximizing the value of analytics to drive personalization automate processes and uncover deeper customer insights visible to all

Next steps

In this experience era organizations must pivot from one-to-one messaging to one-to-one experiences. They must shift from media outlets to experience platforms. And they must structure operations to move from a focus on customer acquisition to a strategy around lifetime-value growth. In this new world companies and CMOs will come to rely not only advertising agencies but on a new breed of strategic partners to help them navigate new personalization imperatives. Strategic partners that can support the synthesizing of design analytics data complex technology integration and business-transformation capabilities to drive industry-transforming customer experiences. They will use their experience and capabilities to unite organizations behind this collective effort.

IBM combines experience design data and analytics and platform-implementation capabilities with Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Cloud solutions.

An unnamed Intel partner took a GPU engineering sample for a whirl in the Geekbench OpenCL test suite using a slightly dated i5-9600K validation platform and here's what we learned...

In outright numbers the GPU does poorly. The four runs achieved an average OpenCL score of about 67000 points and its highest score was 69000 points. For comparison the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT releases about a year ago sits in the 150000 to 180000 point ballpark.

But don't be discouraged. Consider this: according to the metadata collected by Geekbench during the runs the GPU was hovering at around 1.3 GHz. At that frequency with 512 EUs the GPU has a theoretical 11 TFLOPS of performance.

AMD's Radeon RX 6600 XT has similar 11 TFLOPS and scores in the 60000 to 70000 point range. Hence Intel's architecture has the same per-TFLOPS performance in OpenCL as AMD's does.

So the question is: can Intel match AMD's high-end TFLOPS numbers?

According to Geekbench the GPU had a rated clock speed of 2.1 GHz. If it had run at that speed and not at 1.3 GHz then it would've had 17 TFLOPS which is on par with the RX 6800 (non-XT). So the answer to that question is yes if 2.1 GHz is achievable.

And frankly 2.1 GHz isn't that high. If the rumors are true and Intel is using the TSMC N6 node then they could potentially push the clocks high enough to break into RX 6800 XT and RTX 3080 performance territory.

Remember that this is pure conjecture but we're not the first to claim that Intel's GPUs will land somewhere alongside the RTX 3070 or RTX 3080. Intel themselves hinted that their flagship will be priced a touch above the latter at $740 to $790. Still as today's OpenCL scores show Intel may still be hard at work to get there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFtYXRpb24uY29tL2VkZ2UtY29tcHV0aW5nL2ludGVybmV0LW9mLXRoaW5ncy1pb3QtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXFhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Internet of Things (IoT) Q&A with Christine Boles at Intel: Understanding the Intelligent Edge,"Datamation content and product recommendations are editorially independent.

Internet of Things Q&A

IoT as a Career

Datamation: How did you first get started in or develop an interest in the Internet of Things?

Boles: I joined Intel almost 30 years ago at our Chandler Arizona location in the Embedded Products Division as an application engineer for 16-bit microcontrollers. During my tenure at Intel I’ve had the opportunity to help our customers design Intel’s products into their solution; drive product management including ecosystems for our solutions addressing a range of market segments such as communications automotive and retail; serve as technical assistant and chief of staff to one of our global Fabrication Manufacturing executives; and am currently leading Intel’s Industrial Solutions Division.

While the term Internet of Things has emerged in the last several years my career has been building to this from embedded systems to now intelligent and connected systems across a range of industries. Thus my interest and experience have continued to grow and expand with the evolution of the industry and the new possibilities each day.

Datamation: What makes Intel a unique place to work?

Boles: Everything. Intel is a company and brand founded on innovation and technological growth. We pride ourselves in having some of the best and brightest in the world and our leading-edge technology is transforming the world we live in. In addition we are fortunate to have an outstanding technology innovator CEO Pat Gelsinger who is relentlessly reinvigorating our investment in manufacturing and semiconductor product leadership. Plus Intel’s commitment to diversity and inclusion is industry-leading and makes this an incredible place to work.

Developing a Strong IoT Strategy

Datamation: What sets Intel’s IoT solutions or approach apart from the competition?

Boles: At Intel we are investing in cutting-edge technology that is driving innovation and industry transformation as well as solving specific customer business challenges. We are actively listening to our customers particularly industry-specific customers such as manufacturers retailers health care providers and more to better understand their pain points and their biggest obstacles to growth or meeting their customer needs.

We focus our efforts and drive innovation to solve these challenges — expanding our areas of innovation and utilizing the breadth of Intel’s edge networking and cloud products and technologies to address our customers and the industry’s needs.

Within our Internet of Things Group and specifically the Industrial Solutions Division that I lead we are enabling a more intelligent edge supporting enterprises that are moving to the edge so they can capture more data analyze it faster and act on it sooner. For example we are taking analytics to the edge and helping manufacturers automate and enhance critical quality-control processes in their factories.

By creating a data-driven platform solution they are able to reduce human error and ensure products are built with even more accuracy and precision.

Datamation: What do you think makes an IoT platform or product successful?

Boles: The key in deployments such as in factories where my team focuses is a clear return on investment operational acceptance and scalability of the solution. As first deployments happen the solution must provide easy implementation and a clear understanding of the benefits being provided.

As the benefits are seen the management will look to scale it thus the need for proven solutions that scale such as Intel’s ecosystem of market-ready solutions. With that said even if the ROI is there and the solution is scalable we find it is critical that the solution works within the operations workflow for its acceptance.

Datamation: How can the average company affordably integrate IoT automation and other efficiencies into their business?

Boles: Often IoT automation solutions are deployed where much effort has already been placed for a particular problem area and further ROI can only be achieved through automation. For example there is a limit to the accuracy that a human can provide for an inspection process as well as ergonomic concerns. These types of situations are ripe for automation to improve accuracy product quality and worker safety.

We have seen this in multiple manufacturing industries for defect detection including textile die-cast components and automotive. One specific defect detection that we are helping industry solution providers solve for manufacturers is weld defect detection where they can use machine vision to detect and adjust the robotic welder in real-time.

Datamation: How can companies provide security for industrial IoT infrastructure?

Boles: Providing security for any infrastructure requires consideration and implementation of multiple layers such as hardware root of trust provisioning of devices access control data security in the system and data security in transit to name a few. Intel works with industry standards and with our ecosystem of partners to bring best-known practices into solutions utilizing Intel platforms. As an example we worked with the FIDO Alliance and several other companies to define and release an open standard for secure device onboarding.

Datamation: What are the top networking and infrastructure challenges that companies face when trying to build their IoT strategy?

Boles: This past year-plus we had a dramatic shift to limited on-site access and needed remote access to operational information or system experts. While “remote operations” has been a discussion and goal in the industrial sector for some time there was not an urgency to solve for it because it required possible fundamental changes in the operations of industrial environments.

As an example from our engagement and studies with global manufacturing companies they have recognized investment in their networking and infrastructure is critical to bring more IT capabilities to their operations platforms. This is one area that we focus on in order to help our ecosystem of solution providers bring a more open platform approach utilizing the range of assets from Intel edge to cloud to the operations technology area. This will allow them to address the industry needs of remote access and managed operations platforms.

Trends in Industrial IoT

Datamation: What do you think are some of the top trends in industrial IoT right now? What platforms and/or devices do you find to be the most compelling?

Boles: Industrial organizations are on an accelerated path to realizing the factory of the future driven in part by their desire to be more agile and resilient; they are seeking ways to leverage data more effectively. Catalyzed by both new and historic challenges the demand for transformative data-driven technology applications like artificial intelligence (AI) IoT and automation is higher than it has ever been. Organizations now recognize just how critical it is to be able to foresee disruptions on the horizon and respond promptly and decisively.

From a severely interrupted supply chain and unprecedented labor shortages to rapidly changing customer demands and the ability to extract actionable insights from data using AI and machine learning (ML) applications we at Intel see these developments not just as pain points but also as areas of transformational need.

Another global trend that is very important is the convergence of information technology operation technology (OT) and communications technology especially because it enables the vision of software-defined industrial systems for self-organizing flexible production flow self-aware production systems and collaborative machines with the enabled connected worker.

The prevailing vision of the “factory of the future” is a combination of standardized connectivity deterministic control advanced compute and AI.​ A platform that supports an infrastructure converging OT IT and CT will not only result in a lower total cost of ownership but also makes an ideal choice for future services innovation.

Datamation: What do you think we’ll see more of in the IoT space in the next 5-10 years?

Boles: Over the last couple of years we have seen some dramatic changes in our manufacturing customers’ technology investment strategies and we are expecting this trend to continue. With labor shortages throughout virtually every industry our customers are accelerating their investment focus on networking and connectivity upgrades cloud capabilities and industrial automation.

These technology investments are addressing our customers’ challenges and hence are focused on increasing resilience and productivity worker safety and remote work. Intel continues to lead the industrial transformation and continues to be the springboard for transformative solutions that improve business outcomes. For example we will continue to see Intel’s Intelligent Edge platforms across all industrial market segments to enable compute augmentation and connectivity in unprecedented ways.

Intel’s foundational edge inference and machine vision development environment and reference designs applicable across multiple industries will continue to enable our manufacturing solution providers to automate quality assurance processes using machine vision to detect flaws that are not visible to the human eye in real-time — while also enabling fully autonomous retail stores through computer vision autonomous mobile robots that help warehouse operators manage the explosive growth in e-commerce orders meet consumer expectations for rapid delivery and medical diagnostic imaging powered by AI.

Datamation: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected you your colleagues and/or your clients’ approach to IoT solutions?

Boles: The pandemic has greatly accelerated the need for companies to complete their Industry 4.0 transformations with solutions that allow them to have more flexibility visibility and efficiency in their operations. We have seen accelerated adoption of AI solutions that help address that need including machine learning machine vision and advanced analytics. We’ve also seen a significant uptick in investment in the foundational OT infrastructure with more IT capabilities to allow the broad ecosystem of players to deploy these solutions.

An Expert Perspective on the Market

Datamation: How have you seen the IoT solutions market change since you first started? How have the technologies services conversations and people changed over time?

Boles: When the industry started to talk about the Internet of Things much of the conversation and focus was on connecting to the things and getting to the data. At the time many talked about all the information needing to go to the cloud for “big data” analysis. Of course there is a need for big data analysis and correlation between multiple data sets but there has recently been a recognition of the need for computing and intelligence at the edge.

There were also a lot of proof of concepts several years ago that showed the value and the return on investment but the solutions did not scale easily. The focus now from a technology perspective is on edge computing connectivity and AI. At Intel we focus on working with the breadth of our ecosystem to bring solutions that address the needs bring the benefits and can scale.

Datamation: How do you stay knowledgeable about trends in the market? What resources do you like?

Boles: I use a myriad of sources from news articles to journals. In addition we partner with key industry analysts to hear their insights on market trends and industry information. We also conduct our own studies to learn directly from industry-specific customers on their challenges and where they are investing. And I learn the most by engaging directly with manufacturers utilities and the breadth of our ecosystem partners.

Datamation: With the shortage of qualified talent in the tech world how is Intel finding and recruiting qualified candidates for your IoT teams?

Boles: Sourcing talent at Intel is a team effort; we have an incredible Intel recruiting team. Intel is also active with our education community to develop tech talent. As one example in 2020 Intel partnered with the Maricopa County Community College and the Arizona Commerce Authority to launch the first Intel-designed artificial intelligence associate degree program — aimed to enable tens of thousands of students to land careers in high-tech fields. In August of this year we announced a broad expansion of this program at 18 community colleges across 11 states.

Outside of Work

Datamation: What do you like to do in your free time outside of work?

Boles: I love spending time with my family and especially seeing my children participate in a range of activities. Personally I enjoy the outdoors and for the hot Arizona summers I often have a range of projects and books in flight.

Datamation: If you had to work in any other industry or role what would it be and why?

Boles: I realized early in my career that I love seeing technology applied to solve real problems. I also quickly learned how much I enjoy working with customers and ultimately driving business results. So while I can do that in a different industry right now I have an incredible role working with an incredible team and with partners across Intel and the industry. And we are applying technology to address real industry challenges which is helping transform an industry.

Datamation: What do you consider the best part of your workday or workweek?

Boles: Working with incredible talented people around the globe!

Datamation: What are you most proud of in your professional and/or personal life?

Boles: For colleagues whom I had a small part in their career through teams that I led or individuals that I mentored I am proudest to see them soar to new opportunities and new heights!

Along with that piece I wanted to provide a bit more commentary since it was pushed out only a few hours after the discussion ended. A video was in the works but we hit a bit of a snag.

Intel Shares its Plan to Zettascale Video

After returning from SC21 I recorded a video and then got my booster shot that has me a bit slow a the moment (but this morning is looking better.) As a result the video was delayed about a day instead of an hour. The video was uploaded yesterday. Normally YouTube processes the 4K video in SD quickly then HD then 4K and that process takes 10-15 minutes. The video was scheduled but never got pushed to subscribers. So the video was re-uploaded and pushed out this morning.

In the video we have a recap of my discussion with Raja and perhaps a bit more context around each of the areas discussed. As always we suggest opening videos in a new web browser tab or app for a better viewing experience.

Final Words

This was a bit rough. As of now the first time the video was uploaded that video is still stuck on “Processing HD version” while the video above was uploaded hours later and has HD and 4K processing complete. The few folks that did see the original video had great feedback so if you are not normally a STH YouTube watcher this may be one to put on working around the house this weekend.

Over the course of the discussion we went well beyond what is being discussed in this video but so it seems like Intel has a plan albeit an aggressive one to deliver a huge speedup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydW1zLm1hY3J1bW9ycy5jb20vdGhyZWFkcy9hY2NpZGVudGFsbHktZGVsZXRlZC1tYWNpbnRvc2gtaGQtaW4tZGlzay11dGlsaXR5LW1icC0yMDE3LWludGVsLjIzMjQyODcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Accidentally Deleted ""Macintosh HD"" in Disk Utility MBP 2017 Intel","OP wrote:

That IS NOT ""internet recovery"".

It IS ""the recovery partition"".

THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING.



You said you have a tm backup is that right?

So... it doesn't matter if you ""wipe"" the MBP right...?



Here's how to erase the drive using INTERNET recovery (and then how to restore the OS).

WARNING WARNING WARNING

Doing this will WIPE OUT anything that is on the internal drive !!!



PRINT OUT THIS MSG and keep it beside you as you progress.



1. Power down all the way off.



2. Press the power on button and IMMEDIATELY hold down:

Command-OPTION-R



You will need your wifi password.

The internet utilities take a while to load -- BE PATIENT.



3. When you get to the utilities menu open disk utility.



4. VERY IMPORTANT: Go to the disk utility ""view"" menu and choose ""show all devices"".

(If there is no ""view"" menu just proceed to step 5 ... but if there is you MUST choose ""show all devices"")



5. Look at ""the list on the left"". The TOPMOST item should be the physical drive inside the MPB.



6. Click on the physical drive and then click ""erase"".



7. If you are going to install High Sierra or earlier erase to ""Mac OS extended with journaling enabled GUID partition format"".

If you are going to install Mojave or later erase to ""APFS GUID partition format"".



8. When the erase is done quit disk utility. The drive is now completely ""empty"".



9. Open the OS installer and start ""clicking through"". The Mac will restart one or more times and the screen may go black for a minute or two with no indications otherwise. Just be patient.



10. If the install is successful you should see the initial setup screen (choose your language).



At this point you need to decide what to do next.

If all you want to do is present it to the new owner just QUIT the installer RIGHT NOW. Or press and hold the power-on button until the MBP shuts off.



That way the new owner will open it boot it and it will offer a setup -- just as if it were ""new"".



OR...

You can continue through setup and when setup assistant asks if you wish to restore your data connect the tm backup and let setup assistant use that."

You’re looking for holiday cheer in New York City and you’ve only got a long weekend to spare. No problem. The Big Apple becomes a winter wonderland of shopping villages light displays and Christmas trees during the holidays. Here’s how to experience the best of the city’s festive spirit in less than 72 hours:

Rockefeller Center Saks Fifth Avenue

No trip to Manhattan during the holidays would be complete without a stop at Rockefeller Center where majestic Christmas trees have captivated the world for more than 80 years. Take the experience up a notch by lacing up a pair of skates and taking a spin around the world’s most famous ice rink.

Afterward check out the light show at Saks Fifth Avenue and walk along this famous shopping street a place so magical even native New Yorkers can’t resist its charm. Even now New Yorker-turned-Parisian Richard Nahem says during holiday visits he’s “awestruck in a new way of how magical the lights decorations and the trees are.”

From here head to Radio City Music Hall for the legendary Christmas Spectacular starring the Rockettes.

New York Stock Exchange Herald Square Bryant Park

Rockefeller Center may be home to New York’s most famous Christmas tree but it’s far from the only one you’ll want to visit in the city.

Start your day at the New York Stock Exchange where you’ll find the city’s most underrated Christmas tree — and the Fearless Girl who took on Wall Street’s bull and won over the world.

From Wall Street hop on the subway and head uptown to Herald Square the bustling heart of midtown Manhattan. This is where you’ll find the iconic Empire State Building and Macy’s flagship department store sure to be familiar if you’ve ever seen Miracle on 34th Street or the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

This Macy’s is the largest department store in the United States and among the largest in the world. It consistently creates memorable holiday windows. In 2020 the window displays were dedicated to showing gratitude to COVID-19 front-line workers. The store offers nine floors of retail making it easy to find gifts for even the most difficult-to-please people on your shopping list.

To really understand just how big this Macy’s is head to the top of the Empire State Building for a bird’s-eye view from the 86th floor. Nowadays you won’t even have to shiver like Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks did in Sleepless in Seattle. The building recently added external heaters making its observation deck a much more comfortable winter experience says Jean-Yves Ghazi president of the Empire State Realty Trust Observatory.

From the Empire State Building make your way to Bryant Park where you’ll find another gorgeous Christmas tree and another spectacular ice rink this time with the New York Public Library as the backdrop. You’ll also find a pop-up shopping village full of creative gift ideas and travel souvenirs.

The Plaza Hotel Grand Central Station

If there’s anyone left on your list you’re sure to find just the right gift at the holiday market in Columbus Circle at the southwestern edge of Central Park.

Once you’ve checked your list twice walk east along the southern edge of the park and cross the street toward The Plaza Hotel.

Before you head inside take a moment to check out the 36-foot 4000-pound menorah that’s made its home outside The Plaza every Hanukkah since 1977.

Manhattan is full of famous luxury hotels but none is as well known as The Plaza a 100-year-old landmark where holiday spirit was put on full display in Home Alone 2. Even if a room here isn’t in your budget consider stopping in for afternoon tea at The Palm Court restaurant or for an unforgettable visit with Santa Claus.

Afterward head to Grand Central Station for the Holiday Train Show to watch vintage Lionel trains from the New York Transit Museum’s collection make their way around a 34-foot-long model of New York City blanketed in glistening snow. Even in miniature New York City is magical during the holidays.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcHBpLmNvbS9jb250ZW50cy92aWV3X2JyZWFraW5nLW5ld3MvMjAyMS0xMS0yMC9jb3R5cy1iZWF1dHktY29tZWJhY2stY29udGludWVzLXNheXMtY2VvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coty's Beauty Comeback Continues Says CEO,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.happi.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Man United decided to float on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012 in order to try and tackle mounting debt.

Speaking after David Moyes' 2014 Old Trafford sacking financial expert James Igoe told the MEN that United have to 'inform the NYSE about material changes to the business'.

The club are not understood to have been in breach of any rules.

But with the New York Stock Exchange not re-opening until 9:30am local time on Monday 2:30pm UK time many observers thought United might wait before sacking Solskjaer so that they can first inform the NYSE of their decision.

However with a vital Champions League game with Villarreal on Tuesday they decided to act before telling the stock market.

And sacked Solskjaer on Sunday morning just hours after the humiliating 4-1 defeat at Watford.

Seismic changes like a managerial switch can cause wild fluctuations in a club's share price - as was seen when Jose Mourinho was sacked in 2018.

The Portuguese was axed on a Tuesday morning at 4:45am local time in New York.

The day before his axing one share in the club was worth 17.34 USD but by the time they opened for business following Mourinho's sacking this price had risen to 17.78 USD.

Similarly when Moyes was sacked the price soared from 17.72 USD to 18.60 USD.

Man United's board met at 7pm last night to discuss sacking Solskjaer following the abysmal 4-1 defeat to Watford.

Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick are reportedly ready to take interim charge as club chiefs try and convince Zinedine Zidane to move to Old Trafford.

A glum-looking Solskjaer drove home last night having said his goodbyes to Man United stars.

“We are proud to partner with United Way to address period poverty among girls and women in the communities where we live and work” Cameron said. “This is especially important because more than 62 percent of households in our area are forced with the difficult decision of choosing between necessities like feminine hygiene supplies and food or medication.”

We wanted to express our gratitude for Jami’s commitment to the community and ask about her involvement during the fighting for accessible feminine hygiene products.

How did you hear about this program?

I’ve been blessed to hold public relations positions throughout my career that allowed me the opportunity to work alongside community organizations to help drive positive change. That’s when I first became involved with United Way of West Central Mississippi.

How long have you been volunteering?

About two decades.

What are your activities and what do they involve?

I volunteer when any and every opportunity presents itself. While this has been more difficult the past year and half due to COVID-19 restrictions we’re slowly getting back to normal. This year I was honored to serve as the 2021 Campaign Chair. I have met so many wonderful volunteers while in this role. It makes me deeply appreciate everything our United Way campaign coordinators and volunteers do to ensure we raise enough funds to make a positive impact in education financial stability health and support services.

What is your favorite memory while volunteering?

Completing community service projects with my International Paper team members during a Day of Caring; partnering with United Way to put together close to 400 feminine hygiene kits that were donated to 601 for Period Equity to help stop period poverty.

What have you learned from volunteering with this organization?

I have learned that together anything is possible. I have also learned that there are so many wonderful people in our community that truly value serving others. It’s a joy to see and be a part of such a loving community!

These papers bridge theory and practice and will delve into discussions on the challenges and opportunities linked to the definition of beneficial ownership for companies explore the gaps and loopholes of beneficial ownership registration for trusts vis-à-vis the requirements established for legal persons and present an empirical analysis showcasing the utility of linking information on the firm ownership structures of European companies with real estate data to identify financial crime risks in the region.

These topics will be the subject of written contributions that will be submitted to the European Commission as part of the CSABOT project to inform policymaking on beneficial ownership transparency matters at the EU level.

The second NEBOT meeting continued on 14 September with NEBOT authors presenting three policy papers and discussing the findings and recommendations with experts.

The first contribution highlighted existing strategies to ensure the quality of the information on beneficial ownership registers in the EU and stirred a substantial debate on good practices on data accuracy and verification. The second paper showcased the potential of connecting beneficial ownership data with other existing relevant datasets such as real estate and public procurement data to detect potential cases of illicit wealth corruption and other crimes. The last paper focused on the challenges faced by different stakeholders in effectively using beneficial ownership information contained in registers. To that end the paper assesses the extent to which the public obliged entities and competent authorities can access use and trust the information in BO registers.

The next NEBOT meeting will be held in-person in Brussels on 29 November before a high-level conference ""Curbing financial crimes in Europe with beneficial ownership transparency” taking place on 30 November.

The news came out of nowhere and reportedly will go into effect on December 25th of this year. The Athletic's Shams Charania reported that the name change is believed to be the largest U.S venue naming rights deal to date.

Thoughts on the change have varied from person to person but Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban seemed to like the new name. When asked about it ahead if the Clippers vs. Mavericks game on Sunday Cuban said ""I thought it was a brilliant deal.""

Cuban elaborated on his initial thoughts stating that these crypto companies are killing it right now. His only concern was focused on the fact that these companies are often based outside of the United States due to certain regulations that exist within the U.S. Cuban would like to seek ways to get these companies back into the United States.

LA Clippers star Paul George shared some in-depth thoughts about the name change on the night it was announced stating that ""It'll be weird. I grew up with Staples Center being the place to play and the place to be. It will definitely be weird. It's the same location but it's kind of stripping history here by calling it something else... Good thing we won't be here too long we'll be at our own place."" George was referencing the Inglewood Intuit Dome that is set to debut as the LA Clippers' new home in 2024.

Yet for at least the past 16 years it appears mountain lions from the western United States have made this cross-country trek to end up in Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

While these visits perhaps happened before 2008 — the first year the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources confirmed a cougar in the state in nearly a century a cat that sadly ended up killed by law enforcement after somehow ending up in suburban Chicago — the prevalence of trail cameras has raised the frequency of documenting cougar sightings in Wisconsin and the U.P.

Already in 2021 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has received 10 verified reports of cougars in the Upper Peninsula three of them in Dickinson County including the most recent photo Sept. 16 in the southern part of the county.

If this trend continues the Upper Peninsula appears poised to have a modern record for cougar sightings in 2021 topping 15 in 2020.

But does that mean more of these impressive large cats are here? Wildlife biologists say no.

It’s a matter of cougar gender and behavior.

Most of the reports this year — perhaps nine of the 10 — could be the same cougar given the amount of time and distance between records said Cody Norton the large carnivore expert for the Michigan DNR.

Only a track found May 12 by a DNR staffer in Luce County followed by a trail camera image of a cougar the next day in eastern Dickinson County provides evidence more than one mountain lion may be roaming the U.P. Norton said.

“In one day for a cat to travel 125 miles is pretty improbable” Norton explained.

Mountain lions are thought to have the broadest range of any large animal in the Americas with individuals turning up from the northern Yukon Territory in Canada to the southern Andes in South America.

It is the largest of the wild felines native to North America with the exception of the few jaguars that can turn up in the Mexican border areas of the southwest.

Despite its size the cougar is a closer relative to the domestic housecat than panthera species such as lions and tigers.

That the Upper Peninsula has attracted wandering mountain lions makes sense — it is sparsely populated has good habitat for the cats and decent prey Norton said.

The U.P. and Wisconsin once had a native population of cougars earning a prominent mention in Laura Ingalls Wilder’s “Little House in the Big Woods” set in northwestern Wisconsin in the 1870s.

But according to the Wisconsin DNR the state’s last native mountain lion was killed in 1908. One last was taken legally in the Upper Peninsula in 1906.

Despite local reports that a breeding population lingered in the Upper Peninsula no female cougars or cubs have been documented since the DNR began recording modern cougar sightings in the U.P.

This fits a pattern for the species in that young males “disperse” after separating from their mother at about 15 months driven to set out from where they were born to avoid clashing with their father or other mature males or mating with their mother or sisters.

White-tailed deer do much the same thing with young bucks venturing from their home range in search of new territory. But with deer dispersing might mean going to a neighboring county. With cougars it’s more complicated.

The closest significant cougar population to Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula is several states away in the Black Hills of western South Dakota.

The cougar population in South Dakota for now hovers at about 300 but can fluctuate to as high as 500 or as low as the 260s said Steve Griffin a big game wildlife biologist with the South Dakota Department of Game Fish and Parks.

The state does allow them to be hunted with the aim of maintaining its mountain lion numbers at roughly 200 to 300 Griffin said. In 2020 about 58 cougars were taken in the Black Hills along with 10 from the prairie areas where the cats are more sparse.

The Black Hills cougars are thought to have spread from Wyoming reestablished in South Dakota in only the past few decades Griffin said. In turn it likely has led to a small breeding population in northwestern Nebraska.

Young male cougars seem “programmed” to leave their natal area Griffin said. From South Dakota it might roam to Wyoming Montana Canada Nebraska even Missouri and Oklahoma.

Obviously some have headed east and ended up in Minnesota Wisconsin the Upper Peninsula — one even was struck and killed by a car in Connecticut in June 2011 1500 miles from the Black Hills nearly double the previous known distance traveled by a mountain lion.

But of the females that biologists collared and tracked from South Dakota all eventually returned to within roughly 50 miles of where they had been born Griffin said.

So it seems unlikely a female cougar would cross Minnesota — which for now has not documented mountain lions reproducing in the state — to become established in Wisconsin and the U.P.

Considering the distance Griffin said “the chances of that happening are slim to none … but never say never.”

So for the dispersing male cougars headed east arriving in the U.P. can result in a long and futile search for a female. A young male looking to establish a home territory might find the Upper Peninsula inviting but ultimately lonely.

The region becomes a dead end for these roaming young male cougars Norton said. Crossing either U.P. bridge to continue east or north would be daunting for a wild animal and the only other potential opportunity would be when the lakes are iced in.

“I think the U.P. is kind of a funnel” Norton said. “It’s easy to get into not easy to get through.”

So what happens to these roaming bachelor cougars once they reach that barrier to pressing on east? It’s unclear but they don’t seem to be setting up permanently in the Upper Peninsula. Norton noted none of the sites where a trail camera recorded the cat has ever captured a second image.

Since the cougars lack strong identifying marks for telling individuals apart it can’t be determined whether any of these cats even remain in the region through multiple years Norton said.

But they appear to keep moving perhaps eventually heading back west. Several young males radio-collared in South Dakota that dispersed east came back though none were known to have traveled as far as the Upper Peninsula Griffin said.

So for now cougars in the Upper Peninsula are short-term residents until a female makes that 900-plus-mile journey to give the males a reason to stay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL21qczA1Mzc2M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Darlene E.

Diana Ross died peacefully in his sleep Nov. 18 at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills after a brief battle with lung and bone cancer. He was 79.

Born in Philadelphia in 1942 Jacobs grew up an avid fan of film TV and music. Still a teenager he started his career in 1961 when he landed a job at the mail room of the William Morris Agency in New York. He worked at the agency for three decades and was a founding member of the agency’s music department. He worked with artists across all genres from rock and country to jazz and R&B including The Beach Boys The Monkeys The Supremes Simon & Garfunkel Diana Ross Ashford & Simpson George Benson Teddy Pendergrass Al Jarreau as well as Crosby Stills and Nash.

In a recent MPTF profile Jacobs recalled one of his first bookings The Rolling Stones at Auburn University where they got an unheard-of for the time $25000.

“It was really thrilling because when I was 21 or 22” he said in the interview. “I represented The Beach Boys back in the day getting $7500 a night. I created the very first percentage date with them where they got about 70% of the gross at the door and they walked out with $28000. That was an amazing steppingstone to getting percentages for the groups instead of flat fees.”

After almost 30 years at WMA Jacobs left in 1991 for a 3.5-year stint at ICM before retiring from the agency business.

Jacobs spent the final years of his life as coordinator of the William Morris Agency Alumni a collaborative group of over 500 (mostly retired) William Morris agents and management.

In May 2021 Jacobs broke his foot. CT and other tests for the injury revealed a Stage IV lung and bone cancer. With his beloved golden retriever Kona he moved into the MPTF Hersholt Place at the Motion Picture Home where he spent his final months. Jacobs is survived by his son Joey and daughter Melissa.

Jacobs who had received assistance from the Motion Picture & Television Fund for the past decade. always praised the staff and community at the fund for literally adding years to his life his son said.

“Today we mourn the loss of Jay Jacobs whose lengthy career as a talent agent was part of a rich and colorful life” the Motion Picture and Television Fund (MPTF) wrote on Twitter on Friday.

“We were recently honored to talk to Jay here at MPTF and share his journey and may he rest in peace” said MPTF’s tweet which linked to a profile about Jacobs who over the years received assistance from the organization. Billboard has reached out to MPTF for further comment.

Jacobs resided at Hersholt Place at the Motion Picture Home after being diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer in early 2021.

“He’s charming and generous with a distinct self-deprecating sense of humor and stories to tell that could last for days” said the article about Jacobs on MPTF’s website.

Jacobs who was born in Philadelphia began his career in the mail room of the William Morris Agency in New York in 1961. He went on to become an agent and a founding member of the William Morris music department where he booked acts “from country to jazz to R&B” says the MPTF profile. He worked with the Beach Boys Simon & Garfunkel and Diana Ross to name a few.

He recalled “It was really thrilling because when I was 21 or 22 I represented the Beach Boys back in the day getting $7500 a night.

Jacobs who also worked at ICM for a few years before retirement is survived by two children.

Premiering in August the darkly comic tale follows four teenagers growing up on a reservation in Oklahoma as they scheme their way — through minor crime sprees including hijacking a snack delivery truck and stealing copper — off the rez to sunny California in honor of their late friend Daniel who aspired to head west to start anew. Leading the pack is Elora Danan played with a quiet intensity by Devery Jacobs who tells THR that she “needed to be a part of the show” when she first heard of the project created by Oscar winner Taika Waititi and showrunner Sterlin Harjo.

Told from a uniquely Native perspective the series skewers cliches throughout its eight-episode first season — many of which originate from the ways in which white people have depicted Indigenous people in pop culture for a century. Jacobs and co-star Dallas Goldtooth who plays a mischievous apparition named Spirit spoke to THR about the underrecognized power of Indigenous storytelling why humor can be such an effective healing mechanism and their excitement about joining the writers room for season two.

Sterlin Harjo has said he immediately bonded with Taika Waititi over their similar experiences despite being from very different parts of the world. Devery you’re from Canada playing a character who lives on a reservation in Oklahoma. Is there a shorthand among Indigenous communities across the globe because of what you have in common?

DEVERY JACOBS One of the reasons [Watiti’s 2010 film] Boy is one of my favorite movies of all time is because [the characters] are all like family back home — except they all have Kiwi accents. There’s absolutely a commonality between us which is something that ends up making Reservation Dogs so universal for Indigenous people across the globe. That said we’re also comprised of many different languages and cultures and nations and territories. I grew up in Kahnawà:ke Mohawk Territory which happened to be on the north side of this colonial border that split my nation in two. I also don’t necessarily consider myself to be Canadian or American — I consider myself to be Haudenosaunee. My nation is from both sides of this border.

The show also recontextualizes American pop culture in really interesting ways through a Native perspective.

DALLAS GOLDTOOTH We’re able to speak to a broader audience but there’s a dual conversation happening here as we speak to folks within our own diaspora: “We see you you’re a part of this we’re building something together.” I love that the show is a conversation about culture — how communities who are on the margins of society take in culture ingest it and make it a part of who they are. The name itself Reservation Dogs is obviously an homage to Reservoir Dogs. We didn’t grow up seeing Native content on TV. We saw pop culture on TV. And so we’re going to change that and make it our own.

JACOBS One of my favorite parts about being a part of the show is that it’s by Indigenous people for our communities and everybody else also gets to be let in on the joke. That’s what ends up making it so specific and so funny. We’re not spoon-feeding white audiences we’re not showing who we are in proximity to white people. [Many films] have shown us in Westerns or have shown us as people who only exist in contrast with white folks.

GOLDTOOTH We know how the outside world sees Native Americans. We are fully aware of that. And we’re going to take every opportunity to flip that on its head. There is an explicit aspiration to be a counter-narrative but not to over-explain as Devery said — not to explain it all but to present something to make people think.

JACOBS One of the things with your character Spirit is that it’s holding a mirror up to Western audiences and challenging their ideas of what they think an Indian or Native American person looks like. There’s this ancient image of colonial contact with Native men and then it’s flipping it on its head by Spirit being kind of … I don’t know how would you want to describe him? He’s pretty goofy.

GOLDTOOTH He’s definitely very much a goofball. We’re dealing with dualities across the board here and also holding up a mirror to ourselves. We don’t have to keep jumping into the same mold of storytelling that has been dictated by white people. We can tell our own stories on our own terms take control of these cliches and do with them as we wish.

Devery your character also has some heavy moments — particularly when we learn she was the person to find Daniel after he died.

JACOBS One of the elements that rings most true to me throughout the series is the use of humor. [Before] shows like Reservation Dogs or [Peacock’s] Rutherford Falls there were so few glimpses into Indigenous comedy and our biting gallows-type humor the way we’re able to weave together heartbreaking and heartwarming moments. Growing up my mom would always say “If you don’t laugh you’re going to cry.” And I think that’s so true to marginalized communities as a whole. I’m queer as well as Mohawk and I think that’s also true of the queer community.

There’s serious shit that these kids are going through and there’s real impact in context. Daniel’s story isn’t only a plot point on television it’s the story from many of our families and communities. The issue of suicide affects Indigenous people at the highest rates [compared with] any other groups. It’s a fact of life for us. But it isn’t something that we’re sitting around feeling sorry for ourselves about. We’re incredibly resilient people. And one of the ways in which we are so resilient is through our humor.

Dallas is that how you approach your comedy?

GOLDTOOTH I’m rife with insecurities and comedy is a way for me to process that and really understand myself better. That is a form of healing. Maybe mainstream society overlooks the power of comedy as a healing mechanism but for marginalized communities comedy is a tremendous way to let go of trauma and move forward. We’re processing pain we’re processing trauma of the past — we’re not hanging on to it. I think we wouldn’t be here as Native peoples if it weren’t for our ability to make light of a situation.

You’re both now writers on season two. I’m curious if you feel any pressure about speaking for a global Indigenous population and if that’s a conversation you’ve had in the writers room.

GOLDTOOTH Sterlin always emphasizes that we’re not going to get stuck into explaining identities. We’ll just say it as it is and let folks interpret it. There’s a lot of power behind that. We’re not dumbing it down for the audience — we’re encouraging the audience to be very critical and engage their mind on these things. This is a historical first in many ways and so obviously there’s going to be a lot of pressure to hit all the notes. Each of us in that room brought a different aspect of Indian Country into that space whether it’s urban whether it’s Canadian whether it’s First Nations whether it’s on the rez. You see a broad perspective even though it’s specifically in this one community.

Are you excited to write for your own characters or is it more fun to think of things for your co-stars?

JACOBS Writing for the other characters is probably easier than writing for my own because I feel so close to Elora Danan. I am incredibly grateful to Sterlin for embracing all of the writers of varying levels of experience and all being Indigenous from different communities. The whole reason that Reservation Dogs exists is because Taika Waititi opened the door to his peers and said “Hey let’s create a project together.” It wasn’t because there was a huge demand in the industry to pluck an Indigenous creative and uplift them so that they create their projects. It was from Indigenous peers helping each other out. Like Dallas said hopefully this is the first of many — a whole industry of Indigenous creatives.

(Mikey Williams/Top Rank)

The announcer at RAC Arena was not having a good day on Sunday.

The scene was reminiscent of when Steve Harvey crowned the wrong Miss Universe in 2015 or of the “Moonlight” debacle at the Oscars in 2017. It was rough.

Cherneka Johnson beat reigning WBA bantamweight champion Nina Hughes on Sunday in Perth Australia via a majority decision. But when ring announcer Dan Hennessey a former United States Marine stepped up to announce her as the winner he completely butchered the delivery. That made for a very confusing scene in the ring.

Hennessey misread the scorecards when making his announcement and he accidentally declared Hughes the winner. Suddenly it was her arm in the air and the 41-year-old started celebrating.

Pretty quickly though he corrected his mistake as if nothing had happened. He read the scores again apparently correct the second time and Johnson's arm was lifted in the air. That left Hughes and the announcers on the broadcast incredibly confused.

Just watch the scene unfold:

ESPN’s Joe Tessitore erupted on the “absolute clown show garbage amateur hour” announcing from Hennessey too while trying to explain to viewers in the U.S. what had actually happened.

The error wasn’t Hennesseey’s only one of the night either. He messed up the scorecards for the Pedro Guevara-Andrew Moloney fight earlier in the night too. The problem for him is apparently nothing new.

Even though she was briefly robbed of the celebration and just about everyone involved was confused Johnson got her win. In theory that's all that really matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L3RoZS1pbmZlcm5hbC1tYWNoaW5lLXN0ZXBoZW4tam9obnNvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Book Review: ‘The Infernal Machine’ by Steven Johnson,"THE INFERNAL MACHINE: A True Story of Dynamite Terror and the Rise of the Modern Detective by Steven Johnson

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3QtZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvai1hbGFuLWplcnJ5LWpvaG5zb24tb2JpdHVhcnktcGl0dHNidXJnaC9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjQwNTEyMDA5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: J.

Luzardo struggled to a 6.58 ERA over his first five starts and 26 innings before a mild left flexor strain (initially diagnosed as elbow tightness) sent him to the IL so the three-week layoff between starts can hopefully set as a refresh of a tough season to date for the 26-year-old. The returns of Luzardo and Braxton Garrett this weekend will help the injury-riddled Marlins rotation though Edward Cabrera has now also gone down with a shoulder impingement.

Beyond the immediate help that Luzardo will bring to Miami’s pitching staff today’s start figures to reignite the trade rumors that have swirled around the left-hander for months. If Luzardo recaptures his 2021-22 form he would be a very hot commodity at the trade deadline as he is arbitration-controlled through the 2026 season. The Luis Arraez trade has already signaled that the Marlins are in sell mode but while the team pulled the trigger early on that deal Luzardo’s suitors will want to see a larger sample size of healthy and productive starts before moving what would have to be a very substantial trade package to pry him away from Miami.

The Ohio-based company has filed a petition for partial administrative reconsideration asking the agency to rescind the ban on non-refillable cylinders which was included as part of the EPA’s final rule to implement the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act. The AIM Act signed into law in late 2020 was bipartisan legislation aimed solely at phasing down the production and consumption of specific hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

The US final rule effectively prohibits the sale of disposable cylinder after December 31 2024.

Non-refillable disposable cylinders have been banned in a number of countries including the EU Canada and Australia due to the “heel” of refrigerant that is inevitably left behind when disposed of. Cheap and untraceable they are also seen as the container of choice for the refrigerant smuggler.

Worthington maintains that the EPA did not address its concerns regarding the ban’s infeasibility and direct harm to HVAC technicians who often work in elevated cramped spaces and because of the ban will be forced to carry cylinders that are four times heavier likely increasing injuries.

The company’s petition includes an updated fully recyclable lightweight cylinder that adds environmental safety technology to address venting issues and will deter smuggling of banned substances through reliance on domestic production capacity.

Worthington is the only US manufacturer of non-refillable steel cylinders which are produced at its facilities in Columbus Ohio and Paducah Kentucky.

“Worthington supports the AIM Act and its mission to phase down HFCs but banning non-refillable cylinders as part of the phase down is an unnecessary restriction that puts American jobs at risk reduces US manufacturing competitiveness and does virtually nothing to protect the environment” said Worthington Industries president and CEO Andy Rose.

5 IoT Cloud Case Studies

1. Coca-Cola Içecek

One of the key bottlers in the Coca-Cola ecosystem Coca-Cola Içecek (CCI) services more than 400 million consumers in 10 countries across central Asia and the Middle East. CCI sought to improve the efficiency of their 26 bottling plants starting with input from their clean-in-place (CIP) equipment to model a digital twin bottling plant.

“Our CIP is an everyday production process and crucial for industry hygiene and quality requirements” says Burcu Hacioglu digital twin product owner at CCI. “We wanted to improve process efficiency by avoiding errors in time measurement which could lead to CCI plants overusing energy and water.”

CCI fed their industrial IoT information to the AWS cloud where it was used to create data models that could be manipulated to improve efficiency in the system. Early success with the CIP process motivated CCI to expand the model to include filler-mixer machines.

Industry: Beverage

IoT cloud provider: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Outcomes:

Over 30 improvement opportunities identified

20% savings in electricity and 9% savings in water

34 days of processing time saved per year

2. Deep Sky Vineyard

Family-owned Deep Sky Vineyard operates in Arizona and Argentina to grow grapes for wine. In one of their vineyards an unmonitored irrigation valve broke and flooded an entire zone which motivated Deep Sky to improve information over the entire crop management process using cloud-connected instrumentation.

“This year I already know several ways we’ll improve our grapes“ says Phil Asmundson owner of Deep Sky Vineyard. “Without this digital solution … we wouldn’t have the invaluable insights needed to make these decisions.”

Internet of Things Q&A

IoT as a Career

Datamation: How did you first get started in or develop an interest in the Internet of Things?

Boles: I joined Intel almost 30 years ago at our Chandler Arizona location in the Embedded Products Division as an application engineer for 16-bit microcontrollers. During my tenure at Intel I’ve had the opportunity to help our customers design Intel’s products into their solution; drive product management including ecosystems for our solutions addressing a range of market segments such as communications automotive and retail; serve as technical assistant and chief of staff to one of our global Fabrication Manufacturing executives; and am currently leading Intel’s Industrial Solutions Division.

While the term Internet of Things has emerged in the last several years my career has been building to this from embedded systems to now intelligent and connected systems across a range of industries. Thus my interest and experience have continued to grow and expand with the evolution of the industry and the new possibilities each day.

Datamation: What makes Intel a unique place to work?

Boles: Everything. Intel is a company and brand founded on innovation and technological growth. We pride ourselves in having some of the best and brightest in the world and our leading-edge technology is transforming the world we live in. In addition we are fortunate to have an outstanding technology innovator CEO Pat Gelsinger who is relentlessly reinvigorating our investment in manufacturing and semiconductor product leadership. Plus Intel’s commitment to diversity and inclusion is industry-leading and makes this an incredible place to work.

Developing a Strong IoT Strategy

Datamation: What sets Intel’s IoT solutions or approach apart from the competition?

Boles: At Intel we are investing in cutting-edge technology that is driving innovation and industry transformation as well as solving specific customer business challenges. We are actively listening to our customers particularly industry-specific customers such as manufacturers retailers health care providers and more to better understand their pain points and their biggest obstacles to growth or meeting their customer needs.

We focus our efforts and drive innovation to solve these challenges — expanding our areas of innovation and utilizing the breadth of Intel’s edge networking and cloud products and technologies to address our customers and the industry’s needs.

Within our Internet of Things Group and specifically the Industrial Solutions Division that I lead we are enabling a more intelligent edge supporting enterprises that are moving to the edge so they can capture more data analyze it faster and act on it sooner. For example we are taking analytics to the edge and helping manufacturers automate and enhance critical quality-control processes in their factories.

By creating a data-driven platform solution they are able to reduce human error and ensure products are built with even more accuracy and precision.

Datamation: What do you think makes an IoT platform or product successful?

Boles: The key in deployments such as in factories where my team focuses is a clear return on investment operational acceptance and scalability of the solution. As first deployments happen the solution must provide easy implementation and a clear understanding of the benefits being provided.

As the benefits are seen the management will look to scale it thus the need for proven solutions that scale such as Intel’s ecosystem of market-ready solutions. With that said even if the ROI is there and the solution is scalable we find it is critical that the solution works within the operations workflow for its acceptance.

Datamation: How can the average company affordably integrate IoT automation and other efficiencies into their business?

Boles: Often IoT automation solutions are deployed where much effort has already been placed for a particular problem area and further ROI can only be achieved through automation. For example there is a limit to the accuracy that a human can provide for an inspection process as well as ergonomic concerns. These types of situations are ripe for automation to improve accuracy product quality and worker safety.

We have seen this in multiple manufacturing industries for defect detection including textile die-cast components and automotive. One specific defect detection that we are helping industry solution providers solve for manufacturers is weld defect detection where they can use machine vision to detect and adjust the robotic welder in real-time.

Datamation: How can companies provide security for industrial IoT infrastructure?

Boles: Providing security for any infrastructure requires consideration and implementation of multiple layers such as hardware root of trust provisioning of devices access control data security in the system and data security in transit to name a few. Intel works with industry standards and with our ecosystem of partners to bring best-known practices into solutions utilizing Intel platforms. As an example we worked with the FIDO Alliance and several other companies to define and release an open standard for secure device onboarding.

Datamation: What are the top networking and infrastructure challenges that companies face when trying to build their IoT strategy?

Boles: This past year-plus we had a dramatic shift to limited on-site access and needed remote access to operational information or system experts. While “remote operations” has been a discussion and goal in the industrial sector for some time there was not an urgency to solve for it because it required possible fundamental changes in the operations of industrial environments.

As an example from our engagement and studies with global manufacturing companies they have recognized investment in their networking and infrastructure is critical to bring more IT capabilities to their operations platforms. This is one area that we focus on in order to help our ecosystem of solution providers bring a more open platform approach utilizing the range of assets from Intel edge to cloud to the operations technology area. This will allow them to address the industry needs of remote access and managed operations platforms.

Trends in Industrial IoT

Datamation: What do you think are some of the top trends in industrial IoT right now? What platforms and/or devices do you find to be the most compelling?

Boles: Industrial organizations are on an accelerated path to realizing the factory of the future driven in part by their desire to be more agile and resilient; they are seeking ways to leverage data more effectively. Catalyzed by both new and historic challenges the demand for transformative data-driven technology applications like artificial intelligence (AI) IoT and automation is higher than it has ever been. Organizations now recognize just how critical it is to be able to foresee disruptions on the horizon and respond promptly and decisively.

From a severely interrupted supply chain and unprecedented labor shortages to rapidly changing customer demands and the ability to extract actionable insights from data using AI and machine learning (ML) applications we at Intel see these developments not just as pain points but also as areas of transformational need.

Another global trend that is very important is the convergence of information technology operation technology (OT) and communications technology especially because it enables the vision of software-defined industrial systems for self-organizing flexible production flow self-aware production systems and collaborative machines with the enabled connected worker.

The prevailing vision of the “factory of the future” is a combination of standardized connectivity deterministic control advanced compute and AI.​ A platform that supports an infrastructure converging OT IT and CT will not only result in a lower total cost of ownership but also makes an ideal choice for future services innovation.

Datamation: What do you think we’ll see more of in the IoT space in the next 5-10 years?

Boles: Over the last couple of years we have seen some dramatic changes in our manufacturing customers’ technology investment strategies and we are expecting this trend to continue. With labor shortages throughout virtually every industry our customers are accelerating their investment focus on networking and connectivity upgrades cloud capabilities and industrial automation.

These technology investments are addressing our customers’ challenges and hence are focused on increasing resilience and productivity worker safety and remote work. Intel continues to lead the industrial transformation and continues to be the springboard for transformative solutions that improve business outcomes. For example we will continue to see Intel’s Intelligent Edge platforms across all industrial market segments to enable compute augmentation and connectivity in unprecedented ways.

Intel’s foundational edge inference and machine vision development environment and reference designs applicable across multiple industries will continue to enable our manufacturing solution providers to automate quality assurance processes using machine vision to detect flaws that are not visible to the human eye in real-time — while also enabling fully autonomous retail stores through computer vision autonomous mobile robots that help warehouse operators manage the explosive growth in e-commerce orders meet consumer expectations for rapid delivery and medical diagnostic imaging powered by AI.

Datamation: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected you your colleagues and/or your clients’ approach to IoT solutions?

Boles: The pandemic has greatly accelerated the need for companies to complete their Industry 4.0 transformations with solutions that allow them to have more flexibility visibility and efficiency in their operations. We have seen accelerated adoption of AI solutions that help address that need including machine learning machine vision and advanced analytics. We’ve also seen a significant uptick in investment in the foundational OT infrastructure with more IT capabilities to allow the broad ecosystem of players to deploy these solutions.

An Expert Perspective on the Market

Datamation: How have you seen the IoT solutions market change since you first started? How have the technologies services conversations and people changed over time?

Boles: When the industry started to talk about the Internet of Things much of the conversation and focus was on connecting to the things and getting to the data. At the time many talked about all the information needing to go to the cloud for “big data” analysis. Of course there is a need for big data analysis and correlation between multiple data sets but there has recently been a recognition of the need for computing and intelligence at the edge.

There were also a lot of proof of concepts several years ago that showed the value and the return on investment but the solutions did not scale easily. The focus now from a technology perspective is on edge computing connectivity and AI. At Intel we focus on working with the breadth of our ecosystem to bring solutions that address the needs bring the benefits and can scale.

Datamation: How do you stay knowledgeable about trends in the market? What resources do you like?

Boles: I use a myriad of sources from news articles to journals. In addition we partner with key industry analysts to hear their insights on market trends and industry information. We also conduct our own studies to learn directly from industry-specific customers on their challenges and where they are investing. And I learn the most by engaging directly with manufacturers utilities and the breadth of our ecosystem partners.

Datamation: With the shortage of qualified talent in the tech world how is Intel finding and recruiting qualified candidates for your IoT teams?

Boles: Sourcing talent at Intel is a team effort; we have an incredible Intel recruiting team. Intel is also active with our education community to develop tech talent. As one example in 2020 Intel partnered with the Maricopa County Community College and the Arizona Commerce Authority to launch the first Intel-designed artificial intelligence associate degree program — aimed to enable tens of thousands of students to land careers in high-tech fields. In August of this year we announced a broad expansion of this program at 18 community colleges across 11 states.

Outside of Work

Datamation: What do you like to do in your free time outside of work?

Boles: I love spending time with my family and especially seeing my children participate in a range of activities. Personally I enjoy the outdoors and for the hot Arizona summers I often have a range of projects and books in flight.

Datamation: If you had to work in any other industry or role what would it be and why?

Boles: I realized early in my career that I love seeing technology applied to solve real problems. I also quickly learned how much I enjoy working with customers and ultimately driving business results. So while I can do that in a different industry right now I have an incredible role working with an incredible team and with partners across Intel and the industry. And we are applying technology to address real industry challenges which is helping transform an industry.

Datamation: What do you consider the best part of your workday or workweek?

Boles: Working with incredible talented people around the globe!

Datamation: What are you most proud of in your professional and/or personal life?

The Hamptons was constructed in 2015.

Redstone Capital Partners has acquired The Hamptons Statesboro a 668-bed cottage-style community serving students at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro. The Hamptons was constructed in 2015.

Marcus & Millichap represented the seller IMS Development and procured the buyer.

The community was fully leased before the start of the 2021-2022 university year Yardi Matrix data shows.

IMS Development received a 10-year $33.5 million loan for the property in October 2016. The financing originated by JPMorgan Chase came one year after the developers completed the community.

The Hamptons Statesboro encompasses 71 two- and three-story buildings across 24.4 acres. The 237-unit community offers a mix of one- to five-bedroom apartments with floorplans ranging from 664 to 2062 square feet. Amenities include a gym business center swimming pool volleyball court and approximately 350 parking spaces. ‘

Located at 350 Rucker Lane the asset is less than a mile from the Georgia Southern University campus and roughly 3 miles from central Statesboro. Charles H. Herty Pines Nature Preserve and W. Jones Lane Memorial Park are within walking distance of the community.

Despite the initial uncertainty generated by the pandemic the student housing market proved its resilience with 2021 preleasing numbers surpassing 2019 figures.

As of August the Georgia Southern University market registered one of the highest preleasing rates with 98 percent of student residences occupied according to a recent Yardi Matrix webinar.

Moreover the average trading price per bedroom reached $86500 in the market above the roughly $71000 average across major university centers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZWZlZWRzLmNvbS9qcC1tb3JnYW4taWYtcmlwcGxlLXdpbnMtc2VjLWxhd3N1aXQteHJwLWlzLXBvaXNlZC1mb3Itc2lnbmlmaWNhbnQtYWRvcHRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"JP Morgan: ""If Ripple wins SEC lawsuit XRP is poised for significant adoption""","JP Morgan: “If Ripple wins SEC lawsuit XRP is poised for significant adoption”

“If the company is able to win the SEC lawsuit and trading resumes on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase XRP is poised for significant adoption”.

JP Morgan’s North America Equity Research report published earlier this month puts XRP in the spotlight even stating the digital asset is poised for significant adoption.

While the price of XRP has fallen in recent days along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market Ripple Labs has been working non-stop in signing new partners for its RippleNet network and On-Demand Liquidity service thus spreading the use of XRP especially in the cross-border payments space.

XRP vs SWIFT

The JP Morgan report started out by stating “XRP was engineered to facilitate transactions on Ripple’s blockchain-based digital payment network. Benefits of the network include expedited payments and reduced transaction fees”.

The paper mentions its founding date 2012 and co-founders Jed McCaleb (who has left the company to launch Stellar) and Chris Larsen (who is a co-defendant in the XRP lawsuit filed by the SEC).

“While traditional money transfers – most commonly SWIFT transfers – are costly and can take up 5 business days to complete transactions using Ripple’s XRP can be completed in as little as 3 to 5 seconds and transaction fees are just 0.0001 XRP. SWIFT transfers are more expensive due to the numerous intermediary banks involved that charge fees to both the sender and recipient.”

The Ripple network includes more than 100 financial institutions including Bank of America Santander and American Express.

XRP vs stablecoins

Then the JP Morgan document explained XRP’s unique value in comparison to stablecoins using the words of Ripple’s senior director of global operations Emi Yoshikawa.

“The role of XRP as a bridge asset in international settlement is not competing with stablecoins but on the contrary it is complementary.”

XRP is not pegged to an underlying currency unlike stablecoins which follow their underlying currency’s volatility.

XRP vs SEC

The SEC v. Ripple lawsuit is an inevitable topic of discussion for XRP. On that matter JP Morgan points to the Howie test as the end goal and gives away the likelihood of a Ripple win.

The Howie test says that an investment contract exists when these four conditions are met: investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the effort of others.

“For the SEC to win the suit Judge Sarah Netburn […] must determine that all aforementioned four points are met; if she determines that one or multiple points are not met Ripple will win the suit”.

“If the company is able to win the SEC lawsuit and trading resumes on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase XRP is poised for significant adoption”.

Last year analysts valued the scheme at around $18bn-30bn eclipsing the company’s current market capitalisation of $12.9bn. Such programmes have proved a boon to American carriers in the pandemic. Firms including American Airlines have raised $30bn in debt backed by the schemes.

Airlines once hoped simply to foster loyalty by offering customers freebies. Passengers collected miles as they travelled and were awarded a free flight once they racked up enough of them. But schemes today are far more sophisticated. Airlines profit by selling miles to credit-card firms at a price that exceeds the cost of providing reward flights and dishing out other perks such as hotel stays. They also gain when miles expire unused or are cashed in for something of poor value. According to McKinsey a consultancy 15-30% of miles expired unused before the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTExLTIxL3NhdWRpLXN0b2NrLWV4Y2hhbmdlLXNlZWtzLXRvLXJhaXNlLWFzLW11Y2gtYXMtMS1iaWxsaW9uLWluLWlwb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saudi Stock Exchange Seeks to Raise Up to $1 Billion in IPO,"Why did this happen?

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India] November 20 (ANI/PRNewswire): According to The International Labor Organization four out of five employed women in India are engaged in informal economy as daily-wage labourers street vendors garment manufacturers and such.

On World Toilet Day Kimberly Clark Professional – with a mission to create healthier safer and more productive workplaces – fortifies its commitment to furthering hygiene and sanitation in such workplaces supporting Kimberly-Clark’s global goal of improving the lives of 1 billion people in underserved and vulnerable communities by 2030 with the smallest environmental footprint.

In collaboration with Samhita-CGF Garv Toilets and government authorities; the initiative will provide inclusive and sustainable sanitation to 3000 women daily in busy suburban localities of Mumbai.

Gaurav Dubey General Manager Kimberly-Clark Professional South – Asia said ”We are proud to be a part of the change makers and provide better sanitation conditions. My sense is that while there are still areas for improvement the progress that has been made and what has been achieved will shift the indicators on sanitation.”

The 28 state-of-the-art toilets installed as part of the initiative are made of stainless steel with automatic UV light sanitization automatic flushing and bio-digesters for Faecal Sludge Management (FSM). The toilets are installed around urban informal markets and are also used by women residing in nearby chawls that do not have adequate sanitation infrastructure. Kavita Phansalkar 37 is a daily wager who lives in a slum located near one of the toilets. “I had never seen a toilet which cleans itself. Due to auto-clean facility these toilets are always clean and odourless. It has made a huge difference to our life” she says.

The urban local body will support operations and maintenance of infrastructure thereby making the intervention sustainable.

In addition to the portable and innovative toilets Kimberly-Clark Professional’s flagship program also promotes toilet usage by influencing community behaviour towards sanitation thus providing holistic sanitation solutions to the women working in informal settlements.

Priya Naik Founder and CEO at Samhita Social Ventures said “The pandemic has exacerbated the need for hygiene and sanitation more than ever. We are proud to partner with Kimberly Clark Professional in their mission to enable safe dignified and sustainable toilets for women at informal workplaces who do not have access to this basic human right. This initiative will facilitate more women to join the workforce and contribute to our economy as well as ensure the comfort and productivity of those already engaged in jobs.”

Now with travel to Mars on the horizon the time has come for space ice cream to step aside and make room for the flavor of a new era of planetary travel: tomato ketchup the “Marz Edition.”

Heinz a company synonymous with ketchup successfully funded and collaborated with biologists at Florida Tech’s Aldrin Space Institute to grow tomatoes in Mars-like conditions on the Space Coast to show once and for all that even on faraway worlds humans can have the perfect condiment.

The experiment is the first of its kind. It actually produced a single bottle of ketchup that was unveiled Nov. 15 at Heinz HQ in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.

With the help of 14 graduate and undergraduate students Andrew Palmer associate professor of biological sciences at Florida Tech grew 450 tomato plants in regolith the loose unconsolidated rock and dust that cover planets like Mars.

Heinz was certainly proud of the accomplishment that took two years to complete.

“The team successfully yielded a crop of Heinz tomatoes from the brand’s proprietary tomato seeds with the exacting qualities that pass the rigorous quality and taste standards to become its iconic ketchup” the company said in a statement.

While Heinz has no plans to sell any of its Marz Edition ketchup just yet the project represents more than just space-age pop-culture marketing. There was serious science behind it with implications for life on Earth as well as on the red planet as scientists look to grow food in poor soils.

“Before now most efforts around discovering ways to grow in Martian-simulated conditions are short-term plant growth studies. What this project has done is look at long-term food harvesting” said Palmer in a news release from Heinz.

One of the biggest hurdles with producing food on Mars Palmer said is the difference between Earth and Martian soil. According to Palmer the key difference is that Martian soil isn’t really soil. Regolith “doesn’t have any organic matter so there’s nothing alive...so there’s not a lot of organic material there” Palmer said.

To mimic Martian regolith the team used 7800 pounds of soil from the Mojave Desert — a terracotta-colored grit that is similar to Martian regolith according to a statement released by the Florida Institute of Technology. Though the regolith is dry and fine the team found that it didn’t require more water to sustain the plants than it would have with normal soil.

The tomatoes grew in a greenhouse at Florida Tech’s Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Innovative Design in Palm Bay referred to as the “Red House.” Temperatures at the Red House fluctuated between 73 and 83 degrees Fahrenheit depending on if it was nighttime or daytime Palmer said.

The tomatoes produced under these conditions were held to high standards said Palmer. Heinz has “Tomato Masters” who inspect the quality of the tomatoes grown to ensure that they meet professional food-grade standards.

When Palmer and his team tried the tomatoes he said they tasted like tomatoes grown from normal soil. “For me the biggest thing was smell...They have very strong like tomato quality smell to them” Palmer said.

The two-year partnership started with an email that Palmer initially thought was a prank. However after a second read-through Palmer realized Heinz was interested in partnering with his lab to cultivate Martian tomatoes said Palmer.

Heinz was most certainly crowing about the achievement.

“We’re so excited that our team of experts has been able to grow tomatoes in conditions found on another planet and share our creation with the world” said Cristina Kenz chief growth officer for Kraft Heinz International Zone. “From analyzing the soil from Martian conditions two years ago to harvesting now it’s been a journey that’s proved wherever we end up HEINZ Tomato Ketchup will still be enjoyed for generations to come.”

Though the project is now over the research has cross-planetary implications.

Palmer’s team documented every part of the process: fertilizer used details of the water used and temperatures. The information is crucial for trying to duplicate the experiment on Mars. Palmer said the information also would benefit agricultural systems on Earth.

“As we think about sustainable agriculture here the same concerns about inputs need to be considered here right?” Palmer said. “So as we develop modern agriculture some of you know our green revolution that we’re trying to generate now part of that is knowing exactly how much fertilizer you’re using and optimizing that so that you don’t get run off right. So that you don’t have wasted fertilizer that pollutes our lakes or lagoons.”

Though the results from the project were fruitful Palmer said it will be awhile before astronauts will be planting food on Mars.

“We’re making more and more progress” Palmer said. “I think this is an important component of that. But ... what I hope really is the most important thing from this is it draws attention back to the field and gets people really thinking more about funding this research and the importance of this research in planning for that.”

Festive floats area emergency departments and dance troupes will be among many making their way along Charles Street on Friday when the Main Street Bank and Wellsburg Chamber of Commerce Christmas Parade returns.

Eric Fithyan who is in his eighth year as the parade’s chairman said the theme will be “A Country Christmas” with participating units invited to draw on various aspects of the country spirit.

He noted members of Cross Creek the Band will deliver their popular country sound while appearing in the procession joining the Brooke High School Marching Band and others in supplying music for the occasion.

Fithyan said the parade’s main sponsor is Main Street Bank which has arranged for the participation of Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus.

Other floats will be sponsored by the Follansbee McDonald’s Reasner Funeral Home Eagle Manufacturing and the chamber itself with many other businesses also supporting the event.

Fithyan expressed thanks to Ingrid Loy a marketing instructor at West Liberty University and students in the school’s marketing club for designing a logo for this year’s parade and helping to promote it.

Participants in the parade will line up near the Wellsburg Kroger at 3 p.m. with Chamber President Luke Diserio and others set to conduct a ribbon-cutting ceremony to kick it off at 4 p.m. near 23rd Street.

Fithyan said the procession will again make its way to the Town Square where Cross Creek the Band will perform and the Clauses will meet with children.

The chamber also is planning refreshments and activities for the children.

And the parade will be just the start of holiday festivities for the weekend.

After debuting last year outside the Wellsburg Banquet Hall the Wellsburg Winterland Hometown Holiday Market will return at a new location the city’s Central Park at 17th and Charles streets.

With the help of several volunteers Wellsburg Councilman Paul Billiard has been decorating the park with strings of multicolored bulbs lighted snowflakes and assorted holiday figurines.

The group has been building on decorations sponsored by the Wellsburg Lions Club and local businesses.

Billiard said he sees many opportunities for the spacious park and is happy that Angela Staffileno and Johanna Weiler organizers of the holiday market have decided to take advantage of it.

Staffileno said the location is great because nearly 40 vendors including several food trucks have signed on for the event which will be held from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Nov. 27.

She added there will be music by local disc jockeys Ron Music and Chris Knicely of Music Done Knicely from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the Russ Buchanan Band another popular country band from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.

Music and Knicely recently organized a Halloween event at the park with help from many others.

Staffileno said the disc jockeys will take a break at 11 a.m. so pupils from Brooke Primary South can perform.

She added Santa Claus will appear at the park after taking a ride around the city while aboard the Wellsburg Fire Department’s ladder truck beginning at 12:30 p.m.

Staffileno said she got the idea for the market while studying economic conditions affecting small-town businesses for her master’s degree from Duquesne University.

She said she found that such community events boost local economies by attracting visitors to cities and communities and she hopes the holiday market will do the same.

Staffileno said last year’s event suffered from heavy rain later in the day and an increase in COVID-19 cases around that date but she still received positive feedback.

“I always wanted it to be outside” she noted adding she’s received advice and assistance from the chamber and volunteers behind the Wellsburg Applefest another popular outdoor event.

Staffileno who is now a clerk in the city’s water department and Weiler who is office administrator for the Business Development Corp. of the Northern Panhandle also have been organizing informal public meetings to gauge residents’ interest in improving Wellsburg parks.

Staffileno said proceeds from drawings held during the event and the sale of special T-shirts produced by Tri-State Custom Teez will go toward park improvements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsYW5pZ2FuZnVuZXJhbGhvbWUuY29tL20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9Nb25pY2EtSm9uZXMtNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Monica Dee Jones Obituary - Visitation & Funeral Information,Monica Dee Jones age 44 of Buford GA passed away on Sunday November 21 2021.

It's a big hunk of poultry that you only cook once a year so taking the care to properly store thaw and cook the big bird in time for a glorious entrance to the harvest table can be tricky. While it may not be as easy to control for seasonings cooking times and temperatures there is one easy way to start off your Thanksgiving feast preparation on the right foot: Buy the best bird.

To help you decide which turkey to buy for this Thanksgiving we bought roasted and tasted five brand-name frozen turkeys from the supermarket. We had taste testers judge the birds based on tenderness texture and flavor to determine a winner. (Also don't miss We Taste-Tasted 5 Stuffing Mixes & This Is the Best.)

Here's how we did it

We visited three local grocery stores—Food Lion Harris Teeter and Whole Foods—to source our big birds. They were all frozen and ranged in the 12–14-pound range. Two of the birds were not injected or didn't have any added salt while the other three were already brined in the bag.

For how we cooked the turkey we kept it super simple to remove a lot of variables that could possibly skew results. We went with a recipe that includes ""spatchcocking"" the bird which is just cutting out the spine flipping the bird over and pressing down on the breastbone until it cracks allowing you the flatten it out on a roasting tray. This allows for quicker cooking and a more even roast because the cool and moist inner cavity is no longer skewing how fast or slow certain parts (legs versus breast) get cooked to the proper temperature.

We dried the bird applied a tablespoon of canola oil to each side along with two tablespoons of freshly ground black pepper and for the turkeys that weren't brined one tablespoon of Kosher salt.

Our oven was set to 450 degrees and after an hour of cooking a Bluetooth meat thermometer was stuck deep into the breast and set with a 150-degree alarm. Once that went off—most of them only took about an hour and a half to cook—the legs were then checked to make sure they hit the 165-degree mark. When all temps were OK the bird was taken out and left to rest for 5 minutes before carving and taste testing.

Each taste tester was given skin-on breast meat along with a chunk of leg and thigh meat. They were tasked with studying the meat for tenderness texture and flavor and then ranked each according to a one-to-five scale and they wrote down comments. Those results were then calculated and edited and created the Eat This Not That! definitive holiday ranking of Thanksgiving turkeys. Here are the results listed from worst to best.

Disclaimer: Since each turkey took time to thaw and store plus would require five identical ovens to roast at the same time they were cooked over a two-week period with some taste tasters who were around to be able to give their opinions on every bird. And they all tasted very similar as would be expected so either would be a good choice for a successful Thanksgiving feast—and all skin was crispy and delicious thanks to the spatchcock method.

Butterball

Size: 12.61 lbs

Additives: Up to 8% of a solution of water salt spices and natural flavor.

Tenderness: Since these birds are pretty heavily injected the meat ended up to be very tender and moist almost too watery for the breast meat.

Texture: The breast meat was the worst texture of the bunch with a mealy kind of crumbly mouthfeel. We speculated that was possibly because of the heavier brine and longer time sitting in a warehouse frozen.

Flavor: The flavor was decent with almost too-salty taste but it wasn't too overpowering as there was enough sugar in it to balance it out. We also didn't note much flavor from ""spices.""

Verdict: If you failed to secure a turkey before Thanksgiving and this is all that's left it's a fine choice but it's not going to bring rave reviews.

How To Rescue A Dry Thanksgiving Turkey

Shady Brook Farms

Size: 12.92 lbs

Additives: Approximately 9.5% of a solution of turkey broth salt sugar and natural flavoring.

Tenderness: Another plumped-up bird this one didn't fail to bring a moist and tender bite. It was easy to cut the breast meat with a fork and the thigh meat was also tender and easy to eat.

Texture: Again because of the amount of brining/basting done at the factory the texture was on the less firm side. The protein's structure was possibly more compromised by the extra liquid in the meat being frozen for longer.

Flavor: Since it had the highest solution percentage out of the bunch the flavor was a bit on the salty side. But overall it had a solid turkey-like taste with plenty of brothy and sweet notes.

Verdict: This one was pumped full of brine and additives so it had a nice flavor but the flesh didn't have that nice mouthfeel; therefore it's a decent bird but not a standout.

The easy way to make healthier comfort foods.

Harris Teeter Brand

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Size: 12.80 lbs

Additives: Up to 8% of a solution of turkey broth salt sodium phosphate sugar and natural flavoring.

Tenderness: This store-brand was also pretty plumped up and so the meat was also tender and pretty delicious possibly because of the sodium phosphate which is added to increase moisture and intensify flavors. The FDA says that additive is recognized as generally safe.

Texture: The texture was much better in this bird with a firmer and more poultry-like mouthfeel without much mealy-ness.

Flavor: Really nice flavor for a store-brand bird with a nice round saltiness and sweeter notes than the other turkeys.

Verdict: A great choice and certain Thanksgiving-crowd pleaser as long as you (and your guests) don't mind the addition of sodium phosphate.

This Popular Thanksgiving Food Has Skyrocketed in Price

Nature's Rancher

Size: 13.15 lbs

Additives: Non-injected. Less than 5% of retained water.

Tenderness: Without the brine it's easier to get a drier bite when closer to the skin but with the spatchcock method it was still nice and tender on deeper portions.

Texture: Mouthfeel was good with plenty of real turkey-like taste and more fibrous but welcome and fleshy bite.

Flavor: Flavor was good with traditional turkey meat notes of sweetness saltiness and umami. Though not organic you could tell that since there were no additives that it was a more natural-tasting bird.

Verdict: If you don't want to spend the extra money for an organic bird which can range from $3.99 a pound or more this is a great choice with good flavor. Just do your own home brine before cooking to amp up the moistness.

RELATED: 50 Best Thanksgiving Recipes

Organic Prairie

Size: 13.64 lbs

Additives: None

Tenderness: Though again the meat was not quite as moist as the injected birds the firmer and more natural bite made it the big hit with taste testers. You could still manage to cut the breast meat with a fork you just had to push a little more.

Texture: No mealy-ness at all. Mouthfeel was excellent without being tough and gave a nice chew.

Flavor: If you've ever had a heritage or wild turkey this comes close to that true slightly gamey flavor. Lots of balanced notes of sweetness saltiness and umami made it the winner.

Verdict: With no additives of any kind and being USDA certified organic the only thing this bird fell a little short on was moisture. But that's easy enough to remedy with a home brine and then you get the ultimate tender turkey that also tastes like real meat and not mush.

The story by Katie Dowd tracks the story of lifelong con artist Iva Kroeger born Lucy Cooper whose first arrest came in Chicago in 1945 after she went around pretending to be a war-hero nurse. (The offense was illegally wearing the uniform.) The most sensational part of her life of crime however may be familiar to true-crime buffs. In the 1960s she conned and murdered an older couple who ran a cheap motel in Santa Rosa California then buried their bodies under the garage floor of her home in San Francisco. She took over their motel before police unraveled what happened and closed in. Kroeger was on the lam for a while her photo plastered on newspapers as a wanted killer. (In this wild stretch she managed to con her own son and kidnap two grandsons.)

She finally got caught and at the strange murder trial she played the I'm-crazy card but got convicted anyway. She was released after 13 years because of good behavior and because she was practically blind. Or so authorities thought. When she came to police attention again in 1987 after threatening to kill a man in Florida police say she had no vision trouble. The best guess is she faked it to dupe the parole board and to collect benefits. Kroeger's trail runs cold after that. It's not clear whether she was arrested for the Florida threat but Dowd provides the ultimate coda. A public-records search turned up a gravestone with her name in Boston and the city provided a death certificate. She was living alone in public housing when she died of cervical cancer in 2000. Her occupation was ""homemaker"" and the only ""next of kin"" was a social worker. (Read the full tale.)"

That is the sentiment of L3Harris executive Luke Savoie who announced Friday that the global aerospace and defense technology company was expanding modification and production work at its facility in Tulsa.

“Tulsa is a great aerospace city” said Savoie president of aviation services for the Florida-based firm. “The reality is we look for access to talent. We have great access to software engineering in the city of Tulsa. We have a good base of aircraft mechanics that are here.”

“It’s a very very friendly environment business-wise. I always say this is my happiest division to visit. When we look for growth this is definitely a city that can grow with us.”

In a partnership with Texas-based Air Tractor L3Harris will be installing specialized mission equipment packaging and modifications to the AT-802U Sky Warden a single-engine turboprop aircraft designed for airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and other missions in extreme combat environments.

In Tulsa since 1974 and at Tulsa International Airport since 2013 the L3Harris company develops maintains and operates airborne missile tracking systems in support of the Missile Defense Agency Airborne Sensor Program. It is a technology supplier for military government and commercial partners.

L3 employs 264 people in Tulsa.

“We’ve been a strong supporter of L3 in wanting to put them in a position to be successful by providing world-class facilities for them to do their work just like we do with so many other rapidly growing companies out there at the airport” Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said.

“This is really in my mind this is one of our greatest opportunities for growth as it relates to Tulsa’s economy. It’s the industrial cluster that we have right here at the airport.”

L3 is among five companies selected by U.S. Special Operations Command — SOCOM — for prototype demonstrations of part of the Armed Overwatch program. SOCOM launched the program to purchase roughly 75 manned fixed-wing aircraft to perform close air support precision strike and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions.

With L3’s expansion at least 80 new jobs are expected in the next year. That number could grow by an additional 200 if L3 lands the SOCOM award in mid-2022 Savoie said.

“It’s definitely north of a billion-dollar type of a contract” he said. “That’s just the SOCOM side. You see a lot of demand on the international side to follow what SOCOM does. So when we look at this this is a $2 billion to $3 billion opportunity just on the production side of building these types of aircraft.”

The Sky Warden is designed to perform in austere disaggregated combat environments with limited infrastructure. It has unparalleled range and endurance weapons sensor and communication capabilities for the Armed Overwatch mission.

“Aircraft like this are about doing more with less” Savoie said. “How do we still keep an eye on the enemy at the gate that’s at the back door while we’re focusing on the enemy that’s at the front door?

“A platform like this is really really high-tech lots of sensors. It’s the capabilities that we used to stack plane on plane on plane on plane in Iraq and Afghanistan. We’re doing that right now on one single airplane at a much much lower cost point.”

It is being assembled on a new production line at the company's Tulsa International Airport facility. L3 Aviation Services President Luke Savoie said the goal is an aircraft that can do what has previously taken several specialized planes.

""We're doing that now all on one single airplane at a much much lower cost point with a lot of tools software-wise and technology-wise that reduce the workload of the operator to still provide the same effect the same situational awareness keep the ground teams informed for places like Africa and the Middle East where we will continue to operate but not with the entire Department of Defense behind us"" Savoie said.

L3 is adding sensors weapons systems and other modifications to the Air Tractor AT-802 a single engine turboprop originally designed for agricultural use that can take off and land on grass fields and unimproved air strips. Air Tractor President Jim Hirsch said the Sky Warden is the companies’ latest partnership in the past several years.

""Collectively it makes a fabulous platform to help us both do our little part to protect the world"" Hirsch said.

The Department of Defense is looking at a handful of firms to supply 75 planes for its Armed Overwatch program. The contract is expected to be more than $1 billion. Mayor G.T. Bynum said while that’s a big deal so is the potential for L3 to bring some of its other production work to Tulsa.

""One of our greatest areas of opportunity for growth as it relates to Tulsa's economy is the industrial cluster that we have right here at the airport. These companies the CEOs of them tell me every time I see them they cannot hire people fast enough for all the work that there is to do out there"" Bynum said.

The Sky Warden went from concept to first flight in six months. Officials expect an Armed Overwatch contract to be awarded sometime next year. Savoie said the Oklahoma Air National Guard will get some of the new planes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbG9yaWRhdG9kYXkuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjEvMTEvMjAvMTItdGgtYW5udWFsLXNwYWNlLWNvYXN0LXRoYW5rc2dpdmluZy1iYXNrZXQtYnJpZ2FkZS84NzAxNzkxMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12th Annual Space Coast Thanksgiving Basket Brigade,"LOCAL

That's why I have concerns with the so-called 'safe supply' of drugs,"Open this photo in gallery: People hold a banner reading 'safe supply saves lives' at an Aug. 31 march in Vancouver for International Overdose Awareness Day.Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press

Vincent Lam is an addictions medicine physician and an author. He is the Medical Director of the Coderix Medical Clinic an addictions clinic in Toronto.

Last month Vancouver City Council voted to support a federal application by the Drug User Liberation Front for an exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. DULF – a non-profit – is seeking legal permission to purchase heroin cocaine and methamphetamine from the Dark Web which it plans to test label and distribute. They have framed this practice as “safe supply” an increasingly catch-all term for the practice of supplying known formulations of addictive drugs to people in an attempt to reduce harms. “Safe” represents the hope that the practice will reduce people’s chances of overdosing (and possibly dying) from using illicit fentanyl an extremely powerful opioid that has found its way into nearly every uncontrolled substance intended to provide a recreational “high.”

Meanwhile in my addictions medicine clinic patients who feel trapped by fentanyl ask me to prescribe them hydromorphone a commonly used strong opioid painkiller that is employed in a different sort of “safe supply” currently offered in Ontario and British Columbia. In this doctors prescribe high doses of hydromorphone for patients to use anywhere and to swallow crush or inject as they prefer. With no clear evidence yet on whether this kind of “safe supply” saves lives overall I urge these patients to instead take treatments for opioid use disorder that are supported by medical science such as methadone and buprenorphine – opioid agonist therapy (OAT). When they learn that I will not fulfill their request for hydromorphone some are disappointed or angry. “It’s what I need” I’ve been told. “Why won’t you give it to me?”

I decline to write these prescriptions because I am not convinced they are “safe.” Much of my discomfort with “safe supply” comes from what I am told by other patients who are also struggling with substances in their lives. They say that “safe supply” is harming them as street availability has risen and prices have fallen.

Patients of mine who were free of illicit opioids for years now struggle with hydromorphone which they are buying from those to whom it is prescribed. One told me they prefer to sleep outside rather than in shelters because they cannot avoid hydromorphone in the shelters. One who has never tried fentanyl – which hydromorphone is meant to protect them from – is injecting high doses of hydromorphone daily struggling to get off while their tolerance rapidly increases.

What is difficult about “safe supply” and what causes me and others moral distress is that the same pills that one patient insists are needed to save their life may bring harm to another patient of mine or one I have not yet met. In medicine we are taught primum non nocere first do no harm.

At this moment both people who use drugs and the professionals who are trying to offer care feel that a tidal wave of harm is engulfing us. Nat Kaminski president of the Ontario Network of People Who Use Drugs says “What’s currently on the street you can’t figure it out.” A former drug user they cannot recognize the “high” of people on the current illicit supply. An amount that a person could tolerate on one day causes them to overdose the next. I routinely learn of the deaths of my patients who have been among the 22828 apparent-opioid toxicity deaths in Canada between January 2016 and March 2021. This number approaches the 29384 lives we have lost in Canada because of COVID. A national tragedy with complex origins demands a coherent response. Instead Health Canada seems to be at cross-purposes both calling for restrictions on the marketing and advertising of opioids and for the increased availability of opioids under the guise of “safe supply.”

“Safe supply” has now been offered in Canada for the past five years first in a handful of Ontario Community Health Centres and more broadly in British Columbia since March 2020 where its mandate was expanded to help support COVID distancing. Some patients feel it has helped them. One of the first patients of a Toronto pilot program Ari tells me that with “safe supply” he has turned his life around has found success at work has bought a home. “It takes out the chance. I would like to see another day instead of buying something that’s cross contaminated with fentanyl.”

Unfortunately despite anecdotal evidence thus far there has been little objective evidence that “safe supply” reduces fentanyl usage or deaths. Dr. Launette Rieb an addictions doctor in British Columbia says “ ‘Safe supply’ is a misnomer. It is not treatment and it is an unproven intervention.” Injecting substances that are not meant to be injected – which includes both illicit fentanyl and the hydromorphone tablets of “safe supply” – come with the major medical risk of debilitating and life-threatening infections of the heart and spinal column.

A French study showed that giving people morphine tablets to take home rather than providing less easily injected methadone and buprenorphine resulted in higher rates of unintentional overdose bacterial infection dangerous blood clots and overall rates of death. Dr. Mel Kahan an addictions doctor in Toronto says “Ontario physicians have reported an increase in the number of hospitalizations for injection-related infections in patients on ‘safe supply’ and in patients who purchased hydromorphone tablets from ‘safe supply’ patients.”

The argument for “safe supply” often equates it with a very different approach – injectable opioid agonist therapy (iOAT) – in which people are provided with injectable heroin or hydromorphone in a controlled setting that provides medical support and does not permit off-premises use. The submission by DULF cites a study of supervised injectable heroin as well as other references that any undergraduate science student would realize do not support DULF’s conclusion that “when drug users are provided non-toxic drugs the death rate is vastly lower.” City councils and policy makers entertaining such submissions should examine the references with care.

A commitment to iOAT – which differs from supervised injection sites where users bring their own drugs and also differs from standard OAT where take-home options of prescribed medications exist – requires immense staffing and resources and availability of iOAT remains limited. The cost to patients is that multiple daily visits to receive iOAT make it prohibitive to work or attend school. It is convenient for the federal government to pretend that iOAT and “safe supply” both enjoy the support of scientific evidence – because it costs nothing for Health Canada to endorse the writing of prescriptions. Dr. Lisa Bromley an Ottawa addictions medicine physician says “the evidence for iOAT was stretched beyond recognition to apply to ‘safe supply.’ If doctors provide prescriptions it lets governments completely off the hook to craft rational drug policy. It was a brilliant move by the federal government to dodge responsibility for drug policy.”

Much depends on the frame of observation. It is probably true that one person is less likely to die injecting hydromorphone in their next “smash” a single use of intravenous opioids than street fentanyl. But with a medical problem that is characterized by repeated injections we don’t know if it actually keeps anyone from also injecting fentanyl or dying. Studies are under way to assess whether the “safe supply” of hydromorphone actually helps those to whom it is prescribed. Supporters of “safe supply” often frame diversion as being a public-health benefit – because someone found hydromorphone instead of finding fentanyl but we will only know after the fact if “safe supply” seeds the next decades of suffering for new patients who become addicted to hydromorphone bought off someone with a prescription.

One of the reasons both users and prescribers of “safe supply” tell me it is not currently working for some fentanyl users who receive it is because it does not match the strength of the drugs they are using. In the “British Columbia COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Interim Clinical Guidance” up to 112 milligrams of daily hydromorphone can be prescribed a medication whose starting dose for pain control in an opioid-naïve patient would be 1-4 mg.

Ash Heaslip a family doctor and addiction medicine specialist in Victoria tells me “The idea of this being proposed as an alternative to street fentanyl is quite unrealistic in terms of the tolerance levels we are seeing in many patients these days. If it’s being positioned as something that should be replacing their need to access the illicit market it’s not achieving that goal for many patients.” Dr. Heaslip would prefer broader access to hydromorphone through public-health mechanisms without prescribers like her acting as gatekeepers.

As with any opioid hydromorphone tablets can be a commodity so that some “safe supply” hydromorphone is sold by fentanyl users to people with lower opioid tolerance – the profits of which they will use to buy fentanyl. “Patients have said to me ‘I’m not using these tablets’” Dr. Heaslip says. “Sometimes they are being sold or traded in circumstances where patients are not finding them beneficial. In some communities the street value of hydromorphone tablets has dropped significantly since the beginning of COVID because they are more widely available.” I have heard from both doctors and patients that some dealers are buying hydromorphone in cities like Toronto and Vancouver and shipping them to other cities in Canada and the U.S. where they are more valuable.

If you are a proponent of “safe supply” the ineffectiveness of prescribed hydromorphone in replacing street fentanyl supports the argument of making pharmaceutical grade heroin available instead with more open access to this higher potency molecule. If you are a skeptic it points to the futility of the effort. When the argument that we should offer less risky substances to satisfy people who will always seek euphoria “the high” meets the concept that achieving euphoria requires stimulus above a physiological baseline – and continuing use of substances raises that baseline – the notion of “safe supply” looks more like an infinite escalator than a destination. As dose and potency escalate risk and harm escalates and yet “safe supply” is sold as harm reduction. On the ground the irony is that current “safe supply” does not meet the opioid requirements of those who are at highest risk – but it is these high-risk users whose lives it is meant to save.

This conundrum results in varying conclusions. Some advocates like DULF conclude that what is needed is free access to tested labelled drugs that people can use as they wish. Ms. Kaminski asks me “You can drink wine why can’t I do a line of coke? If I want to use a substance I want the ability to go buy it from someone whom I trust.” Some advocates and prescribers argue that for “safe supply” to have useful impact prescribers need to be taken out of the picture – and drugs should be available through public health without the bottleneck of a prescriber. Many prescribers feel there is little clinical judgment involved in any case – they simply fulfill the request for hydromorphone.

Dr. Paxton Bach an internist and addictions specialist who works in Vancouver’s Downtown East Side is conflicted “Safe supply is the most immediate tool that I have available to try and stop somebody from dying tomorrow” he says “but I worry that a discussion on safe supply in isolation without talking about the systematic drivers of substance use is incomplete. I’m less worried about de novo opioid-use disorder tomorrow with some diverted hydromorphone tablets but I do wonder where this ends up taking us over the next 10 years without addressing these bigger questions.” The forces behind substance misuse and addiction are the roots of suffering in Canadian society - trauma mental illness racism poverty homelessness physical injury and pain. These are at once so diffusely powerful and inadequately addressed that those of us who wield prescription pads are easily seduced by the promise of a solution by prescription just as opioids promise solace in the smooth form of a nice safe pill.

Oxycodone once promised easy solutions and instead was a key force in fuelling today’s opioid crisis. I worry that “safe supply” has the potential to seed the next one. In the late 1990s and 2000s the pharmaceutical company Purdue made an earlier unfounded claim of safety – telling doctors that if oxycodone was prescribed for pain patients would not become addicted. Within a Medicare system that funds physicians and often pills – but less often provides multidisciplinary management of chronic pain – oxycodone was the go-to for pain for almost a decade. Stingy sick leave policies make it difficult for injured workers to recover from painful injuries. Many who suffered in non-physical ways – from trauma to untreated mental illness – also discovered that opioids helped to ease their suffering temporarily. In addition to being swallowed oxycodone tablets like Percocet were sometimes sold chewed and snorted.

Now as I struggle to stabilize my opioid-addicted patients I am sometimes haunted by the patients who prevailed upon me almost 20 years ago often after midnight in the emergency department when I could not corroborate much information to write prescriptions for “just a few more” oxycodone tablets. At the time these prescriptions were received with gratitude and thanks. I wonder how many would thank me today?

We now know that 80 per cent of heroin users initially misused prescribed opioids. While the provinces are trying to wrest Canada’s share of settlement funds from Purdue for flooding North America with opioids doctors who have been chastised for a decade for causing the opioid crisis through their prescriptions are hearing from advocates of “safe supply” and from Health Canada that the best way to save lives is now to liberally prescribe opioids. Many are unconvinced. “In BC we are flooding the streets with prescription opioids due to diversion” says Dr. Nick Mathew an addictions psychiatrist in Vancouver. “The benefits of the B.C. safe supply model are entirely unproven and theoretical. The downsides of increasing the amount of opioids in the population have a known harm.”

The call for “safe supply” comes from a place of desperation and justified anger whose causes need to be understood and addressed. “When I say my friends are dead – all my friends are dead” Ms. Kaminski tells me. There is desperation when treatment is inaccessible or doesn’t seem to work. Patients of mine are rightly angry when – as often occurs – they seek general medical care and are belittled condescended to or refused pain management because they are a person who uses drugs. Many Canadian hospitals do not provide addictions services. The result is that people who suffer from substance-use disorders who are admitted for other urgent medical reasons often leave because they are suffering the agony of withdrawal and therefore do not receive other essential medical services. In this way they are denied what is promised by the Canada Health Act – universal access to health care.

What everyone seems to agree on is that the issue and the required solutions are broader than just the molecules on-hand. Stephanie Callaghan a nurse with the Hydromorphone Intensive Engagement Program in Vancouver tells me “If I were to look at what really worked for this program it wouldn’t be so much about prescribing it would be around connection and engagement.” Ms. Kaminski says of physician allies “It is empowering for people who use drugs to feel like there are doctors on their side. They’re our doctors and also our allies.” Clinics that offer comprehensive primary care housing and food programs alongside “safe supply” offer a glimpse of what we owe to our vulnerable citizens – but it may be that the greatest benefits are not the hydromorphone.

“Safe supply” embodies a push against entrenched powers – both legal and illegal. The most lethal power rests with the producers and distributors of the current toxic drug supply and “safe supply” is sometimes framed as an attempt to take power from this unregulated force by shifting the marketplace. Since power can only be exercised upon or taken from those who can be reached individual users of drugs are criminalized and the health care system is asked to both provide solutions and relinquish its oversight. A distinction between the exercise of punitive powers and limits based upon science and safety is important. I have not yet met an addictions professional who does not support decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use – as the revolving door of the criminal justice system destabilizes people who use drugs and makes their lives more dangerous. We must find a way as a society to give people agency and choice – without the widespread uncontrolled distribution of the same molecules that got us here.

Simon Fraser University has issued a “Call to Action” to the British Columbia Government drawing on 15 years of research to show that for the same cost as existing programs recovery-oriented housing to support people affected by homelessness addiction and mental illness would result in a 70-per-cent reduction in crime and a 50-per-cent reduction in medical emergencies. This is the kind of leadership and commitment that provincial and federal governments need to show rather than a contradictory and patchwork throw-away telling doctors not to prescribe opioids – except when they are supposed to be prescribing far more than ever before.

Those of us who practise addictions medicine need to ask ourselves hard questions about how we can be more patient-centred and responsive to the dangers our patients now face. Addictions medicine has too often been structured to suit the needs of regulators and care providers before the needs of patients. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities that do not offer OAT ignore three decades of science. Outpatient clinics that profit from insisting upon frequent mandatory urine testing along with regulations which require patients to attend a pharmacy daily to obtain prescribed treatment make it difficult for many patients to be in treatment programs and attend school or work. In some smaller communities often no addictions treatment is available. Methadone and buprenorphine are on the WHO list of essential medicines and yet pharmacies can opt out of dispensing them: dispensing other opioids and not dispensing the treatments for opioid use disorder is akin to allowing people to build bonfires without having buckets of water.

Addictions care is starting to change with more rapid dosing protocols and combinations of medications to address the higher tolerance era of fentanyl.

Dr. Rieb says “we can work to adjust medications and behavioural treatments for opioid use disorder that are proven to be effective.” There are now monthly injectable treatment options of buprenorphine. Virtual options are expanding access to care. Guidelines for prescribing medications are becoming more flexible. Some hospitals are beginning to expand addictions consult services. All of these changes are happening too slowly and inconsistently and need to move forward with urgency.

Ultimately this divisive issue is one that hinges on questions of power inclusion agency as well as science. People who use drugs have felt powerless and excluded. More than ever their lives are at stake. A meaningful response needs to take place in addictions medicine the broad health care system and government and in our communities – with people who use drugs at the centre in such a way that they are served by institutions and by science. Prescribed opioids were an integral part of the creation of this crisis. We are not going to be able to prescribe our way out of it.

This article is part of a series produced in partnership with NBC News and Undark Magazine a non-profit editorially independent digital magazine exploring the intersection of science and society.

FORT MCMURRAY Canada—The first mine opened when Jean L’Hommecourt was a young girl an open pit where an oil company had begun digging in the sandy soil for a black viscous form of crude called bitumen.

She and her family would pass the mine in their boat when they traveled up the Athabasca River and the fumes from its processing plant would sting their eyes and burn their throats despite the wet cloths their mother would drape over the children’s faces.

By the time L’Hommecourt was in her 30s oil companies had leased most of the land where she and her mother went to gather berries from the forest on long summer days or hunt moose when the leaves turned yellow and the air crisp.

Today that same land near her Indigenous community of Fort McKay is surrounded by mines that have swallowed an area larger than New York City stripping away boreal forest and muskeg and rerouting waterways.

Oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil and the Canadian giant Suncor have transformed Alberta’s tar sands—also called oil sands—into one of the world’s largest industrial developments. They have built sprawling waste ponds that leach heavy metals into groundwater and processing plants that spew nitrogen and sulfur oxides into the air sending a sour stench for miles.

The sands pump out more than 3 million barrels of oil per day helping make Canada the world’s fourth-largest oil producer and the top exporter of crude to the United States. Their economic benefits are significant: Oil is the nation’s top export and the mining and energy sector as a whole accounts for nearly a quarter of Alberta’s provincial economy. But the companies’ energy-hungry extraction has also made the oil and gas sector Canada’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. And despite the extreme environmental costs and the growing need for countries to shift away from fossil fuels the mines continue to expand digging up nearly 500 Olympic swimming pools-worth of earth every day.

COP26 the global climate conference in Glasgow earlier this month highlighted the persistent gap between what countries say they will do to cut emissions and what is actually needed to avoid dangerous warming.

Scientists say oil production must begin falling immediately. Canada’s tar sands are among the most climate-polluting sources of oil and so are an obvious place to begin winding down. The largest oil sands companies have pledged to reduce their emissions saying they will rely largely on government-subsidized carbon capture projects.

Yet oil companies and the government expect output will climb well into the 2030s. Even a new proposal by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to cap emissions in the oil sector does not include any plan to lower production.

Some lawyers and advocates have pointed to the tar sands as a prime example of the widespread environmental destruction they call “ecocide.” They are pushing for the International Criminal Court to outlaw ecocide as a crime on a par with genocide or war crimes. While the campaign for a new international law is likely to last years with no assurance it will succeed it has drawn attention to the inability of countries’ existing laws to contain industrial development like the tar sands which will pollute the land for decades or centuries.

Julie King an Exxon spokeswoman said that “ExxonMobil is committed to operating our businesses in a responsible and sustainable manner working to minimize environmental impacts and supporting the communities where we live and work.”

Leithan Slade a spokesman for Suncor pointed to agreements the company has signed with First Nations adding that “Suncor sees partnering with Indigenous communities as foundational to successful energy development.”

Despite those agreements the mines’ ecological impacts are so vast and so deep that L’Hommecourt and other Indigenous people here say the industry has challenged their very existence even as it has provided jobs and revenue to Native businesses and communities.

“The basis of all our Indigenous culture is on the land” said L’Hommecourt 58.

It was the threat to her mother’s traditional land that 20 years ago set her on a path of resistance. She attended a hearing for a mine that was slated to consume much of that land and she spoke out angrily about the development. She ended up being recruited to work as an environmental coordinator for the Fort McKay First Nation the Indigenous group of which she is a member to help protect whatever shreds of land she could.

“That’s when I made my choice” she said. “I’m going to fight for my mom’s land.”

Vast Black Holes

The only way to fully appreciate the scope of the tar sands is to see the mines from the air. Flying across the region from the north the twisting channels of the Peace-Athabasca Delta one of the world’s largest inland deltas dominate the landscape snaking through forest and marshlands with not a road or power line in sight.

That terrain gives way to a mixture of forest muskeg and drylands where the sandy soil rises to the surface. Out of nowhere straight lines emerge—a wide unpaved highway and paths leading to squares carved out of the forest where companies have explored for oil.

Then the mines come into view. Billowing plumes of smoke fill the sky. Flames shoot out of flare stacks. The forest’s green is replaced by vast black holes pockmarked with giant puddles. From the air the dump trucks and shovels look like toys lines of Tonkas digging in oversized sandboxes. The mines are terraced with massive berms holding back lagoons full of waste above the newly dug pits. As the plane nears its descent the cabin fills with a tarry stench.

“It’s just the most completely ludicrous approach to industrial and energy development that is possible given everything we know about the impact on ecosystems the impact on climate” said Dale Marshall national program manager with Environmental Defence a Canadian advocacy group.

To extract bitumen from the sand oil companies heat it and then treat it in a slurry of water and solvents. In other parts of Alberta where the sands are too deep to mine the bitumen is melted in place and extracted through wells by pumping high-pressure steam underground. These deeper deposits cover a much larger area than the mines more than 50000 square miles.

The extraction requires enormous amounts of energy: In 2018 the latest year for which figures are available oil sands producers consumed 30 percent of all the natural gas burned in Canada. Collectively the mines’ and deep-extraction projects emit greenhouse gas emissions roughly equal those of 21 coal-fired power plants and that’s just to get the crude out of the ground.

The operations also pump out noxious air pollutants including nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons traces of which have been detected by scientists in soils and snowpack dozens of miles away.

The mines guzzle vast quantities of water with nearly 58 billion gallons drawn from the region’s rivers lakes and aquifers in 2019 according to government figures. When all that water comes out the other end it is so heavily laced with hydrocarbons naphthenic acids and carcinogenic heavy metals that it cannot be released where it came from. Instead oil companies have been collecting these acutely toxic “tailings” in waste ponds some of which routinely leak their contents into groundwater.

In 1973 a report to the Alberta Department of the Environment identified waste as a problem and recommended placing limits on the ponds’ size and duration of use. The idea was that the toxic components would settle out of the water over a matter of years. The reality is that the tailings will take decades or even centuries to separate naturally.

As a result the ponds have grown exponentially in size and now cover more than 100 square miles. Every day they swell with millions of gallons of new toxic waste. Regulatory filings show that the ponds are expected to continue to expand well into the 2030s. While companies are required by law to eventually reclaim them only a fraction have been reclaimed so far.

Next to one pond a coal-black mountain of debris towers over the water. High voltage lines buzz overhead. Air cannons ring the pond and blast several times each minute creating a constant explosive din. Industrial iron scarecrows are dressed with safety vests and helmets. The noise and display are meant to scare off the millions of migratory birds that arrive in northern Alberta each year exhausted from their annual odysseys.

Sometimes even these defenses fail or the birds ignore them and land anyway—tens of thousands each year according to a 2016 report to provincial regulators obtained this year by The Narwhal a nonprofit Canadian news organization.

Ottilie Coldbeck a spokeswoman for the Alberta Energy Regulator which oversees the industry said the research in the report “was not considered complete.”

Some conservationists worry that endangered whooping cranes which migrate here annually might land in a pond and since fewer than 900 remain the landing of a single flock could decimate the species in one errant swoop.

An Insatiable Appetite for Oil

White explorers and traders set their sights on the tar sands as soon as they arrived. In 1789 Sir Alexander Mackenzie reported seeing veins of “bituminous quality” exposed along the Athabasca River. Within a century prospectors and geologists had identified “almost inexhaustible supplies” of petroleum in the area. The only obstacle seemed to be the people living above it.

In 1891 the superintendent general of Indian Affairs recommended drafting a treaty “with a view to the extinguishment of the Indians’ title” to open access to petroleum and other minerals. When a team was sent up the Athabasca eight years later to sign what would become Treaty 8 a member of the party named Charles Mair described giant escarpments rising on either side “everywhere streaked with oozing tar and smelling like an old ship.”

The Indigenous people used the substance to seal canoes and even burned it like coal but Mair saw something different. “That this region is stored with a substance of great economic value is beyond all doubt” he wrote. “When the hour of development comes it will I believe prove to be one of the wonders of Northern Canada.”

But it would be many years before that hour struck and the tar sands remained largely beyond reach until Americans driven by nationalistic ambitions invested vast sums of capital. In 1967 J. Howard Pew of the Sun Oil Company opened the first commercial mine declaring “No nation can long be secure in this atomic age unless it be amply supplied with petroleum.” A decade later a second mine opened called Syncrude backed by a consortium of American oil companies and the Canadian government.

For years there were only two mines but the 21st century brought an insatiable global appetite for oil and fears that conventional sources of crude were running out. Oil prices surged and Alberta’s massive pool of bitumen offered an opportunity to oil companies: No risky exploration was required and unlike in other parts of the globe Canada provided a stable business-friendly government. Multinational giants poured in cash boosted their reserves and drew tens of billions of dollars in new investment.

Over the course of only a decade the mines began to multiply. Eight active tar sands mines now form a 40-mile chain along the Athabasca River their giant shovels gobbling up the earth like an invasion of mechanical caterpillars.

The town of Fort McKay population 765 sits in the middle of all this. Even as the mines devoured the land most of the people who lived here hung on as well as they could squeezed into smaller and smaller spaces.

L’Hommecourt keeps a cabin 20 miles outside of Fort McKay as the crow flies but more than an hour’s drive because the road has to loop between and around several mines and two deeper extraction projects.

Despite L’Hommecourt’s best efforts as an environmental coordinator the mines have continued to encroach on her cabin which sits on the land where she used to go with her mother. More and more workers have showed up in the area stopping her along the road to tell her that she couldn’t hunt moose or that she was trespassing.

“‘You’re the trespasser’” she tells them. “‘I shouldn’t have to be answering your questions you answer mine. That’s my attitude.”

The land she said is where she can think in her language Dene “where in the outside world it’s all English.”

“You get that sense of belonging here” she said “and that’s what I want for our peoples to have their land back.” She added “If you have your land back you have everything.”

A Devil’s Bargain

When Pew’s Great Canadian Oil Sands mine opened in 1967 the people of Fort McKay were not happy said Jim Boucher who led the First Nation as chief for three decades until 2019.

Sun Oil now Suncor took over an important summer hunting and gathering ground called Tar Island he said. “There was no discussion no consultation.”

The Fort McKay First Nation includes both Dene and Cree—the two main Indigenous groups that have lived in the region for centuries. For most of the 20th century the fur trade provided the nation’s members with one of their few sources of income. But it collapsed just as the oil industry was taking hold and they had few alternatives but to turn to the oil companies and their rapidly expanding mines.

“We had no choice” Boucher said.

After becoming chief in 1986 Boucher formed the Fort McKay Group of Companies to work with the oil industry and over the following decades he oversaw partnerships with energy companies that would eventually net hundreds of millions of dollars for the community.

Now the oil sands are the axis around which Fort McKay revolves. The industry has allowed the community to build subsidized housing and to pay for education and elder care achievements that Boucher rattles off proudly. Enrolled members receive quarterly dividends and some including Boucher have grown relatively wealthy.

Many First Nations have also fought development. Several have filed lawsuits against companies or regulators—The Beaver Lake Cree Nation south of Fort McMurray sued the federal and provincial governments in 2008 saying its treaty rights had been violated by the cumulative effects of development. Despite receiving a favorable ruling five years later the case is still awaiting trial with a court date scheduled for 2024.

Attempting to block development can be prohibitively expensive though and is usually unsuccessful.

“It’s David and Goliath here we’re dealing with multi-billion dollar companies” said Melody Lepine director of government and industry relations for the Mikisew Cree First Nation. The regulatory process she said is built to approve the companies’ projects even if it takes years. “It’s very very difficult to get anybody to say ‘No you’re not going to get approved.’”

Each of the area’s First Nations has signed “impact benefit agreements” with the oil companies that can include limits on certain practices like water withdrawals quotas for hiring Indigenous people and direct payments to the nations. But even as the impact agreements have secured benefits for the First Nations they’ve created a Devil’s bargain deepening reliance on an industry that is consuming the land that was once the base of the Indigenous economy and culture. The British sociologists Martin Crook Damien Short and Nigel South have argued that the concept of “ecocide” offers a “powerful tool” to recognize the particular damage caused by resource extraction to many Indigenous groups because of their cultural spiritual and subsistence ties to ecosystems.

“They’re making us dependent on things that they make things that they build” L’Hommecourt said. “They want us to be dependent on those things so that we can give them our money so we can give them our land and say ‘Yeah OK. I’ll trade it off.’”

L’Hommecourt who is Boucher’s cousin said she holds no resentment toward the former chief for tying their people’s fate to the industry.

“He did what he had to do and as a chief I commend him” L’Hommecourt said. “They call us the richest little First Nation in Canada.”

Boucher lost his grandfather’s cabin where he learned to hunt and trap as a boy to Syncrude’s mine. A cabin Boucher later built for his father to the north now sits on a postage stamp of land he said surrounded by newer mines.

“It’s empty that’s how the cabin is to me” Boucher said. “So I don’t go there anymore. No joy.”

‘They Took It All Away’

The mines cover a staggeringly large area but their impact on the environment reaches even farther.

The town of Fort Chipewyan sits where the Peace and Athabasca rivers empty into Lake Athabasca about 90 miles north of the closest mine and the land here seems to offer a glimpse of what existed before the oil and gas companies arrived. There are no roads to the community except for a frozen winter road that has become harder to maintain as temperatures warm. The mostly Indigenous residents can still hunt and trap in unbroken stretches of boreal forest where wolves and wolverines prowl and towering spruce and jack pines shade a thick spongy mat of lichen and moss below. The town abuts Canada’s largest national park a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is home to herds of wood bison and which the World Heritage Committee said in June was threatened by the expansion of the tar sands.

But while the nights are quiet and the air smells clean the industry’s presence is strong even here. Kids zoom around town on ATVs while the local supermarket displays boxes of 87” flatscreen TVs—”toys” as some residents call them that only those who work in the industry can afford to buy.

And despite its distance from the development the flesh of the animals that drink from the lake is laced with some of the same compounds and heavy metals that collect in the waste ponds upstream.

When Alice Rigney an elder with the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation was a young girl the waste ponds had not yet been dug. Her family would head to their homestead in the delta ahead of the freeze and stay until Christmas. When the delta flooded in the spring she said the men would trap muskrats and the women would keep a fire going to dry the pelts and smoke the meat. Then came the spring bird hunt flocks of thousands coming from the south.

But in the late 1960s the lake levels dropped and the delta no longer flooded. A dam began to fill its reservoir up the Peace River and the tar sands development began up the Athabasca. One day she and her brother took a snowmobile out on the ice to go fishing for walleye and then cooked their catch over an open fire as always. But as the fish began to cook black grease dripped out.

“The taste was gas or fuel” Rigney said. They later learned that there had been an oil spill under the ice upstream and the fishery had to be shut temporarily she said.

People here have long suspected that the tar sands mines were poisoning the land and everything it feeds. Everyone seems to know someone who has died of cancer or another disease—Rigney survived breast cancer which ran in her family and her husband survived colon cancer. But in 2004 the appearance of a rare cancer brought increased attention.

Rigney was working as a physical therapist’s assistant at the health clinic one day when a doctor approached her for help arranging travel saying a jaundiced patient needed to be flown to Fort McMurray for treatment. The man’s illness was soon diagnosed as an aggressive type of bile duct cancer called cholangiocarcinoma. He died shortly after.

Other people began to develop the cancer of which only a few dozen cases are diagnosed each year in Canada. In 2010 a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found elevated levels of numerous “priority pollutants” including mercury lead nickel and other heavy metals in the river downstream of oil sands development as well as in Lake Athabasca and in snow samples.

Three years later another study in the same journal examined lake sediments surrounding Fort McMurray and found that levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons a group of chemicals that includes cancer-causing compounds started rising in the 1960s and 1970s when oil sands development began. The researchers found elevated levels in a lake dozens of miles from the mines.

The Athabasca Chipewyan and Mikisew Cree First Nations commissioned Stéphane McLachlan an environmental scientist at the University of Manitoba to test the tissues of animals and in 2014 he released a report finding elevated levels of toxic pollutants—including arsenic mercury and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons—in the flesh of moose ducks and muskrats in the region. For the most part the study found community members were not exposed to levels high enough to affect their health but that was only because many people had stopped eating as much wild game as they had before out of fear that it was contaminated.

Although the study could not demonstrate that the cancers were caused by pollution from the mines the researchers found that cancer rates in the community were correlated with working in the mines and with consuming larger quantities of traditional foods particularly fish.

Provincial officials acknowledge that the mines’ waste ponds leak into groundwater. To “limit the risk” that this seepage will spread farther the Alberta Energy Regulator requires companies to install drains wells sumps and underground walls to capture and contain the contamination said Coldbeck the agency spokeswoman.

Both federal and provincial officials have disputed research that has linked groundwater contamination to the waste ponds citing other studies that indicate the compounds may be naturally occurring in groundwater because they are contained in bitumen.

But last year the Commission for Environmental Cooperation an environmental body created alongside the North American Free Trade Agreement assessed all the published studies of water contamination and concluded that there was “scientifically valid evidence” that the waste ponds were leaching contaminants into groundwater. The analysis noted that some research has concluded that the contamination reached the Athabasca River but that scientists were still debating the findings.

Asked about the report Coldbeck said her agency “does not have any evidence to suggest” that contaminated groundwater has reached the Athabasca River. In response to a question about health concerns she said that the agency “is committed to ensuring that Alberta’s oil sands are developed in a safe and responsible manner” and referred questions to Alberta Health the province’s public health agency.

A spokesperson for Alberta Health did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers declined to comment for this article pointing instead to reports the group has issued on its engagement with Indigenous communities and on greenhouse gas emissions.

Meanwhile surveys of cancer cases in Fort Chipewyan carried out in 2009 and 2014 came up with mixed results. Both showed higher than normal rates of certain cancers including biliary tract cancers. One study determined that overall cancer rates were elevated. The other did not.

The most recent case of the bile duct cancer was diagnosed in 2017 when Rigney’s nephew fell ill. Warren Simpson battled the illness for two years but died in November 2019.

Rigney blames the oil development for her nephew’s death and all the others even as she acknowledges that there’s nothing to prove the connection. The way she views it Simpson was just the latest piece of her life that industrial development took from her.

“The delta was such a vibrant place” she said. “And they took it all away I mean all.” She added “What else is there to take?”

‘My Heart Is in the Boreal Forest’

The global oil industry is increasingly under assault and Canada’s tar sands because of the developments’ high greenhouse gas emissions are a prime target of climate activists. Because new tar sands projects require billions of dollars invested up front many financial analysts say the era of opening new mines is over.

But even if production from the mines holds steady or declines gradually their massive footprints are likely to expand for decades because companies must continue to clear land to keep up production. For the people living here it matters little whether land is destroyed by a new mine or an existing one.

When the mines do begin to decline at some point in the future the industry will face the challenge of what to do with the waste it has produced and how to pay for cleaning it up. The provincial government has secured $730 million from companies as collateral for a clean-up but that would hardly even begin to cover the costs. While regulators’ official estimate of the current liability for Alberta’s mining industry is $27 billion an internal report obtained in 2018 by Canadian journalists estimated clean-up costs of more than $100 billion. While that figure includes coal mines they account for only a fraction of the costs.

Over the years the people of Fort McKay have discussed moving the entire community to their reserve at Moose Lake about 40 miles northwest to get away from the development—Alberta’s government recently agreed to restrict but not prohibit deep-extraction tar sands sites within a 6-mile buffer around the lake. But for now it seems Fort McKay will remain where it is.

L’Hommecourt said she is torn about whether she will remain here. “My heart is in the boreal forest” she said.

But her kids want to move away and if they do she might too. The mines are coming closer to the cabin more roads are getting blocked off.

Regulatory filings show that Imperial Oil plans eventually to reroute the creek that runs past her cabin to make way for its Kearl mine. If it did so the land where the cabin sits would be buried by land cleared from elsewhere within the mine. A spokeswoman for Imperial Exxon’s Canadian affiliate declined to comment specifically on the filings but said the company “has collaborative and unique relationship agreements with these local communities that provide mutual benefits.”

The cabin itself has been a symbol of L’Hommecourt’s resistance. It sits on an old trappers’ trail that Imperial’s workers began using about 10 years ago as an unpaved access road for exploration marking it off with a “No Trespassing” sign. L’Hommecourt built her cabin in the middle of that road.

“I just said ‘I don’t care’” L’Hommecourt said. “I’m gonna put my house right here and this is where it’s going to be.” When company workers come by she said “I just tell them ‘turn around and go back and if you have a problem with it get your VP or whoever it is that you report to and then tell them to come and see me.”

So far no one has shown up.

Austin-based construction technology company ICON said they are working with Miami-based home builder Lennar to build 100 homes in the Austin area.

The project scheduled to break ground in 2022 will feature single-story homes with varying floor plans designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group.

According to Melodie Yashar Director of Design and Building Performance at ICON the wall system in each home will be built using the company’s proprietary cementitious-based material called ""Lavacrete."" The material is stronger and longer-lasting than traditional building materials and it allows the homes to withstand extreme weather.

Once the first floor walls are printed using ICON’s Vulcan construction system roofs are added and Lennar builders finish out the homes using traditional construction methods. The roof of each home will feature solar panels.

The construction system can create homes and structures up to 3000 square feet that are built to the International Building Code structural code standard and expected to last as long or longer than standard Concrete Masonry Unit built homes ICON representatives said.

“Additive manufacturing has the potential to revolutionize the built environment as it gets adopted by the industry at scale” Martin Voelkle Partner at the Bjarke Ingels Group said. “By partnering with ICON and Lennar we are able to see this new technology roll out to the widest possible audience. The 3D-printed architecture and the photovoltaic roofs are innovations that are significant steps towards reducing waste in the construction process as well as towards making our homes more resilient sustainable and energy self-sufficient.”

Construction using the Vulcan system is estimated to take about a week to 3D print the walls of each home and ICON plans to have a fleet of five printers delivering the 100-home community starting in 2022 Yashar said.

According to ICON representatives the 3D printing technology produces energy-efficient homes faster than conventional construction methods with less waste and more design freedom allowing the projects to stay on schedule and on budget.

ICON

LENx an arm of Lennar working to disrupt the homebuilding industry through innovation designed and engineered for the fast and precise 3D printing of numerous homes.

“Labor and material shortages are two of the biggest factors pushing the dream of home ownership out of reach for many American families” Eric Feder President of LENx said. “Lennar has always expanded the boundaries of technological innovation to keep quality homes affordable and 3D printing is an immensely encouraging approach. We are excited to collaborate with ICON to develop solutions to emerging challenges in the coming years.”

According to ICON representatives the neighborhood will be the largest of its kind in the world.

“ICON exists as a response to the global housing crisis and to put our technology in service to the world” ICON co-founder and CEO Jason Ballard said. “Construction-scale 3D printing not only delivers higher-quality homes faster and more affordably but fleets of printers can change the way that entire communities are built for the better. The United States faces a deficit of approximately 5 million new homes so there is a profound need to swiftly increase supply without compromising quality beauty or sustainability and that is exactly the strength of our technology.""

Pricing and move-in dates will be made available in 2022.

This isn't the first time 3D-printed buildings made headlines in Texas. Earlier this year the Texas Military Department unveiled a similar 3D-printed structure in Bastrop.

The military barracks at the Camp Swift Training Center are more than 3800-square-feet and is used to train up to 72 soldiers and airmen.

""Texas has become a technological center of gravity within the nation"" Maj. Gen. Tracy Norris Adjutant General of Texas said. ""TMD is proud to be a conduit for introducing these innovative solutions into the military community.""

The Texas Military Department partnered with ICON and Logan Architecture to 3D print the barracks.

Icon

ICON also built a multi-home project in East Austin with developer 3Strands marking the first 3D-printed homes for sale in America.

The company has prototyped structures with the Defense Innovation Unit and United States Marine Corps 3D-printed a community of 500 square foot homes in Tabasco Mexico for local families experiencing extreme poverty and built the Chicon House the first permitted 3D-printed home in the United States.

Other developers across the country are working on similar projects. Several such 3D-printed zero-net energy neighborhoods are being built in Southern California by Palari Group a sustainable real estate developer based in Beverly Hills.

Palari Group is building 15 eco-friendly 3D-printed homes on a five-acre parcel of land in Rancho Mirage an upscale community in the Coachella Valley. The developer is also building 77 eco-friendly homes on a 23-acre parcel of land in Desert Hot Springs near Palm Springs.

According to the Palari Group website the California developer also has plans to build 3D-printed neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley Central Coast and Napa Valley.

As for ICON the construction company has its sights set on using its 3D printing technology far beyond the state of Texas.

The company has already begun what it calls ""off-world construction."" ICON has 3D-printed a prototype rocket landing pad for NASA as well as a surface habitat at NASA's Johnson Space Center to prepare for long-duration missions to Mars.

The company's current program with the Bjarke Ingels Group and NASA called Project Olympus aims to develop an autonomous additive construction system for further exploration of the Moon and imagine humanity's first home on another world ICON said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZGFsbGFzZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9vdmVyLTEwMC1ob21lcy10by1iZS1idWlsdC11c2luZy0zZC1wcmludGluZy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Over 100 Homes to Be Built Using 3D Printing Technology,"Next year the Austin-based construction technology company ICON will build 100 single-story 3D printed homes using advanced technology and new game-changing building material.

ICON has teamed up with Lennar a national home builder. Together they have developed a plan using 3D printing and a revolutionary material that will increase the longevity of homes while increasing sustainability.

The revolutionary material is Lavacrete a cement-based material with a stronger bond that resists shrinking and can withstand extreme weather. ICON and Lennar will utilize the material to build the homes’ walls producing them via a 3D printer.

“By partnering with ICON and Lennar we are able to see this new technology roll out to the widest possible audience. The 3D-printed architecture and the photovoltaic roofs are innovations that are significant steps towards reducing waste in the construction process as well as towards making our homes more resilient sustainable and energy self-sufficient” Martin Voelkle a partner at the Bjarke Ingels Group shared with NBC DFW.

Lennar hopes to make more affordable homes for homebuyers utilizing the technology given the current housing landscape that has skyrocketed. A shortage of materials and increased costs have also been issues since the pandemic started.

“ICON exists as a response to the global housing crisis and to put our technology in service to the world” ICON co-founder and CEO Jason Ballard said.

A project of this scale will be the first nationwide with plans to break ground in 2022. The single-story homes will include roofs with solar panels and will have a variety of floor plans.

“Construction-scale 3D printing not only delivers higher-quality homes faster and more affordably but fleets of printers can change the way that entire communities are built for the better. The United States faces a deficit of approximately 5 million new homes so there is a profound need to swiftly increase supply without compromising quality beauty or sustainability and that is exactly the strength of our technology.” Ballard added.",,,,,,,,,

Next week The Beatles Get Back hits Disney Plus. The new three-part documentary series retells the story of the 1970 film Let It Be which showed the band falling apart during its final recording sessions. Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson has edited the footage to tell a more ""faithful"" story and during promotion for the series Paul McCartney reminisced about the Fab Four's understanding of their fans.

All four members of the band - McCartney John Lennon George Harrison and Ringo Starr - came from working-class backgrounds in Liverpool. Although the band went on to become multimillionaires McCartney explained that he always felt the group were for the ""working people"". Speaking about the rooftop gig which occurred on Apple Corps' roof on January 30 1969 McCartney hit out at those who weren't appreciative of his music. He said: ""There’s always the guy in the bowler hat who hates what you’re doing. He’s never going to like it and he thinks you’re offending his sensibilities.""

McCartney went on: ""And occasionally you would get the kind of snob who would get angry. In a way that was part of the fun."" The 79-year-old went on to explain that the band were never writing music for ""the establishment"" but for the people. He said: ""But you’ve got to remember as we always did there’s the people who work for that guy. There’s the young secretaries the young guys in the office or the tradesmen or the cleaners. Those are the people who like us. ""Also a lot of the bosses too. We always knew that there’s the establishment then there’s the working people.""

For a while I've been wondering how Sleep Token's anonymous dark magician shtick would translate to the stage. Their albums and music videos follow a strict aesthetic that demands your attention and incites analysis. Live somehow the band have crafted something entirely different: a show that is pensive personal and moving.

Like a dark messiah Vessel - the band’s masked singer - floated onto stage with hands aloft to the sound of his followers screaming his name. He was joined by a pair of black-robed choir singers stoic and immovable throughout the entire performance. Vessel cooed the first piano-led half of Atlantic to screams that outweighed his voice. His guitarists soon crawled onto stage like demons to complete the band's set-up and finish out the song with power immeasurable. Without skipping a beat the sect launched into Hypnosis one of their heaviest tracks. Through it Sleep Token proved they have the musicianship skill and presence to be a pure metal band if it ever took their fancy.

But it was some of the band’s more emotional and enchanting tracks that really blew the roof off the make-shift place of worship. Fall For Me in particular was an absolute jaw-dropper. I recently deemed it the worst song on the album but I will happily eat my words. I was wrong. The band brought on a quartet of interpretive dancers to illustrate the alluring and mystical message of the song to Vessel's beautifully harrowing voice. It made me look at the piece as a more performative vulnerable instance in one's most dire moments. This notion was felt in Shepherd's Bush as there wasn't a dry eye in the house. A truly special moment for the band to be sure.

Just before that The Love You Want gave Vessel the opportunity to explore his stunning and unwavering vocal performance. Few singers sound pitch-perfect live but the macabre maestro was absolutely divine. As if you were listening to the album; completely effortless. Vessel spent much of his time exploring his own personal performing space hands flittering between nervous delight and anxious responsibility to the thousands in front of him. But he looked the most at ease when he approached the edge of the stage prompting his disciples’ hands to rise up in an effort to touch their newfound leader.

Weeknights on CBS

NASA and Lockheed Martin unveiled the x59 an experimental jet that would reduce the sound of a sonic boom. The hope is this will lead to a new era of commercial supersonic travel. Barry Petersen reports. Air Date: Nov 21 2021",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vcGVudGFnb24vMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9oZXJlcy10aGUtdGhyZWUtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlbGVjdGVkLXRvLWRlc2lnbi1oeXBlcnNvbmljLW1pc3NpbGUtaW50ZXJjZXB0b3JzLWZvci1tZGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the three companies selected to design hypersonic missile interceptors for MDA,"WASHINGTON — The Missile Defense Agency has chosen Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Missiles and Defense to design the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) for regional hypersonic missile defense the agency announced Nov. 19.

The agency awarded other transactional agreements for an “accelerated concept design” phase of the program according to the statement.

The interceptors are intended to counter a hypersonic weapon during its glide phase of flight a challenge as the missiles can travel more than five times the speed of sound and can maneuver making it hard to predict a missile’s trajectory.

The interceptors will be designed to fit into the U.S. Navy’s current Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense destroyers. It will be fired from its standard Vertical Launch System and integrated with the modified Baseline 9 Aegis Weapon System that detects tracks controls and engages hypersonic threats the statement notes.

“We are pleased to have these contractors working with us to develop design concepts for the GPI” Rear Adm. Tom Druggan MDA’s Sea-based Weapon Systems program executive said in the statement. “Multiple awards allow us to execute a risk reduction phase to explore industry concepts and maximize the benefits of a competitive environment to demonstrate the most effective and reliable Glide Phase Interceptor for regional hypersonic defense as soon as possible.”

The initial development phase “will focus on reducing technical risk rapidly developing technology and demonstrating the ability to intercept a hypersonic threat” according to a Nov. 19 Raytheon statement.

“Raytheon Technologies systems are the cornerstone of today’s ballistic missile defenses. We’re building on that knowledge to advance the missile defense system for future threats” Tay Fitzgerald Raytheon’s vice president of strategic missile defense said in the statement. “GPI’s speed ability to withstand extreme heat and maneuverability will make it the first missile designed to engage this advanced threat.”

All three companies have experience in hypersonic weapons development.

Both Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are also competitively developing scramjet-powered hypersonic missiles as part of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program run by the Air Force and DARPA.

And Lockheed is the lead systems integrator for what will be the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike offensive hypersonic missile and the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon. Northrop Grumman designed the motor for both weapons.

Lockheed is also developing the Air Force’s hypersonic AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon.

Northrop began a push to develop hypersonic missile capability in 2019 when the Pentagon made hypersonic capability a priority and Lockheed Martin broke ground on a new facility in Alabama that same year geared toward developing testing and producing hypersonic weapons.

The Missile Defense Agency hit the pause button on its effort in the summer of 2020 to bring a defensive hypersonic weapon online. But MDA took steps this year to move forward again and received feedback from industry confirming a glide phase interceptor is something that can be done “and we shouldn’t be afraid to go do it” Vice Adm. Jon Hill MDA director told Defense News earlier this year.

Just a year ago MDA had a different answer on where it was going with hypersonic defense focusing on solutions under development in the science and technology phase Hill said.

But after taking a step back and assessing the U.S. ballistic missile defense capability the agency realized it already had some means to tackle hypersonic weapons using sea-based assets like a Navy Carrier Strike Group with the ability to engage high-speed maneuvering threats during the terminal phase of flight.

The Aegis ship which boasts launch-on-remote weaponry is capable of seeing hypersonic weapons in the battlespace because “remember they’re not very high” Hill said. “They are around 70 kilometers.”

Future efforts already scheduled to come online are systems like the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) a satellite that will be placed in low-earth orbit to spot hypersonic missiles in flight and the SPY-6 radar will further increase the ability to track hypersonic threats Hill added.

The agency decided it would make the most sense to focus on taking out hypersonic weapons in the glide phase of flight where they are most vulnerable Hill said.

MDA then assessed current and possible capability and concepts to be able to detect track and intercept a hypersonic weapon in that glide phase.

The agency also studied data from adversaries’ systems. “Our adversaries are constantly flying these things and we are collecting that data with the existing sensor architecture” Hill said. “We were pulling that data down and we could run it through our high fidelity systems models.”

Taking that data MDA asked “What sort of material do we need on the seekers? What sort of divert capability do we need? Do we use a fragmentation warhead or do we want to do hit-to-kill in the glide phase because it’s a different battle? It’s a different environment” Hill said.

MDA has discovered it can use the existing booster stacks and can focus on developing a front end for an interceptor Hill said. What’s missing now is the weapon he noted.

Armed with the new strategy the agency came out with a solicitation to industry asking for white papers on solutions for its GPI in April.

While the MDA is still doing risk reduction for more exquisite capabilities to be brought online later Hill said “from a regional perspective we can go after this now.”

The agency will first focus on providing a capability to the Navy. “If this is successful” Hill said “we can move it to the land-based battery to protect other things against that sort of hypersonic threat.”

NAVSEA press release

The future USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul is the 11th Freedom-variant LCS designed by the Lockheed Martin-led industry team at Fincantieri Marinette Marine Marinette Wisconsin. Delivery marks the official transfer of the ship from the shipbuilder part of a Lockheed-Martin-led team to the Navy.

“Today marks a significant shipbuilding milestone in the life of the future USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul an exceptional ship which will conduct operations around the globe” said LCS program manager Capt. Mike Taylor. “I look forward to seeing Minneapolis-Saint Paul join her sister ships with 100 percent of propulsion power available for unrestricted use.”

LCS 21 was accepted after rigorous testing of a combining gear modification that will allow for unrestricted operations addressing a class-wide flaw that was discovered as the Fleet deployed these ships in greater numbers. LCS 21 is the first Freedom-variant ship to receive the fix.

The future USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul is the second naval ship to honor Minnesota’s Twin Cities although each city has been honored twice before. The first US Navy warship named Minneapolis-Saint Paul was a Los Angeles-class submarine launched in 1983 who took part in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul (SSN 708) was the first submarine to carry Tomahawk missiles specifically designed for use in strikes against Iraq during the Gulf War. Having served for over two decades with distinction the submarine Minneapolis-Saint Paul was decommissioned in 2007.

Several more Freedom variant ships are under construction at Fincantieri Marinette Marine Corp. in Marinette Wisconsin. Pending successful at-sea testing of its combining gear modification Cooperstown (LCS 23) is planned to deliver in January 2022. Additional ships in various stages of construction include Marinette (LCS 25) Nantucket (LCS 27) Beloit (LCS 29) and Cleveland (LCS 31).

Press Release Tucson 19 November 2021: Raytheon Missiles & Defense a Raytheon Technologies business has been selected by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) as one of the companies to develop and test the first interceptor specifically designed to defeat hypersonic threats. The weapon called Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) will defeat a new generation of hypersonic missiles – weapons that travel more than five times the speed of sound and manoeuvre rapidly in flight.

“Raytheon Technologies systems are the cornerstone of today’s ballistic missile defences. We’re building on that knowledge to advance the missile defence system for future threats” said Tay Fitzgerald vice president of Strategic Missile Defense. “GPI’s speed ability to withstand extreme heat and manoeuvrability will make it the first missile designed to engage this advanced threat.”

GPI will intercept hypersonic weapons in the glide phase of flight which occurs once a missile has re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and is manoeuvring toward its target. The initial development phase will focus on reducing technical risk rapidly developing technology and demonstrating the ability to intercept a hypersonic threat. Developed on behalf of the MDA GPI will be integrated into the US Navy’s Aegis Weapon System a ship- and shore-based defence system.

Raytheon Technologies’ missile defence portfolio combines sensors interceptors and command and control networks to track and defeat a wide range of threats. Today the company is responsible for portions of nearly every air and missile defence system deployed by the US and its allies. By evolving its missile interceptors directed energy and cyber technologies Raytheon Technologies is advancing counter-hypersonic solutions.

NEDERLAND Texas — Members of the Nederland community gathered to support a 12-year-old boy who is currently recovering after battling a rare coronavirus-related disease.

Dre Lowe was diagnosed with MIS-C earlier this year and fought for his life at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston for two weeks. At one point Lowe was in a coma.

Lowe was released from Texas Children's on Tuesday Oct. 5 2021. On Saturday Lowe’s family and friends gathered to support him in his recovery process.

Those in attendance said Lowe seemed to have fun and even met a boy named Jayden who was also diagnosed with MIS-C this year. Lowe’s mom Missy Lowe said they have been through a great deal recently but she appreciated all the love.

“Everybody I'm sorry has come together” Missy Lowe said. “People that you wouldn't think would come together. This town has come together for us and I'm so thankful. I'm just so thankful for it.”

Lowe’s story has reached other families sorting through the same symptoms after their children were diagnosed with COVID-19.

Lowe is one of the two Southeast Texas boys who battled the disease.

Missy Lowe said before her son's diagnosis he complained about aches and pains. When she noticed his face turning blue she rushed him to Christus St. Elizabeth Hospital in Beaumont.

Lowe who is fully vaccinated was tested for COVID-19 at St. Elizabeth but all of those tests came back negative. Doctors did not know what was wrong with him and he was eventually transferred to Texas Children's Hospital.

""Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed including the heart lungs kidneys brain skin eyes or gastrointestinal organs according to the CDC.

The CDC says you should contact your child’s doctor nurse or clinic right away if your child is showing symptoms of MIS-C:

Ongoing fever PLUS more than one of the following: Stomach pain Bloodshot eyes Diarrhea Dizziness or lightheadedness (signs of low blood pressure) Skin rash Vomiting



Be aware that not all children will have all the same symptoms.

The CDC also says that if someone is showing any of these signs seek emergency medical care immediately:

Trouble breathing

Persistent pain or pressure in the chest

New confusion

Inability to wake or stay awake

Pale gray or blue-colored skin lips or nail beds depending on skin tone"

You can find more blogs here .

It is not unusual for CBC News to get complaints about our stories. We publish and broadcast hundreds of stories across the country each day on every conceivable topic.

As I've written before  we hold ourselves accountable to some of the highest journalistic standards in the industry ( read them here ) regularly answer public concerns about our journalism and transparently correct errors . Our journalism is subject to review by an independent ombudsman who publishes his findings here .

Despite these safeguards we do hear from people who have concerns about what they've read watched or listened to on any given day.

What is unusual is to receive dozens of complaints about a story before a single word of it has gone to air or online.

Such was the case with an investigation into the WE Charity by our flagship investigative journalism program The Fifth Estate. It aired Thursday.

Letters and inquiries

For the past several months as our journalists conducted research and interviews we received more than 30 letters of complaint with multiple signatures from WE Charity donors who expressed concerns about our journalism questioned the integrity of our reporters and urged us not to publish or go to air with the story.

They wrote to our journalists to the leaders of The Fifth Estate to me to the president of the CBC.

Now that the Fifth Estate investigation has aired and the feature has been published to our website we want to share a bit of the story behind the story. We believe there's value in explaining how news gets made and the obstacles journalists sometimes face when trying to get important information to the public.

First some background.

Marc Kielburger left and Craig Kielburger right are seen appearing before a House of Commons committee via videoconference in July of last year. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)

In 2020 the federal government announced WE Charity would administer the Canada Student Service Grant a financial aid program meant to give post-secondary students who couldn't find summer jobs a chance to earn money while volunteering in ""national service"" activities. Controversy erupted over the sole-source contract and the fact Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and then-Finance Minister Bill Morneau had not recused themselves from cabinet discussions about the contract despite family ties to the charity which had been founded 25 years earlier by brothers Marc and Craig Kielburger.

(Trudeau was later cleared of wrongdoing in the affair by the federal ethics commissioner while Morneau was found to have breached the Conflict of Interest Act.)

Investigations by two parliamentary committees commenced. In testimony before one of them WE Charity donor Reed Cowan told the ethics committee that he had raised funds for a school to be built in Kenya in memory of Wesley his deceased four-year-old son. He later learned that a donation plaque on the school bearing Wesley's name had been removed and replaced with the name of another donor. Cowan told the committee he wondered if more than one WE donor had been told they had funded the construction of the very same school. WE Charity said the replacement of the plaque was a mistake.

Our Fifth Estate journalists wondered if there were other donors like Cowan who had been told they had funded the same school. If so how many schools were built? The Fifth Estate team began to investigate.

Then came the letters to CBC.

First there was a letter in mid-September signed by more than 70 major WE donors including Canadian Football League legend Mike ""Pinball"" Clemons Chip Wilson the founder of Lululemon Athletica and former prime minister Kim Campbell. A version of this letter was published Saturday as a full-page ad in some national newspapers.

""The Fifth Estate has repeatedly reached out to many of us and/or to members of our organizations over the last few months"" the letter stated. ""We do not agree with their thesis that we as donors were misled about the projects in Kenya. We do not see any public interest in this kind of journalism.""

Public interest

However our journalists felt that the public interest case was solid. Charitable status gives organizations credibility income tax exemptions and other benefits. Donors big and small taxpayers and the government expect transparency. Why wouldn't we examine the workings of WE?

Our team responded to the concerned donors and assured them their views — and WE Charity's answers to our questions — would be included in the final story. Our team also asked many of these donors to share with us their donation agreements with WE so we could see what was promised in return for their money.

None did.

Meanwhile our Fifth Estate crew visited Kenya to find answers for other donors who told us they believed their money had been used to construct new buildings but were no longer confident that had happened.

For the record WE denies misleading donors and says that donors knew their funds were being pooled for such things as teacher accommodations and training administration spaces libraries and student lunches.

We built a database to track the number of schools donors had been told they had funded then went into Kenyan villages to count how many schools were actually built.

While WE Charity had earlier told Parliament it had built 360 schools in Kenya a WE charity official on the ground told us the 360 figure was a mistake because it didn't include renovated buildings high schools and other structures. The correct number was 852 schools we were told.

While in Kenya the team interviewed the governor of Narok County Samuel Tunai a WE supporter who has lauded the charity for changing the "" landscape and lives "" of the people he governs. Tunai greeted our team with his own camera crew and recorded our interview. Within hours a WE Charity lawyer based in Toronto wrote to The Fifth Estate quoting part of the Tunai interview stating ""It is clear that CBC has been presenting as 'fact' inaccurate information.""

Next the CBC received a letter from Kenya's Ministry of the Interior with allegations that our reporters had engaged in criminal activity including a claim of trespassing on government property. For some reason the letter was copied to the WE College in Kenya.

Incoming criticism before reporting was done

Over the next two months more than 30 letters were sent by groups or individuals all taking issue with a story we had not yet reported. Many were from educators and charitable foundations.

Some of the letters accused our journalists of bias unprofessionalism and self-interest. The letters were sent to managers at all levels of the CBC.

Others threatened to sue. One letter from a family foundation warned us that if The Fifth Estate reported a story that didn't match their views of WE Charity ""there will be peripheral damage"" to the foundation's reputation. ""I am aware that other donors are organizing funding for a defamation lawsuit against the Fifth Estate if the network [CBC] proceeds to misrepresent WE Charity"" the letter noted.

Many of the letters followed a similar pattern. The authors spoke of positive experiences donors had with the charity including trips they'd taken to Kenya. They said their money was being used for good and asked that CBC stop asking questions about how many schools were built.

""There is a very loud voice of support emerging from all those who have witnessed the worth of the WE organization and CBC would be well advised to listen and discern and consider changing this present course of reporting"" said one typical letter.

The similarity among the letters suggested to us a co-ordinated campaign. At the bottom of one long email sent to the CBC from a high-profile donor was an attached email titled ""draft for consideration."" The donor later told us he had shared the email with Craig Kielburger to ensure accuracy before sending it to us.",,,,,,,,,

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvdHJ1bXAtaXJzLWNoaWNhZ28tYXVkaXQtMDAxNTc0ODDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump may face a $100M-plus tax bill if he loses IRS audit fight over Chicago tower according to report,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/11/trump-irs-chicago-audit-00157480 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvdHJ1bXAtaXJzLWNoaWNhZ28tYXVkaXQtMDAxNTc0ODDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Michael Jordan card could fetch $5M at auction: Ken Goldin reveals '100 best collectibles',"Goldin Auction’s second annual Goldin 100 event displays the rarest and most valuable collectibles of the year.

The 2024 roundup does not disappoint with a variety of pop culture items and sports memorabilia including a one-of-a-kind signed Michael Jordan 2003 ultimate collection card.

The card is currently valued at $2 million but Goldin Auctions CEO and founder Ken Goldin told FOX Business in an on-camera interview that he thinks it could sell for much more than that.

""It probably will sell for between $3 million and $5 million"" he said. ""I think [it’s] the best-ever Michael Jordan card.""

Any offer over $2.7 million will be a record sale for a Michael Jordan card according to Goldin.

""[The jersey] was worn during the night he tore his Achilles"" he said. ""And with a torn Achilles he went to the free throw line and sunk two free throws before leaving the game.""

While the Bryant jersey has a current bid of $1 million Goldin predicted that it could sell for more than $3 million.

The auction also features a 1957 Mickey Mantle game-used jersey that Goldin expects to be a seven-figure item — along with a pair of Michael Jordan’s shoes that the star wore during the Aug. 1985 game when he shattered a backboard.

""The glass collapsed down and [the shoe] actually has a piece of glass in it"" Goldin said. ""It’s the only time Michael Jordan ever broke a backboard in his pro career.""

Among the items in other categories Goldin is auctioning off a highest-grade copy of the first-ever issue of Playboy Magazine featuring Marilyn Monroe on the cover and a rare copy of a Superman No. 1 DC comic book from 1939.

This is all fueled by PLFs and Imax screens which are delivering 44% of the weekend’s till. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits showed that 43% of the moviegoers bought tickets because they love the franchise natch.

We’ll see if a Cannes Premiere this week can lift Furiosa past its current $40M-$50M projection but word of mouth is excellent out of early screenings for the George Miller directed Mad Max: Fury Road prequel. Unlike Disney with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny last Cannes a movie that wasn’t ready for primetime Warners is truly in pole position here to blast Furiosa off.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes posted a very good Friday of $22.2M thanks to late night business which isn’t that far from the first Friday results of Tim Burton’s 2001 version ($24.6M) and ahead of Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M) and pennies lighter than War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M). However the Wes Ball directed version of the 56-year old franchise gets a B Cinemascore and 3 1/2 stars/77% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak so hopefully these apes don’t lose their muscle. On a whole 85% of the CinemaScore audience gave Kingdom an A or a B. That’s one of the lowest grades for an Apes movie in the millennium down there with Burton’s which got a B-. Rotten Tomatoes’ audience score has eased to 79%. Still good on Disney for getting this movie opened their first try with the franchise post 20th Century Fox. Despite the audience exits there’s confidence at Disney for the sequel to arrive at the higher end of its projections due to its better-than-expected Friday.

Social media monitor RelishMix detected mixed to positive word of mouth before Kingdom‘s opening. That said on the bright side: “Fans anticipating the sequel seem excited primarily because of one thing — sheer love for the past three films. ‘This looks freaking incredible. I gotta rewatch all the previous ones before this comes out. These movies are so cool.’ The quality of the past films is driving immense interest in this one” ‘This is one of the best franchises ever made. Every movie was awesome. A near-perfect trilogy. I was not expecting a fourth installment but man this looks great!’ Whatever direction the Apes franchise goes next it looks like fans will follow.”

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes saw 64% men turnout with 18-34 year olds repping 57% of the audience with the 25-34 year old segment being the biggest demo at close to a third. Solid diversity demos in 35% Caucasian 27% Latino and Hispanic 22% Black and 9% Asian. Those moviegoers going bananas for this sequel were in the South South Central and West. AMC Burbank is currently the highest grossing theater in the nation with $67K.

The social media universe for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stands at 331.6M followers across TikTok Facebook X YouTube and Instagram. Compared to other action sci-fi comps Kingdom‘s smu runs 24% above genre norms but below recent pics such as Dune: Part Two (575.7M) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (508.8M) and even Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (393M).

Ryan Gosling in ‘The Fall Guy’ Universal Pictures

Universal’s second weekend of Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s Fall Guy is eyeing $14.4M -48% a very good hold. The second weekend is better than Lost City‘s -51% but a little lighter as that Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum film posted $14.7M. The pic’s slither out of the gate had more to do with the marketplace and the insider type of movie that it was and less about stars — it was Gosling’s third highest opening of his career. Some were even put off by the mixed genres. “It’s a problem when you’re pushing a romantic comedy and a majority of men show up” sniped one rival studio source.

Elsewhere there’s Briarcliff Entertainment’s comedy satire Not Another Church Movie booked at 1108 theaters which had no P&A spend and is resulting in $120K Friday and a $300K 3-day. Critics didn’t think it was funny at 17% on RT nor did moviegoers at 44%. Johnny Mack wrote and directed the movie which stars Mickey Rouke as the Devil Jamie Foxx as God and Kevin Daniels as Taylor Pharry.

Overall weekend stands at $93.8M which is 27% ahead of last weekend but 7% off from the same frame in May a year ago when the second weekend of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delivered $62M.

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles."

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy gave the longest House floor speech in US history on Thursday night and Friday morning – an 8-hour 32-minute address that delayed the passage of a $1.9 trillion Democratic bill to expand the social safety net and fight the climate crisis.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning. It now awaits consideration in the Senate.

McCarthy’s speech contained far too many claims for us to try to check all of them; he talked about everything from the war in Afghanistan to the menu at McDonald’s. But here is a look at some of the claims that were inaccurate or lacking key context.

Democrats and Iron Dome funding

McCarthy mentioned Israel’s Iron Dome aerial defense system then told a Democrat that “your party actually defunded that.”

Facts First: This is false. Democrats did not defund Iron Dome; in September the Democratic-controlled House approved $1 billion in funding for Iron Dome in an overwhelming and bipartisan 420-9 vote. (Among Democrats the vote was 210 in favor 8 opposed 2 voting “present.”) The Democratic-controlled Senate is also planning to approve the Iron Dome funding. In October a Democratic effort to get the Senate to rapidly approve the funding was derailed by a Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky who objected to how the US government planned to pay for this spending.

Because of opposition from some lawmakers on the left of the Democratic caucus House Democrats took the Iron Dome funding package out of a September bill that needed to pass to prevent a government shutdown. But Democrats then passed the Iron Dome funding in a separate bill the same week. That just does not qualify as “defunding.”

“I understand that we are in a particularly partisan season but that’s not an accurate or fair characterization” by McCarthy said Bradley Bowman a former adviser to Republican senators who is now senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the pro-Israel Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Bowman criticized the stances of the left-wing Democrats who opposed the funding but he emphasized that “their views are nowhere near a controlling majority in the House of Representatives or the Democratic party.”

McCarthy’s office didn’t respond to our request for comment for this article.

Democrats and energy

Blaming Democrats for high gas prices McCarthy claimed that they “banned oil and gas.” Moments later he narrowed his claim to make it “They banned drilling for oil and gas.”

Facts First: Neither of these claims is true. It’s obviously not true that Democrats completely banned oil and gas. And the narrower claim that Democrats “banned drilling for oil and gas” would have been a major exaggeration even in the weeks after Biden signed a January executive order to put a pause on new oil and gas leases (not to ban all oil and gas activity) on public lands and offshore waters (not on all land in the country). The claim is even less correct now:

Biden’s January executive order directed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands and offshore waters “to the extent consistent with applicable law” until the completion of a review of federal leasing policy. As the Interior Department emphasized at the time this order did not affect existing oil and gas leases; US oil and gas drilling was never banned and never stopped. (The Energy Information Administration has predicted that US production of natural gas for 2021 will set a new record.)

Then in June a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Biden moratorium on new leases. While the administration has appealed the decision it has said its hands are tied for now – and on Wednesday it opened 80.9 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to auction for drilling proceeding with a move initially planned by the Trump administration. (The auction resulted in 1.7 million of the 80.9 million acres actually being leased.)

We won’t go deep here on McCarthy’s effort to blame Biden for high gas prices. As we’ve written before prices at the pumps are driven by a complex array of global economic factors not by the policies of any single president.

Pipelines and jobs

McCarthy repeatedly attacked Biden for his January decision to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have carried oil from Canada into the US. (The company behind the pipeline then announced in June that it was terminating the project.)

At one point McCarthy said that Biden’s Keystone decision resulted in “thousands” of blue-collar workers losing their jobs. But at another point he claimed that there are “more than one million people who lost their job after President Biden was sworn in because he shut down a pipeline” – here McCarthy didn’t name the pipeline – while “allowing” Russia to increase production.

Facts First: McCarthy’s “more than one million people” claim is false. There is simply no Biden pipeline decision that resulted in a million job losses; construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was expected to involve thousands of people in 2021 not even close to one million. (Also overall job growth under Biden has averaged more than 600000 jobs per month.)

It’s not clear what McCarthy was even talking about here and McCarthy’s office didn’t respond to a request for an explanation but we can still safely say the claim is inaccurate.

It’s possible that McCarthy was referring to a 2020 analysis that was done for the American Petroleum Institute which represents the interests of oil and gas companies. The analysis projected about a million job losses by 2022 if the government halted not only new oil and gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters but also new oil and gas development on lands and waters that had already been leased.

This analysis doesn’t tell us what happened in 2021 – Biden never actually put forward a ban on development – and again it was not an analysis about the impact of a pipeline shutdown.

Before Biden revoked the permit for Keystone XL the company behind the project announced in late 2020 that it anticipated that the pipeline would employ “more than 11000 Americans in 2021” mostly in construction. It’s not clear how many of these 11000 hypothetical people actually lost a job because of Biden’s 2021 cancellation of the permit rather than simply losing the opportunity to work on that particular project. In addition this was not long-term employment. Before its cancellation Keystone XL was expected to create just dozens of permanent positions.

Biden and the FBI

McCarthy said “Biden used the FBI to target parents as domestic terrorists. Can you imagine that? To use your own FBI. To go after parents calling them domestic terrorists. Without any evidence. Simply in aiming to silence their First Amendment rights. A whistleblower just confirmed it.”

Facts First: At very least this claim is missing key context. McCarthy was likely referring to the news that the FBI’s counterterrorism division had been involved in creating an internal “threat tag” the phrase “EDUOFFICIALS” to help FBI employees keep track of investigations and assessments related to threats of violence against school board officials teachers and staff. But McCarthy didn’t provide even minimal specifics much less mention that the internal tag is intended as an organizing method for cases related to people who have issued threats. And it was the National School Boards Association not the Biden administration that invoked “domestic terrorism” in the context of threats against education officials.

House Republicans have publicized an October joint memo from the FBI’s counterterrorism division and criminal investigative division – Republicans said it was received from a “whistleblower” – that explained the creation of the new threat tag. But nothing in the memo is evidence that any parent is being treated as a domestic terrorist simply for say criticizing school policy. (It’s certainly possible that the FBI will target some parent without good evidence; the “whistleblower” just did not provide evidence that this is currently happening.)

In a statement emailed to CNN the FBI said that “a tag is merely a statistical tool to track information for review and reporting” that tags are used to group various kinds of related cases that the counterterrorism division is involved in this issue because it shares responsibility with the criminal investigative division for handling violent threats and that “the FBI has never been in the business of investigating parents who speak out or policing speech at school board meetings and we are not going to start now.”

“We are fully committed to preserving and protecting First Amendment rights including freedom of speech” the FBI said. “The FBI’s focus is on violence and threats of violence that potentially violate federal law.”

This controversy erupted in September when the National School Boards Associations sent a letter to Biden in which it said that “acts of malice violence and threats against public school officials” could be classified as “the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes” and asked for a federal review that would include a look at whether there were “appropriate enforceable actions against these crimes” under various laws including “the PATRIOT Act in regards to domestic terrorism.” (The NSBA board has since apologized for language in the letter.)

A subsequent public statement from the Department of Justice vowing to take action on threats against educators was also criticized by many Republicans as evidence of federal overreach. But that statement unlike the NSBA letter did not mention domestic terrorism. Republicans have also noted that the NSBA was in communication with White House officials before sending the letter to Biden but they haven’t shown any indication to date that the White House was responsible for the NSBA’s inclusion of the phrase “domestic terrorism” or the reference to the Patriot Act.

Biden and separated families

McCarthy criticized the Biden administration for “considering paying illegal immigrants $450000 per family.” He said “You’re gonna reward people that came here illegally with $450000 from hardworking taxpayer Americans.”

Facts First: The Biden administration is not considering $450000 payments to every undocumented family or a large percentage of undocumented families as McCarthy’s broad wording would likely lead some listeners to believe. Rather in response to a series of lawsuits against the government – not as part of the bill the House passed – the Biden administration is considering compensation payments of a size that is not publicly known to families who were separated at the US-Mexico border under the Trump administration’s controversial and ultimately abandoned “zero tolerance” policy.

It is not clear how many people might be eligible for compensation but the number is certainly a small fraction of the total US undocumented population that has been estimated at around 11 million. More than 3000 children were separated from their families under the Trump policy.

McCarthy didn’t invent the $450000 figure; the Wall Street Journal reported in late October that the Biden administration was considering payments of around $450000 per person to families that were separated. However the Biden administration has publicly contested the figure saying it is indeed considering a financial settlement but that the $450000 figure is too high.

Biden said in early November: “If in fact because of the outrageous behavior of the last administration you were coming across the border whether it was legal or illegal and you lost your child – you lost your child – it’s gone – you deserve some kind of compensation no matter what the circumstance. What that will be I have no idea. I have no idea.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Beverly Hills and the Westside

Avalon Hotel Beverly Hills a Member of Design Hotels

Beverly Hills is known as a posh destination within Los Angeles and it certainly lives up to that reputation. The Avalon Hotel Beverly Hills is located in a more residential area which is quiet and relaxed. We loved the midcentury design and historic-yet-modern vibe of this stylish hotel. Without being over the top the Avalon exudes LA style and the guests here reflect that. A well-heeled group the Avalon crowd is smartly groomed yet relaxed fun and surprisingly approachable.

Kimpton Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills

We love staying at a Kimpton Hotel Palomar because the design is always impeccable and the Kimpton Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills location is no exception. As guests enter the stylish lobby the hotel exudes a plush relaxing mood. With a boutique hotel approach the attentive Palomar staff somehow finds ways to make each guest feel special. The service here was so great we considered camping here all day instead of exploring all the cool restaurants shops and galleries nearby. This hotel is great for romantic getaways and those seeking a chic place to see and be seen.

Points redemption: From 60000 IHG Rewards Club points (rates from $314). Cardholders of the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card get the fourth night free on all award stays.

Fairmont Century Plaza

The landmark Century Plaza hotel is back this time as the Fairmont Century Plaza. The familiar curved facade remains this time replete with high-tech lighting effects at night. The favorite LA waystation of U.S. presidents and presidential candidates is now the centerpiece of a $2.5 billion mixed-use project. In its new iteration it regains its former glamour and then some.

Features we love include a stunning lobby spacious and elegantly appointed rooms and a huge spa. Located amid the Century City office tower complex that houses lawyers financial firms and talent agents this is a prime location for business travelers. Walkable Beverly Hills is next door and if you time it right the beach is a straight shot west (7 miles or so) on Santa Monica Boulevard.

Keep in mind this is one of the most expensive hotels in LA right now. With fees such as $75 to use the spa and $65 for valet parking this isn't our top suggestion for leisure travelers. But if you've got important business meetings lined up on the Westside it's the gold standard.

Booking details: Room rates at the Fairmont Century Plaza start at between $700 and $800 per night. We recommend logging in to your Accor Live Limitless account where you may be able to find member specials. We were able to get a room and daily breakfast for two for $715 per night. Taxes and fees will easily add an extra $100 per night to your tab. Note that if you are a non-elite ALL member you can earn 25 points per 10 euros ($11.65) spent at participating hotels and can redeem them in increments of 2000 for 40 euros ($46.60) off hotel charges.

Try Hollywood or Universal City

W Hollywood

If you're traveling to LA to be part of the action then the W Hollywood is an ideal place. Located right on Hollywood Boulevard along the Walk of Fame the W is hopping with sleekly dressed visitors from all over the world. The music is thumping the Instagram opportunities are plenty and the vibe is Hollywood chic. The rooftop pool and bar is a well-known hot spot for both visitors and locals day or night. You may even catch a celebrity sighting or two.

Points redemption: Marriott Bonvoy Category 6 from 50000 points per night on standard dates (rates from $273). While Marriott is eliminating its award chart in favor of dynamic pricing effective March 2022 there are still a few months left to book your stay with the current pricing.

Thompson Hollywood

For those eager to venture into authentic (as opposed to well-manicured or touristy) LA Thompson Hollywood may be a good fit. Located between the marquee thoroughfares of Sunset Boulevard and Hollywood Boulevard the Thompson is in a Hollywood neighborhood that's transitioning to trendy on the hospitality front.

Sleek rooms a great rooftop pool and bar with views of the Hollywood sign a designer gym and a magazine cover-worthy lobby are a few of the Thompson's most notable aspects.

It's a good choice for anyone looking to stay midway between downtown and the Westside. It's also close to attractions such as Universal Studios and the hiking trails of Runyon Canyon and Griffith Park. Make sure to take a ride-hailing service at night as streets are a tad empty. But the good news is that the Hollywood/Vine Metro station is close by.

Points redemption: World of Hyatt member rates start at $304 for a standard room. A Double Your Points rate is available from $351. Since this is a Hyatt Category 6 hotel award nights for standard rooms are 25000 points. You will pay another $50 per night in taxes as well as a $25 destination fee for complimentary coffee in the morning use of the gym and pool and discounts at some local attractions. Note that for stays from March 1 2022 onward World of Hyatt's award charts will have three categories — peak off-peak and standard — with redemption rates that will vary across dates.

Andaz West Hollywood

We love this hotel for all its racy beauty and legendary '60s past. The rooftop pool is just stunning and guests might recognize it from scenes shot for many a Hollywood production. Rooms are colorful and interesting with eclectic art mirrored furniture and some wild prints. The Andaz West Hollywood (WeHo) also offers one of the better-outfitted hotel gyms in the area. You can even bring Fido along for the stay – the hotel is dog-friendly and so are the guests.

Points redemption: Category 5 from 20000 World of Hyatt points (rates from $259). Note that for stays from March 1 2022 onward World of Hyatt's award charts will have three categories — peak off-peak and standard — with redemption rates that will vary across dates.

Pendry West Hollywood

The cool factor of West Hollywood is on overdrive these days thanks to new hotels such as Pendry West Hollywood. If you're looking to be immersed in LA hipster chic from a Sunset Strip vantage point you've arrived.

Standouts include eye-popping sculptures and other curated public artwork Wolfgang Puck-helmed restaurants gorgeous rooftop lounge and pool areas a bowling alley a 100-seat live entertainment venue and a private membership club known for attracting Hollywood A-listers. Our one-bedroom suite featured walk-in closets a grand entryway a powder room and a soaking tub overlooking the Hollywood Hills. I confess we didn't leave the premises at all during our stay.

Booking: The Pendry doesn't belong to a major loyalty program though it does participate in Chase's Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection. This means that Chase Sapphire Reserve cardmembers and other eligible cardholders can enjoy perks such as complimentary breakfast for two upgrades and more. Standard rates start at $370 for a king room and $735 for the deluxe skyline one-bedroom suite we stayed in.

Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City

If you like movies and amusement parks the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City is located directly next to Universal Studios Hollywood and all the excitement that comes with it. Walk or shuttle to the park to enjoy rides shows and tours sure to please the entire family. When we stayed here recently our kids were wowed by the hotel's over-the-top buffets at every meal. (The chocolate fountain was a huge hit.) The hotel is also close to the famous Hollywood sign and Griffith Park in one direction and Burbank with all its movie studios in the other.

Points redemption: Between 53000 and 60000 Hilton Honors points per night for a standard room reward (rates from $263).

Holiday Inn Express Hollywood Walk of Fame

Perfect for families the Holiday Inn Express Hollywood is literally in the thick of the action. We love the no-fuss no-muss offerings of this hotel — especially the great complimentary breakfast options. Walking out the door and down the street guests can visit all the famous sights including the Walk of Fame Hollywood and Highland (home to the Academy Awards) the historic Egyptian Theatre and more. There is so much to do in this area you'll have a hard time choosing favorites. The hotel does not offer a ton of frills but you won't need that with so much to see just outside the doors.

Points redemption: From 40000 IHG Rewards Club points (rates from $225).

Located right across from the boardwalk with ocean and palm tree views the hotel is just steps away from the famous Santa Monica Pier the most photographed location in all of LA. Great restaurants and world-class shopping are within walking distance. And did I mention the beach? This is iconic LA straight from the movies and TV.

There also is a park very close by for the little kids to work off some steam and the Santa Monica Pier and boardwalk are just a couple of blocks away.

The Shay

Hyatt has opened The Shay its first Destination by Hyatt property in Southern California. It is located in Culver City which may not be as well known as other areas of LA but it's actually a Westside gem with a historic entertainment industry pedigree. You'll find it due north about 7 miles from LAX.

Culver City has been a film and television production center for the past century. Now it's having a renaissance as a hub for creative types tech and trendy independent boutique outposts.

The Shay's industrial edgy look features lots of open spaces oversized windows two dining venues and quirky touches like a fire pit in the lobby. The pool deck offers sweeping LA vistas and frequent yoga pop-ups. Suites feature large living rooms a work area soaking tubs wet bars and some patios.

Airport lodging

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport

Sometimes it's just easier to stay near the airport particularly if you are just arriving or perhaps leaving very early. Since LAX is such a huge and busy airport we sometimes like to stay in an airport-adjacent hotel the night before we leave — especially if we have an early flight. The Hyatt Regency LAX is one of the best we've visited particularly for design comfort and proximity. It is literally the closest hotel to the airport and we can walk to our flights from the Hyatt Regency lobby. Many choose this as their home base and navigate to the sights of LA from here. Its very nicely appointed spacious rooms and a good restaurant make this a natural choice for this area of LA.

Points redemption: Category 3 from 12000 World of Hyatt points. Note that for stays from March 1 2022 onward World of Hyatt's award charts will have three categories — peak off-peak and standard — with redemption rates that will vary across dates.

Bottom line

Regardless of where you choose to bank your loyalty points there are great redemption options across the Greater Los Angeles area. If you're junkies like us you may have points programs with several (OK maybe all) of the hotel programs. That will allow you to pick and choose your options based on location cost and even mood. Whichever it may be those points are going to save you money on your visit to Los Angeles which you can then spend on those Lakers tickets or convertible Ferrari rental. Splurge! It's LA!

This reticence comes on the heels of a visit two years ago to a three-star establishment in Singapore perched high up amongst the clouds that left me thoroughly unimpressed. Conversation with food friends about what makes a restaurant Michelin-worthy almost always ends with a toss-up between food quality and impeccable service as if those two factors aren’t already a given.

For me a restaurant worth its weight in Michelin-star is one with a good story at its heart. By story I don’t mean drama or theatrics—I don’t need glass domes or scented smoke to waft out of opaque chalices. I have little need too for herbs and leaves meticulously plucked from a walled garden at the back. All I want is a good story.

All this is not to say that a Michelin-star restaurant bereft of a story is by any measure lesser. Without a compelling tale of intention a restaurant has little choice but to lean on a faultless menu that impresses from start to end. I take pains to say this because it’s not usually the case all the time. Everyone has room to grow but if you’re a three Michelin-star joint honey that ship has long and truly sailed.

This brings me to Alma by Juan Amador tucked at the corner of Goodwood Park Hotel commandeered to five consecutive one Michelin-star fame by Singaporean Executive Chef Haikal Johari. I came here for lunch which garnered a lot of ‘But dinner is so much better Zat” proclamations in my IG DMs which goes to show that even with an award safe and firm in their pocket restaurants like Alma still have a lot to prove.

Crispy Tofu (PHOTO: Zat Astha/Yahoo Lifestyle SEA)

At S$78++ for a 4-course lunch menu Alma could be the easiest and most pocket-friendly Michelin-star restaurant where you can have an elegant meal without any foreboding joy.

Going with a friend means I get to try more options in their 4-course lunch menu. To start there’s a delicate presentation of Hokkaido Scallops bursting with both colours flavours and textures. A bed of scallops tartare carries the weight of cheese parfait white meringue and slices of Japanese strawberries. There are pine nuts somewhere in this which lends an incredible savouriness to a dish already overflowing with all things bright and carefully acidic. It is served with a quenelle of Yellow Gazpacho sorbet and sauce flavours that add a poetic contradiction to the brininess of scallops.

Starters come by way of either a Crispy Tofu or a Boston Lobster Capellini both champions in their own right. I’m more partial to the tofu though with its moreish wild mushroom undertones that pair amazingly with an earthy Foie Gras Emulsion. It’s impressive. Even more impressive is that lightly battered tofu seasoned and flash-fried till delicately crispy outside while retaining a pillowy softness within.

Boston Lobster Capellini (PHOTO: Zat Astha/Yahoo Lifestyle SEA)

The Boston Lobster Capellini shares the Tofu’s bold flavour profile—going forth bravely and never excessively restrained. Still it’s Boston lobster after all like most lobster dishes in Singapore so I’m a bit hesitant to heap praise though it is no lightweight. The Hijiki on top and lobster butter greatly help with the waves of umami flavours that burst in the mouth.

It helps that attention falls squarely on the food because looking around the decor here feels like it’s stuck in a time capsule of the 1990s. It desperately needs to be brighter and elegant if only to match the fabulousness of the cuisine. If not now during a pandemic then when?

No sooner had I entertained and discussed that thought along came a plate of Barramundi—the softest most flavourful fish I’ve ever eaten this year. Unlike the previous appetisers and starters this is suitably restrained which I greatly appreciate giving space and room for Barramundi to shine. Not that it lacks culinary creativity. The mustard leaf for instance has a touch of spice that pairs beautifully with its inherent bitterness while the oyster sauce adds a touch of brininess. What’s there not to love?

Pork Jowl (PHOTO: Zat Astha/Yahoo Lifestyle SEA)

There’s also a plate of Pork Jowl served with Kale Sweet Corn Mustard and Pork Jus. It’s a simply seasoned cut of Pork Jowl carefully cooked so that it still retains bite. On its own it can be a tad predictable. But with all the other co-stars duly elevated. It takes brightness from the onions bitterness from the Kale and crunch from the courgette cubes. There’s also a slight restraint of flavour here not that I minded at all. It makes for a nice change of scenery.

Japanese Musk Melon (PHOTO: Zat Astha/Yahoo Lifestyle SEA)

Lunch ends with a bowl of Japanese Musk Melon dessert served with musk melon balls white grapes musk melon sorbet and icy lychee granita. It’s a dessert I can stand behind with each element contributing a different type of sweetness to the entire presentation without talking over each other. It’s essentially a fruit bowl with pizzazz.

I left understanding Alma’s appeal and its fame which is severely underrated. Everyone talks about the Jaan’s Odette’s Cloudstreet’s and Sommer’s. Still I rarely hear people heaping honorific on Alma which is peculiar because after today’s lunch it’s clear that praise needs to be given where credit is due. Alma by Juan Amador far exceeds any measure of expectations I had for an establishment this unsung. I’ll recommend this without hesitation to anyone wishing to experience Michelin-star quality food any time. It’s excellence that deserves your attention.

That’s the principle behind the collaboration between Mastercard and Sarah Beydoun the Lebanese designer behind Sarah’s Bag. The technology company partnered with Beydoun to launch the Official Expo 2020 Dubai limited-edition Priceless Collection of Sarah’s Bag merchandise. For this collection Beydoun allies with previously disadvantaged female artisans and connects them with opportunities to continue supporting themselves their families and their wider communities. The collaboration is titled Priceless as a wordplay regarding the Mastercard’s background and the positive impact of Sarah’s Bag’s production. Keep your eyes peeled for Priceless which launches on December 1st – just in time for the holidays.

Sarah Beydoun’s designs for Sarah’s Bag range from quirky tongue-in-cheek to extremely elegant. This range has made Sarah’s Bag a huge success with an impressive clientele base that includes figureheads such as Queen Rania of Jordan and actress Mona Zaki. People are drawn to Sarah’s Bag for these signatures which were carried over into the Priceless collection; blending the Sarah’s Bag’s brand codes with its thesis.

We know that the Priceless collection contains Mini Pouches Celeste Boxes an Arabesque Gold Classis Clutch and a Priceless Love Pochette. The themes within the collection include love hearts and “Priceless” spelt out across the exterior and that beading is the primary practical design technique employed in the collection. The result: a line of gift-worthy bags that give back that have helped make them.

Discover the collection for yourself on December 1st here at sarahsbag.com.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9pdmUtYmVlbi1hcHByb3ZlZC1mb3ItYS1iaWx0LWNhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I've Been Approved For A Bilt Card!,"I receive compensation for content and many links on this blog. Citibank is an advertising partner of this site as is American Express Chase Barclays and Capital One. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own and have not been reviewed approved or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles points and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). Terms apply to the offers and benefits listed on this page.

The Bilt Mastercard has no annual fee lets you earn points paying rent on your card and has bonus categories similar to a Sapphire Preferred Card as well (2x travel 3x dining). If you rent an apartment or house you can be 100000 points richer each year with this card and points transfer to great airline and hotel partners.

There’s a waiting list to get the card but they gave me a code to skip the waitlist to share on this site. I do not receive referral credit of any kind if you do.

Now that I’m no longer under 5/24 (I’ve recently gotten Sapphire Preferred a Southwest card and new Venture X) I decided to apply for the Bilt card and was approved instantly.

Earn Points On Your Rent

The card earns up to 100000 points per year paying rent at no fee. Paying $100000 in rent would cost you $2850 if you used Plastiq.com to charge your rewards credit card and send your landlord a check. Now you can charge up to $100000 in rent each year and earn transferable points without paying any fee.

In order to earn points on your spend each month you must make at least 5 transactions on the card that month. That’s easy to meet splitting up a single grocery or gas station trip into multiple purchases. But the idea is they want cardmembers using the card and not just doing a single ‘one and done’ rent transaction because that’s going to be a big money-loser.

I am a homeowner. I don’t rent. It’s still a good card without being able to take advantage of this unique benefit (and the Bilt Mastercard is unquestionably the best no annual fee rewards card as well). My reason for getting it was mostly to experience the Bilt program to dive into the Bilt app (they have really good articles on redeeming points actually) so that I could speak about it more intelligently.

Transfer Partners

I value Bilt points at 1.7 cents apiece. Points in the Bilt program transfer to:

Airlines: American AAdvantage Air Canada Aeroplan Emirates Skywards Air France KLM Flying Blue Turkish Miles & Smiles Virgin Atlantic Flying Club Hawaiian Airlines HawaiianMiles



American AAdvantage Air Canada Aeroplan Emirates Skywards Air France KLM Flying Blue Turkish Miles & Smiles Virgin Atlantic Flying Club Hawaiian Airlines HawaiianMiles Hotels: Hyatt IHG Rewards

This set of partners is at least as good as Chase’s transfer partners in my view.

Earn Interest On Your Points

Earn 25000 points a year and you earn interest on your unredeemed balance in the program which is fairly unique. At today’s low interest rates that doesn’t get you a lot of points but it’s a built-in way to generate trust – your point balances grow rather than being devalued. Or at least that’s what I hope to see.

Initial Bonus

I’ve referred to Bilt not offering an up front card bonus and others have made that mistake. It’s not actually true – you earn double points on non-bonused spend for your spend during your first 30 days as a cardmember. They make a digital card available right away so you can use your full 30 days for this.

How You Can Apply

There’s a waitlist to join the program and it reportedly takes months to be invited in at the moment. However you can go to BiltRewards.com/waitlist enter your email to joint the waitlist and you’ll be asked if you have a fast track code. VFTW4BILT will take you right in. (I do not receive any referral credit for this I simply pass this along as a service to you.)

You sign up for their waitlist verify your email and then you can enter the code to go straight to the application. I used the code myself and was approved instantly with a good credit limit.

If you pay rent you’ll want to be a member of this program (timely rent payments can actually be reported to credit agencies potentially improving your credit score too). And this gets you immediate access instead of having to wait months to be invited off their waitlist.

As long as you’re not working hard to avoid any card applications right now (about to get a mortgage trying to stay under 5/24 for Chase cards) and you rent this card is a no-brainer. And it is strong for more than just rent. Plus they’ve invested in Mastercard protections including Premium Cell Phone Protection; Purchase Protection; concierge; Trip Cancellation; and Trip Delay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMzE2Njc2L21hc3RlcmNhcmQtZXhjZWxsZW5jZS1hd2FyZC0yMDIxLXdpbm5lcnMtYW5ub3VuY2Vk0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGhha2F0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hbXAvYnVzaW5lc3MvMzE2Njc2L21hc3RlcmNhcmQtZXhjZWxsZW5jZS1hd2FyZC0yMDIxLXdpbm5lcnMtYW5ub3VuY2Vk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard Excellence award 2021 winners announced,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/316676/mastercard-excellence-award-2021-winners-announced on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMzE2Njc2L21hc3RlcmNhcmQtZXhjZWxsZW5jZS1hd2FyZC0yMDIxLXdpbm5lcnMtYW5ub3VuY2Vk0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGhha2F0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hbXAvYnVzaW5lc3MvMzE2Njc2L21hc3RlcmNhcmQtZXhjZWxsZW5jZS1hd2FyZC0yMDIxLXdpbm5lcnMtYW5ub3VuY2Vk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlcmJkLmNvbS9jb3Jwb3JhdGVzLzEzMTU10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BRAC Bank wins three excellence awards from Mastercard,"BRAC Bank Limited has received three awards from Mastercard for its contribution to innovation and success in driving business growth in Bangladesh.

In most sports you're either the player or the coach but not usually both. Sometimes you start your career as a player and transition into a leadership role once your playing days are over.For Bob Learn Jr. the month of November has been a rewarding whirlwind that has allowed him to wear multiple hats and jerseys while enjoying the many facets of the sport he has loved for a lifetime.Two weeks ago he was in Georgia coaching his Tennessee Southern men's team to a win at the 2021 Bowlero Southern Collegiate Classic the first Tier I title in the program's history.Now he's thousands of miles away competing for Senior Team USA in the 2021 International Bowling Federation Masters World Championships  where he has secured two match-play appearances in as many opportunities.The 59-year-old right-hander averaged more than 227 over five games Saturday at the Dubai International Bowling Centre to advance to singles match play which will take place Monday.Learn's 1136 block Saturday nearly matched his 1133 effort in Thursday's opening round. His 10-game total of 2269 was seventh in the 79-player field. Based on total pinfall the top 32 have advanced to match play.""I started off strong today but got into some trouble in Game 4 which cost me a few spots but I'm glad to be moving on and I hope it works out that we're all in different pods so we can maximize our chances at the medals"" Learn said. ""I'm seeing the lanes well overall but a lot of others are too. It's a very competitive field but I like our chances.""Team USA's Chris Barnes who is making his debut at the IBF Masters World Championships was the top qualifier with a 2488 total a 248.8 average for his 10 games which included one of the day's two 300 games. Sweden's Stefan Yngstrom had the other.Barnes had blocks of 1193 and 1295 to earn the top spot in the standings.As a longtime member of Team USA he became the first of two bowlers in history to roll multiple 300s at the IBF Men's/Super World Championships which came in 2010 and 2013 respectively.Team USA's Tom Hess and Parker Bohn III also qualified for match play Saturday in Dubai. They finished second and eighth with 2473 and 2263 totals.Norway's Tore Torgersen was third with 2378 Yngstrom was fourth with 2322 and Sweden's Peter Ljung rounded out the top five with 2288.It took an average of 205.5 to make the top 32.On the women's side Tuula Tamminen of Finland led the way with a 2122 total a 212.2 average.Team USA's Tish Johnson was second with 2090 and followed by her teammate Debbie Ayers (2081) and the Canadian duo of Lisa Morabito (2080) and Jill Friis (2066).Team USA's Sharon Powers was sixth with 2065 and Tracy Calfee finished in 22nd place with 1830. It took an average of 180 to make the cut.As the veteran of the women's squad from the United States Johnson's teammates have acknowledged how instrumental her leadership has been in their early success and the left-hander always is happy to help others find comfort and success.But as much as Johnson wants to see her teammates do well the mindset for singles will change now that qualifying is over.""I threw the ball a lot better today though I didn't score as well and I'm happy to be moving on to the next round"" said Johnson who earned a singles bronze medal at the IBF Masters World Championships in 2019. ""I'm glad the others bowled well too and I'm hoping it'll work out that we're all in separate pods for match play. But as much as I'm a team player when it comes to the rest of singles I want the gold and I'm going for it.""Overall Johnson is feeling comfortable on the lanes even after not bowling as much in 2021 following surgery on her left knee.Learn also has not been at 100% but his tweaked back is improving each day and he feels great overall.After helping hoist the trophy at the Brunswick Southern Collegiate Classic and making the 14-hour trip from New York to Dubai Learn's first night in the hotel was spent on a rollaway bed which left him feeling some discomfort.He then tweaked his back while at the bowling center for official practice Wednesday.Perhaps it was karma for all he gives to the sport of bowling or for letting Barnes have the king-size bed in their room Learn was able to get some relief from a chiropractor who happened to be in Dubai with one of the Team USA athletes from the Para Bowling World Championships Julet Hutchens the wife of team member Eddy Hutchens help Learn get back into bowling shape just a few hours before the para athletes headed home to the United States.Eddy Hutchens earned three gold medals and a silver medal at the inaugural Para Bowling World Championships and the Team USA contingent still was in Dubai for a day of sightseeing.Being able to compete and coach means the world to Learn who gets support - both in life and in coaching - from his own wife Stacey.Finding a balance in his personal preparation and the success of his collegiate team takes strategy and time but he's hoping it pays off in gold medals this week in Dubai.""We've got a really talented squad including some who have been with me for a while and they've worked incredibly hard at it"" Learn said. ""We're really at the point where I think we have enough experience and knowledge of the game that these guys believe it and they're performing like they believe it. Being able to coach and bowl takes balance and coming here and bowling well makes it all worth it.""Learn's focus in Dubai so far this weekend is two-fold as well.The spotlight will shift back to doubles Sunday morning for match play and the quarterfinals and all four Team USA duos made the cut. The doubles fields were cut to the top 16 in each classification also based on 10-game pinfall totals.The singles match play quarterfinals semifinals and finals will take place Monday.The doubles qualifiers will be divided into four groups of four teams.Each group will include four teams and they'll all bowl three games of round-robin matches allowing them to face everyone in the group one time each.Points will be awarded for each win and the top two teams in each group based on points will advance to the bracket-style quarterfinals.The quarterfinals semifinals and finals all will be one-game matches at the Masters World Championships.Learn is bowling with Bohn Barnes and Hess teamed up Johnson and Powers are a team and Ayers and Calfee are the final tandem.Doubles is using the Baker format during which the team members will alternate frames to complete a single game. Team competition this week also will feature a modified Baker format.""We won doubles last time (Munich in 2017) and have always bowled well together so I'm excited to have the opportunity again"" Learn said. ""We have a good synergy and I'd like to have a chance to repeat it. I think the way we bowled yesterday shows we definitely have a chance to do that.""Singles will follow a similar format with the 32 players being divided into groups of eight.Two dozen countries are being represented at the 2021 IBF Masters World Championships and they are competing across two age classifications - 50 and older and 65 and above. Team USA only is competing in the 50-and-older division.Each country at the 2021 IBF Masters World Championships can have a maximum of four men and four women in each age classification.IBF is providing livestream coverage and results at StrikeCloud.com This week Team USA is looking to defend the men's singles men's doubles and men's team titles as well as doubles and team on the women's side.The United States has swept the team gold medals for the last three editions of the event (2019 2017 2015).For more information about IBF visit bowling.sport",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGhvbGljbmV3c2FnZW5jeS5jb20vbmV3cy8yNDk2NTgvcG9wZS1mcmFuY2lzLW1lZXRzLXRoZS1wb3BlLXMtdGVhbS1haGVhZC1vZi1mcmllbmRseS1zb2NjZXItbWF0Y2jSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXRob2xpY25ld3NhZ2VuY3kuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzI0OTY1OC9wb3BlLWZyYW5jaXMtbWVldHMtdGhlLXBvcGUtcy10ZWFtLWFoZWFkLW9mLWZyaWVuZGx5LXNvY2Nlci1tYXRjaA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pope Francis meets the ‘Pope’s Team’ ahead of friendly soccer match,"The Roma also known as the Romani people are a traditionally nomadic group originating from the Indian subcontinent.

“Last Sept. 14 in Košice Slovakia I visited the Roma community. I invited them to move from prejudice to dialogue from isolation to integration” he said.

“After listening to the testimonies of some members of the community — stories of pain redemption and hope — I reminded everyone that to be Church is ‘to live as a people called by God each with his or her special role to play all as members of the same team.’”

Vatican Media.

“I used precisely these expressions taken from the language of soccer which also fit very well with the meaning of your game.”

He went on: “Too many times I told the Roma people of Košice the Roma have ‘been the object of prejudice and harsh judgments discriminatory stereotypes defamatory words and gestures. As a result we are all poorer in humanity.’”

WWE created Survivor Series in 1987 and the PPV became one of the promotion’s “big four” events along with WrestleMania SummerSlam and Royal Rumble. Like the Rumble Survivor is centred around a popular style of match.

The PPV introduced the multi-person tag team elimination concept. Two teams of four or five people led by captains face off in a match fought under tag team rules with the winning team decided once all of their opponents have been eliminated.

Over the year’s the concept has changed a little but the team vs team elimination match remains the show’s biggest draw.

In the PPV’s thirty-plus-year history there has been a feast of amazing matches. So here is our 25 greatest Survivor Series elimination matches in WWE history.

25. Team Faye Vs Team Blayze – Survivor Series 1995

A short but fun match that featured an incredible array of talent many of which came from All Japan Women’s Pro Wrestling. Bertha Faye and Alundra Blayze were feuding over the WWE Women’s Championship and at Survivor Series 1995 brought in help from Japan to settle their score.

Aja Kong Lioness Asuka and Tomoko Watanabe joined Faye while Chaparita Asari Kyoko Inoue and Sakie Hasegawa backed up Blayze.

The action was fast furious and packed with explosive moves rarely seen on American soil and especially on WWE television.

24. The Rude Brood Vs Roddy’s Rowdies – Survivor Series 1989

The match pitted Rick Rude’s Rude Brood of the Fabulous Rougeaus and Mr Perfect vs Roddy Piper’s Roddy’s Rowdies consisting of the Bushwhackers and Superfly Jimmy Snuka.

The match is just a great watch and loads of fun. The match revolved around the rivalry between Rude and Piper who both told a great story in the ring and continued their feud as they battled to a double count-out.

Everyone played their part perfectly especially Mr Perfect who scored two eliminations and won the match as the lone survivor. The final sequence with Perfect and Snuka was particularly good and a great showcase for the future Intercontinental Champion.

23. The Ultimate Warriors vs. The Perfect Team – Survivor Series 1990

Another good and fun elimination match featuring a host of legendary WWE Superstars. The Ultimate Warrior captained the team of Legion of Doom and Texas Tornado against the team led by Mr Perfect and Ax Smash and Crush of Demolition.

The action fought at a frenzied pace with Mr Perfect selling like crazy and flying all over the place. Warrior is his usual maniacal self hitting anything that moves while LOD and Demolition slugging it out has the fans at a fever pitch.

Once again Perfect is excellent and a joy to watch in exchanges with both Tornado and Warrior at the closing period of the bout.

22. The Mega Powers Vs The Twin Towers – Survivor Series 1988

A match that featured some of WWE’s biggest ever Superstars both figuratively and literally.

The Twin Towers of Akeem King Haku Ted DiBiase The Big Boss Man and The Red Rooster clashed with the Mega Powers of Hulk Hogan Macho Man Randy Savage Hercules Hillbilly Jim and Koko B. Ware in this great outing.

Everyone even the Red Rooster played their part in this classic late-eighties WWE encounter. Hogan and Savage were on fire throughout as the biggest stars in the business while DiBiase and Boss Man are excellent as the company’s top heels.

Hogan’s post-match celebrations gave fans the first glimpse into the Mega Powers explosion leading into WrestleMania 5.

21. Team Angle Vs Team Lesnar – Survivor Series 2003

Kurt Angle against Brock Lesnar is one of WWE’s greatest rivalries. Two legitimate athletes tearing it up whenever they met. At Survivors Series in 2003 they clashed in a five-on-five elimination match and the result was awesome.

The monster heel team Lesnar Matt Morgan Nathan Jones A-Train and The Big Show was one of the most intimidating teams in the PPV’s history but the crew Angle assembled featured four of the toughest wrestlers to ever do it – Bradshaw Chris Benoit Hardcore Holly John Cena completed Angle’s team and the action was excellent.

The focus was on Angle and Lesnar but Cena and Benoit in particular got some huge moments and the left on a much higher level than when they entered.

20. Team Michaels Vs Team Ramon – Survivor Series 1995

Shawn Michaels’ wild card team of Sid The British Bulldog and Ahmed Johnson took on Razor Ramon’s motley crew of Dean Douglas Owen Hart and Yokozuna in a fun and crazy match.

Heels and faces teamed up on both sides making for a chaotic spectacle. Michael had issues with Sid and Bulldog while Ramon’s entire group had problems.

The result saw teammates attack one another break up pinfall attempts and cause eliminations. HBK Razor and Owen were the obvious stars but Johnson put in a good shift and was portrayed as a monster receiving huge pops with every power move.

19. Team Hogan vs. Team Andre – Survivor Series 1987

The first-ever Survivor Series elimination main event match and it is a doozy. The match was a big-time spectacle with non-other than Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant as the warring team captains.

The teams included One Man Gang King Kong Bundy Butch Reed and Rick Rude for Andre against Paul Orndorff Don Muraco Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow for Hogan.

The build-up to and the match itself featured many twists turns and double-crosses along the way. The fractured and fraught relationships on both sides made for heightened interest and investment in the epic encounter.

Everything about this match felt big. The action was intense and explosive and only increased as it came down to the final two. Each performer played a vital role in telling the story while the commentary team of Jim Ross and Paul Heyman heightened the magnitude every step of the way.

“Team Pope – Fratelli Tutti” (All Brothers) will face players from a Croatian group the World Rom Organisation on Sunday at the training grounds of Rome club Lazio – with Lazio star Ciro Immobile refereeing.

Football fan Pope Francis met on Saturday with priests migrants and Swiss Guards making up his very own team for a charity match promoting the inclusion of the Roma community.

In 2013 the pope brought back three Syrian families from Lesbos the major point of entry for migrants into Europe. He is returning to the island next month as part of a trip to Greece and Cyprus.

“It is a team where there are no barriers and which makes inclusion a simple normality” the 84-year-old pontiff told the players on Saturday according to a Vatican statement.

The match is intended to raise funds for an initiative by the diocese of Rome to promote the inclusion of Roma and other vulnerable people.

During a visit to Slovakia in September Francis called for “integration” for the marginalised ethnic Roma in the east of the country.

After hearing from Roma at the Lunik IX estate in Kosice the pope told members of the community that “all too often you have been the object of prejudice and harsh judgments”."

The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcnVzc2VsbC13aWxzb24tY2FsbGVkLW1lLWFzLXNvb24tYXMtaS1nb3QtZHJhZnRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mason McCormick: Russell Wilson Called Me 'As Soon As I Got Drafted',"To hammer home the point one more time Russell Wilson is embracing all of his new teammates especially the ones tasked with protecting the quarterback. As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group."

Overtreating livestock with antibiotics can increase the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria—this is hardly a new finding. Nether is the fact that antibiotic-resistant bacteria can subsequently infect humans which can cause infections that are more difficult to treat. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other organizations across America (and around the globe) have tracked the issue for years via programs like the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria (or NARMS) and others.

McDonald's Would Need To Change Its Entire Menu to Meet New Goal Experts Say

The problem is that the groups tracking the issue can often do little more than that: keep track. It is up to producers and major purchasers of livestock to take action and curtail the heavy use of prophylactic antibiotics—drugs used to treat infections on a large scale rather than treating sick animals on a case-by-case basis. And in 2018 McDonald's the largest buyer of beef in the United States made a pledge to do just that.

McDonald's announced three years ago that it restrict antibiotic use among its beef suppliers and was to run pilot projects across the U.S. that would help them set reduction targets by the end of 2020.

The company released a statement that read in part: ""As one of the world's largest food companies we will use our scale for good partnering with industries in transparent conversation to advance practices related to use of antibiotics and susceptibility testing.""

However according to Lena Brook a director with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) we're nearly a year past that deadline and the chain still hasn't shared any information about its progress on reaching this goal. What's more the chain made a similar pledge pertaining to the chicken industry in 2015 which positioned it as an early leader for the cause of ending the use of medically important antibiotics in the U.S. chicken supply chain. But Brook says ""the company has fallen from its leadership position"" since and calls these promises a case of greenwashing.

Danny O'Malley president and founder of the plant-based food company Before the Butcher noted that McDonald's showed ""a blatant disregard for the reduction pledge they so boldly stated in 2018."" However he said there may still be hope for the chain to redeem itself with its new plant-based burger. ""Let's hope that McDonald's introduction of the McPlant in the U.S. sizzles rather than fizzles as we have seen [with] their pledge to restrict antibiotics in beef produced for the company.""

McDonald's did not return our request for comment on this matter.

Here's what it'll take to fix them,"New York CNN Business —

Late this summer drive-thru times slowed by about 26 seconds compared to last year according to a study. That may not seem like much — but in the world of fast food every moment counts.

“Mere seconds can be a make-it or break-it in terms of where a consumer decides to order from” Amanda Topper a research director at the research firm Mintel said of the slowdowns. The data is from SeeLevelHX which tracked drive-thru times at about 1500 US restaurants across 10 major chains from July 5 to August 6.

A speedier drive-thru can “be a competitive advantage” Topper said while long lines may discourage customers from stopping in. Most Americans who eat at fast food restaurants use the drive-thru she noted — and the option has become even more popular during the pandemic when many customers felt safer in their cars than restaurants.

So far the habit has stuck. A Technomic consumer survey found about 52% of quick-service restaurant orders were placed in drive-thrus in August 2021 compared to about 42% in January 2020.

In the highly competitive fast food space increased demand through any channel is a win. Restaurants don’t want to lose ground by giving up any potential drive-thru sales yet they also can’t overwhelm their systems and risk losing customers.

To solve that problem fast food chains are chasing multiple solutions many of which are about more: more lanes more pickup options and more technology.

How drive-thrus got bogged down

Restaurant staffing is the main cause for drive-thru delays. “Labor is at the heart of a lot of the big challenges that … restaurants are facing right now” said David Henkes senior principal at Technomic.

Restaurants and bars were short about 800000 jobs as of October compared to February 2020 before the pandemic according to the National Restaurant Association. Workers have been leaving in droves with the quit rate for accommodation and food services hitting 6.6% in September according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -— more than double the overall 3% average.

And the pandemic-fueled push to drive-thru delivery and pickup has created a cycle: With workers scrambling to fill those off-premise orders customers inside the restaurants may become frustrated — and turn to the drive-thru instead.

“You’re sitting there waiting in line and meanwhile all the drive-thru orders are getting filled the takeout orders are getting filled” Henkes said. Until the labor situation eases restaurants are “diverting their resources where they’re going to be most effectively used. For a lot of quick-service-restaurants that’s the drive-thru.”

Some staff-strapped restaurants are opting to keep dining rooms closed entirely. But even if they add more employees to the drive-thru staff there’s tremendous pressure on that channel.

At Wendy’s (WEN) for example staffing challenges meant “we had more dining rooms closed during the third quarter on average than we did during the second quarter” CEO Todd Penegor said in a recent analyst call. “One of the big keys for us is to get our dining rooms open to really support taking pressure off the drive-thru and support our digital business moving forward.”

Meanwhile there’s even a challenge with the staff restaurants have managed to maintain. Turmoil in the industry means more turnover which means less experienced workers. “If you have an employee who has been with you for a year they’re much more efficient … than the person who you hired three weeks ago” said Peter Saleh restaurant analyst with BTIG.

Larger orders another pandemic trend only exacerbate the situation Saleh noted. Some restaurant chains said although traffic may have slowed during the crisis the average check size went up. That’s partially due to price hikes but also because people placed larger orders for families or groups eating together at home.

Order ahead double lanes and artificial intelligence

It’s not clear when or even if the labor pool for restaurants will grow. So restaurants are turning to other solutions.

Earlier this week KFC announced a drive-thru alternative called Quick Pick-Up. Customers order ahead through the KFC app or website drive to a KFC location and park in a dedicated spot and then walk into the restaurant to pick up their food from a shelf near the register. In its announcement KFC encouraged customers to choose pickup over drive-thru.

This isn’t a new pandemic-era idea: Fast casual chains such as Sweetgreen and Chipotle (CMG) have long featured pickup shelves. Last year McDonald’s said that it was testing express lines and dedicated pickup spots for customers who placed digital orders. Burger King also unveiled new restaurant designs last year with similar spots and walk-up order windows.

Order-ahead not only takes some pressure off the drive-thru window but also encourages people to order through an app — an important way for fast food chains to build loyalty with rewards and exclusive offers and learn more about their customers.

Still fast food has always been about convenience so adding another step might not appeal to every diner. So several chains are leaning into the drive-thru.

Burger King is building prototypes with more drive-thru lanes. McDonald’s (MCD) and others are experimenting with automated voice technology that can take customer orders.

McDonald’s has been testing automated order taking at several US drive-thrus CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts during an October call. He said the efforts “have shown substantial benefits to customers and the crew experience.” McDonald’s drive-thru times in major markets have shortened an average of about 30 seconds over the past two years according to the company.

In other drive-thru initiatives last year Restaurant Brands International (QSR) — which owns Burger King Popeyes and Tim Hortons — announced it will roll out digital menu screens with contactless payments by mid-2022. And Wendy’s (WEN) recently announced a partnership with Google (GOOG) to give it access to AI and other tech that can help improve ordering at the drive-thru."

Far more cardiac pacemakers were produced here than Minnesota patients ever needed and the pioneering Medtronic became one of the companies that led the region to higher standards of living through its pacemaker manufacturing.

Political leaders will eagerly praise small business owners but every economic development program of the last 40 years seems to be aimed at another Medtronic.

This pursuit of big business — or at least big potential — may be one reason small business owners are often underappreciated. No one really gets excited about another burger restaurant or landscaping contractor. They often can't ""scale"" meaning get a lot bigger. No region really gets ahead if all they do is feed each other hamburgers and plant each other's birch trees.

It's why a startup with nothing but a free software app can still get more attention than a landscaper with 50 employees.

We in the region really do want more businesses that can get big said Louis Johnston a professor of economics at the College of St. Benedict and St. John's University yet there's still more to the story.

He explained that local machine shops and other small suppliers solved a lot of manufacturing and design problems for companies like Medtronic which helped fuel the growth in Twin Cities prosperity in the second half of the 20th century.

The value of small business bears out in the research that convincingly shows smokestack-chasing — trying to lure a big employer with taxpayer subsidies — is often a game for losers.

A region will be better off if its people go to work for themselves instead.

If state and local governments want to use taxpayer money wisely they might provide these entrepreneurs with things like technical services or invest more in training the whole workforce.

We also have to stop thinking only about what these small businesses do for our regional economy and appreciate what they can do for their owners.

It's long been understood that immigrants are more likely to start businesses than native-born people.

Starting a successful business is hard work of course made even harder if you've bootstrapped the business out of necessity or are doing so in a second (or fourth) language.

That's one reason the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis added a section to its regionwide scan of economic conditions that focuses on businesses owned by women and people of color.

The effort goes back a few years when ""we were interested in highlighting a little more and better understanding the contributions of immigrants not just in the Twin Cities but in a lot of our smaller communities"" said Joe Mahon the Minneapolis Fed's regional outreach director.

Service-based businesses of all kinds were clobbered during the COVID-19 pandemic as people stayed home — and didn't want other people in their homes. And the bad news was only worse for businesses owned by women and people of color.

A greater proportion of these entrepreneurs were in businesses that deliver face-to-face service like serving food. They were less likely to have any financial cushion. They had a harder time getting bank loans through the Paycheck Protection Program or other financial assistance because many didn't have a relationship with a commercial bank.

Mahon said the Minneapolis Fed can't know for sure which business owners stopped responding to its surveys because they'd closed.

There's some indication though that new business formation has been growing including in the areas most heavily damaged in Minneapolis' unrest last year. It makes sense that a lot of this startup activity could be owners who were put out of business last year simply starting over.

""East Lake Street will be back"" explained Pinky Patel co-owner of the rebuilding Elite Cleaners of Minneapolis earlier this fall. ""We are hardworking immigrants that need to work.""

That's the kind of grit you might expect from people who had decided to go into business for themselves. And maybe that's the reason to appreciate small business owners even more. We as customers came to depend on their mettle or whatever it was that drove them to keep hustling and adapting during a very difficult couple of years.

That was the point of an e-mail that arrived just before Halloween as a friend shared his COVID-19 vaccine booster shot confirmation from a Thrifty White Pharmacy. An appreciative new customer as well as thoughtful observer of business he wondered why he's never read much about Plymouth-based Thrifty White which has almost all of its more than 50 Minnesota stores outside of the metro area.

That got me thinking about my own COVID-19 booster shot hand-delivered by John Hoeschen the owner and pharmacist at an even smaller Minnesota retailer. His St. Paul Corner Drug a single store next to Macalester College's stadium can't be more than 1 200 square feet. It was closed last year to foot traffic because it's hard to remain 6 feet from anyone in a space that tight. Staffers rang up orders and walked them outside.

During the big spring vaccine push Hoeschen had the whole front part of the store cleared out of shelving and merchandise to make room for booths where customers could be vaccinated.

At this traditional pharmacy there was nothing old-fashioned about the slick online scheduling app customers used to book appointments. The work of filling other prescriptions didn't slow down and the store remained staffed to keep vaccinating all day with the owner happily poking arms himself.

When I stopped in there last month to receive my booster shot some of the store had been put back in place but the soda fountain counter was still taken over by the vaccination operation. No hand-scooped ice cream cone was available that morning.

Hoeschen and his small team managed through it all.

We still highlight the work of entrepreneurs in this country. The business media publishes almost daily updates about the billionaire entrepreneurs funding their own personal space race for example and taunting one another about net worth. Well God bless their significantly undersized hearts they really have achieved a lot.

But if you want to celebrate the contribution of America's entrepreneurs better candidates are just down the street. Their homegrown businesses just might lead the recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

“An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. Stop. I am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. Stop. Mail is only form of transportation. Stop.”

Dr. Curtis Welch

This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome Alaska to all the major Alaska towns to territorial governor Scott Bone in Juneau and to the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington D.C. Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.

Known as the “Great Race of Mercy” it’s an iconic story of human compassion.

Weather prevented delivery by air so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300000 units of antitoxin which was produced by Merck legacy company H.K. Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.

674 miles 5 days 300000 units

Over 130 years of vaccine leadership In 1895 the H.K. Mulford Company began marketing the first commercially available diphtheria antitoxin in the U.S. the very medication that helped avert the diphtheria epidemic in Nome. Today we have a significant presence in vaccine discovery development and distribution in both human and animal health.

Vaccines are not just for children

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider vaccines to be one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. In the U.S. vaccines are now available for a number of infectious diseases that once routinely affected people. While there are many vaccines available for children it’s important to remember that adults also are susceptible to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.

Imagine at a point in the near future you are taking your daily trip through the metaverse when you encounter Colin Kaepernick. It's not the flesh-and-blood Colin Kaepernick but a digital avatar of the former NFL star. As you interact with Kaepernick Nike Kaepernick's sponsor becomes part of the experience. Whether you're a Nike fan or not his presence at least affirms the brand's identity and story. Advertising has always met the world where technology has taken its eyes and ears. If the first wave of advertising was print and billboards followed by radio and TV ushered in a new iteration in the 1950s built around the 30-second spot an era lasted through the introduction of the World Wide Web in the 1990s. But in the mid-2010s the average time spent watching TV fell from 4.2 hours to the current 3.17 hours and that time is projected to continue falling through the decade. While it's not assured that less TV time means migration to the metaverse a conceptual virtual world where people will interact with each other using headsets or smart glasses and virtual reality many advertising executives are banking on it. The term ""metaverse"" dates back to Neal Stephenson's 1992 science-fiction novel ""Snow Crash"" in which humans as avatars interacted in a three-dimensional virtual space — to escape a dystopian reality. It has caught fire this year after Facebook rebranded itself as Meta Platforms  noting its goal is ""to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect find communities and grow businesses."" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the metaverse as an ""embodied Internet"" that unlike the Internet of today gives one a ""feeling of presence."" Video game companies like Fortnite developer Epic Games and Roblox have planted a flag early in the metaverse trend. Nike — which has several patents related to selling products in the metaverse — recently created Nikeland in conjunction with Roblox and seemingly every company is looking to do something.

""Our efforts to date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse"" said Disney CEO Bob Chapek on the company's third quarter earnings call. ""The metaverse is the next frontier just like social networking was when we got started"" billionaire businessman Orlando Bravo co-founder and managing partner of private equity firm Thomas Bravo recently told CNBC. ""It's investable and it's going to be very big."" Now the question of how to monetize metaverse users' attention in this new form of media is top of mind. Advertising might have previously interrupted a user's media experience. A newspaper ad for instance ran on the same pages in which readers read news stories. Subsequent inventions like radio followed the same format: programming would be interrupted by audio ads. Later TV would follow the same format. Advertising executives sketched out a different approach for metaverse advertising.

The new billboard ad

In the first phase these executives said brands would merely erect digital billboards in the metaverse. The template for such advertising is in games like Tiki-Taka Soccer and FIFA Mobile in which billboards for brands both increase awareness and if the visitor is interested lead to more information about the product. ""It's going to be very similar to what we have today in the real world"" said Jason Velliquette executive vice president of digital for marketing consultancy R3. He believes that there will be systems within the metaverse that let you produce and publish assets. ""So in the same way that we have billboards on the side of the road or [out of] home signage brands will still be able to buy these types of placements within a Metaverse environment or a 3D environment"" he said. That means that if say a major financial services company like a Citibank wanted to set up a stand to teach financial education in the metaverse it can. But in a virtual world the brand might have better luck partnering with an influencer. ""Within Twitch you have influencers who have these huge channels and following"" said Velliquette. ""You're going to still be able to follow these types of individuals or attend their seminars or go to their shows or go to their speaking engagements or things of that nature. And brands are going be able to partner and collaborate with these various influencers to really kind of make a splash within the metaverse space"" he said.

Product placement

The pandemic forced more brands to experiment with the latest in camera technology and virtual fitting apps for clothing and cosmetics and ""virtual fashion"" is an obvious target for early development and experimentation in the metaverse. ""When people walk around as avatars it's quite imaginable that then your virtual version will dress up and use brands like Nike Adidas Balanchine Balenciaga or Gucci or Levi's doesn't matter"" said Max Pinas creative director for Dept a global digital agency. ""And so you will have virtual fashion"" he said. This past May Gucci introduced a purse in Roblox that actually cost more than the item in real life. Nike 's virtual world called Nikeland within the Roblox platform is modeled after the company's headquarters. While it will feature different minigames for users to play like dodgeball and tag Nike plans to have a digital showroom and include athlete and product integration. In the past when marketers place products in movies or TV shows they use a product placement agency. In gaming and the metaverse it works a bit differently. Generally gaming has you work for goods. In World of Warcraft for instance you mine gold and when you get enough gold you can buy something. The introduction of NFTs — non-fungible tokens — changes this equation. Suddenly a person (represented as a game avatar) can buy an NFT and virtually walk around different worlds with it. Such cross-pollination inevitably leads to trouble. For example last year in Fortnite it was possible to see both Marvel and DC Comics properties in the same location. ""So you could see let's say somebody suited up as Batman and talking to the Avengers"" Pinas said.

New universe for consumers

As marketers work out those branding boundaries the technology keeps evolving. That's why within a short time a user will be able to interact with an embodiment of a brand like Kaepernick for Nike. Tiffany Rolfe global chief creative officer of ad agency R/GA said though the metaverse doesn't exist yet it will provide a new universe of customers and environments to build within for entertainment companies like Disney tapping existing intellectual property. And some of these new experiences will be similar to the 30-second TV spot. ""It's a story that could play out over time across different platforms different realities stuff could happen in the real world and then it connects you to something that's happening in the virtual world"" Rolfe said. ""This last year of the pandemic and how we engage with digital experiences has really opened our eyes to what's possible. Experiences are going to be a big space where brands will create [events] to bring people in and get the scale there"" she added. Some advertising executives say successful efforts will need to take into account that the metaverse by its original definition is a realm inside of which the individual escapes the real world. That means brands shouldn't create what looks at all like advertising as we know it and what will come across as real in the virtual world will be different. ""The time of phoning it in is over and brands must redefine their approaches to audience engagement"" said Lewis Smithingham Media.Monks' director of creative solutions. ""In the metaverse brands need to strike a balance between being present and being authentic by providing utility and meaning for people through creativity and technological innovation. In short brands must create experiences people actually want.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvbm92LzIxL21ldGEtZGVsYXlzLWVuY3J5cHRlZC1tZXNzYWdlcy1vbi1mYWNlYm9vay1hbmQtaW5zdGFncmFtLXRvLTIwMjPSAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS8yMDIxL25vdi8yMS9tZXRhLWRlbGF5cy1lbmNyeXB0ZWQtbWVzc2FnZXMtb24tZmFjZWJvb2stYW5kLWluc3RhZ3JhbS10by0yMDIz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta delays encrypted messages on Facebook and Instagram to 2023,"The owner of Facebook and Instagram is delaying plans to encrypt users’ messages until 2023 amid warnings from child safety campaigners that its proposals would shield abusers from detection.

Mark Zuckerberg’s social media empire has been under pressure to abandon its encryption plans which the UK home secretary Priti Patel has described as “simply not acceptable”.

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has said private messaging is the “frontline of child sexual abuse online” because it prevents law enforcement and tech platforms from seeing messages by ensuring that only the sender and recipient can view their content – a process known as end-to-end encryption.

The head of safety at Facebook and Instagram’s parent company Meta announced that the encryption process would take place in 2023. The company had previously said the change would happen in 2022 at the earliest.

“We’re taking our time to get this right and we don’t plan to finish the global rollout of end-to-end encryption by default across all our messaging services until sometime in 2023” Antigone Davis wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. “As a company that connects billions of people around the world and has built industry-leading technology we’re determined to protect people’s private communications and keep people safe online.”

Meta already uses end-to-end encryption on its WhatsApp messaging service and had been planning to extend that to its Messenger and Instagram apps in 2022. It has already encrypted voice and video calls on Messenger. Announcing the privacy drive in 2019 Zuckerberg said: “People expect their private communications to be secure and to only be seen by the people they’ve sent them to – not hackers criminals over-reaching governments or even the people operating the services they’re using.”

Meta’s apps are used by 2.8 billion people every day. The tech industry made more than 21m referrals of child sexual abuse identified on its platforms globally to the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2020. More than 20m of those reports were from Facebook.

Davis said Meta would be able to detect abuse under its encryptions plans by using non-encrypted data account information and reports from users. A similar approach has already enabled WhatsApp to make reports to child safety authorities. “Our recent review of some historic cases showed that we would still have been able to provide critical information to the authorities even if those services had been end-to-end encrypted” she said.

Patel has been a vocal opponent of Meta’s plans. “We cannot allow a situation where law enforcement’s ability to tackle abhorrent criminal acts and protect victims is severely hampered” she said in April.

The issue is also a concern for Ofcom the communications regulator tasked with enforcing the online safety bill which will become law around 2023 and imposes a duty of care on tech companies to protect children from harmful content and prevent abuse from occurring on their platforms. Ofcom’s chief executive Melanie Dawes told the Times on Saturday that social media companies should ban adults from directly messaging children or face criminal sanctions.

The NSPCC’s head of child safety online policy Andy Burrows welcomed Meta’s move. “Facebook is right not to proceed with end-to-end encryption until it has a proper plan to prevent child abuse going undetected on its platforms” he said.

“But they should only go ahead with these measures when they can demonstrate they have the technology in place that will ensure children will be at no greater risk of abuse.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF0bGFudGljLmNvbS9pZGVhcy9hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjEvMTEvZmFjZWJvb2tzLWRhbmdlcm91cy1leHBlcmltZW50LXRlZW4tZ2lybHMvNjIwNzY3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook's Dangerous Experiment on Teen Girls,"Social media gets blamed for many of America’s ills including the polarization of our politics and the erosion of truth itself. But proving that harms have occurred to all of society is hard. Far easier to show is the damage to a specific class of people: adolescent girls whose rates of depression anxiety and self-injury surged in the early 2010s as social-media platforms proliferated and expanded. Much more than for boys adolescence typically heightens girls’ self-consciousness about their changing body and amplifies insecurities about where they fit in their social network. Social media—particularly Instagram which displaces other forms of interaction among teens puts the size of their friend group on public display and subjects their physical appearance to the hard metrics of likes and comment counts—takes the worst parts of middle school and glossy women’s magazines and intensifies them.

One major question though is how much proof parents regulators and legislators need before intervening to protect vulnerable young people. If Americans do nothing until researchers can show beyond a reasonable doubt that Instagram and its owner Facebook (which now calls itself Meta) are hurting teen girls these platforms might never be held accountable and the harm could continue indefinitely. The preponderance of the evidence now available is disturbing enough to warrant action.

Facebook has dominated the social-media world for nearly a decade and a half. Its flagship product supplanted earlier platforms and quickly became ubiquitous in schools and American life more broadly. When it bought its emerging rival Instagram in 2012 Facebook didn’t take a healthy platform and turn it toxic. Mark Zuckerberg’s company actually made few major changes in its first years of owning the photo-sharing app whose users have always skewed younger and more female. The toxicity comes from the very nature of a platform that girls use to post photographs of themselves and await the public judgments of others.

From the September 2017 issue: Have smartphones destroyed a generation?

The available evidence suggests that Facebook’s products have probably harmed millions of girls. If public officials want to make that case it could go like this:

1. Harm to teens is occurring on a massive scale.

For several years Jean Twenge the author of iGen and I have been collecting the academic research on the relationship between teen mental health and social media. Something terrible has happened to Gen Z the generation born after 1996. Rates of teen depression and anxiety have gone up and down over time but it is rare to find an “elbow” in these data sets––a substantial and sustained change occurring within just two or three years. Yet when we look at what happened to American teens in the early 2010s we see many such turning points usually sharper for girls. The data for adolescent depression are noteworthy:

Some have argued that these increases reflect nothing more than Gen Z’s increased willingness to disclose their mental-health problems. But researchers have found corresponding increases in measurable behaviors such as suicide (for both sexes) and emergency-department admissions for self-harm (for girls only). From 2010 to 2014 rates of hospital admission for self-harm did not increase at all for women in their early 20s or for boys or young men but they doubled for girls ages 10 to 14.

The Facebook Papers: ‘History will not judge us kindly’

Similar increases occurred at the same time for girls in Canada for mood disorders and for self-harm. Girls in the U.K. also experienced very large increases in anxiety depression and self-harm (with much smaller increases for boys).

2. The timing points to social media.

National surveys of American high-school students show that only about 63 percent reported using a “social networking site” on a daily basis back in 2010. But as smartphone ownership increased access became easier and visits became more frequent. By 2014 80 percent of high-school students said they used a social-media platform on a daily basis and 24 percent said that they were online “almost constantly.” Of course teens had long been texting each other but from 2010 to 2014 high-school students moved much more of their lives onto social-media platforms. Notably girls became much heavier users of the new visually oriented platforms primarily Instagram (which by 2013 had more than 100 million users) followed by Snapchat Pinterest and Tumblr.

Boys are glued to their screens as well but they aren’t using social media as much; they spend far more time playing video games. When a boy steps away from the console he does not spend the next few hours worrying about what other players are saying about him. Instagram in contrast can loom in a girl’s mind even when the app is not open driving hours of obsessive thought worry and shame.

3. The victims point to Instagram.

The evidence is not just circumstantial; we also have eyewitness testimony. In 2017 British researchers asked 1500 teens to rate how each of the major social-media platforms affected them on certain well-being measures including anxiety loneliness body image and sleep. Instagram scored as the most harmful followed by Snapchat and then Facebook. Facebook’s own research leaked by the whistleblower Frances Haugen has a similar finding: “Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression … This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.” The researchers also noted that “social comparison is worse” on Instagram than on rival apps. Snapchat’s filters “keep the focus on the face” whereas Instagram “focuses heavily on the body and lifestyle.” A recent experiment confirmed these observations: Young women were randomly assigned to use Instagram use Facebook or play a simple video game for seven minutes. The researchers found that “those who used Instagram but not Facebook showed decreased body satisfaction decreased positive affect and increased negative affect.”

4. No other suspect is equally plausible.

Many things changed in the early 2010s. Some have suggested that the cause of worsening mental health could be the economic insecurity that followed the 2008 global financial crisis. But why this would hit younger teen girls the hardest is unclear. Besides the American economy improved steadily in the years after 2011 while teen mental health deteriorated steadily. Some have suggested that the 9/11 attacks school shootings or other news events turned young Americans into “generation disaster.” But why then do similar trends exist among girls in Canada and the U.K.? Not all countries show obvious increases in mood disorders perhaps because technological changes interact with cultural variables but the societies most like ours (including Australia and New Zealand) exhibit much the same patterns.

Correlation does not prove causation but nobody has yet found an alternative explanation for the massive sudden gendered multinational deterioration of teen mental health during the period in question.

To be sure there is evidence on the other side. Dozens of studies and several meta-analyses (studies of groups of studies) have examined the relationship between greater digital-media use and worse teen mental health and most have found just small correlations or none at all. The most widely cited of these studies published in 2019 analyzed 355000 teens across three large data sets from the U.S. and U.K. The authors found only a tiny correlation—no larger than the correlation of bad mental health with self-reports of “eating potatoes.” Facebook cites this research in its defense.

But here’s the problem with these studies: Most lump all screen-based activities together (including those that are harmless such as watching movies or texting with friends) and most lump boys and girls together. Such studies cannot be used to evaluate the more specific hypothesis that Instagram is harmful to girls. It’s like trying to prove that Saturn has rings when all you have is a dozen blurry photos of the entire night sky.

Derek Thompson: Social media is attention alcohol

But as the resolution of the pictures increases the rings appear. The subset of studies that allow researchers to isolate social media and Instagram in particular show a much stronger relationship with poor mental health. The same goes for those that zoom in on girls rather than all teens. Girls who use social media heavily are about two or three times more likely to say that they are depressed than girls who use it lightly or not at all. (For boys the same is true but the relationship is smaller.) Most of the experiments that randomly assign people to reduce or give up social media for a week or more show a mental-health benefit indicating that social media is a cause not just a correlate.

Facebook would have you believe that merely cutting back the time that teens spend on social media will solve any problems it creates. In a 2019 internal essay Andrew Bosworth a longtime company executive wrote:

While Facebook may not be nicotine I think it is probably like sugar. Sugar is delicious and for most of us there is a special place for it in our lives. But like all things it benefits from moderation.

Bosworth was proposing what medical researchers call a “dose-response relationship.” Sugar salt alcohol and many other substances that are dangerous in large doses are harmless in small ones. This framing also implies that any health problems caused by social media result from the user’s lack of self-control. That’s exactly what Bosworth concluded: “Each of us must take responsibility for ourselves.” The dose-response frame also points to cheap solutions that pose no threat to its business model. The company can simply offer more tools to help Instagram and Facebook users limit their consumption.

But social-media platforms are not like sugar. They don’t just affect the individuals who overindulge. Rather when teens went from texting their close friends on flip phones in 2010 to posting carefully curated photographs and awaiting comments and likes by 2014 the change rewired everyone’s social life.

Improvements in technology generally help friends connect but the move onto social-media platforms also made it easier—indeed almost obligatory––for users to perform for one another.

Public performance is risky. Private conversation is far more playful. A bad joke or poorly chosen word among friends elicits groans or perhaps a rebuke and a chance to apologize. Getting repeated feedback in a low-stakes environment is one of the main ways that play builds social skills physical skills and the ability to properly judge risk. Play also strengthens friendships.

When girls started spending hours each day on Instagram they lost many of the benefits of play. (Boys lost less and may even have gained when they took up multiplayer fantasy games especially those that put them into teams.) The wrong photo can lead to school-wide or even national infamy cyberbullying from strangers and a permanent scarlet letter. Performative social media also puts girls into a trap: Those who choose not to play the game are cut off from their classmates. Instagram and more recently TikTok have become wired into the way teens interact much as the telephone became essential to past generations.

Evelyn Douek: 1 billion TikTok users understand what Congress doesn’t

Facebook’s researchers understand the implications of this rewiring. In one slide from an internal presentation on Instagram’s mental-health effects the presenter notes that “parents can’t understand and don’t know how to help.” The slide explains: “Today’s parents came of age in a time before smartphones and social media but social media has fundamentally changed the landscape of adolescence.”

Social-media platforms were not initially designed for children but children have nevertheless been the subject of a gigantic national experiment testing the effects of those platforms. Without a proper control group we can’t be certain that the experiment has been a catastrophic failure but it probably has been. Until someone comes up with a more plausible explanation for what has happened to Gen Z girls the most prudent course of action for regulators legislators and parents is to take steps to mitigate the harm. Here are three:

First Congress should pass legislation compelling Facebook Instagram and all other social-media platforms to allow academic researchers access to their data. One such bill is the Platform Transparency and Accountability Act proposed by the Stanford University researcher Nate Persily.

Second Congress should toughen the 1998 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. An early version of the legislation proposed 16 as the age at which children should legally be allowed to give away their data and their privacy. Unfortunately e-commerce companies lobbied successfully to have the age of “internet adulthood” set instead at 13. Now more than two decades later today’s 13-year-olds are not doing well. Federal law is outdated and inadequate. The age should be raised. More power should be given to parents less to companies.

Third while Americans wait for lawmakers to act parents can work with local schools to establish a norm: Delay entry to Instagram and other social platforms until high school.

Right now families are trapped. I have heard many parents say that they don’t want their children on Instagram but they allow them to lie about their age and open accounts because well that’s what everyone else has done. Dismantling such traps takes coordinated action and the principals of local elementary and middle schools are well placed to initiate that coordination.

Haugen’s revelations have brought America to a decision point. If public officials do nothing the current experiment will keep running—to Facebook’s benefit and teen girls’ detriment. The preponderance of the evidence is damning. Instead of waiting for certainty and letting Facebook off the hook again we should hold it and other social-media companies accountable. They must change their platforms and their ways.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzIxLzIyNzk0NjIyL21lc3Nlbmdlci1pbnN0YWdyYW0tZW5kLXRvLWVuZC1lbmNyeXB0aW9uLWRlZmF1bHQtMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook Messenger and Instagram may not get default end-to-end encryption until 2023,"Meta — Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp’s parent company — doesn’t plan to roll out end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default on Messenger and Instagram until 2023 first reported by The Guardian.

The company merged Messenger and Instagram chats last year as a part of its plan to create a unified messaging system across all of its platforms. And while messages sent through Messenger and Instagram can be E2EE that option isn’t turned on by default — and likely won’t be — until sometime in 2023. WhatsApp already supports E2EE by default.

Meta wants to keep users safe while still “assisting public safety efforts”

In a post in The Telegraph Antigone Davis Meta’s head of safety attributes the delay to concerns about user safety. Since E2EE means only the sender and recipient will see their conversations Davis says Meta wants to ensure that this doesn’t interfere with the platform’s ability to help stop criminal activity. Once E2EE does become available by default Davis notes that the company will “use a combination of non-encrypted data across our apps account information and reports from users” to help keep them safe all while “assisting public safety efforts.”

In a blog post earlier this year Meta said that default E2EE would become available on Instagram and Messenger “sometime in 2022 at the earliest.” But now Davis says that Meta wants to “get this right” so the company plans on delaying the feature’s debut until 2023.

Also going into effect in 2023 is the UK’s Online Safety bill which will require online platforms to keep children from harm as well as promptly address abusive content. This may impede Facebook’s plans to enable E2EE by default as the UK’s Home Secretary Priti Patel has criticized its use in the past. According to a report from BBC Patel claims E2EE could make it more difficult to prevent child abuse online stating: “Sadly at a time when we need to be taking more action... Facebook is still pursuing E2EE plans that place the good work and the progress that has already been made at jeopardy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzIxL2ZhY2Vib29rLWNyaXRpY3MtbG92ZS13aGlzdGxlYmxvd2VyLWZyYW5jZXMtaGF1Z2Vucy1sZWFrcy1idXQtaGF0ZS1oZXItcG9saWN5LWlkZWFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook critics love whistleblower Frances Haugen's leaks but hate her policy ideas,"Facebook critics have a Frances Haugen problem: Many love that the whistleblower leaked a trove of documents exposing many of the tech giant’s worst problems — but hate her ideas on how to solve them.

Haugen has repeatedly insisted that breaking up Meta Platforms — the company that owns Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp and which changed its name from Facebook last month amid a torrent of bad press — will not solve the issues she has helped uncover. Those include Instagram’s toxic effects on teen mental health and the company’s struggles to crack down on human trafficking.

Instead Haugen has insisted in interviews and in Congressional testimony that the company’s woes are mainly the result of poor leadership under Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg who has deployed algorithms that run its social-networking apps to incentivize engagement at any cost.

“These systems are going to continue to exist and be dangerous even if broken up” Haugen told Congress in October.

Such comments have left bad tastes in the mouths of many Meta critics who initially praised Haugen’s leaks as a breakthrough as they seek to hold Facebook accountable for its increasingly outsize power.

“She turned over the documents — great” Mike Davis head of the conservative anti-Big Tech group the Internet Accountability Project told The Post. “Thank you for your service. Now go away.”

“She’s not a policy expert especially not in antitrust” said Davis who previously worked for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and supports a slate of House antitrust bills including one that could break up Meta Google and other big tech firms.

Instead of slicing the company into pieces Haugen told lawmakers that the government should leave Meta whole and create a new regulator that would be able to request company data and force changes to its algorithms.

“There needs to be a regulatory home where someone like me could do a tour of duty after working at a place like this” Haugen said.

Haugen doubled down on the idea in a Vogue interview on Tuesday saying that calls to break up the company are “so reductive” and could even violate the first amendment.

“At which point the way we will get change is if like we have 18-year-olds having dance parties outside Mark Zuckerberg’s house” added Haugen in the interview which was accompanied by a photoshoot.

4 “Thank you for your service. Now go away” Mike Davis of the conservative Internet Accountability Project said of Frances Haugen. AP

But Haugen’s belief that Meta’s harms do not inherently come from its size but rather from its leadership and a lack of oversight is misguided according to Matt Stoller an antitrust expert and former adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

“The documents were useful but she’s not relevant” Stoller told The Post adding that Haugen “doesn’t really have any understanding of the core problem.”

“She basically agrees with Mark Zuckerberg” he added. “She wants Mark Zuckerberg to be nicer.”

A prominent Republican lobbyist also slammed Haugen arguing that opening Facebook up to greater competition would help address issues including Instagram’s negative effects on teens.

“Haugen and her largely Democratic supporters are looking at the wrong solution” the lobbyist told The Post.

“We do not need a super speech regulator” the lobbyist added. “We need to solve the market power problem.”

4 Facebook could be forced to sell off assets like Instagram and WhatsApp if its most stringent critics get their way. AP

Influential digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation meanwhile has sought to thread the needle by using Haugen’s testimony to bolster their case for breaking up the company without acknowledging that she opposes the idea.

“Facebook’s broken system is fueled by a growth-at-any-cost model as indicated by some of the testimony Haugen delivered to Congress” the group wrote in November. “In other words Facebook’s badness is inextricably tied to its bigness.”

“Requiring Facebook to divest Instagram WhatsApp and possibly other acquisitions and limiting the companies’ future mergers and acquisitions would go a long way toward solving some of the problems with the company and inject competition into a field where it’s been stifled for many years now” the Electronic Frontier Foundation added.

Ahead of Culpo’s big day the couple — who made their relationship Instagram official back in February — enjoyed a night out in Manhattan. After Culpo posted the photos of the evening on Instagram Berrios upped his flirting game in the comments.

“Tryna date?” Berrios asked Culpo who then replied “@braxtonberrios call me 555-9858.”

Perhaps Berrios and the Jets can get Culpo a win Sunday as a belated birthday gift."

PPV schedule main card start time for 2021 fight,"Terence Crawford has not let anyone come close to claiming his WBO welterweight title belt.

He won the belt in a TKO against Jeff Horn on June 9 2018 and he has retained it with four straight TKOs with his most recent defense coming on Nov. 14 2020 against Kell Brook.

Shawn Porter is looking to change that. Porter who once held the WBC welterweight title will be matched up against his latest challenge in pursuit of reclaiming a belt on Saturday.

Crawford hasn't faced a challenger quite to the level of Porter. At 37-0 with 28 knockouts Crawford has dominated his competition but he has yet to face one of the top names in boxing as he has ascended to the level where he is now considered one of the top three pound for pound boxers in the world.

Porter has plenty of big names on his resume that has seen him fight out to a 31-3-1 record with 17 knockouts. He first won the IBF welterweight title in 2013 against Devon Alexander before losing it two fights later in 2014 to Brook. He fought and lost Keith Thurman for the WBA welterweight title in 2016 and won the WBC welterweight belt in 2018 against Danny Garcia before losing it in a fight with Errol Spence Jr. in a fight for the IBF welterweight in 2019.

When Terence Crawford knocked out Jeff Horn to win a piece of the welterweight title in June 2018 he immediately called for a marquee fight.

“I want the other champions” he said from the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. “I want the big fights.”

And yet more than three years later he still hasn’t been in a so-called big fight. But that changes Saturday at Michelob Ultra Arena where the undefeated Omaha Nebraska native defends his WBO welterweight belt against Shawn Porter in the main event of an ESPN+ pay-per-view card.

In the meantime Crawford (37-0 28 knockouts) has been essentially treading water while those big fights have taken place without him. Errol Spence Jr. beat Porter and Danny Garcia. Yordenis Ugas defeated Manny Pacquiao. Crawford has racked up wins against fighters who either no one has heard of or in the case of Amir Khan and Kell Brook no one realized were still active fighters.

Porter (31-3-1 17 KOs) isn’t Spence but he’s a legitimate top-five welterweight easily the best opponent of Crawford’s career. And this matchup comes at a critical time for Crawford who will be a promotional free agent Sunday and can chase any fight he wants.

“I respect everything that Shawn does” Crawford said. “Shawn is athletic he can box he can bang he can move around in the ring he can cut corners and take angles. I’m not going to sit here and say that I don’t respect anything that he does. I’m just going to say that I do a lot of things better than Shawn. I’m going to show him come Saturday.”

Porter is a throwback fighter with a bulldog in-your-face style and a mentality that never lets him shy away from a challenge. He has the best resume in the division.

Porter and Crawford were born within a month of each other but Porter a Las Vegas resident has the clear experience advantage.

“There are people you can get to and there are people that you can’t get to” Porter said. “I’m one of those people that you can’t get to.”

That should make for an intriguing style clash with Crawford boxing’s most lethal switch-hitter who possesses a boxing IQ levels above anyone he’s fought. He will often take a few rounds to download information about his opponent patiently waiting for openings before he turns up the pressure. He’s not normally a one-punch knockout artist but he’s stopped his past eight opponents.

Crawford is considered one of boxing’s best pound-for-pound fighters. That goes back to his success in the 140-pound division when he stopped Julius Indongo to become the first undisputed champion in more than a decade.

In the time since Crawford’s momentum has stalled as others have achieved the same feat. But Crawford doesn’t seem worried. He never does and rarely expresses himself in interviews.

“Once we signed that contract the switch was already flipped and I can’t wait to go out there Saturday to display my talent and look good doing it” he said. “Until then right now I’m just chilling.”

Crawford seems more than ready however to separate himself from Arum and the promotional company Top Rank Inc. that has represented him throughout his Hall-of-Fame run as a three-weight world champion. The 34-year-old Crawford’s contract with Top Rank expired after his division-defining 10th-round technical knockout of former welterweight champion Shawn Porter about an hour earlier at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino’s Michelob ULTRA Arena.

Now that he is a promotional free agent one of the top performers pound-for-pound in the sport obviously has a lot of options for his first fight of 2022.

“Well I’m pretty sure my decision is made already” Crawford said. “You know Bob couldn’t secure me the Spence fight when I was wit’ him. So how he gonna secure me the Spence fight when I’m not wit’ him? So you know I’m moving forward with my career right now and I wish everybody the best.”

Crawford wanted Spence more than any other welterweight but their lucrative showdown has eluded the Omaha Nebraska native since he moved up from the junior welterweight division early in 2018. Top Rank paid Crawford very well during their partnership often for fights that the supremely talented Crawford was heavily favored to win.

The unbeaten WBO welterweight champion reportedly earned approximately $10 million in combined guarantees for his past two fights – stoppages of former IBF welterweight champ Kell Brook a year ago and Porter. Crawford (38-0 29 KOs) was consistently listed by credible Internet sportsbooks as at least a 7-1 favorite to beat Porter (31-4-1 17 KOs) but Porter who is also 34 was the most accomplished tested welterweight Crawford fought in six appearances as a 147-pound boxer.

England’s Brook beat Porter by majority decision to win the IBF belt in August 2014. Brook (39-3 27 KOs) had already been battered however by middleweight knockout artist Gennadiy Golovkin and Spence both of whom left Brook with fractured orbital bones before Crawford stopped him in the fourth round of their November 2020 bout at MGM Grand Conference Center.

Arum’s expression didn’t change late Saturday night when Crawford pointed out that his outspoken promoter couldn’t secure the showdown with Spence.

Before their press conference began Arum told BoxingScene.com and other outlets that he believes another high-profile fight against Scottish southpaw Josh Taylor (17-0 13 KOs) boxing’s undisputed junior welterweight champion would do bigger business in the United Kingdom than Crawford-Spence would do in the United States. Arum’s company promotes Taylor thus Crawford would have to work with Top Rank in some capacity to get that fight even if he doesn’t want to sign another multi-fight deal.

When asked to clarify his aforementioned statement regarding the “decision” he declared he has already made Crawford offered a vague response.

“I don’t know” Crawford said. “I’m gonna let my little head-butt heal up. And then you know we gonna go to the drawing board and see what’s best for Terence Crawford and his career moving forward.”

Saturday night is Fight Night in Las Vegas where Mandalay Bay’s Michelob Ultra Arena will host an elite boxing match pitting Las Vegas resident Shawn Porter (31-3-1) against undefeated WBO welterweight champion Terence Crawford (37-0).

Las Vegas-based Top Rank Boxing along with Premier Boxing Championship are promoting this big fight. Crawford is known as the boogeyman of the welterweight division as he’s been avoided by nearly every Premier Boxing Championship promotions current and former titlist with the exception of his longtime friend Porter.

The two will put the friendship aside and commit to 30 minutes of punching each other in the face for the sake of Pay-Per-View dollars and a championship belt this weekend. LVSportsBiz.com was there to ask Porter about careers outside the ring:

ADVERTISEMENTS

ADVERTISEMENTS

Competing at the highest level is nothing new for Porter. He’s an athlete pushed to excel by his father Kenny for his entire life.

It began with running in circles around his dad at the tender age of five with a football in his hand. The gridiron was supposed to be his escape from the rough neighborhoods where at the age of four his father went on a mission with his three-year-old brother to find their mother. She ran numbers as Kenny explains out of a drug house not far from their home. Kenny’s younger brother was killed while crossing the street after being struck by a drunk driver.

The younger Porter inherited his father’s drive to escape the neighborhood and became an all-conference running back at Stow-Munroe Falls High School outside Akron Ohio. He eventually passed up the opportunity to play college football to pursue a professional boxing career.

The tenacious puncher known for his gritty pugilist style also happens to live in the age of athletes becoming brands and extending their earning potential beyond their sport. Porter’s business success is coming through his insightful firsthand work as an analyst on Fox’s Premier Boxing Champions studio shows. It’s the network’s cornerstone show for boxing.

LVSportsBiz.com asked Porter when he began to see the blueprint to the boxing business and began minding the boxing business as well as being a fighter. “I grew into this and these fighters these young fighters that are coming up they gonna have to grow up fast.”

“A big inspiration for me was Shaquille O’Neil” Porter also added during this week’s media events. “I’ve seen what he’s done with his career and his investments beyond basketball. You can’t turn on the TV without seeing Shaq in a commercial or analyzing a game like he does on TNT. I’ve told this story before. It’s important to acknowledge what the pastor at my church just told me ‘Personality gets you in the door character keeps you in the room.’ ”

Donned with aggressively patterned suits and a megawatt smile Porter has personality for days. He’s not the slick car salesy kind; that is he’s a genuine tell-it-like-it-is broadcaster that fans respect and have come to rely upon during big fight nights like the recent Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder III championship event in October. Porter’s high-gear personality has been critical in promoting this fight while Crawford not known for his penchant for promotion of any kind has had very little to say during any of the scheduled marketing events.

Because of the nature of boxing and the unpredictability of big payday fights especially during the pandemic it served the Ohio native well to understand how to parlay his personality and the importance of having additional streams of revenue outside of the ring. While still fighting at the top level in the welterweight division Porter has also been a featured commentator for the 2020/21 Summer Olympics boxing coverage. He was a primary commentator for NBC’s Ring City USA plus Fox Sports 2 and Triller Fite Club spectacle this year. In 2020 Porter launched The Porter Way Podcast along with two co-hosts that focuses on boxing and other trending sports topics.

Even the best professional athletes only have a small window of time to compete amongst the elite of their peers. When it comes time to retire some stay involved in sports. But many athletes’ second careers are set up well before the final bell rings. Unlike leagues like the NBA and NFL there’s no organized financial literacy or marketing seminar for boxers provided by their promoters.

The 34-year-old father of two toddler boys offers advice anywhere a microphone is available to him. During the final press conference for his match with Crawford Top Rank Boxing Crawford’s promoter announced the recent signing of 2020 Olympians Keyshawn Davis and Richard Torrez.

When we asked him if he had any words of advice for the sport’s newest professionals he responded “These athletes today they have social media now. They have a presence now that they didn’t have it when I was growing into this sport. I was 20-21 years old and didn’t have everything that they do now. So yeah I will encourage those guys to learn the business learn what’s going on learn the behind the scenes and understand your contracts.”

Porter’s dad was an ever-present and critical fixture in his career boxed and coached throughout his childhood. “Everything I didn’t care about my dad kept pushing me on it even though I didn’t care about it. Guess what once I had to call on it I knew what I was doing and I knew what I was talking about. So I will definitely impress upon those guys to start knowing it all. Know your place as a fighter but also know that your place as a fighter is also to know the business as well.”

As for the business of his fight with Terence Crawford the WBO mandated fight was agreed upon with a 60-40 revenue split in favor of Crawford this summer. Porter comes in as a sizable underdog.

As of Friday afternoon Caesars Sportsbook listed Crawford as a 7-1 favorite to beat Porter in their 12-round fight. While that’s a testament to Crawford’s skill and perceived dominance as a boxer it still seems to slight Porter. The former IBF/WBC welterweight champion has lost only a majority decision to three former champions including a previously unbeaten Kell Brook a debatable unanimous decision to then-undefeated Keith Thurman and a split decision to Errol Spence Jr. who remains the unbeaten WBC belt holder.

“I really don’t care if I’m an underdog” Porter said at a press conference at Mandalay Bay. “I really don’t care what the betting lines are like. I don’t wanna justify why they’re making the lines the way that they’re making them. So the best thing I’m gonna do is go in that ring and punch Terence Crawford in the mouth. And people that win money they win. The people that lose money they lose.”

Regardless of whether you think he’ll win or lose the boxer is also a businessman and wants fans to buy the PPV. The telecast which will start at 9PM ET and 6PM PT costs $69.99 and also requires at least a one-month subscription to ESPN+ ($6.99)."

Samsung will have some competition in this market now as Micron has also unveiled its LPDDR5X memory chips.

Micron's new LPDDR5X memory was announced during the MediaTek Executive Summit this week MediaTek has already validated Micron's LPDDR5X memory to be used alongside its new chip – the Dimensity 9000 5G which should begin popping up in smartphones soon. The MediaTek Dimensity 9000 is the first to support LPDDR5X memory offering a peak bandwidth of 60Gbps when combined.

Aimed at 5G applications and high-end smartphones Micron's LPDDR5X memory is based on Micron's 1α DRAM technology which allows it to support data rates up to 7.5Gbps with samples going up to 8.533Gbps (JEDEC LPDDR5X standard) launching soon after. At 8.533Gbps LPDDR5X memory is 33% faster than standard LPDDR5 memory.

Besides MediaTek Micron is also working with other chipset vendors and smartphone manufacturers to optimise their products to its LPDDR5X memory.

KitGuru news: As the need for higher bandwidth in mobile devices increases LPDDR5X will slowly become the standard. At the moment it's completely new and no devices feature such memory. However it will eventually be as common as LPDDR5 and soon you'll probably find it inside almost every smartphone even your own.

At its annual tech day the specifications and plans for DDR6 LPDDR6 and GDDR7 memory were detailed. With DDR6 we’re looking at a doubling in bandwidth to 12800 MT/s (from 6400 MT/s on DDR5) and twice as many memory channels per DIMM. While DDR5 adopts a dual-channel architecture DDR6 plans to increase it to a quad-channel design. The number of memory banks also increases to 64 four times as much as DDR4. DDR5 memory is still in the early phase of development so don’t expect to buy a 12800 MT/s kit anytime in the near future.

JEDEC-Module Overclocked DDR4 up to 3200 MT / s up to 5600 MT / s DDR5 up to 6400 MT / s up to 8400 MT / s DDR6 up to 12800 MT / s up to 17000 MT / s

In the mobile segment we have LPDDR6 memory. As the low power equivalent of DDR6 it’ll cut down on power consumption while simultaneously increasing the throughput. While LPDDR5 tops out at 6400 MT/s and LPDDR5X extends it to 8500 MT/s LPDDR6 memory will push it to as much as 17000 MT/s the same as overclocked DDR6 modules. The mass production of LPDDR5 chips has already begun while LPDDR5x will begin mass production in early 2022 using the 1anm process.

For gamers and graphics enthusiasts we have the GDDR6 memory standard. At present GDDR6 tops out at 18 Gbps with Micron’s GDDR6X modules enabling speeds of up to 20Gbps (thanks to PAM4). Samsung is planning to increase the throughput of GDDR6 to 24 Gbps with its GDDR6+ chips based on the 1z mm process. AMD’s Radeon RX 6000 refresh may leverage these faster chips.

For GDDR7 we’re looking at a 33% increase in bandwidth to 32 Gbps. Not many details regarding GDDR7 have been shared at this point. The only major feature we know is known as “real-time error protection” which I reckon is similar to on-die ECC.

Finally there’s the matter of next-gen HBM3 memory primarily used in data center CPUs and GPUs. Samsung promises per pin speeds of 800GB/s for HBM 3 and 450GB/s for HBM2e. SK Hynix already released the specs of its HBM3 memory a while back (819 GB/s) with plans to integrate it into GPUs/CPUs in 2022."

Ed Fries one of the original team members at Microsoft that co-created the Xbox shared his behind-the-scenes stories from his time at the tech giant as part of a celebration of the Xbox project’s 20th anniversary.

Fries spoke at the WN Conference in Seattle last week as part of a discussion hosted by Venturebeat’s Dean Takahashi author of the 2002 non-fiction book Opening the Xbox. In an hour-long conversation with Takahashi Fries talked about the Xbox console its development his personal history with it and his current business a venture capital fund that specifically invests in up-and-coming game developers.

Fries came up through Microsoft in the ’80s after the video game crash of 1983 forced him as he put it onstage to “get a real job” instead of pursuing game design. He worked his way up at Microsoft as a young programmer working on Excel and Word before taking over Microsoft’s then-nascent games division in 1995 a move that multiple Microsoft vice presidents told him was “career suicide.”

After scoring a hit for the company with the original 1997 Age of Empires Fries was still the lead at the games division when a group of what he called “evangelists” including Seamus Blackley met with him to pitch the project that ended up becoming the original Xbox. That put Fries in the position of leading the Xbox team from the project getting approved on Valentine’s Day of 2000 up to its launch on Nov. 15 2001.

Fries later left Microsoft in 2004 after shipping dozens of games and playing a role in Microsoft’s acquisitions of Rare (Battletoads) the now-defunct Lionhead Studios (Fable) and Bungie (Halo). He subsequently raised two sons founded a company called Figure Prints that specializes in creating models of customers’ World of Warcraft characters and currently works as a general partner at 1UP Ventures.

Some of the fun facts to know and tell about the Xbox that Fries shared during the chat include:

Microsoft’s early attempts to break further into the video game industry included failed attempts to buy Electronic Arts (Madden Apex Legends) and Westwood Studios (Command & Conquer) in the ’90s.

The Xbox project was so expensive at its outset that an unnamed Microsoft VIP left the company rather than deal with it telling Fries that “I like to work on businesses that make money.”

At the same time however Microsoft was pulling in so much revenue on both Office and Windows that the expenses for creating the Xbox still weren’t big enough to affect the company’s overall bottom line. In terms of growing Microsoft’s business “Almost nothing else we could propose made sense to do” said Fries noting that at the same time Sony’s relatively new PlayStation had risen to provide 40% of the company’s profit. “If we won it was going to be worthwhile.”

The original Xbox team was described by Fries as a group of PC developers trying to understand the console market which was effectively ruled by Japanese studios at the time. The question among the original Xbox team was whether it could effectively bring some of the then-current developments in PC gaming such as multiplayer first-person shooters to the console space. That debate was settled according to Fries when the Xbox launched; “Halo took off and [notoriously weird platformer and Xbox exclusive] Oddworld: Munch’s Oddysee did not.”

The Xbox project was a money sink on both the hardware and software sides with Fries estimating it lost $1 billion per year for Microsoft until he left the company. Considering the current revenue that the Xbox brings in for Microsoft however Fries calls it “a bet that was worth making.”

Steve Ballmer was so excited about Xbox Live that in 2003 in a meeting with Fries and Xbox newcomer Peter Moore he punctuated his sentences by pounding on the table in the conference room. This led to Ballmer accidentally destroying the meeting room’s speakerphone.

The biggest mistake with the original Xbox as per Fries was that the hardware “was not at all designed to be cost-reducible.” Unlike Sony and Nintendo who owned the IP to their console hardware Microsoft had designed the Xbox to use parts from both Intel and Nvidia. The Xbox also unlike its competition contained an internal hard drive that couldn’t conveniently be shrunken down.

As a result while Sony was able to repeatedly redesign the PlayStation 2 into smaller “slimline” models as its hardware got cheaper there was effectively no way for Microsoft to do the same thing. This is what led to the first Xbox’s relatively short life cycle with its successor the Xbox 360 launching a scant four years later.

One of the factors that led to Microsoft losing money on the Xbox’s software was that at the time first-party exclusives like Halo were limited to only being sold on Microsoft’s own console. “If they really wanted me to make the business profitable” Fries said “I would put out a PlayStation version of Halo. It’d be profitable tomorrow.” This mirrors Microsoft’s current strategy with the Xbox Series X|S which has almost no traditional exclusives.

Microsoft has filmed a documentary about the start of the Xbox a process Fries called “the train to hell” which was announced at its own anniversary celebration on Nov. 15. Power On: The Story of Xbox is planned to debut on IMDB TV YouTube and other streaming networks on Dec. 13 with commentary from Fries.

The WN Conference is a business-to-business and networking event for the international games industry hosted by a Russia-based events company of the same name. Before 2020 it was typically held three times a year in Moscow St. Petersburg and assorted cities in Europe. Its 2021 show in Seattle at the Washington State Convention Center is WN’s first conference in the US.

The event was previously known as the White Nights Conference which references the period of time during summer in St. Petersburg when due to how far north the city is the sun never quite goes down. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck its events team moved the conference online and shortened its name to simply WN which informally now stands for “Worldwide Networking.”

But if you're still using Microsoft's older OS don't stress. Microsoft will continue to support Windows 10 until Oct. 14 2025. (The Windows 10 November 2021 update is now available.) That gives you about four years to prepare as Microsoft slowly moves its billion-plus Windows users to Windows 11.

The company's new OS will continue the Windows 11 rollout through mid-2022. You can expect a brand-new design that borrows a Mac-like look and includes updated features. For instance the Windows Start Menu gets a refresh that moves it to a different place on the screen and a few productivity features that can help with multitasking. There's also a change to make Android apps more readily available on Windows 11 coming soon.

Read more: Windows 11 is familiar but fresh

As many people prepare to update their Windows laptops and desktops to the latest software what happens to PCs still running Windows 10 in 2025? We'll explain. And here are some big differences between Windows 10 and Windows 11 that you can look forward to. This story was recently updated.

What does it mean for Microsoft to end support for Windows 10?

As it did with Windows 7 in January 2020 Microsoft will pull active support for Windows 10 in 2025. You'll still be able to use the software but you won't get any more security updates. There also won't be any new features added to the software. Instead Microsoft is shifting its focus to Windows 11 which comes with Android apps desktop widgets and new Xbox gaming features for the PC.

Watch this: Windows 11 review: New OS has us asking update or wait? 08:32

Will I have to switch to Windows 11?

Probably not. Many people are still running Windows 7 and 8 on their computers and never switched to Windows 10. However it's recommended to use the most up-to-date software so you get security updates. Without security updates your computer is at risk for malware and other vulnerabilities that can expose you to hacks viruses and more.

Will Windows 11 be completely free to upgrade?

Yes. Free upgrades to eligible Windows 10 PCs will be available from Oct. 5. The free upgrades will continue into 2022. If you're still running Windows 7 but want to upgrade to Windows 11 you'll first need to upgrade to Windows 10 to be eligible.

When will Windows 11 support end?

Since Windows 11 is so new we likely won't have an answer to that for years to come. When support ends Microsoft 10 will have been around for 10 years so Windows 11 could have a similar timeline.

Earlier this month the Japanese publisher said it had agreed a deal that will see it develop “large-scale global games in a next-generation development environment built on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform”.

On Friday further details on the deal emerged via newly-published comments from Sega’s recent fiscal meeting in which it moved to clarify that it wouldn’t be releasing games exclusively for Microsoft.

“We already have a very close business relationship with Microsoft. We outsourced the development of their large-scale titles and as a third party we are supplying a variety of titles” the company said referring to its studios’ work on Halo Wars 2 and Age of Empires 4.

“When we announced the concept of Super Game Microsoft was sympathetic to that vision and that leads to the announcement this time.

“About this we are not talking about releasing games to Microsoft exclusively but rather to develop Super Game that will be delivered to the world together with their technical support.”

The Japanese publisher has committed to a new ‘super game’ initiative this year a mid to long-term strategy aimed at creating a “major global title” focusing on the pillars of “global” “online” “community” and “IP utilization”.

In the company’s annual report published this month parent company SegaSammy said it would consider investing up to ¥100.0 billion ($882 million) over the next five years to achieve its ‘super game’ ambitions.

This investment could be spent on not only its internal development resources and in-development games but also on the acquisition of other companies either in Japan or abroad.

Sega has one of the largest studio networks of any Japanese company. Since the acquisition of UK-based Creative Assembly (known for Total War) in 2005 it’s gone on to acquire Sports Interactive (Football Manager) Relic (Age of Empires IV) Atlus (Persona) Amplitude (Humankind) and Two Point (Two Point Hospital).

In SegaSammy’s annual report it suggested that any future acquisitions would be considered based on how they can complement its existing developers.

Microsoft has been openly licensing its cloud server technology to games companies in recent years. Microsoft and Sony announced a “strategic partnership” in May 2019 which will result in the PlayStation maker using Microsoft Azure data centres for cloud gaming and content streaming services.

""I analysed the credentials entered from over >25 million brute force attacks against SSH. This is around 30 days of data in Microsoft's sensor network"" said Ross Bevington a security researcher at Microsoft.

""77% of attempts used a password between 1 and 7 characters. A password over 10 characters was only seen in 6% of cases"" said Bevington who works as Head of Deception at Microsoft a position in which he's tasked with creating legitimate-looking honeypot systems in order to study attacker trends.

Bevington says that only 7% of the brute-force attempts he analyzed in the sample data included a special character. In addition 39% actually had at least one number and none of the brute-force attempts used passwords that included white space.

The researcher's findings suggest that longer passwords that include special characters are most likely safe from the vast majority of brute-force attacks as long as they haven't been leaked online and are not part of attackers' brute-forcing dictionaries.

RDP brute-force attacks tripled this year

In addition Bevington said that based on data from more than 14 billion brute-force attacks attempted against Microsoft's network of honeypot servers —also known as a sensor network— until September this year attacks on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers have tripled compared to 2020 seeing a rise of 325%.

Network printing services also saw an increase of 178% as well as Docker and Kubernetes systems which saw an increase of 110%.

""Stats on SSH & VNC are just as bad - they just hasn't changed that much since last year"" Bevington said.

""By default solutions like RDP are turned off but if you decide to turn them on don't put stuff straight on the Internet. Remember that attackers will go after any brute forcible remote admin protocol. If you must have yours accessible on the Internet use strong passwords managed identity MFA"" the Microsoft manager said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LXRvLXNldC11cC1saWJyZW9mZmljZS13cml0ZXItbGlrZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtd29yZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Quickly Set Up LibreOffice Writer to Run Like Microsoft Word,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LXRvLXNldC11cC1saWJyZW9mZmljZS13cml0ZXItbGlrZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtd29yZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

PolitiFact.com

Viral Tweet says: ""Bill Gates just admitted that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines don’t work well.""

PolitiFact's Ruling: False

Here's why: A clip of Bill Gates is being taken out of context online with claims that it shows the billionaire openly acknowledging that the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective.

""Bill Gates just admitted that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines don’t work well"" reads one Twitter post that shared the 27-second clip.

""For those who have not seen it this is an explicit acknowledgement that the mRNA and rAdV vaccines for COVID are not working well"" another said.

This distorts Gates’ words and the clip only shows a snippet of a longer conversation he had Nov. 5 with Jeremy Hunt Britain’s former health secretary. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation called the claim false.

The interview was hosted by a British think tank called Policy Exchange and covered topics such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The part that’s highlighted in the tweets comes toward the end when Hunt asked Gates about pandemic preparedness.

Around the video’s 27-minute mark Gates said:

""It was 2015 that I gave the TED talk and wrote a number of papers titled ‘we’re not ready for the next pandemic’ and sadly that was a better forecast of what would happen than anyone would have wished for. The economic damage the deaths it’s been completely horrific.

""And I would expect that will lead the R&D (research and development) budgets to be focused on things we didn’t have today. We didn’t have vaccines that block transmission. We got vaccines that help you with your health but they only slightly reduce the transmission. We need a new way of doing the vaccines.""

COVID-19 vaccines do not entirely block transmission of the virus. But they continue to protect against severe disease. And studies show that fully vaccinated people are less likely to contract and spread the virus than unvaccinated people.

Still Gates never said that any of the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective or ""don’t work."" Rather he suggests that resources need to be allocated to help scientists develop new types of vaccines that halt transmission while also offering protection from diseases — something that researchers have already started to look into.

These posts are False.

(Mainichi/Hidenori Yazawa)

About 70% of Japan's population is fully vaccinated against the coronavirus but of the 1325 people who had died as of Oct. 24 after receiving their shots the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare says a causal relationship between vaccination and death cannot be confirmed for 99% or 1317 cases. Why is this?

""Instead of just saying it 'can't be evaluated' I want them to draw a proper conclusion"" said Yuji Okamoto 63. His son Hiroyuki a resident of the city of Higashihiroshima in Hiroshima Prefecture died aged 30 after getting his second Moderna Inc. vaccine shot. Though Yuji asked the health ministry about the causal relationship between the vaccine and his son's death he still hasn't received a convincing answer.

Hiroyuki got his second shot on Aug. 22. The next day he developed a fever so he took an antipyretic and recovered on Aug. 24. But despite him then going to work he was found dead in his futon the next morning. Hiroyuki had no underlying health issues or allergies. The vaccine administered to him was manufactured on the same line and at the same time as batches found to be contaminated with foreign objects but his death certificate after a judicial autopsy says his cause of death is ""unknown.""

Of the 1325 people who died after getting COVID shots as of Oct. 24 1279 had Pfizer Inc. shots and 46 received Moderna vaccines. Deaths tend to be higher among those receiving Pfizer vaccines which are widely available to elderly people.

Experts have concluded that an overwhelming number of the deaths following COVID shots cannot be evaluated. Of the 1325 cases it was ruled that a causal relationship between vaccines and deaths could not be confirmed in 1317 -- including 1272 in which people received Pfizer shots -- due to a lack of information and other reasons. Experts have drawn conclusions for just eight people. In all of these eight cases they say a causal relationship between vaccination and their deaths cannot be confirmed.

Among the 1325 the most common causes of death included ischemic heart disease heart failure and strokes. Eighty-four percent of the deceased were aged 65 or older. Because elderly people are more likely to die from chronic illnesses investigation can be difficult. Eight individuals whose deaths were said to have no causal relationship were considered to have suffered from the progression of chronic diseases such as cancer.

But Hiroyuki was young and had no chronic conditions. His father said angrily ""Even if the national government tells me I should be convinced (by what they've presented) that will never happen.""

How exactly are deaths after receiving coronavirus shots investigated?

Japan has a national adverse reaction reporting system for vaccines. When an inoculated person dies doctors on site and medical institutions must based on autopsy results and other information conclude whether the death is ""related"" ""not related"" or ""cannot be evaluated"" due to a causal relationship with the vaccine and report it to the national government.

The reports are first checked by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency an independent incorporated administrative body then by the health ministry's expert committee for the national government to verify whether the evaluations are appropriate.

Many experts are involved in the decision but in reality as many as 99% of cases are classed as ""cannot be evaluated."" One reason for such a high figure is that various causes of deaths other than from vaccines can occur coincidentally. Furthermore it is necessary to draw a comparison with the uninoculated to determine if a symptom is an adverse reaction but no such database exists in Japan.

""It's difficult to assess in a short period of time whether a death was due to the vaccine or not"" a senior health ministry official explained. The World Health Organization has not requested cause of death determinations for individual cases and it seems there are many instances where the conclusion simply remains that they can't be evaluated.

But the United States' Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) system can statistically verify the causal relationship between vaccines and symptoms occurring after inoculation. More than 12 million members of the public participated with data such as their history of vaccination and consultation at medical institutions anonymously accumulated. If adverse reaction symptoms are reported after inoculation they can be checked against the database to confirm if they are actual side effects.

Based on analysis by VSD and other methods the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated there is currently no clear causal relationship between the cases of deaths and Pfizer and Moderna's messenger RNA vaccines.

But it has also been found that myocarditis which causes inflammation including of the heart muscle can develop on very rare occasions among vaccinated younger people. This has led to an effective response including issuing warnings of the symptom as a side effect.

While the database is considered useful for drawing certain conclusions it uses personal information which needs management and protection. ""It's not possible to build (such a database system) overnight"" a senior health ministry official said.

Japan's current system for determining a causal relationship between vaccines and deaths seems to be at its limit. At this rate with vaccination rates rising in Japan the number of cases that cannot be evaluated will only increase and the public's anxiety and distrust over the vaccine will likely spread.

(Japanese original by Hidenori Yazawa Lifestyle and Medical News Department and Akihiro Nakajima Hiroshima Bureau)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdWRpZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20uc2EvYXJ0aWNsZS82MTM3ODXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US expands COVID boosters to all adults,"WASHINGTON — US regulators on Friday moved to open up COVID-19 booster shots to all adults expanding the government’s campaign to shore up protection and get ahead of rising coronavirus cases that may worsen with the holidays.





Pfizer and Moderna announced the Food and Drug Administration’s decision after at least 10 states already had started offering boosters to all adults. The latest action stands to simplify what until now has been a confusing list of who’s eligible by allowing anyone 18 or older to choose either company’s booster six months after their last dose — regardless of which vaccine they had first.





But there’s one more step: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must agree to expand Pfizer and Moderna boosters to even healthy young adults. Its scientific advisers were set to debate later Friday The Associated Press (AP) reported.





If the CDC agrees tens of millions more Americans could have three doses of protection ahead of the new year. Anyone who got the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine can already get a booster.





All three COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. offer strong protection against severe illness including hospitalization and death without boosters but protection against infection can wane with time.





Previously the government had cleared boosters of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine as well as the similar Moderna vaccine only for vulnerable groups including older Americans and people with chronic health problems.





But Pfizer last week asked the FDA to expand that decision to everyone citing new data from a study of 10000 people. Ultimately the FDA decided there was enough evidence from studies and real-world use of boosters to back the expansion for both Pfizer and Moderna.





“Streamlining the eligibility criteria and making booster doses available to all individuals 18 years of age and older will also help to eliminate confusion about who may receive a booster dose and ensure booster doses are available to all who may need one” FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said.





The move to expand comes as new COVID-19 cases have climbed steadily over the last two weeks especially in states where colder weather is driving people indoors. — Agencies",,,

Launched just a year ago MedArrive grew rapidly in 2020 by doubling the size of its team and expanding into new states. The startup facilitated thousands of home visits according to the company.

MedArrive is a care management platform that enables healthcare providers and payers to extend services into the home.

The series A funding round was led by Section 32 with participation from new investors 7wireVentures and Leaps by Bayer as well as existing investors Define Ventures Kleiner Perkins and Redesign Health.

MedArrive will use the new financing to expand its network to additional states and invest heavily in its product and platform to maximize impact.

Trigub who serves as MedArrive's CEO told Fierce Healthcare the company also plans to scale up its team.

""This is an opportunity to continue to build our team. We're proud of the team we've assembled across product engineering sales and operations"" he said. ""We see ourselves as an operating system on behalf of payers and providers and this allows us to continue to expand our coverage in more markets than where we are today and grow our partnerships.""

MedArrive connects payers and providers to a network of EMTs paramedics and other skilled healthcare workers to extend care into the home. As the pandemic continues to accelerate the adoption of virtual health—with 40% of U.S. consumers planning to use telehealth moving forward—MedArrive is bridging the virtual care gap by combining physician-led telemedicine with hands-on care from the comfort and safety of the patient’s home according to the company.

Key services include episodic care such as vaccinations and monoclonal antibody treatments along with Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set gap closure and risk assessment to identify and address patients’ preventive care needs.

MedArrive plans to expand into new uses cases for chronic care management to help prevent emergency department visits.

Forrester predicts that the number of hospitals that deliver care at home will triple in 2022. The pandemic was a major catalyst for shifting acute hospital care into patients’ homes given the need to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and limit surge capacity.

The trend of shifting more health services to patients' homes is a major tailwind for companies like MedArrive.

In 2019 national spending on home health care reached a high of $113.5 billion a 40% increase from 2013 according to the most recent data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

""Fundamentally we think the future of care is in the home. There is a large market opportunity a lot of white space; this is not winner take all"" he said. ""The hospital of the future will be the ER OR and ICU and the vast majority of services will move into the home.""

He noted that MedArrive has a unique approach by connecting through payers and providers rather than operating as direct-to-consumer and utilizes a unique workforce by tapping the skills of EMS professionals.

MedArrive taps into a capable workforce of EMS professionals so they can leverage the full scope of their training earn supplemental income and diversify their day-to-day responsibilities. At the same time patients using MedArrive are able to access trusted medical expertise from the safety of their homes and within their existing health systems.

MedArrive has established nearly a dozen partnerships with large national and regional health plans including SCAN Health Plan Clover Health Bright HealthCare and Molina Healthcare as well as accountable care organizations and government entities such as the Los Angeles Department of Health. Through these partnerships the company is currently conducting home visits across California Florida New Jersey North Carolina and Texas.

As part of the financing Andy Harrison managing partner at Section 32 will join MedArrive’s board of directors and Alyssa Jaffee partner at 7wireVentures will join as a board observer.

“The pandemic has exacerbated long-standing inefficiencies in the medical system and accelerated the transformation of healthcare delivery” said Harrison in a statement. “Over the past year MedArrive has emerged as a leader in redefining how—and where—care is delivered.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kelleher an Irishman from County Cork retired from his post at Morgan Stanley in 2019 after three decades at the U.S. investment bank including as finance director during the global financial crisis but stayed on as a special adviser.

UBS has been keen to hire a chairman with investment banking experience to work closely with former ING boss Ralph Hamers who became chief executive of Switzerland's biggest bank last year and pledged to improve its digital services after a career focused primarily on retail banking.

""UBS is pleased to propose a Board member and future Chairman who has a deep understanding of the global banking landscape"" Weber said in a statement. ""His more than 30 years of leadership experience in banking and excellent relationships around the world make Colm an ideal fit for UBS.""

The bank had been aiming to pick a new chairman by the end of the year and shareholders must now approve the appointment of Kelleher at their annual meeting on April 6.

During the financial crisis Kelleher drastically shrank Morgan Stanley's balance sheet and converted it to a traditional bank holding company so it could access funding from the U.S. Federal Reserve as well as negotiating a $9 billion investment from Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.

The esprit de corps at Morgans Stanley is legendary: the U.S. bank is rich with bankers who have spent their entire career there. UBS' designated chairman Colm Kelleher (pictured below) is one of them.

The 64-year-old Irish banker studied history at Oxford coyly telling the «Financial Times» (behind paywall) last year that he would become a professor of Byzantine history «if I were clever enough.» Instead he headed to Wall Street where he fell in with John Mack who started at Morgan Stanley as a salesman and worked his way up to CEO.

The bond between the two men is obvious: Keller put Mack next to Emperor Justinian (architect of the restoration of the Byzantine empire) in leaders he idolizes. Kelleher credited Mack «for his actions in holding Morgan Stanley together when things got very bleak.»

Having «Some Issues»

The ties were so strong that Kelleher nearly followed Mack to Credit Suisse First Boston in 2001. «Mack the Knife» famously branded CSFB at the time a «giant casino» valuing speculative bets and bonuses over long-term profits.

Kelleher almost followed Mack to Credit Suisse he told the pink paper last year. «At the time Morgan Stanley was going through some issues.» He ultimately didn't because he felt moving too frequently risks being titled a professional gun for hire.

Balance Sheet Cuts

It proved wise: Mack was ousted by his then-co-CEO Oswald Gruebel in 2004. The American investment banker returned to Morgan Stanley the following year replacing Philip Purcell as CEO.

Mack and Kelleher took up where they left off with the latter banker taking on the chief financial officer job under his mentor during the financial crisis of 2008/09. Kelleher is credited with clamping down on Morgan Stanley's balance sheet as first Bear Stearns faltered and then Lehman Brothers collapsed in October 2008.

Swiss Triumvirate

Freely admitting he would have liked Morgan Stanley's board to name him CEO after Mack he instead settled in under James Gorman who nabbed the job in 2010 instead. He left the U.S. bank two years ago though made it clear he was looking for his next job – and wanted to stay active into his 80s.

He now forms a Swiss triumvirate together with incoming deputy Lukas Gaehwiler and CEO Ralph Hamers provided shareholders vote the two men onto UBS' board in April. Credited by «The Irish Times» with a sarcastic sense of humor Kelleher is likely to bring levity to Zurich: he was known at Morgan Stanley for occassionally locking meeting participants in to discourage tardiness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sYXRpbWVzL25hbWUvZnJlZGVyaWNrLXVscmljaC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMTYxNzAyNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frederick Ulrich Obituary (1943 - 2021) - Los Angeles CA - Los Angeles Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/latimes/name/frederick-ulrich-obituary?id=31617026 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sYXRpbWVzL25hbWUvZnJlZGVyaWNrLXVscmljaC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMTYxNzAyNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Credit: PCL

As one of the largest independent general contracting construction companies in Canada PCL’s name may be familiar across the country as well as in the United States the Caribbean and Australia.

For more than a century based out of Edmonton and with offices in 28 locations across North America and Australia PCL has spearheaded a diverse roster of operations in the civil infrastructure heavy industrial and building markets. With annual construction volume of $9 billion the PCL logo is a common sight on projects across the country but many in the mining industry may not realize the company is also prepared to bring its extensive skillset to the sector.

While PCL has been involved in a variety of mining-related projects over the years working with the likes of Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO; LSE: RIO; ASX: RIO) K+S Potash Canada and Mosaic Canada the company had stepped back from the sector for a short period while concentrating on commercial work. However it is now once again providing turnkey solutions for mining projects with one part of PCL’s current focus being projects located in northern Ontario.

Two years ago PCL opened a bricks-and-mortar office in Sudbury. As the mining sector in northern Ontario not only weathered the Covid pandemic but also found itself in the midst of an exploration development and production boom PCL found itself poised to be a service provider in the region.

According to Robert Black the company’s director of business development this has led PCL to get the word out that it is ready to assist with companies in the mining community no matter the size of the project.

“We’ve been focusing on trying to reach out to those working in the region of northern Ontario essentially from Kenora all the way to the North Bay area” says Black. “Our goal has been to tell people that we’re active in the region and open for business. And at this point we want to focus on juniors and developers to get them a degree of awareness that we provide a one-stop shop for their construction services anywhere in the region. With our network of sub-trades we can partner and tackle challenging projects reliably.”

As it continues to work with the mining community in northern Ontario management understands that there are a few perceptions about the company it wants to address.

“One challenge has been ‘Oh we didn’t know you did mine projects’” says Black. “Our mining and industrial side is often overlooked. Also the concern is we’re too big.”

He points out that while PCL certainly has expertise on big budget projects such as mine development and expansion it has successfully delivered smaller-scale projects such as C$20000 energy-saving exterior retrofit or small interior office renovations or concrete work.

“We cover every size of project because we can essentially do anything anywhere” Black says. “And to be honest it’s easier working with us because you have consistent point of contact – PCL – who can shoulder responsibility and keep our clients aware of changing project info.”

According to Black one of the advantages of working with PCL is the way the company is organized to address the needs of clients and provide a cost structure that optimizes return whether the project is an office renovation a mining camp or a tailings management facility. Depending on the project scale and deliverables the company has civil buildings and special projects departments structured to meet these needs.

“We can provide the solutions that clients are looking for” emphasizes Black. “And more importantly we can scale up to match your needs. If you’re looking for a C$100000 concrete foundation job. No problem. If you’re looking for us to commit to five years and C$500 million to build out an entire mine site? We can do that too. We have the experience and the company structure to work across a range of budgets projects and locations.”

Trenton’s radio services have been facing the threat of a shutdown that would affect the ability of police fire water utility and other essential personnel to dispatch assistance and communicate during a crisis. A resolution to the problem was finally achieved when the city council voted in favor of Mayor Reed Gusciora’s plan to use $10.1 million to address the problem on November 14.

The vote followed a presentation by the Trenton Police Captain John Zappley who is responsible for the radio operations.

Motorola Solutions will receive $9.9 million to facilitate the transfer to the new system. The changes will use some funds given to the city under President Biden’s COVID-19 relief American Rescue Plan.

MPS Communication which has provided the services up to this point had planned a shutdown for October 31 citing a bill for $218000 in unpaid services. But a judge agreed to extend the city’s shut off date until December 31 2021.

According to reporting from Isaac Avilucea with the Trentonian in the past several years Trenton has had problems with Kenwood Radio System which is operated by MPS. There is a count of 345 system glitches one of which allowed a bank robber to steal $10000 in 2019.

MPS vowed to fix the communication issues when Trenton threatened to take legal action but there were still continuous problems even after a third communications tower was installed on South Broad Street.

“Communication services need to be reliable. If my house was burning I wouldn’t want to dial 911 and cross my fingers that I will receive help on the other end. That should be guaranteed” says Trenton resident Kyle Lang.

Councilwoman Kathy McBride who has been vocal and even derogatory in her disagreements with Mayor Gusciora’s leadership has fought him on the idea of replacing emergency radio equipment with a system that is compatible with the Mercer County radio system utilizing the ARP (American Rescue Plan) funds.

In an article by P. Kenneth Burns on whyy.org McBride explained that she thought a better solution and use of money would have been an overhaul of the radio room rather than just replacing equipment.

Councilwoman McBride and MPS Communications did not return phone calls and emails requesting comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhaWxkYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy9lYWdsZS12YWxsZXkvZWFnbGUtY291bnR5cy1maXJzdC1yZXNwb25kZXJzLWFyZS1ob25vcmVkLWF0LW5pZ2h0LW9mLWV4Y2VsbGVuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eagle County's first responders are honored at 'Night of Excellence',"Vail Daily Publisher Mark Wurzer left presents a “Call of the Year” award to Eagle County Paramedics Amelia Van Dyke C.J. Castle and Parker Armberg for their actions in transporting a critically ill patient from Vail to Denver. Paul Rodarte/Courtesy photo

Doug Schwartz is proof that there’s really no such thing as off duty for first responders.

Schwartz of the Etown restaurant in Edwards Thursday presented a Distinguished Service award at “A Night of Excellence” a dinner and ceremony honoring Eagle County’s first responders.

Schwartz told a story of an Etown patron who suffered a sudden cardiac arrest one evening. Shelly Belknap an oncology nurse at the Shaw Cancer Center was also at the restaurant that night as was Stephan McGaffick of the Beaver Creek Ski Patrol.

Both jumped into action with Belknap performing CPR and McGaffick running to grab a nearby automated external defibrillator or AED device. The device worked as it should shocking the patron’s heart back to life.

Working together the two kept that patron alive until help arrived.

That patron turned out to be Schwartz.

“You don’t expect to be called to duty when you’re out to dinner Belknap said adding her thanks to McGaffick. She also thanked Vail Health and Starting Hearts a local nonprofit that has put AED devices all over the valley.

Belknap also thanked Schwartz “who decided to stick around.”

The honor of service

All 14 of the awards given Thursday honored those who believe pubic service is an honor and take that honor to heart.

Amelia Van Dyke Parker Armberg and C.J. Castle of Eagle County Paramedics were honored for their work getting a very sick patient from Vail to Denver.

Plenty of patients every year take that ambulance ride. But this call required the crew to get their patient to Denver while hooked to a ventilator with nine medication infusions delivered on the way.

A crew from the Colorado Department of Transportation was honored for work in evacuating people from Glenwood Canyon when mudslides last summer closed Interstate 70.

John Harris of the Eagle County Road and Bridge Department accepted the award for his people keeping motorists safe while the mostly-dirt road over Cottonwood Pass was the main route between Gypsum and Glenwood Springs.

Beyond keeping that traffic safe a county crew also responded to a 2 a.m. call to aid a motorist traveling with two small children who had taken a wrong turn and ended up at LEDE Reservoir.

Harris thanked his team a common theme among award recipients from police and fire agencies to department of transportation recipients and the crew from the Eagle County Public Health Department Disease Prevention and Control Team.

A night of gratitude

Those who presented the awards also expressed their gratitude.

Presenting a Leadership Award to Roaring Fork Fire Rescue Authority Deputy Chief Richard Cornelius Vail Mayor Dave Chapin talked about his gratitude to those who serve.

Chapin talked about Vail firefighter Scott Bridges who was badly injured in 2019 when he was hit by a car on an icy morning while trying to help other accident victims in a multi-car pileup along I-70.

“The people in this room are the ones who come to the rescue” Chapin said.

“I’m not the one should be up here” Chapin added. “I wish more people could see nights like this” he added.

Eagle County Sheriff James van Beek said while the valley is full of people who have stepped outside their comfort zones to serve the community those honored Thursday are the ones who run toward danger.

“Giving is what it’s all about” van Beek said. “There’s a strong sense of duty” among those people he added. “It’s more than a slogan … it’s a lifestyle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldGRyb2lkdGlwcy5jb20vc3RvY2stcm9tLW1vdG8tZzVzLXBsdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motorola G5S Plus XT1802 / XT1804 / XT1803 Firmware Flash File,"Want to install the stock firmware on your Motorola XT1804 Moto G5S Plus? then you are in the right place.

In the prevailing scenario one can say with confidence that India is one of the fastest growing economies. However India’s GDP represents only 3% of World GDP and roughly the same percentage of global stock market capitalization.Globally a lot of innovation is taking place through disruption of various traditional industries. Such innovation and disruption creates investment opportunities across geographies. Such opportunities are very limited in India in the listed space. Hence to participate meaningfully in these opportunities investors need to take exposure to several themes or emerging mega-trends outside India.Every country has its own strengths and weaknesses and reactions to global news flows can be consequently different.As can be seen in the chart above no single country/region has been the best performer consecutively for a prolonged time period. In the last 10 years the US has been the top performer in 6 years but only twice consecutively. International investments reduce single country/region-specific risk at portfolio level.Correlation shows the strength of relationship between two variables in this case the stock market performance of one country vis-à-vis the other.As against the general notion that Indian & US equity markets have high positive correlation there have been periods of divergent movements e.g. 2011 2013 2015-16 as given in the previous chart. Also in the last 10 years the correlation between India & US has been only 0.29.International exposure also carries with it exposure to different currencies. Whenever there is any depreciation in INR the global portfolio could earn higher INR returns which is depicted in the chart of the US S&P 500 index below.Though India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world it still lags behind the advanced economies with respect to innovation since the major technology centric firms operate globally. E.g. names like Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix Google etc. are not listed on Indian bourses.Popular themes that are emanating across the globe are robotics artificial intelligence electric vehicles industrial automations e-commerce and cloud computing. Since these themes are expected to shape our future it makes sense for domestic investors to participate in such global themes.To summarize international investing helps in diversifying single country risk provides correlation benefits provides currency diversification and the opportunity to invest in some of the leading global brands & themes.International Investing is possible either through domestic Mutual Funds either through Index funds which mirror global indices or actively managed funds or by investing directly in foreign currency through the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS).Investing via domestic funds is preferable since the money remains INR denominated and is subject to domestic taxation. Funds which invest in international equities are taxed as fixed income mutual funds in India i.e. subject to LTCG @20% with indexation if held for > 3 years or subject to STCG @MMR if held for < 3 years.Benefits of Index Funds in International InvestingFor domestic investors passive funds or Index funds are the best way to invest in international markets.Index funds aim to replicate the performance of an index. The case for Index funds is pretty much proven in the US where almost 50% of the assets managed through that mutual fund industry is covered through passively managed funds. One of the key reasons for this is the information efficiency which is prevalent in US & other Developed markets. This is makes it difficult for a global active manager to consistently outperform the benchmark indices e.g. the S&P500 Nasdaq100 MSCI World Index etc. Global Index funds are more economical since they do not have the management & operational expenses associated with actively managed funds.Furthermore global index funds provide access to global leaders across industries and access to emerging themes or mega-trends.The Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index Fund replicates the S&P500 index which includes the top 500 companies in the United States covering all 11 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors making it a broad based diversified index. This index includes top 100 non-financial companies and the companies that form the top 10 holdings include Microsoft Apple Amazon Tesla Alphabet Facebook Nvidia & NetFlix.The Motilal Oswal NASDAQ 100 ETF & FoF offer an opportunity to invest in global technology companies that are part of the NASDAQ 100 Index which covers the top 100 non-financial companies.The HDFC Developed World Indexes Fund of Funds tracks the performance of the MSCI World Index which covers 23 developed markets covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each country through 1500+ constituents.(The author Nitin Shanbhag  is Senior Group Vice President – Investment Products Motilal Oswal Private Wealth .

The company has been known to make moves that hurt its credibility with investors.

Yet it does have a large cadre of followers particularly from its early days as a Reddit meme stock favorite and it has the potential to be a good business (if not always a good investment). For longer-term investors let's see where this Canadian cannabis producer might be in three years.

Flooding the market with cheap paper

One of the biggest knocks against Sundial Growers is its penchant for diluting shareholders. While many of the marijuana stocks that have gone public in the past few years have issued more stock to raise cash Sundial has been especially busy doing it unleashing a tsunami of shares over the past two years that increased the share count by 2150%.

If you want to know why Sundial is an actual penny stock these days look no further than its nonstop share issuance. There are over 1.6 billion shares outstanding today.

But the cannabis grower just announced it would buy back shares worth 100 million Canadian dollars ($79.5 million) in an effort to lift the stock over the $1 share price needed to maintain compliance with Nasdaq exchange rules. Even so it's limited to reducing the share count by just 5% or around 103 million shares and it's not obligated to actually follow through on the buyback.

If there is one upside to Sundial's dilutive practices it's that the company is flush with cash. It just reported having CA$571 million at the start of the month and has some CA$1.2 billion total in cash marketable securities and long-term investments.

Although Sundial was profitable in the third quarter reporting adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of CA$10.5 million versus a loss of CA$4.4 million last year revenue from its cultivation and production continues to decline dropping 11% year over year.

It's also notable that Sundial used the proceeds from its stock sales to completely pay off the long-term debt on its balance sheet.

New opportunities opening up

However the pressure that Sundial is under and the marijuana industry as a whole is feeling necessitated the pot stock restructuring its business so it could focus on operating at sustained profitability.

Its cash position gives it a buffer but Sundial is now branching out into the retail market to boost sales following its acquisition of retailer Inner Spirit Holdings and its Spiritleaf brand. And last month Sundial acquired Canadian liquor retailer Alcanna in an all-stock deal valued at CA$346 million.

Becoming a vertically integrated marijuana company gives Sundial more levers to pull and further diversifies its business. By owning retail locations where it can sell its premium cannabis Sundial could become an effective industry player. CEO Zach George said ""We remain focused on sustainable profitability and continued improvement in all aspects of our operations.""

George also said Sundial would become free cash flow positive in 2022. Free cash flow is the money a business has left over after paying all the bills to reinvest in the company.

Management still eyed suspiciously

Wall Street seems on board. Analysts forecast Sundial Growers can increase revenue from CA$73.3 million last year to around CA$705 million in 2022 and as much as CA$1.1 billion by the end of 2024 at which time it will be generating $0.03 per share in profits.

That's hopeful but investors do need to be worried about just how dependent on dilution the management team actually is. Buying back stock merely to maintain exchange-listing requirements doesn't reflect a true commitment to avoid future dilution.

Analysts don't seem hopeful either. Even though Sundial's stock was trading at just $0.79 per share they have a consensus price target of $0.73 indicating 6% more downside at least over the coming year.

And that is the investor's dilemma with Sundial Growers: The business should do well for itself over the coming years but management needs to prove it truly can prioritize shareholders' interests. It hasn't done that yet and will need much more than one stock buyback plan to show that the marijuana company is one to invest in because it wants everyone to profit equally.

Matt Frankel: Boston Stu says ""Hey Matt. Do you think the recent developments in Zillow abandoning iBuying will be a domino in ending the boom in housing prices? I wonder whether institutional buying played a role in exacerbating the housing shortage.""

No I don't think that the Zillow news will play a role in ending the boom in housing prices. iBuying as an entire industry is right about 1% of the entire housing market. Zillow was not the biggest player in that space. Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN) is by far the biggest player in that space. Zillow's iBuying represents something to the effect of 0.2% of the entire housing market. They've already said that there's institutional interest for the 7000 or so homes they're holding. So I don't think that from a homeowner's perspective there's any reason to be worried about the price of your house because of the Zillow news.

Having said that I tweeted this morning that the Zillow news -- them exiting iBuying and the way they went about it -- is probably the most disappointed I've ever been in a company that I've invested in and I have had some pretty bad ones. It seems like an incompetence problem. Just last week they put out a statement saying that they were going to suspend iBuying for the rest of the year due to overwhelming demand and really spun it into a good thing. And then just a few days later to completely upend your business model? They've been saying for years how iBuying is their growth engine.

So as an investor I'm disappointed but as a homeowner I'm not worried that that's going to set off any type of domino effect. There's tons of institutional interest for homes not just from iBuyers but from a lot of real estate investment trusts. Invitation Homes (NYSE: INVH) is one that's scooping up rental properties left and right. Opendoor put out a statement saying they're still in business. There are a few others in the space that are doing very well. It just seems like a mismanagement in this one case. So from a homeowner's perspective I'm not very worried about it.

The analyst is positive about Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)’s growth catalysts in the near future but he believes that the stock valuation is “full”.

Here is what Polen Capital has to say about Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:

“We believe Airbnb has substantial competitive advantages in a large fast-growing and global market. Airbnb acts as a “System of Trust” in the private rental accommodations market removing a considerable amount of friction so hosts can trust unknown guests and guests can trust unknown hosts/properties. We believe Airbnb has an attractive growth runway given its unique inventory powerful platform and system enhancements that further reduce user friction. We see Airbnb as well-positioned to benefit from secular growth in travel the increasingly mainstream nature of private rentals and as hybrid work/travel can lead to more frequent and longer stays. Unlike traditional online travel agencies like Booking.com and Expedia Airbnb’s user traffic comes almost entirely directly which speaks to the brand’s strength. This also means that Airbnb does not need to pay Google or other meta-search engines nearly as much money for generating booking leads which is a favorable structural business model advantage in our view. We expect the company’s bookings and revenue to compound at a high-teens rate or better over the next five years and margins to expand by thousands of basis points as it scales its fixed costs base leading to 40%+ earnings per share growth over that period.”

“Zai Lab Limited is a leading biotechnology company helping to modernize the Chinese health care industry.

Shares fell alongside the broader Chinese equity markets given concerns around regulations the government has enacted in education technology and real estate. While we are paying attention to these developments so far we think health care will not be subject to any draconian rulings.”

The terror here is people the opportunists cult leaders and blind believers who follow fear to the point of shaming others hating others destroying each other for the goal of earning God's mercy. Yeon’s series mixes this grounded horror with thoughtful discussions about how we define a sin and what we as human beings are deserving of from such a God.

But before the religious folks project their own meaning onto it the opening beatdown is investigated like a crime by Jin Kyunghun (Yang Ik-june) who provides our first-person perspective into this phenomenon. He has a sad backstory involving his wife being murdered by someone and then getting out of jail just years later. That becomes a sore spot that is pressed upon by a Jung Jinsu a stoic chairman of a religious group called the New Truth that believes the monsters are attacking sinners. Yoo Ah-in is excellent in this role that has him delivering cryptic words of faith with a certain deadness in his eyes making him all the more calming to his rabid supporters especially as more deadly decrees start to happen. They believe he is right when he says that the attacks are related to someone's great sin. The New Truth has inspired its own QAnon-like media following with a radical group called The Arrowhead who are riled up broadcast-by-broadcast by a screeching man named Dongwook (Kim Do-yoon). From a gaming chair he makes grandiose assumptions about why so-and-so received a decree and shows how the mania of fear can lead to witch hunts. Members of the Arrowhead usually teenagers with baseball bats then go out hunting.

Numerous people get in the crosshairs of Jung Jinsu and the New Truth and the Arrowhead including a lawyer named Min Hyejin (Kim Hyun-joo) who initially tries to help a doomed woman who receives a decree and decides to let the New Truth broadcast her death. (It's a staggering scene that allows the madness of ""Hellbound"" to grow tenfold.) Min Hyejin has a surprising and heavily rewarding character arc as many people do in this top-tier ensemble—along with how the series jumps time it’s never certain where a character will be in the next episode or if they’ll return.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS90di9uZXdzL2FyY2FuZS1zZWFzb24tMi1uZXRmbGl4LWNvbmZpcm1lZC1sZWFndWUtb2YtbGVnZW5kcy0xMjM1MTE2NjM5L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS90di9uZXdzL2FyY2FuZS1zZWFzb24tMi1uZXRmbGl4LWNvbmZpcm1lZC1sZWFndWUtb2YtbGVnZW5kcy0xMjM1MTE2NjM5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Arcane’ Renewed for Season 2 by Netflix,"Netflix and Riot Games have confirmed that a second season of “Arcane” the streamer’s hit “League of Legends“-based animated series is officially on the way. The two companies made the announcement at the conclusion of a fan event on Saturday evening.

Welcome to Thanks I Love It our series highlighting something onscreen we're obsessed with this week.

If you've been putting off watching Netflix's Arcane because you don't play League of Legends stop that right now. Friends you're missing out on some truly incredible animation.

The first TV series from Riot Games and French animation studio Fortiche created by Christian Linke and Alex Yee Arcane landed on Netflix on Nov. 6 rolling out three episodes per week until the finale on Nov. 20. And while fans and players of League will find references Easter eggs and character signatures aplenty throughout the show any viewer can jump into it and fully appreciate the series' compelling story nuanced characters and unique stunning animation style.

To be clear: I don't play League of Legends and I loved it.

Taken from the lore of League Arcane centres around the tensions between two cities Piltover and Zaun. It's the wealthy elite versus the shadowy underworld where both sides are developing technology to secure dominance.

In Piltover where a council rules all scientists Jayce and Viktor (apprentices to the mustachioed Heimerdinger) create what's known as hextech which gives anyone the ability to use magic. Meanwhile in Zaun where Piltover police do routine raids a bright purple drug called shimmer is turning people into monstrous creatures with super strength which could prove advantageous in a simmering rebellion. It's here we meet sisters and protagonists Vi and Powder (later Jinx) who become separated for years after tragic events.

While the series' extremely dark plot and established characters are a major drawcard the animation in the series is worth the trip in itself: It's both painstakingly hand-painted and computer animated all framed within meticulous cinematography.

""In a typical 3D production every element from the characters to the background is modelled in three dimensions"" Barthelemy Maunoury Fortiche's director of animation for Arcane explained to Mashable.

""On Arcane it’s slightly different — the backgrounds are digitally hand-painted and the texture on the characters is crafted to get that graphical look that fits with the environment. We also mainly use 2D animation for the FXs (explosions tears smoke...) to reinforce the painted look. In the details it’s slightly more complicated but it’s more or less how you end up with something that looks like an illustration.""

Creating an animated series based on the lore and playable characters (or champions) of League of Legends comes with heavy baggage — millions commandeer these characters daily knowing their physicality their voices and especially their weapons intimately. The facial movements of each character are incredibly complex bringing nuance to reaction raw emotion to excellent delivery by the cast and believability to these unreal characters usually known from a top-down perspective viewed on the Summoner's Rift (the game's battle arena).

""We worked really closely with Riot to make sure the lore and the IP were respected. Having said that animation is a different medium than video games so we also had to adapt the characters' animation and create our own style"" Maunoury said.

""Our goal was to find a good balance between realism and 'cartoon' style. Since our characters have semi-realistic proportions they have to move and behave in a realistic way with weight and solid body-mechanics. But to keep the appeal and avoid any uncanny valley effect we also had to bring traditional animation techniques. That’s why we didn't do mocap [motion capture] but only keyframe animation that allows us to control our acting performance and aesthetic.""

For existing and new characters costuming in the show is elegantly detailed and tailored with show-stopping elements like geometric belt buckles and steampunk glasses appearing throughout. In the fancy city Piltover officials wear golden embellishments on their attire — Councilor Shoola's incredible kinetic neckpiece casually revolves like clockwork and police officers wear golden metal facemasks to walk around Zaun.

Meanwhile in Zaun characters wear whoever’s jacket they can steal fine-tuning their own personal steampunk looks from scraps in The Lanes. It’s a grimy den of bars clubs brothels and street food vendors illuminated by smoky green hues and the promise of distraction lurking behind each closed door.

""Designing characters that belong to the well-known IP can be tricky"" said Maunoury. ""But with the support of Riot's artists and the trust of Christian Linke and Alex Yee the creators of Arcane we had a blast doing that work.""

Fortiche usually starts with a brief from Arcane directors Arnaud Delord and Pascal Charrue who bring moodboards for the team to reference. After the character designers get their sketches reviewed by Riot and the directors they also need to be technically approved to make sure the design can be done within budget.

League players will notice the weapons in the show almost immediately and Fortiche didn't muck around with those — Jinx's punk DIY mechanical chompers and machine gun appear in the game and the show for example. ""Weaponry is probably one of the things we diverged the least from the game as it’s a key element for the champions and we wanted to make sure LOL's fans would recognize them in the show"" said Manoury. ""We did adapt elements though to make sure the functionality would make sense when our heroes are manipulating them.""

That's a hell of a gun to carry around. Credit: Netflix

But often the characters are upstaged by the stage itself. Interiors and exteriors taken from League lore are exquisitely detailed down to the window pane and they often steal the scene they're setting. There’s a stark difference between the winding shadowy neon-lit streets of Zaun and the bright mechanical Art Deco promenades of Piltover gleaming with gold and glass like a landscape straight out of Bioshock Infinite. Meanwhile the buildings across the river are pieced together with whatever's left.

""These locations exist in the lore of League of Legends so we didn’t start from scratch"" said Maunoury. ""The process is not different from designing a character. The location needs to tell a story and is obviously as important as a hero. We’re gathering a lot of research on moodboards defining colors shapes or patterns that fit with the environment to make sure we keep consistency during the design process. I don’t have a particular favourite but if I had to choose between Zaun and Piltover I would have to pick Zaun!""

""It’s like the scene you’re looking at is the movie of her life that Jinx is editing herself with rage scribbling directly on the film."" - Barthelemy Maunoury

One of the biggest differences in animation style that Fortiche plays with in Arcane is the consistent core animation and the distorted bright neon scribbles that often accompany Powder/Jinx's inner turmoil. It's a particularly striking graphic novel-like technique that mixes 3D and 2D elements — something Fortiche is well-known for.

""We usually use that mix for effects like fire gunshots smoke"" said Maunoury. ""Here the idea was to use 2D animation and film scratches to make you enter Jinx's mind. It’s like the scene you’re looking at is the movie of her life that Jinx is editing herself with rage scribbling directly on the film! Kudos to the 2Dfx team who did a great job designing and animating those scribbles. Also the edit and the compositing team for the final look!""

Whether you've played League of Legends or not the sheer beauty of Arcane's animation should reel you in where a truly engaging extremely dark story awaits. Don't let the fact you haven't battled on the Rift stop you from appreciating it.

Check out our guide to the best space movies and TV shows on Netflix for more.

And "" Don't Look Up "" has all the signs that it's going to be a well-written very funny deeply disturbing and beautifully observed dark comedy-cum-satire. It is in essence a message about climate change and mocks those who willfully repeatedly scoff at the science. And sadly that could be applied to a number of things including the pandemic pollution orbital debris and so on.

Raging inflation could do more than just erode the purchasing power of the dollar.

According to Peter Schiff CEO of equity fund Euro Pacific Capital who’s famous for publicly predicting the 2008 housing crisis spiking price levels will help “push the economy into recession.”

“A strong economy doesn't produce inflation” Fox Business reported earlier this month. “It actually produces the reverse because a strong economy means that your economy is productive you're producing more goods and services and you're growing the supply.”

The good news? Schiff also knows a thing or two about hedging against inflation. In fact we can clearly see that theme in Euro Pacific's latest 13F filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.

So here’s a look at three ways Schiff’s investment firm is preparing for a downturn — one of them might be worth purchasing with some of your extra nickels and dimes.

Gold miners

Schiff has long been a fan of the yellow metal.

“The problem with the dollar is it has no intrinsic value” he once said. “Gold will store its value and you'll always be able to buy more food with your gold.""

As always he’s putting his money where his mouth is.

As of Sept. 30 Euro Pacific held 519095 shares of Newmont and 1.528 million shares of Barrick Gold.

In fact the two gold mining giants were the firm’s top two holdings representing 7.4% and 7.3% of its portfolio respectively.

In Q3 Newmont produced 1.45 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1120 per ounce — the current price of gold sits above $1800. Meanwhile Barrick Gold produced 1.09 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1034 per ounce.

Gold can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and its status as a safe haven means demand typically increases during times of uncertainty.

If gold prices go up miners like Newmont and Barrick will likely enjoy bigger profits.

These days you can build your own recession-proof portfolio just by using your own digital nickels and dimes.

Recession-proof income stocks

Dividend stocks offer investors a great way to earn a passive income stream but some can also be used as a hedge against inflation — and even recessions.

Case in point: The third-largest holding at Euro Pacific is cigarette giant British American Tobacco accounting for 4.5% of the portfolio.

The maker of Kent and Dunhill cigarettes pays quarterly dividends of 75 cents per share giving the stock an attractive annual yield of 8.6%.

Schiff’s fund also owns over 160000 shares of Philip Morris International another tobacco king with a dividend yield of 5.4%. The Marlboro cigarette producer is Euro Pacific’s fourth-largest holding with a portfolio weighting of 4%.

The demand for cigarettes is highly inelastic meaning large price changes only induce small changes in demand — and that demand is largely immune to economic shocks.

If you’re comfortable with investing in so-called sin stocks British American and Philip Morris might be worth researching further.

Agriculture

Mark Agnor/Shutterstock

When it comes to playing defence there’s one recession-proof sector that shouldn’t be overlooked: agriculture.

It’s simple. Whatever happens people still need to eat.

Schiff doesn’t talk about agriculture as much as precious metals but the fifth-largest holding of Euro Pacific is fertilizer producer Nutrien.

As one of the world’s largest providers of crop inputs and services Nutrien is positioned solidly even if the economy enters a major downturn. Its shares are already up about 39% in 2021.

Another way to play the agricultural boom is to invest in U.S. farmland.

Farmland could be an effective hedge because it’s intrinsically valuable and has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market.

The NCREIF Farmland Total Return Index has increased more than five times over the past 15 years 10 times over the past 20 years and 20 times over the past 30 years.

The best part? You don’t need to get your hands dirty to get a piece of the action.

New platforms allow you to invest in U.S. farmland by taking a stake in the farm of your choice.

You’ll earn cash income from the leasing fees and crop sales. And of course you’ll benefit from any long-term appreciation on top of that.

Lands and Natural Resources Samuel Abu Jinapor has tasked the Board and Management of Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd. to as matter of necessity reconstruct the 5 kilometre Hwidiem – Kenyasi Road which also leads to the Mines.

He said this will be their contribution to the development of the country.

Mr Jinapor said this when he visited the Ahafo Mines at Kenyasi in the Asutifi South District as part of his one-day tour of the Ahafo Region.

He urged management of the Mines to continue to act on the principles of integrity transparency and help to support the government’s efforts at developing Ghana.

Mr. Jinapor said Newmont should work within the government’s vision to increase its efforts at making Ghana the Mining Hub of Africa not just in the production of Gold but also retaining the value chain in Ghana.

He assured the Company of the government’s support saying ”whatever we can do as a government and for that matter as a Ministry to make sure that you have a conducive environment to thrive we will ensure it.”

Vice President Government Relations and Strategic Development of Newmont Mr. Keane Addo Kufour announced that the Company’s Board of Directors have approved $800 million to establish a new Mine site called ” Ahafo North”.

He explained that the creation of the new Mine will among others provide jobs for the youth in the community and enhance its Corporate Social Responsibility opportunities.

Mr. Addo Kufour however called for increased support from all stakeholders to ensure the success of their operations especially with regard to the setting up of the Ahafo North Mine.

General Manager of the Ahafo Mines Mr. Okyere Yaw Ntrama said the company has so far invested about $3.5 billion into Ghana’s economy paid $1.9 billion taxes and dividends to the government and looks forward to doing more in the coming years.

As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility the General Manager said 45% of indigenes of Ahafo are permanent employees within the Mines.",,,,,,,,,

We know enough about Waystar and ATN and the Roy family to draw comparisons to Rupert Murdoch his children and the poisonous legacy of News Corp or perhaps Donald Trump and his smooth-brained fail-children. If a show like Succession referenced say the Trump family more directly perhaps we would understand Don Jr. as a Roman Roy type a pitiable simp who’s eager to please the distant abusive father who will never love him. Such a show might only hint around the impact their familial intrigue has on the real world because it would be immersed instead in the petty no-doubt-hilarious internecine conflicts that engulf daddy and the kids behind closed doors.

The title “What It Takes” references Richard Ben Cramer’s book about the 1988 presidential election a classic of political nonfiction and perhaps the definitive book about how campaigns operate. The ’88 election was a mad scramble to succeed Ronald Reagan after he’d reached his two-term limit with then-VP George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole battling it out for the Republican nomination and Michael Dukakis Gary Hart Dick Gephardt and a no-hope Joe Biden mixing it up on the Democratic side. There were a lot of wild twists and turns in the news media particularly among Democrats that led to a nominee but it was not as if the media itself had a thumb on the scales. As in any healthy democracy it was decided by the people of New Hampshire.

The perverse twist of “What It Takes” is that the actual process of who gets to be president — or who gets to be the nominee on the right anyway — is completely opaque decided in the lobbies and suites of off-the-books events rather than campaign stops and ballot boxes. Just as Logan Roy casually considered the interim CEO of Waystar from the cabin of his PJ he could also play kingmaker from the couch of his hotel suite despite being the man responsible for bullying the current president “the Raisin” out of trying for a second term. He’s looking for the next white guy that looks like the strongest contender and will agree to a hands-off approach to Waystar’s criminal misadventures in exchange for favorable coverage on ATN. These are things that aren’t supposed to happen — the DOJ is supposed to be independent of executive influence elections are supposed to be decided by the voters — but in the jaundiced view of Succession do.

So who gets to be president? We’re offered four candidates: There’s the current vice-president Dave Boyer (Reed Birney) a.k.a. “Martin Van Boring” babbles on about being anti–Big Tech and has a gross habit of constantly wetting his lips. (“He’s like a cartoon bear and there’s always a picnic hamper nearby” says Roman.) There’s Rick Salgado (Yul Vazquez) a RINO-type who seems to have an uncomfortable relationship to the party’s rabid base but may have mainstream appeal. There’s Connor Roy a fringe anti-tax dipshit whose candidacy is such a joke that even his family members cannot help riffing on it. And then there’s Jeryd Mencken (Justin Kirk) a full-on white supremacist and fascist who also happens to be the most charismatic contender by far.

The bottom line for Logan Roy — and the bottom line as we’ve learned in the real world for Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump — is not a question of ideology but power. Presidential candidates are assessed for their popularity with viewers and how much they might benefit ATN’s ratings and Waystar’s business interests but what they actually believe doesn’t matter that much. Those adjustments can be made if they haven’t been made already. A network on which Ravenhead is a popular prime-time demagogue can accommodate a guy like Mencken and the rest of the programming will fall in line even if the advertisements get winnowed down to an online pillow distributor. Logan needs a winner especially now when he’s under threat from the DOJ and his shareholders.

The rift within the Roy family over Mencken is absolutely chilling. Shiv has proven herself to be nothing if not politically flexible — not long ago she was toying with a chief advisory position with a Bernie Sanders–like flamethrower and now she’s arguing for the least-appalling option. We’re so used to seeing Roy business as amusing full-contact sport that Shiv’s genuine panic and revulsion over Mencken’s candidacy is a cold splash of water to the face. If there was any thought that a corporation like Waystar — or you know News Corp — would draw the line on fascist authoritarianism “What It Takes” perishes it. Mencken’s extremism may come back to bite Waystar in the end perhaps giving rise to the Succession equivalents of NewsMax and OANN but Roman thinks it’s good for business and his daddy agrees. They’re probably right.

In the end Shiv makes a comically spineless choice. She cannot refuse to be included in a photo with Mencken and continue to be “part of the family” so she negotiates a pose that puts her as far away from him as possible. “You win Pinkie” her father says about this embarrassing ignominious defeat. She has cast her lot with her father and he will continue to abuse her for it just as he did after she struck a deal with his bitter adversaries last week. She doesn’t smile in the photo. She isn’t next to Mencken. But she should know that she’s complicit and we should know as viewers of this very entertaining show that there are no corporate guardrails to prevent the worst people from taking control of the country.

Sad Sack Wasp Traps

• Kendall’s longstanding refusal to listen to his lawyer — who annoyingly does not tell him everything he wants to hear — results in a serious weakening of his standing in the cruises scandal. His smug answers in a prep session (“I approved the illegal payments because I love sexual assault and I love to cover it up”) carry over into the actual questioning by DOJ officials. Meanwhile Waystar is burying DOJ in paperwork running a faux-scrupulous internal investigation and gumming up the works until the crisis is yesterday’s news.

• Roman green-lighting a hit movie called Dr. Honk about a man who can talk to cars suggests that Hollywood might be a good place for his talents.

• Even by Succession standards Will Tracy’s script is saltier and more colorful than usual. Choice one-liners from the “ATN primary”: “As a libtard how do you like spelunking the elephant’s asshole?” “Hey Shiv is it true you’re at the hatefest fest burning books and measuring skulls down in Nuremberg Virginia?” “I’m not saying it’s going to be the full Third Reich but I am genuinely concerned that we could slide into a Russian Berlusconi-ed Brazilian fuckpile.”

• A wonderful episode for Tom whose impending prison sentence has earned him the nickname “Christmas Tree” around the office because others like Greg can hook their “bauble of corporate wrong-doing” on his branches. In the meantime he’s too depressed to make love to Shiv who’s still on contraception (“It’s like throwing so much cake batter at a brick wall”) and picking through the overcooked omelets at a local diner to get a feel for what prison food might be like.

• But maybe he doesn’t have to go to prison! Kendall arranges a clandestine meeting to persuade Tom to join his team and get an immunity deal for turning on Logan. The offer sounds great if not for the fact that Tom would be betraying his wife and throwing his lot in with a guy who always loses. At this point Tom is so resigned to his fate that he’s ordering dinner food like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day: “I’ll take the griddle hero special with double hash browns fully loaded and plain waffle and a large cup of plain temperature water.”

• It didn’t seem possible for Willa to detest Connor more than after he suggested turning her play into a so-bad-it’s-good event but using her body to curry favor with the lecherous donor (Stephen Root) responsible for the Future Freedom Summit takes the animosity to another level.

• Tom and Shiv’s vineyard is yielding screw-top wine that seems as foul as their marriage. “It’s earthy kind of Germanic” seems like wine-speak for “It literally tastes like shit.”

• Greg line of the week: “I just feel because of my physical length I could be a target for all kinds of misadventure.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZ3JheXpvbmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEvYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1taWxsaW9uLW1lZGlhLW91dGxldHMtZ2xvYmFsLWFnZW5kYS_SAVZodHRwczovL3RoZWdyYXl6b25lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzIxL2JpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtbWlsbGlvbi1tZWRpYS1vdXRsZXRzLWdsb2JhbC1hZ2VuZGEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Documents show Bill Gates has given $319 million to media outlets to promote his global agenda,"A look at the database of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reveals how the oligarch influencing the global pandemic response has bankrolled hundreds of media outlets to the tune of at least $319 million.

This article was originally published by Mint Press News.

Read The Grayzone’s investigation into Bill Gates’ global public health empire and propaganda machine here.

Up until his recent messy divorce Bill Gates enjoyed something of a free pass in corporate media. Generally presented as a kindly nerd who wants to save the world the Microsoft co-founder was even un-ironically christened “Saint Bill” by The Guardian.

While other billionaires’ media empires are relatively well known the extent to which Gates’s cash underwrites the modern media landscape is not. After sorting through over 30000 individual grants MintPress can reveal that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has made over $300 million worth of donations to fund media projects.

Recipients of this cash include many of America’s most important news outlets including CNN NBC NPR PBS and The Atlantic. Gates also sponsors a myriad of influential foreign organizations including the BBC The Guardian The Financial Times and The Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom; prominent European newspapers such as Le Monde (France) Der Spiegel (Germany) and El País (Spain); as well as big global broadcasters like Al-Jazeera.

The Gates Foundation money going towards media programs has been split up into a number of sections presented in descending numerical order and includes a link to the relevant grant on the organization’s website.

Together these donations total $166216526. The money is generally directed towards issues close to the Gateses hearts. For example the $3.6 million CNN grant went towards “report[ing] on gender equality with a particular focus on least developed countries producing journalism on the everyday inequalities endured by women and girls across the world” while the Texas Tribune received millions to “to increase public awareness and engagement of education reform issues in Texas.” Given that Bill is one of the charter schools’ most fervent supporters a cynic might interpret this as planting pro-corporate charter school propaganda into the media disguised as objective news reporting.

The Gates Foundation has also given nearly $63 million to charities closely aligned with big media outlets including nearly $53 million to BBC Media Action over $9 million to MTV’s Staying Alive Foundation and $1 million to The New York Times Neediest Causes Fund. While not specifically funding journalism donations to the philanthropic arm of a media player should still be noted.

Gates continues to underwrite a wide network of investigative journalism centers as well totaling just over $38 million more than half of which has gone to the D.C.-based International Center for Journalists to expand and develop African media.

These centers include:

International Center for Journalists- $20436938

Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (Nigeria) – $3800357

The Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting – $2432552

Fondation EurActiv Politech – $2368300

The Poynter Institute for Media Studies- $382997

Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (Nigeria) – $360211

Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies – $254500

Global Forum for Media Development (Belgium) – $124823

Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting – $100000

In addition to this the Gates Foundation also plies press and journalism associations with cash to the tune of at least $12 million. For example the National Newspaper Publishers Association — a group representing more than 200 outlets — has received $3.2 million.

The list of these organizations includes:

Education Writers Association – $5938475

National Newspaper Publishers Association – $3249176

National Press Foundation- $1916172

Washington News Council- $698200

American Society of News Editors Foundation – $250000

Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press- $25000

This brings our running total up to $216.4 million.

The foundation also puts up the money to directly train journalists all over the world in the form of scholarships courses and workshops. Today it is possible for an individual to train as a reporter thanks to a Gates Foundation grant find work at a Gates-funded outlet and to belong to a press association funded by Gates. This is especially true of journalists working in the fields of health education and global development the ones Gates himself is most active in and where scrutiny of the billionaire’s actions and motives are most necessary.

Gates Foundation grants pertaining to the instruction of journalists include:

Johns Hopkins University – $1866408

Teachers College Columbia University- $1462500

University of California Berkeley- $767800

Tsinghua University (China) – $450000

Seattle University – $414524

Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies – $254500

Rhodes University (South Africa) – $189000

Montclair State University- $160538

Pan-Atlantic University Foundation – $130718

World Health Organization – $38403

The Aftermath Project- $15435

The BMGF also pays for a wide range of specific media campaigns around the world. For example since 2014 it has donated $5.7 million to the Population Foundation of India in order to create dramas that promote sexual and reproductive health with the intent to increase family planning methods in South Asia. Meanwhile it alloted over $3.5 million to a Senegalese organization to develop radio shows and online content that would feature health information. Supporters consider this to be helping critically underfunded media while opponents might consider it a case of a billionaire using his money to plant his ideas and opinions into the press.

$319.4 million and (a lot) more

Added together these Gates-sponsored media projects come to a total of $319.4 million. However there are clear shortcomings with this non-exhaustive list meaning the true figure is undoubtedly far higher. First it does not count sub-grants — money given by recipients to media around the world. And while the Gates Foundation fosters an air of openness about itself there is actually precious little public information about what happens to the money from each grant save for a short one- or two-sentence description written by the foundation itself on its website. Only donations to press organizations themselves or projects that could be identified from the information on the Gates Foundation’s website as media campaigns were counted meaning that thousands of grants having some media element do not appear in this list.

A case in point is the BMGF’s partnership with ViacomCBS the company that controls CBS News MTV VH1 Nickelodeon and BET. Media reports at the time noted that the Gates Foundation was paying the entertainment giant to insert information and PSAs into its programming and that Gates had intervened to change storylines in popular shows like ER and Law & Order: SVU.

However when checking BMGF’s grants database “Viacom” and “CBS” are nowhere to be found the likely grant in question (totaling over $6 million) merely describing the project as a “public engagement campaign aimed at improving high school graduation rates and postsecondary completion rates specifically aimed at parents and students” meaning that it was not counted in the official total. There are surely many more examples like this. “For a tax-privileged charity that so very often trumpets the importance of transparency it’s remarkable how intensely secretive the Gates Foundation is about its financial flows” Tim Schwab one of the few investigative journalists who has scrutinized the tech billionaire told MintPress.

Also not included are grants aimed at producing articles for academic journals. While these articles are not meant for mass consumption they regularly form the basis for stories in the mainstream press and help shape narratives around key issues. The Gates Foundation has given far and wide to academic sources with at least $13.6 million going toward creating content for the prestigious medical journal The Lancet.

And of course even money given to universities for purely research projects eventually ends up in academic journals and ultimately downstream into mass media. Academics are under heavy pressure to print their results in prestigious journals; “publish or perish” is the mantra in university departments. Therefore even these sorts of grants have an effect on our media. Neither these nor grants funding the printing of books or establishment of websites counted in the total although they too are forms of media.

Low profile long tentacles

In comparison to other tech billionaires Gates has kept his profile as a media controller relatively low. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s purchase of The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 was a very clear and obvious form of media influence as was eBay founder Pierre Omidyar’s creation of First Look Media the company that owns The Intercept.

Despite flying more under the radar Gates and his companies have amassed considerable influence in media. We already rely on Microsoft-owned products for communication (e.g. Skype Hotmail) social media (LinkedIn) and entertainment (Microsoft XBox). Furthermore the hardware and software we use to communicate often comes courtesy of the 66-year-old Seattleite. How many people reading this are doing so on a Microsoft Surface or Windows phone and doing so via Windows OS? Not only that Microsoft owns stakes in media giants such as Comcast and AT&T. And the “MS” in MSNBC stands for Microsoft.

Media Gates keepers

That the Gates Foundation is underwriting a significant chunk of our media ecosystem leads to serious problems with objectivity. “The foundation’s grants to media organizations…raise obvious conflict-of-interest questions: How can reporting be unbiased when a major player holds the purse strings?” wrote Gates’s local Seattle Times in 2011. This was before the newspaper accepted BMGF money to fund its “education lab” section.

Schwab’s research has found that this conflict of interests goes right to the very top: two New York Times columnists had been writing glowingly about the Gates Foundation for years without disclosing that they also work for a group — the Solutions Journalism Network — that as shown above has received over $7 million from the tech billionaire’s charity.

Earlier this year Schwab also declined to co-report on a story about COVAX for The Bureau of Investigative Journalism suspecting that the money Gates had been pumping into the outlet would make it impossible to accurately report on a subject so close to Gates’s heart. Sure enough when the article was published last month it repeated the assertion that Gates had little to do with COVAX’s failure mirroring the BMGF’s stance and quoting them throughout. Only at the very end of the more than 5000-word story did it reveal that the organization it was defending was paying the wages of its staff.

“I don’t believe Gates told The Bureau of Investigative Journalism what to write. I think the bureau implicitly if subconsciously knew they had to find a way to tell this story that didn’t target their funder. The biasing effects of financial conflicts are complex but very real and reliable” Schwab said describing it as “a case study in the perils of Gates-funded journalism.”

MintPress also contacted the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for comment but it did not respond.

1/ Months ago I was asked to be a co-reporter on this story. I declined b/c the #GatesFoundation was a funder which I knew would make it impossible to rigorously examine Gates's role in Covax. This story is a case study in the perils of Gates-funded journalism. 🧵Read on & RT: https://t.co/hkFQOBEGff — Tim Schwab (@TimothyWSchwab) October 13 2021

Gates who amassed his fortune by building a monopoly and zealously guarding his intellectual property bears significant blame for the failure of the coronavirus vaccine rollout across the world. Quite aside from the COVAX fiasco he pressured Oxford University not to make its publicly-funded vaccine open-source and available to all for free but instead to partner with private corporation AstraZeneca a decision that meant that those who could not pay were blocked from using it. That Gates has made over 100 donations to the university totaling hundreds of millions of dollars likely played some role in the decision. To this day fewer than 5% of people in low-income countries have received even one dose of COVID vaccine. The death toll from this is immense.

Unfortunately many of these real criticisms of Gates and his network are obscured by wild and untrue conspiracy theories about such things as inserting microchips in vaccines to control the population. This has meant that genuine critiques of the Microsoft co-founder are often demonetized and algorithmically suppressed meaning that outlets are strongly dissuaded from covering the topic knowing they will likely lose money if they do so. The paucity of scrutiny of the world’s second-richest individual in turn feeds into outlandish suspicions.

Gates certainly deserves it. Quite apart from his deep and potentially decades-long ties to the infamous Jeffrey Epstein his attempts to radically change African society and his investment in controversial chemical giant Monsanto he is perhaps the key driver behind the American charter school movement — an attempt to essentially privatize the U.S. education system. Charter schools are deeply unpopular with teachers’ unions which see the movement as an attempt to lessen their autonomy and reduce public oversight into how and what children are taught.

All the way to the bank

In most coverage Gates’s donations are broadly presented as altruistic gestures. Yet many have pointed to the inherent flaws with this model noting that allowing billionaires to decide what they do with their money allows them to set the public agenda giving them enormous power over society. “Philanthropy can and is being used deliberately to divert attention away from different forms of economic exploitation that underpin global inequality today” said Linsey McGoey Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex U.K. and author of No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy.

She adds: “The new ‘philanthrocapitalism’ threatens democracy by increasing the power of the corporate sector at the expense of the public sector organizations which increasingly face budget squeezes in part by excessively remunerating for-profit organizations to deliver public services that could be delivered more cheaply without private sector involvement.”

Charity as former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee noted “is a cold grey loveless thing. If a rich man wants to help the poor he should pay his taxes gladly not dole out money at a whim.”

None of this means that the organizations receiving Gates’ money — media or otherwise — are irredeemably corrupt nor that the Gates Foundation does not do any good in the world. But it does introduce a glaring conflict of interest whereby the very institutions we rely on to hold accountable one of the richest and most powerful men in the planet’s history are quietly being funded by him. This conflict of interest is one that corporate media have largely tried to ignore while the supposedly altruistic philanthropist Gates just keeps getting richer laughing all the way to the bank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL211cmRvY2gtaGFzLXRoZS1wb3dlci1pZi1oZS1yZWFsbHktd2FudHMtdHJ1bXAtdG8tbW92ZS1vbi0yMDIxMTExOS1wNTlhYjEuaHRtbNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL211cmRvY2gtaGFzLXRoZS1wb3dlci1pZi1oZS1yZWFsbHktd2FudHMtdHJ1bXAtdG8tbW92ZS1vbi0yMDIxMTExOS1wNTlhYjEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Murdoch has the power if he really wants Trump to move on,"Rupert Murdoch told News Corp’s shareholders that former President Donald Trump needs to get over himself.

“The current American political debate is profound whether about education or welfare or economic opportunity” he said at Wednesday’s annual meeting. “It is crucial that conservatives play an active forceful role in that debate but that will not happen if President Trump stays focused on the past. The past is the past and the country is now in a contest to define the future.”

Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News has been the single most influential media platform supporting Donald Trump. Credit: The New York Times

Murdoch is the founder and executive chairman of News Corp and its primary US holdings are Dow Jones & Company which publishes the Wall Street Journal; the New York Post; and book publisher HarperCollins. Murdoch also met with shareholders of another one of his companies Fox last week. Fox of course owns lots of things named Fox including Fox News. Murdoch didn’t mention Trump at the Fox gathering.

It might have been healthy and a public service for Murdoch as Fox’s chairman to share his thoughts about Trump with institutional investors such as Vanguard Blackrock and Dodge & Cox that fund Fox’s operations. Fox News has spent years amplifying the dangerous and damaging garbage Trump continues to peddle and it’s the single most influential media platform supporting him.

We know enough about Waystar and ATN and the Roy family to draw comparisons to Rupert Murdoch his children and the poisonous legacy of News Corp or perhaps Donald Trump and his smooth-brained fail-children. If a show like Succession referenced say the Trump family more directly perhaps we would understand Don Jr. as a Roman Roy type a pitiable simp who’s eager to please the distant abusive father who will never love him. Such a show might only hint around the impact their familial intrigue has on the real world because it would be immersed instead in the petty no-doubt-hilarious internecine conflicts that engulf daddy and the kids behind closed doors.

The title “What It Takes” references Richard Ben Cramer’s book about the 1988 presidential election a classic of political nonfiction and perhaps the definitive book about how campaigns operate. The ’88 election was a mad scramble to succeed Ronald Reagan after he’d reached his two-term limit with then-VP George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole battling it out for the Republican nomination and Michael Dukakis Gary Hart Dick Gephardt and a no-hope Joe Biden mixing it up on the Democratic side. There were a lot of wild twists and turns in the news media particularly among Democrats that led to a nominee but it was not as if the media itself had a thumb on the scales. As in any healthy democracy it was decided by the people of New Hampshire.

The perverse twist of “What It Takes” is that the actual process of who gets to be president — or who gets to be the nominee on the right anyway — is completely opaque decided in the lobbies and suites of off-the-books events rather than campaign stops and ballot boxes. Just as Logan Roy casually considered the interim CEO of Waystar from the cabin of his PJ he could also play kingmaker from the couch of his hotel suite despite being the man responsible for bullying the current president “the Raisin” out of trying for a second term. He’s looking for the next white guy that looks like the strongest contender and will agree to a hands-off approach to Waystar’s criminal misadventures in exchange for favorable coverage on ATN. These are things that aren’t supposed to happen — the DOJ is supposed to be independent of executive influence elections are supposed to be decided by the voters — but in the jaundiced view of Succession do.

So who gets to be president? We’re offered four candidates: There’s the current vice-president Dave Boyer (Reed Birney) a.k.a. “Martin Van Boring” babbles on about being anti–Big Tech and has a gross habit of constantly wetting his lips. (“He’s like a cartoon bear and there’s always a picnic hamper nearby” says Roman.) There’s Rick Salgado (Yul Vazquez) a RINO-type who seems to have an uncomfortable relationship to the party’s rabid base but may have mainstream appeal. There’s Connor Roy a fringe anti-tax dipshit whose candidacy is such a joke that even his family members cannot help riffing on it. And then there’s Jeryd Mencken (Justin Kirk) a full-on white supremacist and fascist who also happens to be the most charismatic contender by far.

The bottom line for Logan Roy — and the bottom line as we’ve learned in the real world for Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump — is not a question of ideology but power. Presidential candidates are assessed for their popularity with viewers and how much they might benefit ATN’s ratings and Waystar’s business interests but what they actually believe doesn’t matter that much. Those adjustments can be made if they haven’t been made already. A network on which Ravenhead is a popular prime-time demagogue can accommodate a guy like Mencken and the rest of the programming will fall in line even if the advertisements get winnowed down to an online pillow distributor. Logan needs a winner especially now when he’s under threat from the DOJ and his shareholders.

The rift within the Roy family over Mencken is absolutely chilling. Shiv has proven herself to be nothing if not politically flexible — not long ago she was toying with a chief advisory position with a Bernie Sanders–like flamethrower and now she’s arguing for the least-appalling option. We’re so used to seeing Roy business as amusing full-contact sport that Shiv’s genuine panic and revulsion over Mencken’s candidacy is a cold splash of water to the face. If there was any thought that a corporation like Waystar — or you know News Corp — would draw the line on fascist authoritarianism “What It Takes” perishes it. Mencken’s extremism may come back to bite Waystar in the end perhaps giving rise to the Succession equivalents of NewsMax and OANN but Roman thinks it’s good for business and his daddy agrees. They’re probably right.

In the end Shiv makes a comically spineless choice. She cannot refuse to be included in a photo with Mencken and continue to be “part of the family” so she negotiates a pose that puts her as far away from him as possible. “You win Pinkie” her father says about this embarrassing ignominious defeat. She has cast her lot with her father and he will continue to abuse her for it just as he did after she struck a deal with his bitter adversaries last week. She doesn’t smile in the photo. She isn’t next to Mencken. But she should know that she’s complicit and we should know as viewers of this very entertaining show that there are no corporate guardrails to prevent the worst people from taking control of the country.

Sad Sack Wasp Traps

• Kendall’s longstanding refusal to listen to his lawyer — who annoyingly does not tell him everything he wants to hear — results in a serious weakening of his standing in the cruises scandal. His smug answers in a prep session (“I approved the illegal payments because I love sexual assault and I love to cover it up”) carry over into the actual questioning by DOJ officials. Meanwhile Waystar is burying DOJ in paperwork running a faux-scrupulous internal investigation and gumming up the works until the crisis is yesterday’s news.

• Roman green-lighting a hit movie called Dr. Honk about a man who can talk to cars suggests that Hollywood might be a good place for his talents.

• Even by Succession standards Will Tracy’s script is saltier and more colorful than usual. Choice one-liners from the “ATN primary”: “As a libtard how do you like spelunking the elephant’s asshole?” “Hey Shiv is it true you’re at the hatefest fest burning books and measuring skulls down in Nuremberg Virginia?” “I’m not saying it’s going to be the full Third Reich but I am genuinely concerned that we could slide into a Russian Berlusconi-ed Brazilian fuckpile.”

• A wonderful episode for Tom whose impending prison sentence has earned him the nickname “Christmas Tree” around the office because others like Greg can hook their “bauble of corporate wrong-doing” on his branches. In the meantime he’s too depressed to make love to Shiv who’s still on contraception (“It’s like throwing so much cake batter at a brick wall”) and picking through the overcooked omelets at a local diner to get a feel for what prison food might be like.

• But maybe he doesn’t have to go to prison! Kendall arranges a clandestine meeting to persuade Tom to join his team and get an immunity deal for turning on Logan. The offer sounds great if not for the fact that Tom would be betraying his wife and throwing his lot in with a guy who always loses. At this point Tom is so resigned to his fate that he’s ordering dinner food like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day: “I’ll take the griddle hero special with double hash browns fully loaded and plain waffle and a large cup of plain temperature water.”

• It didn’t seem possible for Willa to detest Connor more than after he suggested turning her play into a so-bad-it’s-good event but using her body to curry favor with the lecherous donor (Stephen Root) responsible for the Future Freedom Summit takes the animosity to another level.

• Tom and Shiv’s vineyard is yielding screw-top wine that seems as foul as their marriage. “It’s earthy kind of Germanic” seems like wine-speak for “It literally tastes like shit.”

• Greg line of the week: “I just feel because of my physical length I could be a target for all kinds of misadventure.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL21lZGlhLWFuZC1tYXJrZXRpbmcvbmV3cy1jb3JwLXRha2VzLWlzZW50aWEtdG8tY291cnQtb3Zlci1jb3B5cmlnaHQtaW5mcmluZ2VtZW50LTIwMjExMTIxLXA1OWFwMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,News Corp takes iSentia to court over copyright infringement,"News Corp’s Australian News Channel is taking iSentia to court in a bid to stop the media monitoring firm from providing Sky News Australia content to clients without an appropriate licence.

This article was originally published by Mint Press News.

Read The Grayzone’s investigation into Bill Gates’ global public health empire and propaganda machine here.

Up until his recent messy divorce Bill Gates enjoyed something of a free pass in corporate media. Generally presented as a kindly nerd who wants to save the world the Microsoft co-founder was even un-ironically christened “Saint Bill” by The Guardian.

While other billionaires’ media empires are relatively well known the extent to which Gates’s cash underwrites the modern media landscape is not. After sorting through over 30000 individual grants MintPress can reveal that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has made over $300 million worth of donations to fund media projects.

Recipients of this cash include many of America’s most important news outlets including CNN NBC NPR PBS and The Atlantic. Gates also sponsors a myriad of influential foreign organizations including the BBC The Guardian The Financial Times and The Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom; prominent European newspapers such as Le Monde (France) Der Spiegel (Germany) and El País (Spain); as well as big global broadcasters like Al-Jazeera.

The Gates Foundation money going towards media programs has been split up into a number of sections presented in descending numerical order and includes a link to the relevant grant on the organization’s website.

Together these donations total $166216526. The money is generally directed towards issues close to the Gateses hearts. For example the $3.6 million CNN grant went towards “report[ing] on gender equality with a particular focus on least developed countries producing journalism on the everyday inequalities endured by women and girls across the world” while the Texas Tribune received millions to “to increase public awareness and engagement of education reform issues in Texas.” Given that Bill is one of the charter schools’ most fervent supporters a cynic might interpret this as planting pro-corporate charter school propaganda into the media disguised as objective news reporting.

The Gates Foundation has also given nearly $63 million to charities closely aligned with big media outlets including nearly $53 million to BBC Media Action over $9 million to MTV’s Staying Alive Foundation and $1 million to The New York Times Neediest Causes Fund. While not specifically funding journalism donations to the philanthropic arm of a media player should still be noted.

Gates continues to underwrite a wide network of investigative journalism centers as well totaling just over $38 million more than half of which has gone to the D.C.-based International Center for Journalists to expand and develop African media.

These centers include:

International Center for Journalists- $20436938

Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (Nigeria) – $3800357

The Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting – $2432552

Fondation EurActiv Politech – $2368300

The Poynter Institute for Media Studies- $382997

Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (Nigeria) – $360211

Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies – $254500

Global Forum for Media Development (Belgium) – $124823

Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting – $100000

In addition to this the Gates Foundation also plies press and journalism associations with cash to the tune of at least $12 million. For example the National Newspaper Publishers Association — a group representing more than 200 outlets — has received $3.2 million.

The list of these organizations includes:

Education Writers Association – $5938475

National Newspaper Publishers Association – $3249176

National Press Foundation- $1916172

Washington News Council- $698200

American Society of News Editors Foundation – $250000

Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press- $25000

This brings our running total up to $216.4 million.

The foundation also puts up the money to directly train journalists all over the world in the form of scholarships courses and workshops. Today it is possible for an individual to train as a reporter thanks to a Gates Foundation grant find work at a Gates-funded outlet and to belong to a press association funded by Gates. This is especially true of journalists working in the fields of health education and global development the ones Gates himself is most active in and where scrutiny of the billionaire’s actions and motives are most necessary.

Gates Foundation grants pertaining to the instruction of journalists include:

Johns Hopkins University – $1866408

Teachers College Columbia University- $1462500

University of California Berkeley- $767800

Tsinghua University (China) – $450000

Seattle University – $414524

Institute for Advanced Journalism Studies – $254500

Rhodes University (South Africa) – $189000

Montclair State University- $160538

Pan-Atlantic University Foundation – $130718

World Health Organization – $38403

The Aftermath Project- $15435

The BMGF also pays for a wide range of specific media campaigns around the world. For example since 2014 it has donated $5.7 million to the Population Foundation of India in order to create dramas that promote sexual and reproductive health with the intent to increase family planning methods in South Asia. Meanwhile it alloted over $3.5 million to a Senegalese organization to develop radio shows and online content that would feature health information. Supporters consider this to be helping critically underfunded media while opponents might consider it a case of a billionaire using his money to plant his ideas and opinions into the press.

$319.4 million and (a lot) more

Added together these Gates-sponsored media projects come to a total of $319.4 million. However there are clear shortcomings with this non-exhaustive list meaning the true figure is undoubtedly far higher. First it does not count sub-grants — money given by recipients to media around the world. And while the Gates Foundation fosters an air of openness about itself there is actually precious little public information about what happens to the money from each grant save for a short one- or two-sentence description written by the foundation itself on its website. Only donations to press organizations themselves or projects that could be identified from the information on the Gates Foundation’s website as media campaigns were counted meaning that thousands of grants having some media element do not appear in this list.

A case in point is the BMGF’s partnership with ViacomCBS the company that controls CBS News MTV VH1 Nickelodeon and BET. Media reports at the time noted that the Gates Foundation was paying the entertainment giant to insert information and PSAs into its programming and that Gates had intervened to change storylines in popular shows like ER and Law & Order: SVU.

However when checking BMGF’s grants database “Viacom” and “CBS” are nowhere to be found the likely grant in question (totaling over $6 million) merely describing the project as a “public engagement campaign aimed at improving high school graduation rates and postsecondary completion rates specifically aimed at parents and students” meaning that it was not counted in the official total. There are surely many more examples like this. “For a tax-privileged charity that so very often trumpets the importance of transparency it’s remarkable how intensely secretive the Gates Foundation is about its financial flows” Tim Schwab one of the few investigative journalists who has scrutinized the tech billionaire told MintPress.

Also not included are grants aimed at producing articles for academic journals. While these articles are not meant for mass consumption they regularly form the basis for stories in the mainstream press and help shape narratives around key issues. The Gates Foundation has given far and wide to academic sources with at least $13.6 million going toward creating content for the prestigious medical journal The Lancet.

And of course even money given to universities for purely research projects eventually ends up in academic journals and ultimately downstream into mass media. Academics are under heavy pressure to print their results in prestigious journals; “publish or perish” is the mantra in university departments. Therefore even these sorts of grants have an effect on our media. Neither these nor grants funding the printing of books or establishment of websites counted in the total although they too are forms of media.

Low profile long tentacles

In comparison to other tech billionaires Gates has kept his profile as a media controller relatively low. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s purchase of The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 was a very clear and obvious form of media influence as was eBay founder Pierre Omidyar’s creation of First Look Media the company that owns The Intercept.

Despite flying more under the radar Gates and his companies have amassed considerable influence in media. We already rely on Microsoft-owned products for communication (e.g. Skype Hotmail) social media (LinkedIn) and entertainment (Microsoft XBox). Furthermore the hardware and software we use to communicate often comes courtesy of the 66-year-old Seattleite. How many people reading this are doing so on a Microsoft Surface or Windows phone and doing so via Windows OS? Not only that Microsoft owns stakes in media giants such as Comcast and AT&T. And the “MS” in MSNBC stands for Microsoft.

Media Gates keepers

That the Gates Foundation is underwriting a significant chunk of our media ecosystem leads to serious problems with objectivity. “The foundation’s grants to media organizations…raise obvious conflict-of-interest questions: How can reporting be unbiased when a major player holds the purse strings?” wrote Gates’s local Seattle Times in 2011. This was before the newspaper accepted BMGF money to fund its “education lab” section.

Schwab’s research has found that this conflict of interests goes right to the very top: two New York Times columnists had been writing glowingly about the Gates Foundation for years without disclosing that they also work for a group — the Solutions Journalism Network — that as shown above has received over $7 million from the tech billionaire’s charity.

Earlier this year Schwab also declined to co-report on a story about COVAX for The Bureau of Investigative Journalism suspecting that the money Gates had been pumping into the outlet would make it impossible to accurately report on a subject so close to Gates’s heart. Sure enough when the article was published last month it repeated the assertion that Gates had little to do with COVAX’s failure mirroring the BMGF’s stance and quoting them throughout. Only at the very end of the more than 5000-word story did it reveal that the organization it was defending was paying the wages of its staff.

“I don’t believe Gates told The Bureau of Investigative Journalism what to write. I think the bureau implicitly if subconsciously knew they had to find a way to tell this story that didn’t target their funder. The biasing effects of financial conflicts are complex but very real and reliable” Schwab said describing it as “a case study in the perils of Gates-funded journalism.”

MintPress also contacted the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for comment but it did not respond.

1/ Months ago I was asked to be a co-reporter on this story. I declined b/c the #GatesFoundation was a funder which I knew would make it impossible to rigorously examine Gates's role in Covax. This story is a case study in the perils of Gates-funded journalism. 🧵Read on & RT: https://t.co/hkFQOBEGff — Tim Schwab (@TimothyWSchwab) October 13 2021

Gates who amassed his fortune by building a monopoly and zealously guarding his intellectual property bears significant blame for the failure of the coronavirus vaccine rollout across the world. Quite aside from the COVAX fiasco he pressured Oxford University not to make its publicly-funded vaccine open-source and available to all for free but instead to partner with private corporation AstraZeneca a decision that meant that those who could not pay were blocked from using it. That Gates has made over 100 donations to the university totaling hundreds of millions of dollars likely played some role in the decision. To this day fewer than 5% of people in low-income countries have received even one dose of COVID vaccine. The death toll from this is immense.

Unfortunately many of these real criticisms of Gates and his network are obscured by wild and untrue conspiracy theories about such things as inserting microchips in vaccines to control the population. This has meant that genuine critiques of the Microsoft co-founder are often demonetized and algorithmically suppressed meaning that outlets are strongly dissuaded from covering the topic knowing they will likely lose money if they do so. The paucity of scrutiny of the world’s second-richest individual in turn feeds into outlandish suspicions.

Gates certainly deserves it. Quite apart from his deep and potentially decades-long ties to the infamous Jeffrey Epstein his attempts to radically change African society and his investment in controversial chemical giant Monsanto he is perhaps the key driver behind the American charter school movement — an attempt to essentially privatize the U.S. education system. Charter schools are deeply unpopular with teachers’ unions which see the movement as an attempt to lessen their autonomy and reduce public oversight into how and what children are taught.

All the way to the bank

In most coverage Gates’s donations are broadly presented as altruistic gestures. Yet many have pointed to the inherent flaws with this model noting that allowing billionaires to decide what they do with their money allows them to set the public agenda giving them enormous power over society. “Philanthropy can and is being used deliberately to divert attention away from different forms of economic exploitation that underpin global inequality today” said Linsey McGoey Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex U.K. and author of No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy.

She adds: “The new ‘philanthrocapitalism’ threatens democracy by increasing the power of the corporate sector at the expense of the public sector organizations which increasingly face budget squeezes in part by excessively remunerating for-profit organizations to deliver public services that could be delivered more cheaply without private sector involvement.”

Charity as former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee noted “is a cold grey loveless thing. If a rich man wants to help the poor he should pay his taxes gladly not dole out money at a whim.”

None of this means that the organizations receiving Gates’ money — media or otherwise — are irredeemably corrupt nor that the Gates Foundation does not do any good in the world. But it does introduce a glaring conflict of interest whereby the very institutions we rely on to hold accountable one of the richest and most powerful men in the planet’s history are quietly being funded by him. This conflict of interest is one that corporate media have largely tried to ignore while the supposedly altruistic philanthropist Gates just keeps getting richer laughing all the way to the bank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL211cmRvY2gtaGFzLXRoZS1wb3dlci1pZi1oZS1yZWFsbHktd2FudHMtdHJ1bXAtdG8tbW92ZS1vbi0yMDIxMTExOS1wNTlhYjEuaHRtbNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL211cmRvY2gtaGFzLXRoZS1wb3dlci1pZi1oZS1yZWFsbHktd2FudHMtdHJ1bXAtdG8tbW92ZS1vbi0yMDIxMTExOS1wNTlhYjEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Murdoch has the power if he really wants Trump to move on,"Rupert Murdoch told News Corp’s shareholders that former President Donald Trump needs to get over himself.

The past is the past and the country is now in a contest to define the future.”

Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News has been the single most influential media platform supporting Donald Trump. Credit: The New York Times

Murdoch is the founder and executive chairman of News Corp and its primary US holdings are Dow Jones & Company which publishes the Wall Street Journal; the New York Post; and book publisher HarperCollins. Murdoch also met with shareholders of another one of his companies Fox last week. Fox of course owns lots of things named Fox including Fox News. Murdoch didn’t mention Trump at the Fox gathering.

It might have been healthy and a public service for Murdoch as Fox’s chairman to share his thoughts about Trump with institutional investors such as Vanguard Blackrock and Dodge & Cox that fund Fox’s operations. Fox News has spent years amplifying the dangerous and damaging garbage Trump continues to peddle and it’s the single most influential media platform supporting him.

With the cost of manufacturing in China and shipping from China having increased so substantially of late and with all signs pointing to those costs continuing to rise many companies are looking at doing their manufacturing outside China and you should too.

This post was originally written in the summer of 2019 — in pre-COVID times. But when I checked our most read China Law Blog posts this is number one. This tells me two very important things the first of which I already knew. One companies are looking at moving their manufacturing outside China. Some are looking at this so as to diversify their manufacturing and some are looking to get out entirely. Two we should update this post which is exactly what I have done below.

Nike’s Manufacturing History

Nike has always been at the forefront of international manufacturing. So much so that I can remember a time (before China became THE factory to the world) when many companies would base their decision on where to do their manufacturing on Nike.

Nike began international manufacturing early in its history and started in Japan. In the 1980s the company moved nearly its entire manufacturing efforts to South Korea and Taiwan. In 1981 Nike opened its first factory in China.

Back in the mid-1990s Jardine Fleming Securities came up with the Swoosh Index which was its theory that once Nike selects a country for its newest factory site economic growth rising stock markets and other foreign companies follow. A Business Week article entitled “The Swoosh Index for Emerging Markets” explained it:

Nike first started using Japanese plants in 1964. When labor costs there climbed in the mid-1970s it gave South Korea and Taiwan a run. In the 1990s production jumped to Indonesia and China which now account for two-thirds of Nike output. Nike pulled back from Thailand recently ahead of a collapse in stock and property prices. Next up: Vietnam. While production there is now only 2% of Nike output that’s expected to double within a year.

When choosing factory sites Nike looks for cheap labor. However it also picks countries with stable–usually authoritarian–leadership decent infrastructure a pro-business government and a liberal trade regime. When it decides to leave that doesn’t signal the end of prosperity. It often means that countries are ready to move on to high-end manufacturing. And democracy.

Many companies watch Nike and then follow Nike to whichever country the company locates. I bring this up because hardly a day goes by without my discussing with a client “where to manufacture” something — mostly in the context of the client inquiring about moving their manufacturing out of China . As one of our international manufacturing lawyers told me the other day: it feels like the old days when manufacturing in China was not a given and companies needed to make international manufacturing decisions. With China no longer the automatic choice for manufacturing things have gotten more complicated and more interesting for someone who thinks of himself as an international lawyer and not a China lawyer.

Cons of Manufacturing in China

Low production costs are typically what draw people to China for their manufacturing needs. However there are many disadvantages of choosing this country for your company including:

Finding a factory: One of the biggest headaches of moving your manufacturing to China is finding a factory with the capacity to take on your products. Choosing a reliable and upstanding manufacturer is especially important because one in five North American corporations say Chinese companies have stolen intellectual property from them.

Shipping logistics: Another con of manufacturing in China is complications with logistics. Shipping in China can take longer than in other countries because of congestion due to the high volumes of goods they send out.

Minimum order requirements: Because of their slim margins Chinese manufacturers often have high order minimums.

Unexpected price hikes and changes to trading regulations can be stressful for businesses manufacturing products in this country. “Made in China” stigma: Products made in China sometimes have a negative connotation making consumers question the quality of goods manufactured here. While there are factories in China that uphold excellent quality other options may be better for your business.

Manufacturing in “Sleeper Countries”

I had a long talk with the leading company for providing necessary inspections of an important rapidly growing and hugely in-demand product. And as so often happens these days — we quickly found ourselves talking about what we are saying by way of companies moving their manufacturing out of China. Because the product this company inspects is huge transportation costs are a big factor and we talked about how Mexico (for shipment to the United States and elsewhere in Latin America) and Poland (for shipment to Europe) is becoming the new focus of this industry. I have had at least twenty conversations like this in the last few months about at least 15 different sorts of products.

One of the things I often say to clients is how nobody has made manufacturing easier than China — especially contract manufacturing and SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). No country even comes close to China on that count. China has a great “soft infrastructure” for manufacturing and most other countries are just not very helpful. This is a major factor in how slowly companies are moving their manufacturing out of China especially with COVID making multiple in-country visits difficult or impossible.

But on the flip side I can cite plenty of companies that have come to one of the international manufacturing lawyers at my firm for legal help with their China manufacturing only to end up manufacturing in another country at lower cost and with no tariffs. Some of these country changes were initiated at our urging and these discussions nearly always go something like this:

Lawyer: Why China for X product? Did you consider Thailand (or whatever other country seems to make better sense)?

Client: I actually wanted to have my X product made in Thailand but I could never figure out how to accomplish that.

Lawyer: We have people who can help you with that.

We then talked about the pros and cons of manufacturing in various countries. We discussed the nations we like and the “sleeper countries” — those that we believe more companies should be considering for their manufacturing.

Depending on the product I often throw out Spain Portugal Poland Thailand the Philippines Mexico South Korea and Guatemala.

Nike’s International Manufacturing

But what about Nike? What countries does Nike like? The answer to this question is easy because Nike has a manufacturing map that lists exactly where it manufactures its products. Below is what that map told us back in August 2022 regarding its factories/facilities.

I’m breaking down some major changes from 2019 to 2022. The company currently operates in 37 countries in total. The first difference I noticed is that Nike has fewer factories in 20 countries than it did in 2019.

Check out all the changes for yourself:

Argentina — Went from 13 to 4 factories. Bosnia and Herzegovina — 1 factory. Brazil — Went from 24 to 11 factories. Bulgaria — 1 factory Cambodia — Went from 10 to 18 factories. Canada — Went from 3 to 1 factory. China — Went from 109 to 90 factories. Croatia — 1 factory Egypt — Went from 5 to 7 factories. El Salvador — Went from 3 to 2 factories. Georgia — Went from 2 to 4 factories. Guatemala — Went from 4 to 2 factories. Honduras — Went from 5 to 6 factories. India — 8 factories. Indonesia — Went from 38 to 37 factories. Israel — 1 factory. Italy — Went from 18 factories to 12 factories. Japan — Went from 12 to 7 factories. Jordan — 3 factories. Lithuania — 1 factory Malaysia — Went from 7 to 6 factories. Mexico — Went from 16 factories to 5 factories. Moldova — Went from 4 to 2 factories. Netherlands — Went from 2 to 1 factory. Nicaragua — When from 2 to 1 factory. Pakistan — Went from 6 to 5 factories. Poland — 1 factory. South Africa — 1 factory. South Korea — 8 factories. Spain — Went from 2 to 1 factory. Sri Lanka — Went from 17 to 18 factories. Taiwan — Went from 13 to 12 factories. Thailand — Went from 29 to 24 factories. Turkey — 4 factories. United Kingdom — 1 factory. United States — Went from 42 to 29 factories. Vietnam — Went from 105 to 104 factories.

What can be learned from all of this Nike info? That depends. Nike actually lists out the specific companies it uses in each country and there can be little doubt that Nike has thoroughly vetted each of these companies and their facilities. Do these companies engage in contract manufacturing for companies other than Nike? I would think most do.

So this listing ought to be very helpful for anyone in the apparel sports equipment or footwear industries. Does that mean you should have your t-shirts made in the United Kingdom? I highly doubt that. It’s possible Nike has very limited amounts of apparel made in Britain in order to ensure fans in Europe can get their customized jerseys quickly when a new Liverpool Barcelona or Inter Milan star is born.

What about this list surprises you? I’m surprised to see an expensive country like the United States on here and not the Philippines. I’m surprised to see the decrease from 2019 to today in factories based in Mexico. Though it is quite possible that other factories in Mexico won out and are making more products and that the actual quantity of goods made in this country has not actually declined at all.

I also will bet that Mexico’s numbers (and those of other Latin American countries as well) will be higher in the future due to the “new NAFTA” trade agreement and greatly increased China tariffs and shipping costs for products coming from China to the United States.

Manufacturing Outside of China

But what if you make toaster ovens? What can you learn from what Nike is doing? You can learn that there are plenty of countries other than China that manufacture quality items at a price that makes sense for a highly sophisticated international company like Nike and that alone ought to open your eyes to the manufacturing world outside China.

But what is good for Nike may not be good for you and quite frankly there are countries listed above that I would immediately write off as too dangerous too corrupt too risky too lawless or just too difficult for the average company. One thing I feel compelled to mention though is that I would have written off Pakistan two years ago but all of our clients who have moved their apparel manufacturing from China to Pakistan in the last couple of years now swear by it and not at it.

Considerations for Choosing Your Manufacturing Location

Before committing to a location for your manufacturing efforts your business can benefit from considering the following factors:

Political climate: When looking into countries for your manufacturing it is essential to consider the political conditions of that nation and its regulations regarding labor and environmental laws.

A lot of you (raises hand) are wearing Nikes right now. For the fiscal year ending May 31 2021 Nike reported its revenue was up 19% to $44.5 billion for the year. But that’s here. What about in the Metaverse?

Why Nike is interested in the Metaverse

For those as of yet unfamiliar with the concept the easiest — yet very incomplete — way of imagining the Metaverse is imagining yourself existing in a real-life video game. Nike enters and provides very cool meta-stuff.

This is no joke. Nike is very serious about the Metaverse.

Patent filings dating way back to the pre-Metaverse universe in 2018 reveal that Nike has seriously been stockpiling the tools with which it can do business in the Metaverse. These digital tools will include sneakers but also avatars and other forms of virtual branding. Sure Nike intends to sell you digital products (and you will buy them because Nike knows how to make you want them) but the meta-plan revolves around entire digital worlds.

Is this just Nike being Nike? Sure but if we choose to define that as creating net-new revenue streams as it has throughout its entire history then good for it. Someone’s going to own the Metaverse swag and it might as well be Nike.

The Metaverse has rules that will be new for Nike

Nike needs to be prepared for the notion of destruction by duplication. In this temporal world Nike has been very litigious of late with its intellectual property (IP). Yet in the Metaverse duplication will transcend our current conceptions of what’s legal. The value of Nike’s meta-wares will absolutely be affected by what the company would deem to be pirates yet others would call artists.

In the real world there is a recent art project called the Museum of Forgeries with significant commercial application. In brief Brooklyn art collective Mschf bought an original Warhol for $20000 and made 999 exact forgeries. It then mixed in the original and sold all 1000 “might be real” Warhols for $250 each for a grand total of $250000 of which $230000 is profit.

The same thing will happen in the Metaverse. Some rare Nike drops (what we sneakerheads call a new release of a shoe or even a color — known as “colorway” — of a shoe) will be real some may be real and some will be either knowingly or unknowingly fake.

The Metaverse is new for courts

As to how courts are eventually going to deal with these metaverse disputes Samir Patel a Miami attorney and an appointee to the Miami-Dade Cryptocurrency Task Force recently tweeted:

A judge’s lack of knowledge on blockchain technology is completely missed by devs who think their inventions circumvent the law. Judges judge on what they know not what you know. https://t.co/QDnLihGu9e — Samir Patel (@SamirPatelLaw) October 26 2021

I talked to Patel about the realities of the new Metaverse and how it’s going to be a quick harsh discovery when judges realize that common law precedent will be more of a hindrance than a help in deciding Metaverse cases. As Patel said:

“Legal doctrine like real property rights breach of wet contracts and copyright infringement of human-derived work will govern the relationships in the metaverse (MV).”

He continued: “So when Nike wants to participate in the MV whether that be with virtual storefronts gear for avatars or create new products exclusively for the MV then its lawyers need to build a nexus between the MV legal violation or claim and meatspace.”

Just that fact that few-to-no judges (and very few lawyers) have used or even heard the term “meatspace” is itself an issue. The term refers to our physical world as opposed to cyberspace or a virtual environment such as the Metaverse.

So yes Metaverse claims will need to be dumbed down for judges at least initially written in such mundane ways using such traditional language so that judges won’t get lost.

Can Nike help build a Metaverse legal structure?

Patel sees a real opportunity here. “Nike has the resources to educate judges through trial because they can afford to pay their lawyers to drag out litigation but other smaller petitioners would have a hard time convincing a judge that they own virtual property that exists on a virtual land registry maintained by a decentralized blockchain” he said.

Patel explained to me that if he were to buy virtual land in the Metaverse the judge would probably view the transaction as a sale of goods and not a transfer of real estate. Because statutory regulations do not contain nor entertain the notion of virtual real estate this virtual land can’t be recorded in a virtual land registry because that registry is not governed by a municipality or sovereign.

“So if Nike were to sell a pair of virtual sneakers but don’t deliver the sneakers to the buyer then that is a breach of contract in the sale of sneakers. But the bargained-for exchange of value will still need to be articulated and possibly recorded in meatspace” Patel explained.

What this will mean in practice is a conundrum for judges where there is no evidence of a contract being made in the Metaverse such as a verbal contract entered into by two avatars. So how can a judge award for one side in this dispute? It’s exactly the same as a verbal contract done in meatspace. If an avatar can prove reliance on the verbal contract in the Metaverse much like they may be able to do it in meatspace then there may be evidence to support a plaintiff’s claims.

The Metaverse may be as litigious as meatspace

And there are going to be plenty of claims. If Nike has a problem with its creations being modified in meatspace without its permission and defendants in Nike lawsuits boldly answer that modifications are art not IP theft just imagine the Metaverse. Patel noted:

“IP laws will be tested in the MV if artificial intelligence is used to create landscapes or other virtual objects.”

He added: “That’s because AI derived work is not covered by U.S. copyright laws. So if I were to deploy AI in the MV and the AI creates something wonderful I have zero rights to the derived work and someone else can mimic the work and claim copyright for themselves. It will be exceedingly difficult to protect one’s copyrights because the MV could be so vast and the infringer could be an AI-deployed entity. Judges will treat these issues using meatspace copyright laws.”

This leaves us with the only viable way to change how judges view and decide cases in the Metaverse: by changing our existing laws to accommodate virtual reality. Without this change as viewed through the eyes of judges everything is meatspace and virtual reality doesn’t exist as a legal reality.

The true legal reality as Patel pointed out is that “Nike would be prudent to hire attorneys that are well-versed and I mean really well-versed in real property the Uniform Commercial Code as well as experts in blockchain technology.”

With the Metaverse providing a new virtual world of opportunities to create sell buy and sue it’s going to be fascinating to watch through societal commercial and legal lenses. Just the fact that Nike has been getting ready to create sell and litigate in this new space means that you should also get ready for the reality of the Metaverse coming soon to a computer or phone very near you.

ACG ISPA and the brand’s famous Innovation Kitchen at its Beaverton Oregon WHQ are a testament to that. But one of Nike’s most interesting — and frankly underrated — innovation projects is its longstanding partnership with Swarovski. That project has reached a climax this week with the announcement of the duo’s crystal-shroud-clad Air Force 1s.

On the surface the Austrian luxury brand is a designer and manufacturer of jewelry watches and crystal decorations. But under the surface Swarovski is a formidable innovator in its own right. For several years now Nike and Swarovski have been collaborating on footwear drops ranging from the sparkling Air Max 97 to more recently a PE of Naomi Osaka’s signature on-court shoe.

Nike

The partnership’s product has been around since 2016 when the aforementioned AM97s dropped but it had been in the workings for much longer. Swarovski and Nike began talks eight years ago and every collaborative sneaker released since then has been an exercise in material innovation. Together the two brands have explored what crystals and their reflective properties can bring to footwear. A bejeweled sneaker is nothing new (hello Jimmy Choo) but a bejeweled sneaker that serves a specific function and looks good? That’s what Swarovski and Nike have been building since their partnership kicked off.

1 / 4 Nike

“Swarovski and Nike have been launching covetable and innovative products together for five years now. We are great collaborators bringing the best out of one another and proving how collaboration between creative partners elevates both to new heights” Swarovski interim CEO Michele Molon tells Highsnobiety.

To understand the significance of the crystal shroud Nike Air Force 1 one must first understand the project as a whole. On its own the Swarovski crystal-clad AF1 is a beautiful take on an icon that introduces a brand new reflective technology — retro reflection — to the footwear world. As part of a long-term investigation into material innovation it represents the latest step in a move by Nike and Swarovski to reimagine visibility in sneakers.

Nike

“With all our Swarovski sneaker partnerships we had a lot of fun exploring the edges of what’s possible for shine reflectivity and embellishment through advanced design development and manufacturing” explains Nike’s Marie Crow senior creative director of women’s lifestyle footwear. “This AF1 takes that to the next level by incorporating our most challenging reflective development to date with generative design and modularity to get to a really fresh look and update to the AF1. It’s a kind of co-creation with the wearer designing options that allow them to customize their reflectivity based on their look activity and mood.”

Each step along the way Swarovski and Nike have brought a new innovation to the table via their co-branded drops. Spring 2016’s Air Max 97 was an exercise in using crystal fabric on a Nike sneaker for the first time. The VaporMax that followed in 2019 actually incorporated crystal beads in the knitted upper while the Jordan Air Latitude 270 LXX in late 2019 attached fine crystal rocks to the inside of a strap on the upper allowing the wearer to reveal and conceal the reflectivity at will. Cactus Plant Flea Market’s recent Nike Dunk Low which is perhaps the most popular Swarovski-infused sneaker to date featured applied crystals with an imperfect topography resulting in a stunning light show.

Nike

The Nike Air Force 1 LXX features a shroud outfitted with specially-placed crystals that are retroreflective. This means that like the road reflectors that directly inspired the project the crystals reflect light directly towards the source. Normally crystals reflect light at an angle based on where the light is coming from and where on the crystal the light hits but the way Swarovski’s retroreflective crystals are shaped light is always directed right back to where it came from. The shoe’s shroud consists of four pieces all of which can be taken off individually with a special co-branded screwdriver making the shoe highly modular. The sneakers arrive in triple black and triple white two of the silhouette’s most iconic colorways.

What you’re getting when you buy a pair of the Swarovski-embedded AF1s is 126 years of crystal innovation literal road reflector technology and a totally new reflectivity concept combined with one of if not the most iconic sneaker in Nike’s catalog. It’s why the crop is the perfect crescendo in Swarovski and Nike’s partnership thus far. “We know style and finishes are meaningful innovation for [our female consumers] so when we multiplied that insight with Swarovski’s expertise we were able to design industrial-strength reflectivity into a fashion application for the first time” says Crow.

1 / 4 Nike

While this particular project is technically categorized as a women’s release the evolution of the products reflects the general trend towards more unisex offerings in the sneaker industry. As Highsnobiety’s own Lucy Thorpe wrote in her think-piece on gender equality in the sneaker marketplace women don’t want to be pandered to. They want the same iconic designs made available in their sizes.

The fact that Swarovski and Nike have worked on the Nike Dunk (via Cactus Plant Flea Market) and now the Air Force 1 speaks volumes and is a huge stride in the right direction. Without a doubt the Air Force 1 will appeal to both female and male sneakerheads alike which underlines the great work both brands have done to apply their respective expertise to the current sneaker zeitgeist.

Nike

“Material innovation can transcend gender and we’ve seen our partnerships with Swarovski be widely coveted” Crow explains. “We find when we start with women’s insights we get to unique design outcomes. In this case we are solving for an edge of city expression through reflective embellishment which feels bold and protective and can be styled up and down through customization. Anyone is welcome to adopt them into their AF1 rotation to style in their own way.”

The Nike Air Force 1 LXX is set to be released on December 2 exclusively via the SNKRS app. The sneakers can be checked out in-store starting today at Swarovski Instant Wonder concept stores in Zurich Paris NY (Rockefeller Center and Soho) Los Angeles (Century City).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbHZlcnNjcmVlbmFuZHJvbGwuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjAvMjI3OTMzMjQvbGVicm9uLWphbWVzLXJlc3BvbmRzLWVuZXMta2FudGVyLWNyaXRpY2lzbS1uaWtlLXRpZXMtY2hpbmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LeBron James responds to Enes Kanter's criticism of his ties to Nike China,"Prior to the Lakers’ Friday matchup against the Celtics veteran Boston center Enes Kanter called out LeBron James on Twitter for his and Nike’s continued business in China and announced that he would be wearing shoes criticizing the Lakers star.

The sneakers — which depict among other things James with bags of money behind him kneeling and being crowned by what appears to be a caricature of Chinese president Xi Jinping — were Kanter’s latest attempt this season at raising awareness of accused human rights abuses in China against the ethnic minority Uighur Muslims that have been declared a genocide by the U.S. State Department and Nike’s longtime ties to the country.

Did you educate yourself about the slave labor that made your shoes or is that not part of your research? pic.twitter.com/YUA8rGYeoZ — Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) November 18 2021

Kanter who wears a Nike jersey every game he plays in and has multiple current and former teammates with sneaker business-related ties to China called out James specifically in a likely reference to James’ much-criticized response to Daryl Morey’s “fight for freedom stand with Hong Kong” tweet that led to the Lakers and their families being trapped in their hotels during a preseason trip to China in 2019.

After the game James was asked if he had any response to Kanter’s critique and while he said “no” he also talked for a little less than a minute about why he wouldn’t be specifically rebutting the substance of Kanter’s call-out.

“I think if you know me I don’t really give too many people my energy. And he’s definitely not someone I will give my energy to. Trying to use my name to create an opportunity for himself” James said. “He’s always kind of had a word or two to say in my direction and as men really if you had an issue with somebody you’d really come up to them. And he had his opportunity tonight. I saw him in the hallway and he walked right by me.”

James signed a lifetime deal with Nike in 2015 that is reportedly worth approximately $1 billion.

Phil Murphy recently announced that the state intends to purchase a 9 mile 135-acre stretch of land across eight tightly-packed municipalities in northern New Jersey formerly the site of a decommissioned rail line and property of Norfolk Southern Railway.

And following ""decades of local advocacy work"" and three years of direct negotiation with Norfolk Southern according to Dene Lee senior director of the Open Space Institute's Northeast Land Program a project known as the Essex-Hudson Greenway is finally ready to move forward.

The objective is to create a ""multi-use linear"" park as Lee put it across Montclair Glen Ridge Bloomfield Belleville Newark Kearny Secaucus and Jersey City.

A release from the governor's office said that the Essex-Hudson Greenway when done will become the first new state park in New Jersey since 2006.

Lee said that increasing recreational open space is obviously a part of it but devising new commuting opportunities is a top priority too and that will help to put the ""green"" in ""greenway.""

""It will hopefully bring people out of their cars and onto their bikes and walking to get to work and you have many people in the communities that it traverses that maybe don't have access to cars"" she said.

The plot of land is an eyesore right now said Essex County Commissioner and Montclair resident Brendan Gill but its development will be ""transformative"" and bring residents closer not only to their places of employment but also schools and houses of worship.

""There's also a tremendous economic development upside to this project as well"" Gill said ""This trail actually is a gateway to many of the downtown and shopping areas of the communities.""

Those communities Gill said each have their own landscape and character but they also have a lot in common and he said the Greenway will showcase both of those truths.

There's no firm timeline for completion according to Gill but this is now a matter of if not when — so the Greenway won't be open tomorrow but as soon as it can be.

""This is a commitment from the state and a down payment that this project is going to happen"" he said. ""There's still work to be done to make it a reality.""

Lee said projects like these are often handled in phases so sections could be made available to locals in a piecemeal manner.

""Each step will take time and energy and effort but this is really a moment to pause and really be proud of how far we've come"" she said.

Rory McIlroy's ball on Saturday after his tee shot on the 17th hole at Jumeirah Golf Estates. twitter.com

Rory McIlroy and Harry Diamond looked up looked back and never once looked forward. During last year’s Northern Trust event player and caddie had had their ball nestle up against a steep bank left of a green only for McIlroy to ricochet his ball off a rock on the ensuing shot and the ball to end up in the water behind him. “Oh no” the announcer said on the PGA Tour Live broadcast.

On Saturday then McIlroy and Diamond looked back in order not to look back again. During the third round of the DP World Tour Championship McIlroy’s tee shot on the par-3 17th rolled off a slope left of the green somehow struck a rock fronting the water twice and settled on another rock inches behind a small grass embankment. And player and caddie were having flashbacks.

“Yeah Harry was pleading with me not to hit it” McIlroy said. “Just go back; we can make four; we can make four at the last. It was reminiscent — you guys might have it on tape. I missed the second hole in Boston right a couple years ago when I was playing with Tiger [Woods] and I was trying to hit it out of the hazard similar sort of thing and went straight into the water.

“Harry and I were both thinking of that when we were looking at it.”

While Diamond learned not to hit the shot McIlroy found a way how to.

Shaking off his caddie the four-time major champion caught his ball clean it landed just over the left greenside bunker and rolled just off the right side of the green. From there he chipped to within a foot and he’ll begin Sunday’s final round of the season-ending event on the European Tour with a one-shot lead.

“I just thought if I got enough on it hit a descending blow on it it would basically hop up and do what it did” McIlroy said. “I thought best I could do was in that far trap but it just stopped short of that. …

“It was an important four.”

On the 17th tee after he swung McIlroy dropped his left hand from his iron on his follow-through and froze. When he reached the ball he and Diamond stood over it Diamond bent over to check the gap between grass and ball and McIlroy took a few practice swings. Diamond then backed off.

“It’s just on a slight downslope” an announcer said on the Golf Channel broadcast. “That’s why it hasn’t gone into the water on the rock. If it was on a flat lie I think he’d get the club under it better. It’s going to hit the bank. It’s just a case of — because he’s thinking he might knock it in the water on the other side.

“Or pop up and hit him on the leg” another announcer said.

The scene was reminiscent too of another McIlroy-Diamond exchange. Earlier this year while protecting a two-shot lead at the Wells Fargo Championship McIlroy had hit his drive on the 18th at Quail Hollow into a penalty area Diamond convinced him to take a drop rather than hitting and McIlroy held on.

“Harry was awesome out there today especially that decision on the last” McIlroy said. “I was ready to get in there and try to play that with a lob wedge and he was sort of like ‘Let’s take a step back let’s think about this. Where’s the best place you’re hitting your third from?’ So he sort of calmed me down and slowed me down a little bit and said ‘Pal let’s just think about this a little bit.’”

It is a cemetery for the royal families but some prominent...

Hubbaren Shehu is the most visited historic site in the ancient city of Sokoto. It is a cemetery for the royal families but some prominent Nigerians were also buried there. They include the former Eze-Igbo of Sokoto Dr. Muhammadu Nweke Umaru Ali Shinkafi among others.

Hubbare was initially the private residence of the late Islamic Reformer Sheikh Usman Bin Fordiyo fondly called Shehu Danfodio in Sokoto and other Hausa speaking states of the northern Nigeria who died on April 20 1817.

Shehu was buried in one of his wives’ rooms Hauwa’u the mother of the pioneer Sultan of Sokoto Muhammadu Bello. Beside his tomb were the graves of two of his sons Sambo and Hassan.

However the place later turned to a full-fledged royal cemetery where his lieutenants and former Sultans who were his direct descendants were buried.

Daily Trust gathered that Hubbare was divided according to the number of Sheikh Danfodio’s children so that each family would have a place to bury their loved ones.

Hundreds of pilgrims visit Hubbare every day from different parts of the country and beyond to pay their respect and pray for the great Islamic Reformer and founder of Sokoto Caliphate.

According to Mai Bude Hubbare (the person charged with taking care of Hubbare) Alhaji Bala Ibrahim the visits climax during the ed-el-Kabir Maulud and Shura festivals and the pilgrims cut across sexes and races.

Ibrahim told our reporter that eight Sultans were resting at the Hubbare and the most recent one was Sultan Ibrahim Dasuki who died four years ago.

Daily Trust gathered that the other rooms for his wives were still occupied by some women but we could not ascertain whether they were parts of his descendants or not.

As one steps into the main entrance of Hubbare the first port of call is ‘Jangirde’ a school where Sheikh taught his students and there was a section where his wives were said to have lived and a burial ground.

Our reporter observed visitors trooping into Hubbare greeted by women and children who lined up along the long path leading to Shehu’s tomb soliciting for alms.

The most common alms given to them as observed by our reporter were grains because according to our findings some villagers brought grains to Hubbare and spread on graves seeking for bumper harvest in the next farming season.

However one of the guides at the site told Daily Trust that there were people recruited to guide the pilgrims on the etiquettes of visiting burial sites to avoid actions that were against Islam.

“Some of the pilgrims are ignorant of these etiquettes. They do things which are contrary to the teachings of the Holy Prophet (SAW).

“Some of them spread grains on graves of prominent lieutenants of Shehu which is very wrong. So our job is to educate them. Teach them what to do and say while visiting grave sites” he said.

According to him some of the people visiting the site were those who could not make it to the Holy Land to visit the tomb of the Holy Prophet (SAW).

“They therefore come to Sokoto to visit the tomb of Shehu” he said.

Our reporter observed that the other side for prominent people was in dire need of attention.

Speaking to Daily Trust one of the pilgrims Malam Shehu a nomad from Kayama in Kwara State said “I feel happy coming here and I pray to come back next year.

“I always feel happy coming to this place. If God permits I will return here next year.”

Shehu however requested for a picture of Jingirde in order to have something to prove to his kinsmen that he was once a visitor to Hubbare.

“Pls help me take the picture of this place for me” he said pointing at Jangirde.

“I want to show it to my people I want them to know that I visited Hubbaren Shehu in Sokoto. I am so happy to be here. This is the place I’ve always wanted to visit” he added.

According to him he was in Sokoto to pick his daughter in-law but decided to use the opportunity to visit the site.

Mai Bude Hubbare Ibrahim could not give the exact number of people who visit Hubbare every day but said the visit climaxes during Islamic festive periods like Eids Maulud and Shura festivals.

“During these periods we witness unprecedented surge in the number of visitors. We allow some into our private houses because the two guest houses we have cannot accommodate them” he said.

He remarked that Hubbare is usually overwhelmed with visitors on Thursdays and Fridays.

On why Fulanis were the most regular visitors to the site he said it could be because Shehu was from their tribe but people from other tribes also visit the site.

Ibrahim explained that they usually take advantage of the visits to preach the gospel of peace and unity among the ummah.

He however attributed the poor sanitary condition of the place to the influx of pilgrims.

“But we are doing our best to keep it clean and secured” he said.

He also noted that business activities around Hubbare were always booming because of the visitors.

Who is Danfodio

Shehu Danfodio was a religious teacher who became the leader of a revolution. He criticized the elite and changed the political system in present-day northern Nigeria.

Danfodio was born on December 15 1754 in the village of Maratta in the Hausa-speaking city state of Gobir in what is today northern Nigeria. He studied law theology and philosophy in Agadez (in what is today Niger Republic) under Islamic scholar Jibril Ibn Umar. Because of his religious knowledge and authority he later came to be referred to respectfully as Sheikh Usman.

After completing his studies he went back to Gobir and began to preach Islam to the people who at that time mixed paganism with Islam. His popularity grew in Gobir and got to a stage where the then King of Gobir Rimfa saw Usman dan Fodio as a threat and attempted to assassinate him.

Usman escaped and started moving among rural communities preaching teaching and writing. In the year 1803 Sheikh Usman and hundreds of his followers migrated to Gudu where he continued to propagate Islam. While at Gudu Usman dan Fodio declared a holy war (jihad) against King Yunfa of Gobir (Rimfa’s son and successor) and his people as he felt their way of life did not correspond with the teachings of Islam.

The declaration of the holy war spread across Hausa land and many people volunteered to join his army. In 1804 he formally declared a holy war on the whole of Hausa land. In 1808 Usman and his followers conquered Gobir Kano and other Hausa city-states. He retired from battle in 1811 and returned to teaching and writing but his armies continued their conquests until 1815.

This religious revolution united the Hausa states under Islamic law and in 1812 led to the establishment of an empire called the Sokoto Caliphate composed of emirates and sub-emirates many of which were built on the sites of previous Hausa states. The Sokoto Caliphate became the most powerful economic and political system of the region during the 19th Century and contributed profoundly to the Islamization of Northern Nigeria.

His Islamic religious empire includes most of what is now northern Nigeria and parts of Niger as well as northern Cameroon.",,,,,,

The agency awarded other transactional agreements for an “accelerated concept design” phase of the program according to the statement.

The interceptors are intended to counter a hypersonic weapon during its glide phase of flight a challenge as the missiles can travel more than five times the speed of sound and can maneuver making it hard to predict a missile’s trajectory.

The interceptors will be designed to fit into the U.S. Navy’s current Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense destroyers. It will be fired from its standard Vertical Launch System and integrated with the modified Baseline 9 Aegis Weapon System that detects tracks controls and engages hypersonic threats the statement notes.

“We are pleased to have these contractors working with us to develop design concepts for the GPI” Rear Adm. Tom Druggan MDA’s Sea-based Weapon Systems program executive said in the statement. “Multiple awards allow us to execute a risk reduction phase to explore industry concepts and maximize the benefits of a competitive environment to demonstrate the most effective and reliable Glide Phase Interceptor for regional hypersonic defense as soon as possible.”

The initial development phase “will focus on reducing technical risk rapidly developing technology and demonstrating the ability to intercept a hypersonic threat” according to a Nov. 19 Raytheon statement.

“Raytheon Technologies systems are the cornerstone of today’s ballistic missile defenses. We’re building on that knowledge to advance the missile defense system for future threats” Tay Fitzgerald Raytheon’s vice president of strategic missile defense said in the statement. “GPI’s speed ability to withstand extreme heat and maneuverability will make it the first missile designed to engage this advanced threat.”

All three companies have experience in hypersonic weapons development.

Both Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are also competitively developing scramjet-powered hypersonic missiles as part of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program run by the Air Force and DARPA.

And Lockheed is the lead systems integrator for what will be the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike offensive hypersonic missile and the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon. Northrop Grumman designed the motor for both weapons.

Lockheed is also developing the Air Force’s hypersonic AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon.

Northrop began a push to develop hypersonic missile capability in 2019 when the Pentagon made hypersonic capability a priority and Lockheed Martin broke ground on a new facility in Alabama that same year geared toward developing testing and producing hypersonic weapons.

The Missile Defense Agency hit the pause button on its effort in the summer of 2020 to bring a defensive hypersonic weapon online. But MDA took steps this year to move forward again and received feedback from industry confirming a glide phase interceptor is something that can be done “and we shouldn’t be afraid to go do it” Vice Adm. Jon Hill MDA director told Defense News earlier this year.

Just a year ago MDA had a different answer on where it was going with hypersonic defense focusing on solutions under development in the science and technology phase Hill said.

But after taking a step back and assessing the U.S. ballistic missile defense capability the agency realized it already had some means to tackle hypersonic weapons using sea-based assets like a Navy Carrier Strike Group with the ability to engage high-speed maneuvering threats during the terminal phase of flight.

The Aegis ship which boasts launch-on-remote weaponry is capable of seeing hypersonic weapons in the battlespace because “remember they’re not very high” Hill said. “They are around 70 kilometers.”

Future efforts already scheduled to come online are systems like the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) a satellite that will be placed in low-earth orbit to spot hypersonic missiles in flight and the SPY-6 radar will further increase the ability to track hypersonic threats Hill added.

The agency decided it would make the most sense to focus on taking out hypersonic weapons in the glide phase of flight where they are most vulnerable Hill said.

MDA then assessed current and possible capability and concepts to be able to detect track and intercept a hypersonic weapon in that glide phase.

The agency also studied data from adversaries’ systems. “Our adversaries are constantly flying these things and we are collecting that data with the existing sensor architecture” Hill said. “We were pulling that data down and we could run it through our high fidelity systems models.”

Taking that data MDA asked “What sort of material do we need on the seekers? What sort of divert capability do we need? Do we use a fragmentation warhead or do we want to do hit-to-kill in the glide phase because it’s a different battle? It’s a different environment” Hill said.

MDA has discovered it can use the existing booster stacks and can focus on developing a front end for an interceptor Hill said. What’s missing now is the weapon he noted.

Armed with the new strategy the agency came out with a solicitation to industry asking for white papers on solutions for its GPI in April.

While the MDA is still doing risk reduction for more exquisite capabilities to be brought online later Hill said “from a regional perspective we can go after this now.”

The agency will first focus on providing a capability to the Navy. “If this is successful” Hill said “we can move it to the land-based battery to protect other things against that sort of hypersonic threat.”

At the time of release the station was flying about 260 miles (420 kilometers) over the South Pacific Ocean.

The Cygnus spacecraft successfully departed the International Space Station more than three months after arriving at the space station to deliver about 8000 pounds (3600 kilograms) of scientific investigations and supplies to the orbiting laboratory.

After departure the Kentucky Re-Entry Probe Experiment (KREPE) stowed inside Cygnus will take measurements to demonstrate a thermal protection system for spacecraft and their contents during re-entry in Earth’s atmosphere which can be difficult to replicate in ground simulations.

Cygnus will deorbit on Wednesday December 15 following a deorbit engine firing to set up a destructive re-entry in which the spacecraft filled with waste the space station crew packed in the spacecraft will burn up in Earth’s atmosphere.

Cygnus arrived at the space station on August 12 following a launch two days prior on Northrop Grumman’s Antares rocket from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island Virginia.

Press Release Tucson 19 November 2021: Raytheon Missiles & Defense a Raytheon Technologies business has been selected by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) as one of the companies to develop and test the first interceptor specifically designed to defeat hypersonic threats. The weapon called Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) will defeat a new generation of hypersonic missiles – weapons that travel more than five times the speed of sound and manoeuvre rapidly in flight.

“Raytheon Technologies systems are the cornerstone of today’s ballistic missile defences. We’re building on that knowledge to advance the missile defence system for future threats” said Tay Fitzgerald vice president of Strategic Missile Defense. “GPI’s speed ability to withstand extreme heat and manoeuvrability will make it the first missile designed to engage this advanced threat.”

GPI will intercept hypersonic weapons in the glide phase of flight which occurs once a missile has re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and is manoeuvring toward its target. The initial development phase will focus on reducing technical risk rapidly developing technology and demonstrating the ability to intercept a hypersonic threat. Developed on behalf of the MDA GPI will be integrated into the US Navy’s Aegis Weapon System a ship- and shore-based defence system.

Raytheon Technologies’ missile defence portfolio combines sensors interceptors and command and control networks to track and defeat a wide range of threats.

Only a few images of this airframe have surfaced so far. Until now three sightings of the same or identical airframes have been reported — one over the Philippines and two over America’s premier flight test location in California and Nevada

The US Air Force’s RQ-180 ‘White Bat’ is believed to be its newest spy drone in the category of high-altitude long-endurance drones (HALE). The video clearly demonstrates that the Pentagon is on the verge of revealing its ‘White Bat’ very soon.

The video titled “Heritage Today – ISR And Innovation” delves into the US Air Force’s intelligence and espionage capabilities throughout the last decade. At the end of the video the well-known drone Global Hawk arrives and a caption says “The days of balloons and biplanes have been replaced by White Bats”.

In the next frame the video released by the Profession of Arms Center of Excellence (PACE) of the US Air Force directly shows the animated technical drawings of the RQ-180 ‘White Bat’ alluding to the RQ-180’s potential high-tech capabilities.

Media reports have speculated over the years about the spy drone’s physical shape and this newly released video revealed the same shape that several media outlets including the prestigious Aviation Week had projected.

As described by The Drive the USAF wouldn’t be showing off the real drone which is still classified. It speculated that there could be several variants of this HALE stealthy drone.

ICYMI the U.S. Air Force's secret stealth spy drone has appeared in public for the first time flying high over California. The RQ-180 is like a robotic stealth bomber minus the bombs. https://t.co/El2rVa7W5m #RQ180 #USAF pic.twitter.com/fcOY9FrvaW — David Axe (@daxe) November 13 2020

The aircraft’s nicknames even if unofficial are ‘Great White Bat’ and ‘Shikaka’ according to a report from Aviation Week which has subsequently been confirmed by further sources. Shikaka is the name of a fictional sacred white bat which appears in the Jim Carrey movie Ace Ventura 2 from 1995.

As discovered by Aviation Week the US Air Force has established the 74th Reconnaissance Squadron at Beale Air Force Base California to operate the RQ-180 remotely. The insignia of this unit includes a huge white bat which corresponds to the RQ-180’s claimed nicknames.

It’s unclear when the US will make a statement on the White Bat. However speculation is rife that both RQ-180 and B-21 Raider programs may run concurrently. There are five B-21 stealth bombers under various stages of production USAF Secretary Frank Kendell revealed in September this year."

Speaking to CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Friday Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the next iteration of the internet will enable companies to reduce wastefulness and increase efficiency.

“We waste a whole bunch of things to overcompensate for the fact that we don’t simulate” he said referring to the metaverse as an “omniverse.”

“We want to simulate all factories in metaverses in this omniverse. We want to simulate plants in the omniverse. We want to simulate the world’s power grids in the omniverse” he added.

Huang explained that by simulating certain real-world objects businesses could decrease the amount of waste produced and save money. “That’s the reason why the economics are so good for companies” he said. “They’re willing to invest a small amount of money to buy into this artificial intelligence capability but what they save is hopefully hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.”

Nvidia appears to be benefitting from the increased discourse over what the metaverse is and how brands can get involved. Last week the California-based company reported record revenue of $7.1 billion USD up 50% from a year earlier. This includes a gaming revenue of $3.2 billion USD up 42% from a year earlier.

In other news a truck full of Nvidia RTX 30 graphics cards were stolen earlier this month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1pbWFnZS1zY2FsaW5nLWNhbi1ub3ctYmUtdXNlZC1vbi1hbWQtb3ItaW50ZWwtdGhyb3VnaC1sb3NzbGVzcy1zY2FsaW5nL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1pbWFnZS1zY2FsaW5nLWNhbi1ub3ctYmUtdXNlZC1vbi1hbWQtb3ItaW50ZWwtdGhyb3VnaC1sb3NzbGVzcy1zY2FsaW5nL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Image Scaling Can Now Be Used on AMD or Intel Through Lossless Scaling,"NVIDIA Image Scaling was released a few days ago as an updated version of NVIDIA's own spatial upscaling technology. The new algorithm uses a 6-tap filter with 4 directional scaling and adaptive sharpening filters to boost performance and its sharpening and upscaling occur in a single pass making it more efficient than similar methods according to NVIDIA.

As we've said in our report NVIDIA Image Scaling doesn't rely on any proprietary software and therefore its in-game implementations will be usable regardless of your graphics card's manufacturer (AMD or even Intel). However no games have native support for NIS yet and AMD or Intel users obviously cannot rely on NVIDIA's Control Panel or GeForce Experience software to activate it.

That can be circumvented through programs like Lossless Scaling though whose 1.6 release now supports NIS in addition to FSR.

Added another great upscaler - NIS (NVIDIA Image Scaling). Notes:

The sharpness setting is unified for both FSR and NIS in the range [0–1.0] where 1.0 is the maximum sharpness.

Lossless Scaling isn't free software (there is a demo but the full version is priced at $3.99) but if you already own it there's another option now available for you to try.

This version of NVIDIA Image Scaling isn't quite as good as the native one by the way as the developer of Lossless Scaling candidly admitted on the Steam forums.

It uses the official shader but has FP16 support not enabled for now as it has been confirmed not to work on the RTX 3000 for some reason.

Also I do not know exactly what implementation they use in the driver and for sure they do not waste GPU resources on image capture.

If you own an NVIDIA graphics card and have been having issues with getting the custom resolution created by NIS to show in the games download the GeForce hotfix driver 496.84.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2Rvb20tZXRlcm5hbC1pcy1oYXZpbmctaXNzdWVzLXdpdGgtbGF0ZXN0LW52aWRpYS1ncmFwaGljcy1kcml2ZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doom Eternal is Having Issues with Latest Nvidia Graphics Drivers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2Rvb20tZXRlcm5hbC1pcy1oYXZpbmctaXNzdWVzLXdpdGgtbGF0ZXN0LW52aWRpYS1ncmFwaGljcy1kcml2ZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYXJjaGl0b3NoLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExL252aWRpYXMtY2VvLWplbnNlbi1odWFuZy1kYXp6bGVzLXdpdGgta2V5LWFubm91bmNlbWVudHMtYW5kLW5ldy10b29scy1mb3Itb21uaXZlcnNlL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vYXJjaGl0b3NoLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExL252aWRpYXMtY2VvLWplbnNlbi1odWFuZy1kYXp6bGVzLXdpdGgta2V5LWFubm91bmNlbWVudHMtYW5kLW5ldy10b29scy1mb3Itb21uaXZlcnNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang Dazzles with Key Announcements and New Tools for Omniverse,"by

NVIDIA HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY in the past five years with growth in their technology led by CEO Jensen Huang. He is driven by a passion for technologies that create a better world with efficient technologies that can help solve problems like climate change supply chain issues and medical research.

AI and Simulation

First off Omniverse NVIDIA’s simulation for creating and connecting virtual worlds is becoming more powerful with new tools including Omniverse Avatar for creating digital avatars with embodied AI’s in the virtual world. The Omniverse Avatar platform allows companies to create avatars that people can interact with. This uses NVIDIA’s speech AI computer vision understanding of language cues with recommendations and realistic simulation technologies.

A demonstration of a toy version of CEO Jensen Huang (part of Project Tokkio) being asked complicated questions using words and included the natural movement of the body and hand gestures people do when they communicate creating a very natural looking avatar.

Those watching the keynote were treated to a demonstration of Project Tokkio technology wherein a toy version of CEO Jensen Huang was being asked complicated questions using words. A natural-looking avatar (“toy me” of Huang) answered using natural body movements and hand gestures typically used by real humans.

Omniverse

Project Tokkio is a customer service kiosk with an Omniverse Maxine-powered AI talking to customers. Omniverse Replicator is a synthetic data engine that will help businesses create more accurate digital twins creating better AI tools for our world.

Omniverse Replicator has two applications. NVIDIA Drive Sim gives us a digital twin of vehicles to see how they drive in the virtual world before putting them on the road. NVIDIA Isaac Sim creates a digital twin of manipulating robots. Replicator allows companies to use this technology to learn “effective” skills in the virtual environment before being used in the real world for production or any situation.

Architects deal with many-layered complexities in creating and designing. A digital twin of a project could help solve engineering structural and manufacturing obstacles early in the design stage. The client can view the project in real-time and watch the progress and actively participate in the process. You can develop a virtual twin to test the limitations of a design. You can see the pitfalls before you have built something and create changes in real-time.

Imagine the possibilities of Omniverse with real-time collaboration across multiple artists with the ability to access talent across the world. It gives architects flexibility without the worry of expanding their office space.

Omniverse has new features including Showroom Farm AR and VR.

Omniverse in Industry

Omniverse launched in December 2020 and has been downloaded by 70000 people. Professionals at 700 companies are using Omniverse including gaming CAD medical imaging autonomous vehicle developers and creatives in Film & Television.

Omniverse Enterprise is available on November 9th. It allows design teams working across different software packages using the USD format to collaborate in real-time in a shared virtual space on any device with access to global teams around the world. Huang said during his keynote that “Omniverse will revolutionize how the 43 million designers in the world collaborate.”

A few Fortune 500 companies and global design leaders demonstrated their use of Omniverse including HKS Architects KPF Architects Ericsson Lockheed Martin CannonDesign Epigraph and Sony Pictures Animation.

CannonDesign is a global architecture engineering and consulting firm using Omniverse Enterprise to speed up collaborative design. Sony Pictures is using Omniverse Enterprise to enable multiple artists to work on a single scene together in real-time. Ericsson is a leading telecommunications company using the Omniverse platform to create digital twins of cities to simulate and visualize signal propagation to accelerate feature development and insights into their 5G networks.

Bentley Systems the infrastructure engineering software company announced the availability of Bentley iTwin for NVIDIA Omniverse which can enable next-generation physically accurate 4D visualization and construction simulation of infrastructure digital twins for the global infrastructure engineering industry.

Bentley iTwin will allow companies to explore and visualize massive infrastructure in a virtual world like they are walking through it in real-time. Ersi a leading urban design mapping software is bringing Omniverse into the Ersi ArcGIS City Engine application connecting millions of ArcGIS ecosystem users to the Omniverse platform. Teams can apply full 3D city models and geographic content with photorealism giving companies and end-users the ability to create digital twins in the virtual worlds of Omniverse.

USD at the center Omniverse

USD (Universal Scene Description) is a file format and is at the heart of Omniverse. USD was invented at Pixar and the current USD format is roughly the fourth generation of Pixar’s “composed scene description” technology.

In August of this year Apple NVIDIA and Pixar joined forces to expand USD to perform physics in the Omniverse in a consistent way as the real world. In other words simulations obey the laws of physics. Even more important the joint work by NVIDIA Apple and Pixar enable the new physics extensions for USD to be flexible letting developers select which solvers to work with but all driven by the same data set of USD. Gamers prioritize speed over accuracy while architects and engineers prioritize accuracy over speed.

Omniverse uses USD (Universal Scene Description) to create the assets inside the virtual world across many leading applications. Software companies supporting USD include Graphisoft Autodesk Unreal Engine Adobe and many more. “USD is the HTML of 3D” stated Richard Kerris VP of NVIDIA Omniverse. In the keynote NVIDIA CEO Huang stated that there are 14 connectors that link apps together through Omniverse and 15 more are under development.

NVIDIA made the announcement that there are four new features coming to Omniverse—Showroom Farm AR and VR. All of them are in beta now except VR.

Omniverse is set to transform the way designers and creatives work together around the globe while enabling each designer to bring to bear on common projects their specialized skills knowledge and their preferred software tools while they jointly and in real-time work on projects together literally within the same 3D environments (scenes).

Since then the market for desktop GPUs has become a depressing mess. Supplies remain thin scalping is rampant and price inflation is upon us.

Case in point: 12 months ago I scored a Gigabyte RTX 3070 card from Best Buy that cost me $569. Now that same card is listed at $749 due to rising costs and Trump-era tariffs on China kicking back into effect earlier this year.

But good luck finding the card for even that price. PC graphics cards continue to sell out in minutes making it incredibly hard to buy one at normal retail value. To obtain the Gigabyte RTX 3070 immediately you’ll have to try eBay a third-party dealer Amazon or Newegg where it can cost an eye-popping $1200 or more.

To put things in perspective we decided to chart out the price increases for various Nvidia RTX 3000 graphics cards from GPU vendors such as Asus EVGA Gigabyte and MSI. To do so we looked at the initial launch price at either Best Buy or Newegg by using tools such as the Internet Archive PCPartPicker and news articles from a year ago.

We then looked up the current retail pricing and compared it to the costs consumers can find on third-party dealers at Amazon and Newegg. Finally we included the recent average selling price for each card on eBay using the site’s Terapeak tool. The results are below—try not to cry.

Nvidia RTX 3070 Models

Remember when the RTX 3070 was announced with a $499 starting price? Those days are long gone unless you can snag a Founders Edition model.

As you can see it's best to avoid buying the cards from third-party dealers on Amazon where prices are worse than those charged by scalpers on eBay although pricing can quickly fluctuate. (Where it's noted the terms ""Rev 2.0"" and ""LHR"" mean the product listing indicated that the card contains Nvidia's Ethereum hash rate limiter.)

Nvidia RTX 3080 Models

Prices go up again for the more powerful RTX 3080 card which initially arrived closer to $699.

Nvidia RTX 3090 Models

Meanwhile the price increases for the RTX 3090 have skyrocketed by over $500 to more than a $1000 depending where you buy.

Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti Models

Sadly the midrange $399-and-up RTX 3060 Ti now costs closer to a high-end graphics card if you buy from a scalper or third-party dealer.

The one exception to the inflation has been the Nvidia-branded Founders Edition models sold through Best Buy. Pricing for these limited-editions cards has remained the same through the past year. But to buy one consumers have often had to wait hours in line or even camp out.

Nvidia's RTX 3060 RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards were not included because they launched earlier this year."

Oil operations have also led to deforestation and settlement in Indigenous territory. Yet with few options Indigenous communities must choose to sell their land or fend off oil goliaths through small-scale industries like ecotourism.

Indigenous Groups of the Ecuadorian Amazon

The Amazon — the largest rainforest on Earth — covers more than a billion acres spanning eight South American countries and French Guyana. It contains a tenth of the world’s species as well as some 400 indigenous tribes where about 60 choose to remain isolated. However many have had contact with the outside world utilizing guns for hunting and accessing western medicine and education.

About a quarter of Ecuador’s 1.1 million Indigenous people live in the Amazon making up 10 Indigenous nationalities including the Cofán Siona Secoya and Waorani. Ecuador has taken some progressive measures in protecting Indigenous rights yet inequities remain. According to the World Bank Ecuador’s Indigenous households are 16% more likely to live in extreme poverty than non-Indigenous households. While the Ecuadorian constitution gives land ownership to Indigenous groups energy resources like oil are state-owned.

The Search for Black Gold

In Ecuador companies began searching for oil in the early 20th century but peak oil extraction began in the 1970s. U.S.-based Texaco Petroleum Co. — now known as Chevron — arrived in Ecuador in the 1960s and remained its primary oil company through the early 1990s.

A team of lawyers sued Chevron in 1993 for irresponsible waste management affecting 30000 Ecuadorians. The lawsuit accused Chevron of storing 18.5 billion gallons of wastewater in unlined pits. It also claimed Chevron dumped 16 million gallons of oil into the open. Following this scandal Chevron capped more than 200 oil pits and built schools and medical facilities in the area. The plaintiffs however argued this was insufficient. They claimed the oil spills caused long-lasting environmental damage and harm to human health – including skin conditions and cancer.

An Ecuadorian court ruled in 2011 that Chevron should pay $9.5 billion in damages. Three years later Chevron appealed to a U.S. federal court which found the verdict fraudulent. The Hague’s Permanent Court of Arbitration also ruled in favor of Chevron which has argued it never owned any assets in Ecuador and signed a settlement with the country in the late 1990s absolving it of any further responsibilities there.

Nearly 30 years later Chevron still denies liability and has paid nothing from the original ruling.

Ecuador’s Oil Production Today

Ecuador is still highly dependent on oil extraction to pay off debts to China as well as for state revenue. Yet while oil is omnipresent Michael Cepek — an anthropologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio and author of “Life in Oil” — believes oil companies today use better practices than Chevron did. He tells The Borgen Project companies are more careful about responsible waste management and use safety valves along pipelines.

Yet he does not discount that damaging spills are inevitable in an earthquake-prone country like Ecuador. “Until you totally rebuild the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline or do something to make pipelines impervious to seismic activity you’re just gonna have oil spills” he said.

According to the advocacy organization Amazon Frontlines there are now more than 950 oil wells in the Amazon where — between 2005 and 2015 — there were nearly 1170 oil spills in Ecuador alone. As recently as April 2020 broken pipelines from Ecuador’s Petroecuador and the private company OPC Consortium spilled more than 15000 gallons of oil. The spill affected more than 100000 people including more than 100 Indigenous communities. Both oil companies claim to have cleaned up the spills. Yet recent tests reveal heavy metals are still present in the rivers.

The ITT Initiative: A Call to Save the Rainforest or Cynical Criticism?

Ecuador’s then-president Rafael Correa created an international trust fund in 2007 through his Yasuni-ITT Initiative. The goal was to raise half the value of the oil reserve — some $3.6 billion — under Ecuador’s Yasuní Park by 2023. If the initiative met its goal from international donations the 796 million barrels of oil would stay underground. The plan ultimately failed raising less than half of 1% of its goal six years into the initiative.

Ecuador’s foreign debts continued to lurk and Correa ended the initiative in 2013 allowing oil companies to drill.

Cepek doubts Correa ever expected the international community to save Yasuní. He believes the initiative served as a lesson to hypocritical developed nations. “He put it at the ball in their lap saying ‘(If) you don’t want us to do this kind of extractivism … put your money where your mouth is” Cepek said adding that many others genuinely believed the plan would work and were devastated by its failure.

Caught Between A Road and a Pipeline

Indigenous communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon often find themselves in a difficult position. They can strike a deal with companies to sell their land for oil or risk losing everything regardless.

For 20 years Cepek conducted research in a Cofán community in Dureno where he witnessed those living there fighting off oil for years before finally giving in. They lost faith in western environmental activists he said who seemed dismissive of their lack of resources. For many Indigenous communities working with the oil companies equals money for necessities like health care. “The poverty is so extreme” Cepek said “it’s hard to say ‘no’ when you have no other ways to get money.”

Ecotourism in Ecuador: Sani Lodge

The Sani Isla community consists of about 600 Kichwa people from Ecuador’s Napo and Pastaza provinces. The Sani community built Sani Lodge for guests in 1999 where according to Javier Hualinga — a Sani Lodge guide at the time — the community was resisting two threatening proposals. One was to build a road through their community. The other was to allow Occidental Petroleum Corp. to run a pipeline through instead. In the end Occidental won Hualinga told The Borgen Project and the Sani community felt powerless because Ecuadorian law declared such energy resources are government-owned.

The Sani community built Sani Lodge to create jobs and consolidate greater power against encroaching oil companies. One of Sani Lodge’s primary goals today Hualinga said is to conserve the land. Sani Lodge “is a perfect excuse to fight the oil companies” he said “and has become our armor or shield.” At Sani Lodge guests can take personalized tours through the Amazon led by community guides. Guests also have the opportunity to visit Kichwa homes eat traditional meals and learn about Kichwa customs.

Sani Lodge is Ecuador’s only Indigenous-owned and managed ecolodge according to its website. All of the lodge’s profit stays within the community Hualinga says. Money goes toward expenses such as health care education and the preservation of Kichwa culture. Sani Lodge also partners with the Sani Warmi project which supports Indigenous women in small businesses.

The Instability of “Sustainable Tourism”

While Sani Lodge has provided the Sani community with some degree of autonomy it has not made life easy for its Kichwa residents. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic Sani Lodge struggled financially. With increasing pressure from oil companies the community is not in consensus about whether they should maintain their ecolodge or allow in oil.

The global pandemic has added to the lodge’s financial challenges Hualinga says. Sani Lodge closed for months. While Sani can normally accommodate 20 guests it is currently at just half-capacity.

Last year’s oil spill which affected the Napo River also made it difficult for the community to operate its lodge — to the point where Hualinga says reopening feels like starting “from zero once again.”

Light at the End of the Pipeline

At Sani Lodge guests can witness hundreds of species of birds as well as spider monkeys giant otters and occasionally jaguars. On his guided hikes Hualinga says he allows visitors to formulate their own opinions about what they see. Yet he hopes that their immersion will impact the way they understand the Amazon and the Indigenous communities that inhabit it.

The lodge has the potential to “show (guests) how important (it) is to protect the Amazon” he said “which is home not only for the diversity of flora and fauna but also the diversity of … culture and their abilities to live with it.”

ODFL,Old Dominion,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kbmouY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9jb2xsZWdlL210c3UvMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9tdHN1LW1pZGRsZS10ZW5uZXNzZWUtc3RhdGUtZm9vdGJhbGwtb2xkLWRvbWluaW9uLXNjb3JlLWxpdmUtdXBkYXRlcy84NTkwNjg4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bowl eligibility on hold for MTSU football: 5 things we learned from loss to Old Dominion,"MURFREESBORO - Middle Tennessee State lost 24-17 to Old Dominion on Saturday leaving no room for error to become bowl eligible.

The loss was the first at home this season for the Blue Raiders (5-6 Conference-USA 3-4).

Here are five things we learned about the loss to the Monarchs (5-6 4-3):

Bowl eligibility on hold

MTSU would have earned bowl eligibility with the victory the first time since 2018.

Instead MTSU will have to win its season finale at Florida International next Saturday.

Conference USA bowl affiliations include the Bahamas Bowl (vs. MAC) New Mexico Bowl (vs. Mountain West) Independence Bowl in Shreveport Louisiana (vs. BYU) and the New Orleans Bowl (vs. Sun Belt).

The Hawaii Bowl is an affiliate with C-USA every other year. MTSU went to the Hawaii Bowl in 2016.

""I've never lost doubt with the team even though we just lost"" said MTSU senior linebacker D.Q. Thomas of the team's must-win situation next week. ""We're capable of getting the job done and we'll do that.""

Missed opportunities

MTSU had 233 total yards and 14 first downs in the first half but had just 10 points to show for it.

Of their five possessions in the half the Blue Raiders missed a short field goal on their first possession settled for a field goal after getting inside the Old Dominion 6-yard line on another punted after getting to the ODU 41 on one and punted from their 46 near the end of the half.

MTSU also failed to score on a second-half drive inside the ODU 6 when a bad snap prevented the Blue Raiders from taking the lead in what was a 10-10 game at the time.

Trailing 24-17 MTSU had a long pass attempt that was underthrown and ultimately dropped inside the ODU 20. The Blue Raiders ultimately fumbled on the drive.

""We left a lot of points on the board"" MTSU freshman wide receiver Jaylin Lane said. ""I'm not going to put it on our special teams. As an offense we just have to put the ball in the end zone and we won't have those problems. I'm going to put that on us.""

106 yards TD for Jaylin Lane

Lane had 10 receptions for 107 yards and a touchdown.

His 26-yard TD reception from Nick Vattiato with 4:07 left in the fourth kept the Blue Raiders within striking distance.

Vattiato making his third start completed 31-of-45 for 281 yards and a TD. He tossed a third-quarter interception. Mike DiLiello was 5-of-6 passing for 32 yards and rushed for 19 yards and a touchdown.

Protecting the ball

Old Dominion did job holding onto the ball as an MTSU interception with 6:21 left in the third and a Blue Raiders fumble inside the final three minutes were the only turnovers for either team.

The Blue Raiders entered the game leading the nation in takeaways (29) but Saturday’s contest marked the second time in three games that MTSU did not force an opponent’s turnover.

The two turnovers puts MTSU at 13 for the season.

Blue Raider defense has tough fourth quarter

MTSU held Old Dominion to just 155 total yards and through three quarters. The Blue Raiders allowed 171 in the fourth quarter.

But Old Dominion had consecutive scoring drives in the fourth quarter that included a bevy of big plays.

The Monarchs had an 82-yard drive early in the quarter that included a 45-yard TD run by Elijah Davis. On the next drive a 60-yard pass play from Hayden Wolff to Ali Jennings set up another score to put ODU up 24-10.

Old Dominion scored on its first possession of the game an 80-yard drive. Between that and the fourth quarter barrage by the Monarchs MTSU allowed just 75 yards.

""I thought we did some good things defensively that kept us in the game"" MTSU coach Rick Stockstill said. ""Other than a couple of plays defensively I thought we played well""

Due to COVID restrictions Wu was honored with the award in October 2020 during a virtual event but received the physical award during a surprise presentation on Oct. 26. Wu's colleague Doug Streit ODU's executive director of IT security and planning and chair of the VASCAN steering committee joined one of his faculty meetings to present him with the award. Brian Payne vice provost for academic affairs and director of the Coastal Virginia Center for Cyber Innovation nominated Wu for the award.

VASCAN exists to strengthen informational technology security programs in Virginia and is overseen by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. The VASCAN Founders Award is presented annually to an information security professional auditor faculty member or researcher who has contributed to the Virginia information security community in a notable way.

Wu called the award ""a great honor for not only me but also the entire cybersecurity team at ODU."" He joined the University in 2016 to lead the cybersecurity program; under his direction the group of 11 students with no research funding has grown to more than 950 students and $10 million in actively funded research projects.

He credits the interdisciplinary teamwork of faculty advisors staff and students for the program's rapid growth and success.

""I am humbled to be in the company of people who have inspired me and helped shape my thinking"" he said. ""I hope our fast-growing cybersecurity program will train more cybersecurity professionals to close the workforce gap and help everyone enjoy a more secure cyber space.""

Wu has served as a mentor to Melvin Orienza president of the Cyber Security Student Association. ""He's my role model when it comes to leadership"" he said. ""He's been very supportive of our club's endeavors; he's made suggestions and he's sent us to competitions and conferences to help us interact with professionals in the field.

""He helps us envision our future careers in cybersecurity.""

Streit praised Wu's role not only in building ODU's cybersecurity program but as a partner with ITS.

""I have experienced firsthand his collaborative approach having partnered with him in development of technical labs - the Cyber Research Environment and the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative Coastal Virginia Node research and instructional lab called COVA SHARE"" he said. ""In addition to working closely with ITS to develop cutting-edge labs for our instruction and research he has included me in outreach efforts to our students and other opportunities for me to be engaged with the broader cybersecurity academic and research interests of the University.""

VASCAN established the Founders Award in 2015 in honor of Shirley Payne one of the organization's founding members a former information security officer at the University of Virginia and ""an extraordinarily generous collaborator regarding information security.""

Ford and GlobalFoundries Inc. announced the signing of a non-binding agreement that opens the door for the latter to create more semiconductors for the Blue Oval’s current and future vehicles.

GlobalFoundries is a global leader in feature-rich semiconductor manufacturing and will help Ford tackle the issue of semiconductor supply that has impacted the entire automotive industry. The agreement does not involve any cross-ownership between the companies.

“It’s critical that we create new ways of working with suppliers to give Ford – and America – greater independence in delivering the technologies and features our customers will most value in the future” said Jim Farley Ford president and CEO. “This agreement is just the beginning and a key part of our plan to vertically integrate key technologies and capabilities that will differentiate Ford far into the future.”

Not only will GlobalFoundries make chips for Ford’s current lineup of vehicles but it will also develop new ones to address the growing demand for advanced chips. These will be important to Ford’s future products.

The chips developed as a result of the agreement could include semiconductor solutions for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) battery management systems and in-vehicle networking for automated connected and electrified vehicles says Ford. The two companies will also explore expanded semiconductor manufacturing opportunities to “support the automotive industry.”

Ford said that it wants a say in how semiconductor chips are made according to Automotive News though it has no interest in producing them in-house.

“GF is committed to building innovative alliances with the world’s leading companies to enable the features in products that are pervasive throughout people’s lives” said GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield. “Our agreement with Ford is a key step forward in strengthening our cooperation and partnership with automakers to spur innovation bring new features to market faster and ensure long-term supply-demand balance.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjAvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9qYXktbGFzdC1kZWFkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jay Last One of the Rebels Who Founded Silicon Valley Dies at 92 (Published 2021),"Jay Last a physicist who helped create the silicon chips that power the world’s computers and who was among the eight entrepreneurs whose company laid the technical financial and cultural foundation for Silicon Valley died on Nov. 11 in Los Angeles. He was 92.

His death in a hospital was confirmed by his wife and only immediate survivor Debbie.

Dr. Last was finishing a Ph.D. in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956 when he was approached by William Shockley who would share a Nobel Prize that same year for the invention of the transistor the tiny electrical device that became the essential building block for the world’s computer chips. Dr. Shockley invited him to join a new effort to commercialize a silicon transistor at a lab near Palo Alto Calif. about 30 miles south of San Francisco.

Dr. Last was awed by Dr. Shockley’s intelligence and reputation but unsure about the job offer. Ultimately he agreed to join the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory because it sat in the Northern California valley where he had spent a summer harvesting fruit after hitchhiking there from his home in Pennsylvania steel country.

But he and seven of his collaborators at the lab clashed with Dr. Shockley who later became infamous for his theory that Black people were genetically inferior in intelligence to white people. They quickly left the lab to create their own transistor company. They later came to be called “the traitorous eight” and their company Fairchild Semiconductor is now seen as ground zero for what became known as Silicon Valley.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc3dhcmFqeWFtYWcuY29tL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvZmFicy1mYWJsZXNzLWFuZC1pbmRpYW4tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1pbmR1c3RyedIBW2h0dHBzOi8vc3dhcmFqeWFtYWcuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9jb21tZW50YXJ5L2ZhYnMtZmFibGVzcy1hbmQtaW5kaWFuLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItaW5kdXN0cnk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fabs Fabless and Indian Semiconductor Industry,"India has seen exponential growth in semiconductor design activity during the last two decades but zero presence in the semiconductor fabrication space. There have been at least two failed attempts at setting up a fab in the past as well. While one can understand the frustrations of fabless semiconductor companies in getting predictable or preferential treatment by fabs it is simply not reasonable to expect that the Indian govt can battle global semiconductor and device majors like Apple Nvidia Qualcomm Intel Samsung and Broadcom to get preferential treatment for Indian fabless start-ups. Industry has also seen fabs like TSMC cannibalizing the share of design pie by offering IP and design services to their clients. One can also easily see the great geographic divergence between locations of semiconductor design (US EU and India) and semiconductor production (Taiwan and Korea). It is certainly not a truism to suggest that semiconductor fabs will simply follow the fabless companies.

Most of the semiconductor professionals and enthusiasts in India are keenly following the policy commentary and outcomes from the host of Indian govt decisions taken under the head of SPECS and other incentive-based measures. While every actor – government investors entrepreneurs and engineers- wants to see India emerge as a vibrant location in all aspects of production and value addition in the semiconductors ecosystem - they also bring their own unique insights based on their own domain experience and knowledge. Such an environment is naturally expected to breed some disagreements requiring careful moderation and application of mind. We will try to address one such disagreement voiced in opposition to govt push for domestic semiconductor fabrication units from the Indian fabless start-up ecosystem in this article. A fabless semiconductor company translates the abstract system requirements coming from either the end customer or a standard into a very large number (in billions) of circuits. Those circuits are verified using sophisticated software tools for required performance on a chosen process supported by a fabrication company. Finalized design is then sent to the fabrication company as an image – which is etched on the Silicon substrate at the fab. The final Silicon (now called a chip) is then sent back the fabless semiconductor company for characterization and commercialization. During the last 2 decades India has seen an exponential growth in semiconductor design activity but zero presence in the semiconductor fabrication space. There have been at least two failed attempts at setting up a fab in the past as well. One must be deeply aware of this overarching reality and context to appreciate the steps taken by the Indian Govt to push for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Consequences of missing out completely from this crucial space has very obvious strategic and security implications as well.

A fabless semiconductor company Model

While most of the mainstream media has been focused on e-commerce and edutech start-ups for the last decade India has seen some encouraging activity in the space of fabless semiconductor start-ups in the same timeframe as well. Companies like Cosmic Circuits (acquired by Cadence) Saankhya Labs Aura Semiconductor Steradian Semiconductor and many others have built successful start-ups based on offering design services and building high-value IPs at times complete semiconductor products. A couple of comments by Parag Naik CEO of Saankhya labs have caught the attention of many readers and also require a response. Speaking to Ken he said:

“The chips we design cannot be made in a small foundry. Because of the lack of the ecosystem most of our fab vendors do not give us good pricing” “Our Korean partner had 50% lower pricing than us without a design”

Ken summarized his views with the following recommendation.

Speaking to Indian Express he said the following:

If I own the patent and the product I can manufacture anywhere. Setting up a factory is a no-brainer. The government and bureaucrats know only about land and power and depreciation around it. The big companies like Samsung Ericsson Nokia are nomadic companies. They keep moving to the next green pasture. Because you are giving them rebate they will come here. Tomorrow somebody else gives them the rebate they will move out from here. We will be left high and dry.

The motivation behind including the quotes by an individual CEO is not to single out the person but to substantively engage with the thoughts and assumptions embedded in them. Comparing semiconductor production to a mineral like crude oil is a non-starter. No amount of policy or human ingenuity can extract oil from a place that isn’t already blessed with it. Semiconductor fabs exist in Japan China Taiwan Korea Europe and USA. They exist in wet regions of heavy rainfall like Taiwan to dry regions of Arizona. The only common thread between crude oil and semiconductors is that of trade imbalance energy and national security; and unlike crude oil India isn’t destined by geography to live without domestic production of semiconductors! While the authors completely understand the frustrations of fabless semiconductor companies in getting predictable or preferential treatment by fabs it is simply not reasonable to expect that the Indian govt can battle global semiconductor and device majors like Apple Nvidia Qualcomm Intel Samsung and Broadcom to get preferential treatment for Indian fabless start-ups. Every major design house device and auto manufacturer is reeling under shortage of chips for more than a year now. If anything Indian govt can be expected to have more leverage on fabs if and when they are setup on Indian soil. It is an interesting thought to get the Indian govt to subsidize the wafer costs of Indian fabless companies. This is something to be examined on its own merits and govts strategic goals. There is no merit in presenting this as a trade-off against govt incentivising domestic semiconductor fabs. Symbiotic relationship between fabs and fabless industries can be seen from the blossoming of companies like MediaTek and design hubs like Hsinchu in Taiwan. Mr Naik’s comment noting the advantages available to fabless companies in Korea (due to proximity with fabs) underscores this symbiotic relationship and only makes the case for fabs in India stronger. Industry has also seen fabs like TSMC cannibalizing the share of design pie by offering IP and design services to their clients. One can also easily see the great geographic divergence between locations of semiconductor design (US EU and India) and semiconductor production (Taiwan and Korea). It is certainly not a truism to suggest that semiconductor fabs will simply follow the fabless companies. Authors are deeply aware of lack of availability of risk capital to Indian semiconductor start-ups – especially when compared to their e-commerce peers. There is an encouraging trend in the last few years with a few venture capitalists and PE funds taking interest in the deep tech spaces like semiconductors. For example one can see 2 semiconductor companies in the portfolio of Endiya here. Last few months have shown that Indian players are indeed focussed on moving up the value chain and are forced to look into areas of 5G telecom equipment EV and green energy supply chain etc. Authors also hope that some of the post-IPO exits from e-commerce companies will free up some more risk capital for fabless ventures in India. However unlike fabless companies starting a semiconductor fab requires an order of magnitude more capital and risk-taking appetite – and the Indian government must renew their efforts to see this through.

The lab whose work is concentrated on neuromorphic computing or brain-inspired computing has new research that introduces hardware improvements by harnessing a quality known as “randomness” or “stochasticity”. Their research now published in Nature Communications contradicts the perception of randomness as a quality that will negatively impact computation results and demonstrates the utilization of finely controlled stochastic features in semiconductor devices to improve performing optimization.

In the brain randomness plays an important role in human thought or computation. It is born from billions of neurons that spike in response to input stimuli and generate a lot of signals that may or may not be relevant. The decision-making process perhaps is the best-studied example of how our brain makes use of randomness. It allows the brain to take a detour from past experiences and explore a new solution when making a decision especially to a challenging and unpredictable situation.

“Neurons exhibit stochastic behavior which can help certain computational functions” said a USC PhD student Jiahui Ma and a lead author Xiaodong Yan (both equally contributed as first authors). The team wanted to emulate neurons as much as possible and designed a circuit to solve combinatorial optimization problems which are one of the most important tasks for computers to complete.

The thinking is that for computers to do this efficiently they need to behave more like the human brain (on super steroids) in terms of how they process stimuli and information as well as make decisions.

In much simpler terms we need computers to converge on the best solution among all possibilities. Says the researchers “The randomness introduced in the new device demonstrated in this work can prevent it from getting stuck at a not-so-viable solution and instead continue to search until it finds a close-to-optimal result.” This is particularly important for optimization problems says corresponding author Professor Wang “If one can dynamically tune the randomness features the machine for performing optimization can work more efficiently as we desire.”

The researchers achieve this dynamic “tuning” by creating a specialized device a hetero-memristor. Unlike transistors which are logic switches inside a regular computer chip the hetero-memristor combines memory and computation together. Memristors have been developed prior normally with two-terminal structure. The Viterbi team’s innovation is in adding a third electrical terminal and modulating its voltage to activate the neuron-like device and to dynamically tune the stochastic features in its output much like one heats up a pot of water and dynamically adjusts the temperature to control the activity of the water molecules hence enabling the so-called simulated “cooling”. This provides a level of control that earlier memristors do not have.

The researchers say “This method emulates the stochastic properties of neuron activity.” In fact neuron activity is perceived to be random but may follow a certain probability pattern. The hetero-memristors they developed introduce such probability-governed randomness into a neuromorphic computing circuit by the reconfigurable tuning of the device’s intrinsic stochastic property.

This is thus a more sophisticated building block for creating computers that can tackle sophisticated optimization problems which can potentially be more efficient. What’s more they can consume less power.

IoT security is where endpoint detection and response (EDR) and enterprise mobility management (EMM) meet the challenges of a rapidly expanding edge computing infrastructure. As the enterprise attack surface grows IoT is yet another attack vector organizations aren’t fully prepared to defend.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the smart consumer and business systems powering the homes factories and enterprise processes of tomorrow. By year-end total IoT device installations will surpass 35 billion and extend to 55 billion by 2025.

Enterprise organizations recognize this shift and need to invest in device management and endpoint security capabilities. In 2016 $91 million was spent on IoT endpoint security solutions. Five years later that number has skyrocketed to $631 million. With the growth of segments like industrial IoT (IIoT) Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and industrial control systems (ICS) IoT security will continue to be critical to business continuity vulnerability management and threat remediation.

This article looks at the top IoT security solutions current commercial features associated risks and considerations for organizations choosing an IoT vendor.

What Are IoT Security Solutions?

IoT security solutions are the software and embedded tools used to monitor edge devices proactively detect threats and facilitate remediation. As such current IoT security solutions are a mix of standalone and bundle plans that include existing tools like EDR encryption IAM EMM and more to protect connected devices and networks.

What Are IoT Devices?

IoT is the broad label given to all devices capable of communicating with each other often at short range with unique identities and few components outside its operational intent including security features. Because of this several organizations are building security into a new generation of IoT devices (embedded security) while other vendors offer agent-based software to monitor and protect IoT devices.

Examples of IoT devices include most consumer smart systems autonomous machinery and vehicles office appliances and a multitude of healthcare devices.

Considerations for Choosing an IoT Security Solution

How does the solution isolate IoT devices and access from critical segments?

What protocols and tools are available for secure transactions? (TLS encryption Auth0)

Are there embedded or built-in IoT security requirements to address exposure?

What policy controls can administrators configure for unmanaged devices or users?

Does the solution issue and manage secure credentials like PKI and code signatures?

Can solution operators identify categorize and provision new devices?

How does the solution establish trust between devices? (e.g. key injection or HSMs)

IoT Security Solution Features

Network scanning device identification and discovery of active connections

Identify users data devices locations and more to identify and assess risk categories

Threat intelligence informs the status of malware and available patches

Security gateways to isolate network segments between ports servers and IoT devices

Baseline responses to anomalous behavior for individuals or clusters of devices

Define and enforce policies across device and access types for hybrid infrastructures

Automated onboarding configuration and threat response policies for new IoT devices

Certificate issuance and management for granting secure credentials and access

Because securing IoT devices is a budding cybersecurity segment the above list is not all-encompassing and several vendors present unique approaches to addressing IoT security challenges.

IoT Device Risks and Vulnerabilities

Once isolated from other devices and an organization’s larger IT environment IoT devices like sensors doorbells and printers are now at risk of compromise. With proper segmentation organizations can avoid access to an IoT device turning into something more but that won’t stop threat actors from using the device and others like it in a botnet attack.

Other identified risks associated with IoT device management include:

Insufficient security or data protection capabilities for devices

Inability to add additional security software

Insecure interfaces easily accessible to a persistent threat

Poor password protection with default credentials staying put

Unreliable patch or update mechanism

Nonexistent or lacking inventory of IoT devices or monitoring IoT traffic

A gap in IoT security management skills for edge systems

Disparate management of IoT and OT systems creating data silos

IoT Security: Not Going Away

The proliferation of IoT devices means securing the next generation of IT environments will require IoT-specific security strategies and solutions. Organizations actively deploying IoT devices should be prudent about the security risks of insecure edge devices and proceed with caution.

Organizations need to visualize IoT assets under management profile their risk apply adequate protections and monitor IoT traffic for unknown threats. Like so much else in cybersecurity visibility informs action and strategy – making the upfront work of selecting an IoT security solution or assembly a strategy that much more valuable in avoiding unnecessary risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That includes things you want to buy as gifts. So if you haven’t started your holiday shopping there’s no more time to waste.

Credit cards may be the most common way to spend money online but threats like MageCart attacks make them risky to use when it comes to security. Tap or click here to see how 2000 online stores were compromised after a cyberattack.

There are several ways to pay online that are safer and easier than using your card. We’ll show you our favorite secure methods to pay so you can have peace of mind when you’re shopping this holiday season.

1. Shop Pay

If you’ve ever used Shopify then you already know about Shop Pay. The company’s built-in payment system protects your card when you buy with merchants that use Shopify. You’ll know a merchant accepts Shop Pay if they display its logo on their store or during checkout.

Shopify created the Shop app to put hundreds of thousands of independent merchants in one convenient app. If you buy using the Shop app your card information is already encrypted and protected — so you won’t have to worry about your data getting stolen.

The app also has another unique feature: split payments. When you check out with select Shop merchants you’ll get the option to split your total into four interest-free installments.

While checking out on your desktop you can securely save your shipping and payment information if you see the Shop Pay logo. Choose Shop Pay as your payment method and click Authorize purchase on the order review page. You’ll receive a six-digit verification code on your phone via text message. Enter the code to approve the transaction.

If you return to this store on the same device you won’t have to verify yourself again. All you’ll need to do is log in with your account.

It’s super popular

Over 3000 stores accept Shop Pay according to Knoji.com. Here are a few stores you’ll find this option at:

NPR Shop

Allbirds

Ring

Natural Life

Kith

Steve Madden

Beyond Yoga

Raycon

Kylie Cosmetics

Anker

Jonathan Adler

Minecraft

Loeffler Randall

Codeacademy

Blueland

Polaroid

Companies like these serve over 40 million buyers Shopify reports. It’s also a great way to keep your money safe! Set it up to sign out more quickly than ever before.

2. PayPal Venmo and Zelle: Perfect for purchases

You’ve probably heard of PayPal but not everyone knows what it does or how to use it. In a nutshell PayPal acts as a middleman between you and the merchant.

Through PayPal’s website you can connect your bank account credit or debit card and transfer money in just a couple clicks. Your card information is also kept private.

When you make a payment it goes through PayPal and then to the recipient. That way if you run into fraud you can file a dispute through PayPal to recover your money.

The PayPal website and app are encrypted and secure. It can also save you the trouble of entering your payment card number every time you check out.

Visit PayPal.com to create an account. Follow the set-up steps and you’re ready to check out with more than 22 million merchants across the web. Just look for a button that says Check out with PayPal like the ones above.

Here’s how it works

When you choose PayPal as your payment option you’ll be redirected to the site login page. Type your username and password to complete your order. Your payment will then be withdrawn from your PayPal account or linked bank or card. Easy right?

Of course you don’t have to connect your card or bank account to PayPal. You also have the option to add funds to your PayPal account by depositing cash at participating stores:

7-Eleven

Casey’s

CVS/Pharmacy

Dollar General

Family Dollar

GameStop

Kum & Go

Kwik Trip/Kwik Star

Office Depot

Rite Aid

Sheetz

Speedway

Walgreens

Walmart

Participation will depend on your region. Stores listed in bold are always participating.

Here’s how adding cash to your account works:

Bring your smartphone with the PayPal app installed to a participating store.

Select More from the home screen found on the bottom right.

from the home screen found on the bottom right. Select Add cash at a store .

. Choose the store you’re visiting. Then the app will generate a barcode (with a time limit to use it).

Present this code to the cashier so they can scan it then hand them the cash to add to your account.

Note: The daily deposit limit is $1500 and the monthly limit is $5000. There’s also a transaction limit of $20 to $50 depending on which store you go to.

Protect yourself

Though PayPal is safe it’s still a good idea to take some basic security steps if you decide to use it. Set up your account with two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access or phishing scams from cracking your login.

If PayPal isn’t accepted by a merchant you’re shopping with you might see options for Venmo and Zelle. These apps work the same way as PayPal: You link a bank account or card and add money that you can spend online or send to friends.

Both PayPal and Venmo are available as smartphone apps. If you bank with Chase Capital One US Bank or Wells Fargo Zelle is already included with your bank’s app. You can usually find it inside your app’s main menu near the Bill Pay feature. A standalone app is also available.

This is important!

If you decide to use Venmo note that the app makes your transactions public by default. It’s part of the app’s social media aspect but you don’t need it to spend money on Venmo. You can get rid of public transactions by tapping Settings > Privacy and choosing Private under Default Privacy Settings.

But unlike PayPal Venmo and Zelle are more focused on payments between people. You can easily use your Venmo or Zelle account to pay back a friend who loaned you money or cover your portion of a split bill.

Both are secure and easy to use but it’s essential to think of payments sent this way like cash. Once you send it there’s no way to get the money back. Always enter the recipient’s information perfectly before tapping send.

Tap or click here to find out more about peer-to-peer payment apps. Another great app to check out is Shop Pay. More on that later.

3. Prepaid cards are a great choice

As convenient as PayPal is not every website accepts it. If an online shop only takes credit or debit cards pick up a prepaid Visa card from your local grocery store gas station or drugstore. You can find them near the checkout area.

Using a prepaid card and checking out as a guest will hide your identity and keep your bank account out of reach. The cards are also preloaded so you’ll only be able to spend the amount you put on the card. You can reload the card through the Visa app via direct deposit from your bank or in stores. Find a retail location here.

If you know exactly where you want to buy from choosing branded gift cards is just as safe and discreet. They also make easy last-minute gifts this time of year.

4. Buy from Bezos

Amazon gives you plenty of payment options beyond your credit and debit card. It accepts PayPal for starters as well as Visa and Amazon gift cards.

If you prefer to use cash over plastic Amazon still has you covered. Amazon Cash works just like PayPal’s cash option. All you have to do is visit a partner store and load your account. Your Amazon cash balance counts as part of your gift card balance.

This saves you from having to share bank or card information with Amazon. And to be fair it already has enough of your data. Tap or for five privacy settings you should change on your Amazon account.

There are two ways to add cash to your Amazon account: by bar code or phone number.

To load money using a bar code:

Go to one of Amazon’s partner stores and open the Amazon app.

In the search bar type Amazon Cash .

. Scroll down and tap Get your barcode .

. Show the cashier the bar code. After he or she scans it you can add $5 to $500 to your account.

Another method is to pay with your phone number. Just make sure it’s the same number associated with your Amazon account. Give the cashier your phone number and they can deposit cash to your account — no bank required!

Some online retailers also offer Amazon Pay Amazon’s payment processing system for merchants. When you check out with Amazon Pay you can automatically port payment and shipping information from your Amazon account without having to type it in again. If you see the logo above you can check out with Amazon Pay.

To protect your data Amazon handles all the payment processing on its end. The merchant never receives your card number only your name email address and shipping address.

Keep in mind: Amazon won’t let you use your gift card balance to make purchases through Amazon Pay. The same goes for Amazon Cash which is included in your gift card balance.

5. Use mobile payments when you’re shopping on your phone

Smartphone manufacturers have also created payment systems that are highly secure to use online. Apple Pay Google Pay and Samsung Pay will come with your phone right out of the box and all you need to start using it is to scan your credit or debit card.

You can tell if the place you’re shopping accepts mobile payments by checking for the logos below.

Source: Apple Google Samsung

When you’re ready to check out choose the option above that comes with your smartphone. iPhones come with Apple Pay Androids can use Google Pay and Samsung Galaxy devices use Samsung Pay.

You’ll be asked to unlock your phone by using Face ID or entering your passcode during checkout. The charge will be processed using the debit or credit card you entered into your digital wallet.

Tap or click here to set up mobile payments with Apple Pay Google Pay and Samsung Pay.

You can also use mobile payments when you’re shopping in person. Just select the payment method on your device and scan it with the card reader instead of swiping a physical card or using cash. There’s no need to touch anything besides your phone when done correctly making it a safer way to pay during a pandemic.

Now that you’ve found the safest ways to pay your next task is to protect your bank account from hackers and cybercriminals. Even if you’re protecting your card it never hurts to double down on security for the sake of your money.

Here's What to Do,"With Venmo you can send and receive money facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges with ease. Funds appear in the recipient's Venmo balance instantly. However transferring money to a bank account takes one to three business days. If you need to add cash to Venmo right away use Instant Transfer to shift your available balance to a Visa or Mastercard debit card in 30 minutes or less. There are a number of reasons why Venmo Instant Transfer might not work as expected.

How Do I Contact Venmo?

If your money doesn't arrive on time or if you experience another problem Venmo offers the following contact methods and typically responds in a timely fashion.

Chat with a support specialist in the Venmo mobile app. Select Menu > Get Help > Contact Us > Chat with Us .

> > > . Call Venmo customer support at 855-812-4430. Their hours are 10:00 a.m. through 6:00 p.m. EST Monday through Friday. They are closed on major holidays.

Fill out the Venmo Support team web form.

Before you spend time calling do some troubleshooting to make sure there's nothing off on your side of the works.

Is My Debit Card Eligible for Instant Transfer?

All United States-based Visa and Mastercard debit cards that take part in the Visa Fast Funds service or the Mastercard Send platform can be used with Venmo Instant Transfer. However most cardholders don't know whether or not the bank associated with their card participates in the program.

The easiest way to determine if a debit card qualifies for Instant Transfer is to add it to your Venmo account. To set up a debit card in the app go to the main menu select Settings then choose Payment Methods.

Once the card has been added to your Venmo account take the steps outlined below to initiate an Instant Transfer. If your card is eligible you can select it from the list provided. If it isn't the card shows in your list but is greyed out and inaccessible for this purpose.

Funds from a Venmo Instant Transfer are sent to the bank account linked to your eligible debit card. Verify the account balance to determine whether or not the transfer was completed successfully before using your debit card for a purchase or withdrawal.

Transfer Money to Your Bank With Venmo

Take the following steps from the Venmo app to initiate an Instant Transfer and see if your card is eligible.

Tap the Menu button represented by the three horizontal lines located in the upper-right corner of the screen. When the drop-down menu appears your Venmo balance displays below your name. Select the Transfer Balance link which is found to the right of your balance. Enter the amount you want to transfer and tap on the drop-down menu located toward the bottom of the screen. A list of available cards and bank accounts displays. Those that are eligible for Instant Transfer appear in the Instant section.

How Much Does It Cost?

Bank transfers from your Venmo balance can be initiated free of charge meaning that all the money transfers to your checking or savings account. However a 1% fee is incurred each time you use the Instant Transfer feature with a minimum of $0.25 and a maximum of $10 taken from the transferred funds. For example if you instantly transfer $50 to your bank account a $0.50 (1%) fee is incurred and only $49.50 is transferred.

Are Funds Always Available Within 30 Minutes?

The majority of Instant Transfer requests are completed in under a half-hour. There are rare occasions where the funds may be delayed or blocked for a variety of reasons. These reasons include potential fraud legal roadblocks and past issues with your account or the sender's account.

When transferred funds originate from a compromised account or card your Instant Transfer request may be delayed and reviewed closer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2Vsb24tbXVzay1vbmNlLXRvdGFsZWQtYS1tY2xhcmVuLWYxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk Once Totaled A McLaren F1,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2Vsb24tbXVzay1vbmNlLXRvdGFsZWQtYS1tY2xhcmVuLWYxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zb2NpYWwvdHdpdHRlci1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLWl0cy10aXBwaW5nLWZlYXR1cmUtZm9yLWFuZHJvaWQtaGVyZXMtaG93LWl0LXdvcmtzLTc2MzI3Mzcv0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NvY2lhbC90d2l0dGVyLWludHJvZHVjZXMtaXRzLXRpcHBpbmctZmVhdHVyZS1mb3ItYW5kcm9pZC1oZXJlcy1ob3ctaXQtd29ya3MtNzYzMjczNy9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twitter introduces its Tipping feature for Android: Here’s how it works,"Twitter is introducing its tipping feature on Android devices that will allow users to send money to the content creators of their choice.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Art LaFleur a veteran character actor with notable roles in ""The Sandlot"" and ""Field of Dreams"" has died at age 78 after a 10-year battle with Parkinson's disease.

His wife Shelley announced his death on Facebook: ""He was a generous and selfless man which carried over to his acting but more importantly it was who he was for his family and friends"" she wrote.

""I was so very lucky to have had a 43 year relationship with a man who cherished me and who I adored. Art was larger than life and meant the world to us.""

Over a four-decade career LaFleur appeared in dozens of films and television shows.

Among his most memorable roles was playing the spirit of Babe Ruth in the 1993 classic ""The Sandlot."" The Yankee legend appears to Benny in a dream sequence advising him to get his signed baseball back from the neighbor's yard guarded by a dog known as ""The Beast.""

LaFleur also played another baseball player Chick Gandil in ""Field of Dreams"" and was a Yankees coach in the 1992 film ""Mr. Baseball."" And he was the Tooth Fairy in the second and third installments of the ""Santa Clause"" franchise.

LaFleur was also recognizable from famous Pepsi ads that aired during two Super Bowls 15 years apart: In 1995 he played a Pepsi truck driver who generously shared his soda with a Coke driver before the two end up in a fistfight smashing through the diner window. He then appeared in a reprise to that ad in 2010 as the diner cook who takes the order of the two soda-company drivers who similarly end up in a fight after an initial gesture of goodwill.

This charging station layout and stall design are different from the Superchargers as these are specifically designed for Tesla’s class-8 electric semi-trucks.

The photos of the Tesla Semi while charging at the Megacharger were taken by one of the earliest Model Y owners who got his vehicle delivered during the difficult COVID-19 peak times last year.

The layout of the Megacharger station is designed to accommodate the large Tesla Semi truck even when it has the trailer attached so the truck can turn park and leave the station easily.

The term Megacharger evolved alongside the launch of the electric Tesla Semi. Due to the ultra-large battery pack of the Tesla Semi it needed a higher level of electric power to charge compared to a Tesla car. In the early days of Tesla Semi testing across North America the automaker used to charge the Tesla Semi prototypes by joining 4-5 Supercharger stall connectors to an adapter and then connecting it to the Megahcarging port of the Semi.

In the company’s 2020 Impact Report Tesla revealed that it is developing a network of such Megacharger stations at trucking stops across North America and Europe.

Tesla’s Gigafactory Nevada was the first Gigafactory that Tesla originally built for cell manufacturing. Tesla has been working on the battery and powertrain of its Semi Truck at Giga Nevada since last year as Elon Musk revealed in an email that it is time to bring Tesla Semi to volume production.

However there have not been many updates of the Tesla Semi production progress since then. But the images of the first Megcharger at Giga Nevada say that Tesla is constantly working on this project.

Since the Tesla Semi battery packs will be using the new 4680 cell form factor. So the automaker must scale the new battery cell production at Giga Nevada which might have been achieved to get the Semi Truck program rolling.

Just recently PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said that Tesla will be delivering the first batch of their Tesla Semi order in Q4 2021 (video interview below). This statement by the PepsiCo CEO suggests that the Tesla Semi production program is actually accelerating. The Tesla Semi order tracking page that I have maintained for a few years now shows that PepsiCo had ordered 100 Tesla Semis in December 2017.

Tesla enthusiast and social media influencer Sawyer Merrit also obtained the following aerial footage of Giga Nevada earlier this month that shows a lot of activity at the factory.

The first COVID-19 vaccine became available in late 2020 and since then more than two-thirds of the total U.S. population has been fully vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends booster doses for everyone 5 and older at the appropriate time. The CDC recommends a second booster for people age 50 and older and immunocompromised people.

What you need to know about booster doses

Who is eligible for a booster dose?

The CDC recommends people as young as 5 should get a first booster shot.

If you got the Pfizer vaccine you should get your booster five months after completing your primary vaccine series.

If you got the Moderna vaccine a booster is recommended at this time only for people 18 and older. It is recommended five months after completing your vaccine series.

If you got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine you should get your booster at least two months after your first dose.

The CDC recommends people over 50 and people who are immunocompromised should get a second booster shot.

For Pfizer Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccine you should get your second booster at least four months after the first.

Why are booster doses recommended?

Although the COVID-19 vaccines remain effective at reducing risk of severe disease hospitalization and death the CDC has found that their protection against mild to moderate disease decreases over time. Studies have shown that a booster shot not only lengthens immunity but helps to broaden and strengthen your immune response even against variants such as omicron. Learn more about the omicron variant.

PolitiFact.com

Viral Tweet says: ""Bill Gates just admitted that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines don’t work well.""

PolitiFact's Ruling: False

Here's why: A clip of Bill Gates is being taken out of context online with claims that it shows the billionaire openly acknowledging that the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective.

""Bill Gates just admitted that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines don’t work well"" reads one Twitter post that shared the 27-second clip.

""For those who have not seen it this is an explicit acknowledgement that the mRNA and rAdV vaccines for COVID are not working well"" another said.

This distorts Gates’ words and the clip only shows a snippet of a longer conversation he had Nov. 5 with Jeremy Hunt Britain’s former health secretary. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation called the claim false.

The interview was hosted by a British think tank called Policy Exchange and covered topics such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The part that’s highlighted in the tweets comes toward the end when Hunt asked Gates about pandemic preparedness.

Around the video’s 27-minute mark Gates said:

""It was 2015 that I gave the TED talk and wrote a number of papers titled ‘we’re not ready for the next pandemic’ and sadly that was a better forecast of what would happen than anyone would have wished for. The economic damage the deaths it’s been completely horrific.

""And I would expect that will lead the R&D (research and development) budgets to be focused on things we didn’t have today. We didn’t have vaccines that block transmission. We got vaccines that help you with your health but they only slightly reduce the transmission. We need a new way of doing the vaccines.""

COVID-19 vaccines do not entirely block transmission of the virus. But they continue to protect against severe disease. And studies show that fully vaccinated people are less likely to contract and spread the virus than unvaccinated people.

Still Gates never said that any of the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective or ""don’t work."" Rather he suggests that resources need to be allocated to help scientists develop new types of vaccines that halt transmission while also offering protection from diseases — something that researchers have already started to look into.

These posts are False.

Minister of Health Dr. Frank Anthony said Pfizer has signed an agreement with the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) patent production office allowing countries to use its technology to manufacture the pill.

“We don’t have manufacturing capacity in the public sector for pharmaceuticals but here in Guyana there are private companies that would have the manufacturing capabilities so if those companies work with the WHO patent office and are able to bring that particular medicine to Guyana it is something that we will want to procure” he said on Thursday.

However he noted that even if the drug is not produced locally there is a high likelihood that the cost will be affordable.

“If that does not happen then certainly with the number of countries now that are going to be producing this medication that we are certain that we will be able to get the medicine at an affordable price once production has started so it is something that we are looking at” the Health Minister said.

He noted that the efficacy of the medication was reviewed and it seemed to be working “quite well.”

“Therefore as soon as it’s made available and it’s licensed then that’s something that we would want to look at and it’s certainly a medication that we would want to add to the meds that we already have been using to treat COVID-19” Dr Anthony said.

He said the process is not complete and still has to go through the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “so they have to present the data it has to be reviewed and once it is reviewed and they have accepted it then they will give it emergency use authorization so that has not been done as yet.”

“I know they have promised to submit the data soon so once that process is completed I guess we will have better information being available.”

Earlier this week Pfizer Inc announced that it is seeking U.S. authorization of its experimental antiviral COVID-19 pill that could cut the chance of hospitalization and death by 89 percent.

The New York Times reported that under the agreement Pfizer will grant a royalty-free license for the pill to the Medicines Patent Pool a non-profit backed by the United Nations in a deal that will allow manufacturers to take out a sublicence. They will receive Pfizer’s formula for the drug and be able to sell it for use in 95 developing countries.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMTIwNTMzLW5iYS10cmFkZS1ydW1vcnMtY2otbWNjb2xsdW0tbm90LXVudG91Y2hhYmxlLWluLXRhbGtzLXBlbGljYW5zLXBnLXNlZW4tYXMtbGVhZGVy0gGNAWh0dHBzOi8vc3luZGljYXRpb24uYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FtcC8xMDEyMDUzMy1uYmEtdHJhZGUtcnVtb3JzLWNqLW1jY29sbHVtLW5vdC11bnRvdWNoYWJsZS1pbi10YWxrcy1wZWxpY2Fucy1wZy1zZWVuLWFzLWxlYWRlci5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA Trade Rumors: CJ McCollum 'Not Untouchable' in Talks; Pelicans PG Seen as Leader,"Jeff Haynes/NBAE via Getty Images

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times. They were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder this year with Williamson unavailable due to a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-in tournament loss to the Los Angeles Lakers."
PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzE5NzE4NDEvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conflicting reports about smoke-free alternatives are main hurdle in quitting cigarettes says survey,"RIYADH: Confusing information about smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes prevents a large number of smokers from kicking the butt according to the findings of a global survey.

The survey of nearly 30000 adults in 26 countries including Saudi Arabia and the UAE found that too many adult smokers remain unaware that alternatives to cigarettes exist are unable to access them or are confused by conflicting information that prevents them from making an informed choice.

According to the World Health Organization there are more than 1 billion smokers in the world today and this number is expected to stay steady until 2025.

The study which was commissioned by Philip Morris International was conducted by research firm Povaddo to measure the public’s awareness of smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes.

The international survey showed that despite the available science and research backing up smoke-free alternatives there was public confusion surrounding these products such as heated tobacco products or e-cigarettes.

Thirty-three percent of the respondents cited a lack of information about how these products differ from cigarettes and 35 percent said they were unsure about the science behind these new products.

The survey found that 32 percent of smokers have easier access to cigarettes and so don’t switch to alternatives.

Two thirds of adult smokers in the Kingdom when surveyed on why they have not considered switching to smoke-free products 62 percent said the lack of information about how these products differ from cigarettes 41 percent cited uncertainty about the science while 56 percent said having easier access to cigarettes played a part in their consideration.

The survey revealed 97 percent of legal age smokers in the Kingdom surveyed who have switched to a smoke-free product and stopped smoking confirmed that having accurate information about how these products differ from cigarettes was an important factor in their decision.

In addition 73 percent of current Saudi-based adult smokers said they would be more likely to switch to smoke-free products if they had clarity on how these products differ from cigarettes and the science behind them. Globally of the adult smokers surveyed this figure stood at 63 percent.

“The findings of the survey show there is confusion about smoke-free products. For those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes having access to evidence-based information about smoke-free products is critical” said Tarkan Demirbas area vice-president for the Middle East at Philip Morris International.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wZXRlci1zY2hpZmYtanVzdC13YXJuZWQtc3Bpa2luZy0xNDAwMDA0NjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Schiff warns inflation will help 'push the economy into recession' — 3 ways to protect yourself like him,"Peter Schiff warns inflation will help 'push the economy into recession' — 3 ways to protect yourself like him

Raging inflation could do more than just erode the purchasing power of the dollar.

According to Peter Schiff CEO of equity fund Euro Pacific Capital who’s famous for publicly predicting the 2008 housing crisis spiking price levels will help “push the economy into recession.”

“A strong economy doesn't produce inflation” Fox Business reported earlier this month. “It actually produces the reverse because a strong economy means that your economy is productive you're producing more goods and services and you're growing the supply.”

The good news? Schiff also knows a thing or two about hedging against inflation. In fact we can clearly see that theme in Euro Pacific's latest 13F filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.

So here’s a look at three ways Schiff’s investment firm is preparing for a downturn — one of them might be worth purchasing with some of your extra nickels and dimes.

Gold miners

Schiff has long been a fan of the yellow metal.

“The problem with the dollar is it has no intrinsic value” he once said. “Gold will store its value and you'll always be able to buy more food with your gold.""

As always he’s putting his money where his mouth is.

As of Sept. 30 Euro Pacific held 519095 shares of Newmont and 1.528 million shares of Barrick Gold.

In fact the two gold mining giants were the firm’s top two holdings representing 7.4% and 7.3% of its portfolio respectively.

In Q3 Newmont produced 1.45 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1120 per ounce — the current price of gold sits above $1800. Meanwhile Barrick Gold produced 1.09 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1034 per ounce.

Gold can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and its status as a safe haven means demand typically increases during times of uncertainty.

If gold prices go up miners like Newmont and Barrick will likely enjoy bigger profits.

These days you can build your own recession-proof portfolio just by using your own digital nickels and dimes.

Recession-proof income stocks

Dividend stocks offer investors a great way to earn a passive income stream but some can also be used as a hedge against inflation — and even recessions.

Case in point: The third-largest holding at Euro Pacific is cigarette giant British American Tobacco accounting for 4.5% of the portfolio.

The maker of Kent and Dunhill cigarettes pays quarterly dividends of 75 cents per share giving the stock an attractive annual yield of 8.6%.

Schiff’s fund also owns over 160000 shares of Philip Morris International another tobacco king with a dividend yield of 5.4%. The Marlboro cigarette producer is Euro Pacific’s fourth-largest holding with a portfolio weighting of 4%.

Story continues

The demand for cigarettes is highly inelastic meaning large price changes only induce small changes in demand — and that demand is largely immune to economic shocks.

If you’re comfortable with investing in so-called sin stocks British American and Philip Morris might be worth researching further.

Agriculture

When it comes to playing defence there’s one recession-proof sector that shouldn’t be overlooked: agriculture.

It’s simple. Whatever happens people still need to eat.

Schiff doesn’t talk about agriculture as much as precious metals but the fifth-largest holding of Euro Pacific is fertilizer producer Nutrien.

As one of the world’s largest providers of crop inputs and services Nutrien is positioned solidly even if the economy enters a major downturn. Its shares are already up about 39% in 2021.

Another way to play the agricultural boom is to invest in U.S. farmland.

Farmland could be an effective hedge because it’s intrinsically valuable and has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market.

The NCREIF Farmland Total Return Index has increased more than five times over the past 15 years 10 times over the past 20 years and 20 times over the past 30 years.

The best part? You don’t need to get your hands dirty to get a piece of the action.

New platforms allow you to invest in U.S. farmland by taking a stake in the farm of your choice.

You’ll earn cash income from the leasing fees and crop sales. And of course you’ll benefit from any long-term appreciation on top of that.

A jury found Donald Ray Mouse Jr. 20 guilty Friday of aggravated robbery possession of firearm by certain persons theft of property and two counts of aggravated assault. The panel found him not guilty of another count of aggravated assault.

The panel recommended he serve 15 years for the robbery charge 12 years and six months for the firearm charges and six years each for the aggravated assault counts. They recommended that the sentences be served consecutively. Jurors recommended Mouse serve one year in jail for the misdemeanor theft conviction.

Benton County Circuit Judge Brad Karren followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced Mouse to 39 years and six months in the Arkansas Department of Corrections.

Mouse was arrested Sept. 14 2020.

He was accused of the armed robbery of Phillips 66 at the intersection of Cheri Whitlock Drive and North Mount Olive Street in Siloam Springs according to court documents. He was accused of stealing $200 in cash and $100 worth of cigarettes according to court documents.

Mouse shot the glass out of the front door of the gas station according to court documents. Video surveillance from the store shows the robber running east behind the gas station toward Misti Court according to court documents.

Police identified Mouse as the person who robbed the store according to court documents.

Stacey Hill who was working at the store at the time of the robbery told jurors she no longer worked at the business and it is even hard for her to go into a convenience store.

""I was never afraid of anything in my life and now I'm afraid of everything"" she said.

Lt. Chase Fine a detective with the Siloam Springs Police Department testified police had connected Mouse with attacking and robbing a homeless man near the Siloam Springs Public Library and also a commercial burglary in the city. The incidents were also in September 2020 he said.

Chantel Mouse testified during the sentencing proceedings and described her brother as a hard worker and good person. She said her brother had a history of drug abuse.

""He's a lost boy with a big heart"" Billy Jo Gandert told jurors about her son.

She said her son has a tough life with both of his parents being drug addicts. She also testified he had a history of using methamphetamine and pills.

Sam Hall one of Mouse's attorney urged jurors not to sentence Mouse to life imprisonment. He cited his client's rough upbringing and history of drug use.

Brynna Barnica deputy prosecutor asked jurors to consider a life sentence.

""What parole means is that he will be out on your streets"" she said.

Barnica said Mouse was given a chance when he was placed on probation for burglary in Oklahoma.

The case does not end the criminal issues for Mouse. He's currently charged with robbery and battery in connection with the incident near the library. He's also charged with commercial burglary.

Mouse also is charged with commercial burglary theft of property three counts of breaking or entering criminal mischief possession of a controlled substance.

The attorneys discussed before the trial that Mouse is a suspect in another armed robbery that happened in the city.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2NoZXN0ZXJ0b24tcG9saWNlLXBvcnRlci1jaGFzZS1pbmRpYW5hLW5ld3MvMTEyNTkxOTEv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3Y2hpY2Fnby5jb20vYW1wL2NoZXN0ZXJ0b24tcG9saWNlLXBvcnRlci1jaGFzZS1pbmRpYW5hLW5ld3MvMTEyNTkxOTEv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chesterton Indiana police chase ends in crash; Porter officer injured and suspect in custody,"Chesterton police chase ends in crash; Porter officer injured and suspect in custody

CHESTERTON Ind. (WLS) -- Police in Chesterton have found the man who officials said took off after a chase and crash involving a police vehicle Saturday night.

Indiana State Police said in a news release early Sunday that a kidnapping victim was reported about 7 p.m. Saturday traveling east on Interstate 94 from the Illinois state line.

The caller's daughter was being held against her will and the suspect was armed with a handgun police said.

Just before 7:15 p.m. troopers located the suspect vehicle on I-94 near Burns Harbor and tried to make a traffic stop. The car initially pulled over but then sped away.

Police were able to see there were several people in the car including someone who appeared female and a chase began.

It continued east on I-94 and exited at S.R. 49 before traveling south.

The driver turned right on 1050 N. north on Calumet Avenue and east on 1100 N. When the driver approached S.R. 49 he turned left driving north in the southbound lanes police said.

Three Porter police officers were driving south in the southbound lanes with their emergency lights activated when they saw the car driving directly toward them at a high rate of speed officials said.

Two of the police cars were able to avoid the suspect vehicle. The third police car a 2021 Dodge Durango was struck head-on by the fleeing vehicle. This impact caused the police car to rotate and come to a rest facing north. The suspect vehicle came to a rest in the west ditch.

Two people immediately exited the vehicle and fled west toward Calumet Avenue.

During that foot chase one of the suspects was tased and taken into custody at a Phillips 66 gas station. The second suspect who was reported to be male wearing all black clothing remained at large.

A handgun stolen from Michigan was recovered during the investigation police said.

There were also three other occupants in the suspect vehicle that did not run away. One of those who is female was transported to Northwest Health-Porter with non-life threatening injuries police said. The suspect that was apprehended was transported to Franciscan Health in Crown Point for treatment of non-life threatening injuries.

The injured officer Cpl. Scott Cornelison is a 16-year veteran of the Porter Police Department. He was transported to Northwest Health-Porter with serious non-life threatening injuries.

Indiana officials said the Chesterton Police Department received a call of a suspicious male suspect asking to use a phone at the Phillips 66 gas station on Calumet Sunday morning.

Officers responded and located the individual who ran from police but was chased down and taken into custody.

The suspect Samuel A. Kuhl 29 from Kalamazoo Michigan is wanted on two separate extradition warrants in Kalamazoo for unlawful possession of a weapon as a felon charges.

He is currently being held at the Porter County Jail. Charges are pending in connection with the chase and crash police said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL2JpbGxpbmdzZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9ub3J0aHdlc3Rlcm4tZ2FzLXBsYW50LXByb3Bvc2FsLXN0YWxscy1vdmVyLWNpdHlzLW9iamVjdGlvbnMvYXJ0aWNsZV80NDJjNjRmMC1lOTNmLTU1YmYtYjc2ZC05ODVkMzExYTI5OWIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NorthWestern gas plant proposal stalls over city's objections,"NorthWestern Energy’s plans to build a gas-fired power plant have stalled in Laurel where neighbors say the generator will ruin their quality of life.

Last week the Laurel City Council again delayed votes critical to the plant’s development and formed a fact-finding commission to square the utility’s statements with neighborhood concerns about noise and pollution.

“We represent the citizens. The citizens have continued to come into this chamber and speak against this plant” said Heidi Sparks a City Council member explaining that after doing her own research if she had to vote today she would vote no.

NorthWestern which announced its intention to build the gas plant eight months ago still needs several things from the City of Laurel including a zoning change and an easement to bore a natural gas pipeline beneath Riverside Park which offers the community its best public access to the Yellowstone River.

City staff have warned the council not to put the cart before the horse by granting NorthWestern the needed changes without first annexing the property to assure the power plant’s property taxes estimated at $10 million a year mostly flow to Laurel.

NorthWestern which did not respond to an interview request for this article assures Laurel there will be time for annexation later.

Then there is the issue of power plant noise raised by neighbors.

“Mayor (Emelie) Eaton can you help me out with this?” said Aaron Felder as he produced a decibel meter and a boom box to illustrate during a meeting just how loud 65 decibels of noise are.

A woman in the front row used her fingers to plug her ears as Felder pumped up the jams of what sounded like a large locomotive or factory engine.

“That’s holding steady at 61” Eaton said as Felder’s voice faded beneath the groan of trundling steel.

“So it’s a constant noise 24/7” Felder said after turning off the sound. And when the sound hits the water it goes even further.”

Felder and his wife Kasey live on the opposite side the Yellowstone River from the power plant site. They can see the tallest pieces of the power plant substation rising above the riverbank treetops. The potential of 18 stacks 77 feet tall in the same location concerns them and their neighbors.

“These people live very close to those 18 stacks concentrated in one area one breeze in the wrong direction can lay that pollution right on top of them. They’re that close” Steve Krum told the council.

When neighbors on the south side of the river heard the utility describe the power plant’s noise as minimal not unlike a vacuum cleaner they thought they better check it out.

Steve Krum looked up the decibels reported by Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality which permitted the gas plant earlier this year. DEQ reported the noise to be 65 decibels. The city planning committee had been told the noise from the plant would travel west toward the CHS refinery but the DEQ application indicated the noise would travel in every direction for 200 yards too close for the neighbors on the opposite side of the Yellowstone.

The folks living on the south side of the river tend to be blue collar. Aaron Felder is a crane operator who works at the region’s oil refineries. Krum is a retired refinery worker.

Silence and distance define the neighborhoods on the Yellowstone’s south banks. Every home is a five-minute walk down a gravel road from the next. The gardens are large and the wildlife is ample. This time of year you see bald eagles nesting in the trees along the river. At night you can hear owls.

NorthWestern has conveyed the importance of the gas plant telling the City Council if it doesn't approve the easement and zoning Montanans’ utility bills will skyrocket.

“If we don’t do this we end up on the open market buying power at $500 to $600 per megawatt hour rather than generating it ourselves at $30 to $40 a megawatt hour. And I don’t think our customers would appreciate that. It would violate our mission to provide safe reliable 24-7 power” said Roy Ishkanian manager of lands and permitting for NorthWestern Energy.

The north side of the Yellowstone River where the utility intends to build its power plant is home to the Laurel sewer plant NorthWestern’s substation and is several hundred yards east of the CHS refinery. The location is right for a gas plant Ishkanian said. NorthWestern intends to use the power plant to offset periods when production from renewable energy sources is down.

The new power plant is a reciprocating internal combustion engine or RICE plant. Easily ramped up or down RICE plants have become a popular tool for balancing intermittent generating resources like wind and solar farms. For perspective the RICE plant’s 175-megawatt capacity would be about 78% of the nameplate capacity of NorthWestern’s 30% share of Colstrip Power Plant Unit 4.

The “or else” scenario posed by Ishkanian was quickly rebutted by Jennifer Harbine an attorney for Earth Justice who clarified that it’s the Montana Public Service Commission not the Laurel City Council that determines what NorthWestern’s customers will pay for electricity.

The challenges faced by the gas plant aren’t limited to the City Council. Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality is being sued for its permitting of the power plant. The Montana Environmental Information Center and Sierra Club say DEQ ignored the power plant’s contribution to local air and water pollution.

The area where the power plant would be located has already been dinged by the EPA for excessive sulfur dioxide levels mainly emanating from a CHS oil refinery near the gas-fired power plant site. Carbon dioxide from the gas-fired plant some 769706 tons a year is a climate change contributor. Harbine is representing the plaintiffs who argue the DEQ ignored the Montana Environmental Policy Act which requires a comprehensive treatment of environmental risks.

Time has also become a challenge for building the plant according to NorthWestern. The utility had initially attempted to get preapproval to bill customers $283.8 million for the power plant. That months-long process before the Montana Public Service Commission was halted abruptly in September because NorthWestern explained it needed to “accelerate the commercial operation date of Laurel Generating Station” as the power plant is known. Seeking preapproval could have taken until early March 2022.

At the time NorthWestern was abandoning preapproval in Montana it was also discontinuing plans for a $60 million gas-fired power plant in Aberdeen South Dakota again because of significant increases in construction costs related to supply chain problems.

Sunday will mark two months since NorthWestern announced it was expediting construction. The building site shows few signs of activity.

CHESTERTON Ind. — Two men are facing a combined total of 12 charges for a northwest Indiana police chase that ended in a head-on crash seriously injuring an officer on Saturday night.

Indiana State Police received a call around 7 p.m. from someone who said their daughter was being held against her will in a vehicle. The caller said the suspect had a handgun and was traveling eastbound on Interstate 94 from the Illinois state line.

Police found the suspect's car and tried to pull it over. The driver initially stopped allowing troopers to see there were several people in the car one of which appeared to be a woman according to Indiana State Police. Then the driver sped away.

On Monday Indiana State Police said detectives had later determined no one in the car had been kidnapped.

""However troopers believed that criminal activity was afoot at the time of the traffic stop due to the information given to them at that time"" ISP said in a news release.

During the police chase the suspect turned his car around and going the wrong way on the road drove at three police cars that were headed his way. The driver hit an officer's car head on.

The officer a 16-year veteran of the Porter Police Department was taken to a local hospital with serious non-life-threatening injuries.

After the crash two men got out of the car and ran away from the police.

The second suspect escaped kickstarting a manhunt near Chesterton.

At around 9:30 p.m. the Chesterton Police Department told residents to stay inside and lock their doors while officers searched for the suspect described as a white man dressed in dark clothes.

Multiple northwest Indiana police agencies and the Lake County Aviation Unit searched for the man through the night.

On Sunday morning officers went to a Phillips 66 gas station where they received a tip that a suspicious man was asking to use a phone.

Officers arrived and arrested the suspect identified as Samuel Kuhl 29 of Kalamazoo. Kuhl was wanted on two warrants for weapons possession by a felon charges. He was arrested and taken to the Porter County Jail.

While investigating ISP said a handgun was recovered. It was later determined to have been a stolen gun from Kalamazoo.

Prosecutors filed a combined total of 12 charges against Kuhl and Atlas on Monday.

Kuhl has been charged with felony unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon and the misdemeanors of carrying a handgun without a license two counts of resisting law enforcement and false informing."

A reality-check while nurturing Olympic-sized ambitions may keep the Gujarat government rooted in perspective. Amid talks of engaging with the International Olympic Committee for the candidature of Ahmedabad in hosting the Games in 2036 it turns out the sporting facilities we have in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar are woefully deficient.

A survey of 22 potential facilities carried out by a private agency in the twin cities reveals that these do not have the proper infrastructure required to host the Games. And this despite Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority spending nearly Rs 100 crore for the same sources told Mirror.

In the past decade words like international standard swimming pool or sports complex have been used a lot by the AMC while announcing the projects. Whenever a swimming pool or a sports complex is constructed the AMC claims that it is of ‘Olympic standard’. However when an infrastructure assessment was carried out in the existing facilities the claim turned out to be a damp squib sources told Mirror.

Sporting facilities in city

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

SVT Robotics has raised $25 million in Series A funding. SVT’s SOFTBOT platform is designed to enable rapid integration and deployment of industrial robotics. SVT’s funding came from Tiger Global with participation from Prologis Ventures.

SVT was founded in 2018 and launches its platform in 2020. SVT’s technology-agnostic SOFTBOT platform is aiming to solve the interoperability problem. The platform is built using what the company calls “SOFTBOTS.” Each SOFTBOT is like a microservice representing an integration to either software or hardware or business logic that manages those technologies and ensures they work in concert.

According to SVT SOFTBOTs can be built maintained or changed without custom code and without retooling the rest of the system. This could result in faster deployment of robotics systems.

SVT will use the new funding to further advance its SOFTBOT Platform and capabilities. SVT said there is a need for rapid automation deployments and management of technologies from disparate supplier.

“The demand for industrial automation is even higher but industry growth has been limited by capacity to execute” said A.K. Schultz co-founder and CEO of SVT Robotics. “Integrations are typically all custom coded meaning long development cycles. It’s expensive and companies wait as much as a year or more for new automation to go live.”

Pru Life UK and Prudential (Cambodia) Life Assurance PLC have teamed up in providing accessible protection to overseas Filipino workers (OFW) through a health and wealth management app in Cambodia.

In a statement Eng Teng Wong Pru Life UK president and chief executive officer said on Friday Nov. 19 that their goal is to help OFWs living in Cambodia secure and build a better future for them and their families.

Pro Life UK has launched Pulse by Prudential an all-in-one AI-powered mobile app which will be rolled-out to about 7000 Filipinos based in Cambodia.

“We strongly believe that OFWs should have access to products and services that will help them set up a comfortable life in the Philippines after years of working in foreign lands” Wong said.

He also said the collaboration between Pru Life UK and Prudential Cambodia allows the opportunity for Filipinos working and living in Cambodia to be given access to life protection products.

“This will empower them to take control of their health and wealth and help them make the most out of life” Wong added.

Through the partnership geo-targeted advertisements of PRUMySafety a digital protection product available through Pulse in Cambodia will be communicated to OFWs.

PRUMySafety provides daily cash benefits upon hospitalization bone fracture and death benefit against road accidents in just a few clicks.

Once OFWs have purchased the coverage in Pulse they can also get advisory services from Pru Life UK agents who can cater to the OFWs’ needs and give them access to other protection and investment products which they can readily purchase once they go home to the Philippines.

Prior to the partnership Pru Life UK has been helping OFWs who are waiting for their deployment and their families in the Philippines through various campaigns mainly on discussions about their life after working overseas savings among others.

Pru Life UK also has a group of insurance agents called the OFW PRUTectors Club which leads these financial literacy and wealth-building sessions.

“We will continue to expand our network in different countries that will help OFWs ease their worries of having protection not only for themselves but for their families’ future too” Wong said.MB.COM.PH",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbG1pcnJvci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9jaGFuZ2luZy1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC1mb3ItYmFua3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Changing environment for banks,"The pandemic has caused new turmoil and highlighted the ongoing concerns within the European Authorities about the Union’s banking system.

The turmoil accelerated the reassessment and upgrading of the operating rules of the banking system concerning capital requirements (ring-fencing).

According to the European Banking Authority: “The European Union embarked on wide-ranging reforms of its banking rules to increase the resilience of the EU banking sector.

“One of the main elements of the reforms consisted of implementing the international standards the EU and its G20 partners agreed in the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS).”

The European Commission in October approved a proposed revised package of EU banking rules including both updates and amendments in the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulations (CRR/CRD).

The new package includes prudential rules for banks and investment firms effectively finalising the implementation of the Basel III agreement in the EU (so-called “Basel III reform”).

The European Commission aims to ensure these new rules will make EU banks more resilient to possible future economic shocks.

At the same time it assists Europe’s recovery from recent financial turmoil and the transition to climate neutrality and observing boundaries for consumer protection.

As Valdis Dombrovskis Executive Vice-President of the European Commission for an Economy that Works for People said: “The proposals ensure the implementation of the key parts of the Basel III international standards.

“This is important for the stability and resilience of our banks. In this context we take into account the specificities of the EU banking sector and avoid significantly increasing capital requirements.”

However all banks are aware that the revised rules effectively mean additional capital funds and regulatory costs.

In the case of the Cypriot banks and financial institutions which may still be struggling to consolidate their balance sheets from past financial problems (2013 financial crisis) the new legislative proposals should be rigorously evaluated and assessed to receive the necessary guidance appropriate measures.

The Commission’s package contains significant improvements to existing EU rules for banks and financial institutions:

Amendments on existing legislation to implement the outstanding elements of the Basel III Reform in the EU while taking into account EU specificities and avoiding significant increases in capital requirements.

Introducing explicit rules on the management and supervision of Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) risks in line with objectives set out in the EU Sustainable Finance Strategy. The measure provides for supervisory powers to assess ESG risks as part of regular supervisory reviews.

Increasing harmonisation of certain supervisory powers and tools (enhanced supervisory capabilities e.g. sanctioning powers to enforce rules).

The first proposal concerns the implementation of the “Basel III” agreement which aims to strengthen the resilience of banks to economic shocks.

“The specificities of the EU’s banking sector for example when it comes to low-risk mortgages have been taken seriously into account” the Commission said.

The proposal aims to ensure the models used by banks to calculate their capital requirements do not underestimate the risks thus ensuring that capital required to cover those risks is sufficient.

The EU may declare that it seeks to facilitate the comparison of risk-based capital ratios between banks and to restore confidence in these indicators but in practice this will not be easy.

Cyprus for example which already has a high percentage of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) with real estate as collateral will be affected by the implementation of this regulation.

However the Commission notes the proposal aims to strengthen resilience without significant increases in capital requirements while further reducing compliance costs particularly for smaller banks without loosening prudential standards.

The second proposal is related to Sustainability issues and the banking and the financial sector’s contribution to green transition.

Strengthening the resilience of the financial industry to Environmental Social and Governance risks (ESG) is a vital pillar of the Commission’s Strategy for financing the transition to a sustainable economy (Sustainable Finance).

With this proposal the Commission requires banks to systematically identify disclose and manage ESG risks as part of their risk management process.

Indicatively we note the obligation for regular climate stress testing by both supervisors and banks (first tests are expected to be performed in 2022).

A few years ago or even a few months ago if anybody said that Cypriot banks would have to be stress-tested for ESG issues possibly many would share a laugh.

Now this is already happening and processed.

Even though the goal is to make the banking sector more resilient and ensure that banks take sustainability issues into account nothing is without cost.

In Cyprus steps have been taken to integrate the ESG criteria and grant ESG linked loans.

However it is evident this specific proposal in the short term will undoubtedly increase the supervisory requirements and operational costs in the banking system.

The third set of measures proposed concerns the supervision of fintech groups as a response to the WireCard collapse scandal. Again this will be addressed separately.

The Commission said the specific legislative package for strengthening banking institutions intends to raise the competitiveness and sustainability of the EU’s banking sector.

In essence it is another major challenge that credit and financial institutions will have to deal with effectively tackling the battle of competition for capital quality ESG issues technology.

Peachtree City is closing the dirt portion of Crabapple Lane on the city’s northeastern border to all vehicular traffic by the end of this month. A similar blockade to all out-of-city golf cart traffic on Crabapple is scheduled to go into effect by June 1 of next year.

Tyrone golf cart users have been vocal in their disappointment in losing that access to Peachtree City’s 100-plus miles of paved multi-use paths.

It’s mainly to prevent future traffic cut-through problems City Manager Jon Rorie told the City Council and a small crowd Nov. 18. “If we do nothing we will suffer the consequences. It’s time to act” Rorie said. He noted similar cut-through problems that have arisen with Planterra Ridge that allows traffic on Ga. highways 54 and 74 to avoid a busy intersection at the expense of using streets within a residential neighborhood.

The dirt portion of Crabapple dumps both cars and trucks as well as golf carts from Tyrone and parts of the county into Kedron Hills subdivision Rorie said. The city welcomes connections to its cart path system but those connections must be along major roads not residential streets he said.

But the discussion also pointed out the city’s irritation that Fayette County included that cut-through on its recently adopted transportation plan without consulting the city.

To a person the five council members emphasized that only city residents pay for the $3.2 million a year cost of maintaining more than 100 miles of paths bridges and tunnels that represent Peachtree City’s most famous amenity.

Access to the city system just got more expensive for cart owners living outside Peachtree City. Beginning Jan. 1 of the new year the non-resident cart fee will be $235 per year plus the $15 cart tag fee for each licensed cart the only kind legally allowed on the paths.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzZWN1cml0eXBsYW5ldC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvaW90LXNlY3VyaXR5LXNvbHV0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top IoT Security Solutions,"eSecurity Planet content and product recommendations are editorially independent.

IoT security is where endpoint detection and response (EDR) and enterprise mobility management (EMM) meet the challenges of a rapidly expanding edge computing infrastructure. As the enterprise attack surface grows IoT is yet another attack vector organizations aren’t fully prepared to defend.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the smart consumer and business systems powering the homes factories and enterprise processes of tomorrow. By year-end total IoT device installations will surpass 35 billion and extend to 55 billion by 2025.

Enterprise organizations recognize this shift and need to invest in device management and endpoint security capabilities. In 2016 $91 million was spent on IoT endpoint security solutions. Five years later that number has skyrocketed to $631 million. With the growth of segments like industrial IoT (IIoT) Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and industrial control systems (ICS) IoT security will continue to be critical to business continuity vulnerability management and threat remediation.

This article looks at the top IoT security solutions current commercial features associated risks and considerations for organizations choosing an IoT vendor.

What Are IoT Security Solutions?

IoT security solutions are the software and embedded tools used to monitor edge devices proactively detect threats and facilitate remediation. As such current IoT security solutions are a mix of standalone and bundle plans that include existing tools like EDR encryption IAM EMM and more to protect connected devices and networks.

What Are IoT Devices?

IoT is the broad label given to all devices capable of communicating with each other often at short range with unique identities and few components outside its operational intent including security features. Because of this several organizations are building security into a new generation of IoT devices (embedded security) while other vendors offer agent-based software to monitor and protect IoT devices.

Examples of IoT devices include most consumer smart systems autonomous machinery and vehicles office appliances and a multitude of healthcare devices.

Considerations for Choosing an IoT Security Solution

How does the solution isolate IoT devices and access from critical segments?

What protocols and tools are available for secure transactions? (TLS encryption Auth0)

Are there embedded or built-in IoT security requirements to address exposure?

What policy controls can administrators configure for unmanaged devices or users?

Does the solution issue and manage secure credentials like PKI and code signatures?

Can solution operators identify categorize and provision new devices?

How does the solution establish trust between devices? (e.g. key injection or HSMs)

IoT Security Solution Features

Network scanning device identification and discovery of active connections

Identify users data devices locations and more to identify and assess risk categories

Threat intelligence informs the status of malware and available patches

Security gateways to isolate network segments between ports servers and IoT devices

Baseline responses to anomalous behavior for individuals or clusters of devices

Define and enforce policies across device and access types for hybrid infrastructures

Automated onboarding configuration and threat response policies for new IoT devices

Certificate issuance and management for granting secure credentials and access

Because securing IoT devices is a budding cybersecurity segment the above list is not all-encompassing and several vendors present unique approaches to addressing IoT security challenges.

IoT Device Risks and Vulnerabilities

Once isolated from other devices and an organization’s larger IT environment IoT devices like sensors doorbells and printers are now at risk of compromise. With proper segmentation organizations can avoid access to an IoT device turning into something more but that won’t stop threat actors from using the device and others like it in a botnet attack.

Other identified risks associated with IoT device management include:

Insufficient security or data protection capabilities for devices

Inability to add additional security software

Insecure interfaces easily accessible to a persistent threat

Poor password protection with default credentials staying put

Unreliable patch or update mechanism

Nonexistent or lacking inventory of IoT devices or monitoring IoT traffic

A gap in IoT security management skills for edge systems

Disparate management of IoT and OT systems creating data silos

IoT Security: Not Going Away

The proliferation of IoT devices means securing the next generation of IT environments will require IoT-specific security strategies and solutions. Organizations actively deploying IoT devices should be prudent about the security risks of insecure edge devices and proceed with caution.

Organizations need to visualize IoT assets under management profile their risk apply adequate protections and monitor IoT traffic for unknown threats. Like so much else in cybersecurity visibility informs action and strategy – making the upfront work of selecting an IoT security solution or assembly a strategy that much more valuable in avoiding unnecessary risk.",,,,,,,,,

Guest columnist

When the Providence Public Library unveiled its $28.5-million renovation in the spring of 2020 it revealed the vision executive director Jack Martin and others had for the landmark institution: an approachable and inclusive place “where tradition and innovation intersect”.

“We’re emphasizing ‘public’ in Providence Public Library and hoping the community takes ownership and uses it in the best way possible” Jack said.

The redesign was deliberately focused on connecting the nearly 150-year-old library with the community: walls and ceilings were torn down to create inviting and airy spaces; windows were enlarged allowing passersby on Empire and Washington Streets to peer inside; and old offices and storage spaces were transformed into user-friendly education labs and a gallery.

“The Providence Public Library was for many years perceived to be asleep” he said. “Now that we have a beautiful new building we want to open it up to everyone and make sure everyone is aware they have this incredible resource here.”

Tasked with helping breathe new life into the reimagined structure are Christina Bevilacqua programs and exhibitions director and Janaya Kizzie events and programs manager. While Christina describes the rebuild as “porous” and about “literal and metaphorical transparency” you get the distinct impression that they would just as soon have the walls of the building magically melt away so strong is their focus on creating a truly collaborative relationship between the library and outside groups and individuals. To turn the library into Providence’s public square.

“We are actively working to dismantle the ‘house on a hill’ conceptions of the library and welcome everybody” Janaya said “not as customers but as people with real agency and who are at the center of everything we do here.”

Making the library a reflection of the community

In practical terms the pair is disrupting the traditional top-down curatorial process (where in-house staff choose and design exhibits and programs for the public) and replacing it with a more democratic model that supports and elevates things already happening in Providence and beyond.

“We really want to not be curating from on high but rather be a space where our job is to invite in to pay attention to what is going on in the community and be a resource for projects that need more space more money more marketing more expertise and be a bolster for those things” Christina said.

Providence Public Library’s current exhibition “Rewilding: Alive in the Churn” is an example of this new more organic strategy. Christina and Janaya brainstormed with leaders of PVD YoungMakers — an organization that held teen workshops in the library’s classrooms over the summer — and came up with the idea for an exhibit about adaptation and the process of living in the moment.

PVD YoungMakers built a “room within a room” in the library’s new gallery space that would serve as the foundation of the project. Nine local artists (only three of whom were selected by the library) were then invited on separate days to interpret “rewilding” in the space either by creating their own art or working off of someone else’s. The public was also included in the process. They could participate passively as spectators or more actively as artists themselves. The result is an ever-evolving work of art that is controlled by no one but is instead the outcome of a collective of disparate members of the community.

“I think for the library there’s always a tension between preservation of culture versus production of culture” said Andrew Oesch an artist and educator who was invited to work in the space. “There’s wondrous moments that are unexpected of how people take an idea or a system that you built and manipulate it and use it and create meaning in a way that you hadn’t expected.”

Giving the public a role in program

That’s precisely what Christina and Janaya are doing on a broader scale. Christina who hired Janaya in early 2020 describes the duo as “culturally curious.” While they may be of different generations and backgrounds each woman is committed to breaking the paradigms of cultural and artistic programming and the way the library interacts with the public.

“The democratizing notion that things should be for everybody is something I’ve always felt” explained Christina.

Women in Action: Farmer Katie Steere has landed her dream job

Born in Frankfurt Germany to parents who were both in the Army — her mother was a nurse and her father a social worker — Christina and her family lived in nearly a dozen cities across the U.S. (“I had an extremely peripatetic childhood” she said). The granddaughter of a coal miner and immigrants from Italy (her maternal grandmother was the only grandparent to graduate from high school) she remembers being acutely aware of how each generation stood on the shoulders of the last. And how the opportunities and possibilities she enjoyed were far different from those of her parents and grandparents.

“The randomness of your circumstances was brought home to me” she said.

Christina studied literature and writing at Bard College in New York and later earned a master's degree in social work from the University of Chicago. Her career path has been eclectic encompassing everything from publishing to advocating for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to hat designing and managing a woman’s clothing store.

Her entrée into programming came when she was hired as program coordinator for Leadership Rhode Island a community leadership development organization. There she forged relationships with people across the state that she continues to call upon.

Christina soon became a highly regarded cultural force in the community when she took the helm of public programming at the Providence Athenaeum a membership library on College Hill. Using her vast connections she developed a platform for Providence-based writers and artistic groups and reintroduced weekly literary salons which were free and open to the public.

Her transition to the Providence Public Library came just as the renovations were starting. Then the pandemic struck.

“I really took [the restoration and the pandemic] as professional/intellectual/cultural challenges and leaned in to the degree that it was possible to see what we could make out of this” Christina said.

Libraries as 'safe havens and treasure troves'

For Janaya libraries have played a significant role throughout her life.

“When I was a kid libraries were safe havens and treasure troves” Janaya said. “My dad would study and I would wander around and pull random books off the shelves and start reading them. I would sit in the corner and draw and write. I would people watch and explore all the spaces. When I was in college libraries became the place for knowledge where I could keep asking questions and be curious.”

Janaya was raised in New Jersey in a home that was always filled with music thanks to her classically trained parents. She too learned to play a variety of instruments from an early age. But her love of writing soon eclipsed everything else.

“I started writing when my dad bought a word processor” she said. “I was obsessed with it.”

Coincidentally Janaya also studied at Bard College focusing on creative writing and history. She became an archivist and was later awarded a PRISM fellowship which allowed her to delve into diversity inclusion and equity issues in the library system as she earned a degree in library science from the University of Rhode Island.

Over the years she said she’s “processed a lot of collections of dead white rich men. And I began to learn that the way we look at history as something that’s the-objects-we-leave-behind-equals-facts was never true.”

As the breadth of her writing archiving and cultural connections grew Janaya was selected as the Rhode Island Arts and Culture Fellow in 2019. She was tasked with being the ultimate arbiter of hundreds of Wikipedia entries about arts and culture in Rhode Island helping to elevate the state’s cultural scene. She was also honored with the Rhode Island Public Humanities Scholar Award in 2020.

While she considers herself a behind-the-scenes person Janaya is reveling in the community-engagement side of her new role at the library where she had previously volunteered for 11 years.

'You open the door and you realize that everything in it is yours'

“PPL has always been for me an amazing and welcoming place” Janaya said. “It’s one of those places where you open the door and you realize that everything in it is yours. It’s there for you. And I want everyone else to know that too.”

If you haven’t visited the Providence Public Library yet these women will find a way to lure you in. For them it’s all about the art of the possible.

“The variety of why people walk through that door is just stunning” said Christina. “I love the sense of public mission. There are no boundaries to what the library can be and what it can make available to people in terms of resources and opportunities. There’s nothing else like it.”

“Rewilding: Alive In The Churn” is open to the public through Dec. 17. For more information go to rewilding.digital. For more information on the Providence Public Library go to https://www.provlib.org.

He knew St. Anthony’s had a good academic reputation. But when he walked into the principal’s office for a chat and saw a small statue of the Hindu idol Lord Ganesha on his desk Sridhar was sold.

Four years later the St. Anthony's senior has found the private high school — run by the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn in traditional brown robes and sandals — to be a hospitable place for students regardless of their faith.

""It was very inviting to be honest"" Sridhar now 17 said of that first meeting with then-Principal Brother Gary Cregan. ""It just showed that he valued other religions.""

As efforts to increase ethnic and racial diversity on campus continue on Long Island and nationwide faith-based private schools are becoming more religiously inclusive as well to attract high-achieving students such as Sridhar — the president of the National Honor Society at St. Anthony's.

The tuition-charging private schools have another motive besides the spiritual education experts said. With some schools — charging anywhere from about $6000 to more than $30000 annually — seeing enrollments drop it's also a way to keep revenue streams solvent in tough economic times.

""The Catholic schools of course are trying to stay afloat and have the funds they need to continue"" said Julie Byrne a professor of religion at Hofstra University. ""They really have made accommodations to other populations’ religious sensitivities.""

On Long Island parents are taking notice. Many are attracted to private schools for their high academic standards tight discipline and in many cases the religious and moral environment even if it is of a different faith.

What to know Faith-based private schools on Long Island are becoming more open to other religions to spur inclusivity and attract students.

The efforts aim to make the schools more open and accepting of other faiths while tapping into potentially new revenue streams in tough economic times.

Parents are attracted to the private schools because of the high academic standards tight discipline and increasing openness to other religions.

Presbyterian ministers founded the Stony Brook School a century ago and though anyone could apply initially it was almost exclusively Christian. The first class had a sole non-Christian student.

In fall 2021 the student body is 50% Christian said Joshua Crane head of the day and boarding prep school with grades 7 to 12. The students comprising the other 50% are Buddhist Jewish Hindu Muslim or have no religious affiliation.

""We are a tremendously diverse school in every way with the religious aspect being front and center"" Crane said. ""It is important for us because we are discussing the big questions of life and certainly want to have other people involved in that conversation.""

The 440-student school has long been open to those of other faiths Crane said. It accepted its first Muslim student for example in 1951.

The religious diversity trend has accelerated in the past few years for a variety of reasons he said. The Stony Brook School is attracting a broader array of students because of its strong academic reputation the increasing secularization and religious diversification of the region itself and the fact that many families feel private schools performed better than public schools during the COVID-19 pandemic by having live online instruction by teachers far sooner.

Hitesh Narain a medical doctor from Holtsville and a Hindu said he enrolled his two children at the Stony Brook School because of its family and moral environment with its stated mission of ""Character Before Career.""

His children who graduated in 2015 and 2019 had never opened a Bible before but became deeply interested in it during religion studies and even won school awards in that class he said.

""We had a really good experience"" Narain said. ""They created a very nice family environment despite the religious differences.""

St. Anthony’s student body is still heavily Roman Catholic — about 89% — said its principal Brother David Migliorino but its tradition of openness to other faiths is strong too.

""That’s always been our tradition because the term Catholic means universal and that means that we have to accept all faiths"" he said. ""I think there is always value in learning from other faiths and it also strengthens our faith.""

He noted that St. Francis of Assisi the founder of the Franciscan order famously visited the Sultan al-Malik al-Kamil during the Crusades in the 13th century and came away with renewed respect for Islam.

Pope Francis ""has opened his arms to all faiths"" Migliorino said. ""I think he is an example for all of us.""

Nationwide the number of non-Catholic students at Catholic grammar and high schools increased from 2.7% to 19.7% between 1969 and 2020 according to the National Catholic Educational Association in Leesburg Virginia.

In the case of St. Anthony's it now draws students mainly from public schools said Christopher Farrell head of admissions ""because there are so few Catholic grammar schools on Long Island. The unfortunate decline of the Catholic grammar schools has contributed to our diversification.""

The total number of Catholic grammar schools in Nassau and Suffolk counties is about one-third of what it was in the 1960s dropping from 92 to 33 according to the Diocese of Rockville Centre. Two closed just this past June and another three in June 2020.

The Stony Brook School founded a century ago by Presbyterian ministers has long had a policy of welcoming students of different faiths said head of school Joshua Crane. Credit: Newsday / John Paraskevas

Most faith-based schools on Long Island require students to attend religious services such as weekly Mass or chapel and take religion classes but do not require them to convert.

""We do not seek to indoctrinate people"" Crane said of his school. ""It’s not our job to convert. Our job is simply to present and to open up to students the possibility of a life of faith.""

Some religious schools on Long Island are less diverse religiously. Kellenberg High School in Uniondale is 95% Roman Catholic and 100% Christian school officials said. Anyone can apply but the school gives priority in admissions to Roman Catholics and then non-Catholic Christians. The two groups typically fill all available seats.

The Schechter School of Long Island in Williston Park is 100% Jewish mostly because a large part of its curriculum is Jewish and Hebrew studies said Rabbi Scott Sokol who heads the K-12 day school.

For other religion-based schools on Long Island far fewer students profess the faith that the schools were founded on.

Friends Academy started by Quakers in Locust Valley in 1876 is now only 1% Quaker said Camille S. Edwards director of diversity equity and inclusion at the school which contains an array of other religions.

""We have a faith in this school practice that we believe leaves room at the table for everyone else"" Edwards said. ""So you can be a Muslim family in a Quaker school and feel seen and heard and known and loved. You can be a Jewish family. You can be nondenominational.""

At Long Island Lutheran Middle and High School in Glen Head only 14% of the students are Lutheran though overall the school is about 60% Christian said John Buck head of the school for grades 6 to 12.

The fastest growing group are those students who say they don’t practice any religion — roughly 37% according to Buck.

Yet many seem drawn to the spiritual aspect of the school which has turned into almost a local parish for many families he said.

""I think it is meeting a need that people have that they may not even realize"" Buck said. ""We’ve had people say literally ‘This became my church.’ ""

The mixing of different religions — or even bringing in students who have no faith — produces challenges as well as rewards educators said.

The Stony Brook School has 75 students from China who profess no faith Crane said.

""We have sometimes these kind of awkward moments where a new student comes from China for example"" he said. After a few days in religion class the student might ""raise their hand and ask: ‘Who is this Jesus person that you’re talking about?’’’

But the mix can also produce transformative moments.

At St. Anthony’s many non-Catholic students ""remarkably are very interested and in awe of our liturgies our retreats"" Migliorino said. ""They go to our teachers and say ‘We have never seen anything like this.’ ""

Yixuan Cheng 18 a senior at Stony Brook who is from China said that while she was not ready to become a Christian she was intrigued by the religion and enjoys weekly chapel and evening prayers in her dorm.

""At first it felt quite new because this is my very first time going to chapel and actually praying before meals"" she said. Now ""it just feels like a time where I can find peace within myself.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaXN3aWNrdzQuY29tL2luZm8vY29ucGxhbjE1My5odG3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chiswick's Local Web site,"Shurgard want permission to construct 10000 square metre unit

Comment on this story on the Self-storage company Shurgard wants to build a major new facility in Chiswick on Power Road. An application has been submitted to build on the land at 266-270 Gunnersbury Avenue which is currently owned by Hinduja Global Solutions and occupied by a low-rise office block which would be demolished. The storage facility would have a gross external area of over 10000 square metres most of which is made up of demountable mezzanine floors. The main access to the building would be by an access road off Power Road where there would be a shop front and eleven parking spaces. The application justifies the height of the building which would be taller than the adjacent Chiswick Place office block by pointing to the amount of planned development in the area and the approval given some years ago to an eight storey block at 250 Gunnersbury Avenue. However this latter development has not proceeded reportedly due to market conditions. Estate agent Savills has tried to sell the site for a client but concluded this is the wrong site and location for large scale speculative office development.

A joint venture of local property players Hoi Hup Realty and Sunway Developments bought a pair of adjoining freehold land parcels on Thiam Siew Avenue near the Paya Lebar Central commercial hub in District 15 with a goal of developing two luxury condo towers yielding more than 800 units according to a statement.

“Thiam Siew Avenue is a popular and mature neighbourhood with strong locational attributes” said Galven Tan deputy managing director for investment sales and capital markets at Savills Singapore. “At S$815 million the deal also marks the largest residential development site sold since July 2018.”

Hoi Hup and Sunway’s purchase in District 15 is their second major site acquisition in as many months with the developer duo betting on the continued appeal of upmarket housing as Singapore officials anticipate accelerating economic growth and search for the off-ramp of the COVID-19 pandemic.

‘Rare’ Find in City-State’s East

The JV partners picked up 22 consolidated plots across a land area of 263794 square feet (24507 square metres). The combined sites can yield a maximum gross floor area of 738624 square feet which works out to S$1103 ($812) per square foot of GFA for the consideration.

Savills Singapore was the exclusive marketing agent for the public tender which closed on Thursday while law firm Rajah & Tann acted for the vendors in the sale.

Wong Swee Chun chairman and managing director of Hoi Hup who also serves as chairman of the developer’s parent Straits Construction cheered the acquisition of what he dubbed a rare freehold site in Singapore’s eastern region.

“In today’s competitive real estate market we are very confident of the demand for quality freehold developments especially for these big freehold plots in District 15” Wong said.

The two sites on Thiam Siew Avenue were sold primarily by Thiam Siew Avenue Investments and Wee Thiam Siew & Co which form part of the estate of tycoon Wee Thiam Siew who passed away in 1972 leaving his descendants a portfolio of properties around the city.

This latest project to change hands is within walking distance of two MRT stations Paya Lebar Interchange and Dakota and about 10 minutes’ drive from the central business district. The land can accommodate 414 and 393 units respectively for the north and south plots based on an average size of 85 square metres (915 square feet).

Doubling Up on Deals

This week’s deal follows Hoi Hup and Sunway’s September purchase of the Flynn Park apartment complex in the Pasir Panjang area for S$371 million ($276.1 million) which set a mark for Singapore’s biggest collective sale of the year.

For a potential GFA of 291820 square feet the buyers paid roughly S$1271 ($946) per square foot for the ageing 72-unit Flynn Park property near the Greater Southern Waterfront project.

Not to be outdone developer UOL and joint venture partner SingLand in late October entered the winning bid of S$550.8 million for Watten Estate Condominium whose residents had put the 1983-vintage building in leafy Bukit Timah on the block at a S$500 million reserve price. The deal would surpass Flynn Park as the biggest collective sale of the year upon closing.

A month earlier lesser-known players El Development and Kingsford Development had emerged as the top bidders with a S$320.1 million tender for a pair of residential sites with commercial elements at Slim Barracks Rise in the One North new-economy hub.

Home Demand Bounces Back

Developers’ hankering for residential plots is in line with the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s announcement Monday that Singapore’s sales of new private homes (excluding executive condos) climbed 9 percent from September to 909 units in October following two straight monthly declines as the city wrestled with an upsurge in COVID-19 cases.

Home sales by developers including the hybrid public-private executive condo category fell by 19.4 percent from September to 1045 units last month. Despite the drop the figure was still the highest for October in five years indicating resilience in the property market according to real estate agency OrangeTee.

Ismail Gafoor CEO of PropNex Realty pointed to an uptick in foreign homebuyers last month after the reopening of borders and the launch of travel lanes for vaccinated passengers as spurring the upsswing.

“Based on caveats lodged in October foreigners accounted for about 6.8 percent of buyers who bought new homes” Gafoor said. This was one of the highest percentages since 2018 when foreign buyers accounted for 6.3 percent of new-home sales. Last year’s figure dipped to 3.8 percent.

Given the renewed momentum PropNex predicts November’s new-home sales (excluding executive condos) to reach about 1000 units with sales for the whole of 2021 likely to exceed 13000 units after reaching close to 10000 last year."

It unveiled the Dimensity 9000 which should be a worthy alternative to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen1. The list of innovations of this chip includes a 4-nm technical process Cortex-X2 core support for cameras with a resolution of 320 megapixels LPDDR5x RAM (up to 7500 Mbps) and Bluetooth 5.3 protocol.

The presence of a high-performance Cortex-X2 core makes you worry about possible chip overheating. After all as you know Snapdragon 888/888 + with Cortex-X1 core show a tendency to increase heating. Will this problem also affect Dimensity 9000? Finbarr Moynihan vice president and general manager of marketing for MediaTek said they are well aware that Qualcomm’s solutions have been disappointing.

However he stated that “we are very confident and obviously testing this chipset for our customers and the feedback we are getting is very promising.” “When it comes to comparing devices with what we think our competitor will have we believe that next year we will have a power advantage for flagships” a MediaTek spokesman said. According to the director of public relations for the chipmaker “now only one company has problems with overheating and this is not MediaTek.”

One of the chipmaker’s representatives also assured that the chip shortage would not affect the company’s flagship processor. According to him they will provide enough capacity for the release of top-end solutions next year.

It’s also worth noting that Dimensity 9000 doesn’t actually have mmWave support. But a MediaTek spokesman said that next year we will see the first Dimensity chips with mmWave-toting technology which will be one step below the Dimensity 9000.

MediaTek Dimensity 9000 chipset is able to compete with Qualcomm Snapdragon flagships

MediaTek announced the latest mobile platform Dimensity 9000 – the most powerful chipset ever. It is expected to receive specifications at least equal; to those offered in the flagship models produced by the more popular Qualcomm and Samsung.

Even the company’s strongest chipsets like last year’s Dimensity 1000 were inferior in performance; to their cutting-edge contemporaries like Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 or Samsung Exynos 2100. The new variant will completely change the situation in the flagship smartphone market.

MediaTek is not alone in using the latest Arm technologies. For example Qualcomm expects to announce a successor to the flagship Snapdragon 888 chipset at the annual Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th.

In any case the announcement of the new flagship is a big step forward for MediaTek. For a long time the company’s chipsets have been a “fallback” option; forcedly replacing Qualcomm and Samsung solutions in smartphones with Android OS devices as needed. Apparently the Dimensity 9000 will indeed become a model capable of competing with Snapdragon on equal terms. Now everything depends on the willingness of smartphone manufacturers to support the introduction of the new platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9tZWRpYXRla19kaW1lbnNpdHlfNzAwMF9sb19iZV9iYXNlZF9vbl90aGVfNW5tX25vZGUtbmV3cy01MTkzMi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MediaTek Dimensity 7000 to be based on the 5nm node,"MediaTek announced its flagship SoC the Dimensity 9000 just a couple of days ago and now we have the first rumor about its supposed upper mid-range offering for 2022 - the Dimensity 7000. The information comes from a reputable Chinese tipster on Weibo.

The rumor suggests that MediaTek's upcoming Dimensity 7000 chipset has entered the testing phase and is built on TSMC's 5nm manufacturing process and uses ARM's new V9 architecture also implemented in the Dimensity 9000.

It's still early to talk about clock speeds and CPU configurations but the so-called Digital Chat Station says the SoC's support for fast charging will comfortably slot in between the Snapdragon 870 and the Snapdragon 888 at about 75W. Sounds quite promising for a non-flagship chip that's for sure.

The previously released Pixel digital series all use Qualcomm Snapdragon chips. Today PCMag conducted a signal test on Google Pixel 6 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 (Snapdragon Edition) and found that the Samsung 5G baseband 5123b used by Google Pixel 6 Pro and the 5G baseband Snapdragon X60 used by Galaxy S21 Ultra have an obvious gap.

From the actual measurement results the Snapdragon X60 baseband used in the Galaxy S21 Ultra can always receive better 4G signals. Except for a very few scenes the Snapdragon X60 performs better than the Samsung 5123b. In terms of network speed Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra also has an advantage. Especially on mmWave 5G the speed of Google Pixel 6 Pro is only about 1Gbps while the speed of Galaxy S21 Ultra exceeds 2Gbps.

Furthermore there are reports that the Google Pixel 6 Pro disconnects for 30-60 seconds when switching from 4G LTE to 5G network. It appears that the signal of the Google Pixel 6 Pro is not impressive.

Signal or Speed Qualcomm wins

Qualcomm’s modem beats Samsung’s both in terms of 5G signal as well as speed. In the U.S. Samsung’s smartphone uses either MediaTek or Qualcomm processors and modems. Since Apple’s iPhones also use Qualcomm’s 5G modems the Pixel 6 Pro brings a “new modem” to U.S. users.

These tests seek to check which of these devices has the best connectivity in terms of signal and speed. PCMag measured thousands of signal samples so as to draw a line between both devices. Of course the result has its error limits because the modem does not solely determine the network performance Other components like antennas power amplifiers and software play a good role.

The tests use Net Monitor and the Ookla Speedtest consumer app. Using the Net Monitor app the signal strength of the Google Pixel 6 Pro ranges between -53dBm and -125dBm. However for the Galaxy S21 the signal strength range between 2-5dBm

Ookla speed tests show that in some cases the Pixel 6 Pro speed struggles to exceed 1Gbps. However in many cases the Galaxy S21 speed approaches or exceeds 2Gbps. From the test it can be seen that the Galaxy S21 has more head-to-head wins than the Pixel 6 Pro. However the Pixel 6 Pro has an advantage as it maintains its connection even in rural woody areas. The Galaxy S21 completely fails in this regard.

From the test results Pixel 6 Pro’s modem-RF system is not up to the standards of the latest Qualcomm products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzIxL21lZGlhdGVrLWNsYWltcy1kaW1lbnNpdHktOTAwMC1iZWF0cy1hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTNzLWExNS1jaGlwL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzIxL21lZGlhdGVrLWNsYWltcy1kaW1lbnNpdHktOTAwMC1iZWF0cy1hcHBsZS1pcGhvbmUtMTNzLWExNS1jaGlwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MediaTek Claims Dimensity 9000 Beats Apple iPhone 13’s A15 Chip,"MediaTek supplies its chips to a number of Android smartphone makers. But we should note that the company’s high-end products have never reached the level of the Qualcomm Snapdragon series ever. However MediaTek’s latest Dimensity 9000 may eventually change this story.

MediaTek claims that the Dimensity 9000 chip’s multi-core performance is comparable to the Apple iPhone 13 A15 chip. Moreover its overall performance is 35% better than that of the Snapdragon 888.

Dimensity 9000 Parameters

At an event held by the company earlier this week MediaTek released the Dimensity 9000. It is the company’s most powerful chip to date. The chip’s performance will be about 35% faster than the Snapdragon 888. Plus its graphics performance will exceed that of the Snapdragon 888 by 35%.

The architecture of the Dimensity 9000 is based on TSMC’s 4nm process. It uses the Cortex-X2 core with a main frequency of 3.05GHz. Apart from this there are three Cortex-A710 cores with the main frequency of 2.85GHz as well as four Cortex-A510 cores with the main frequency of 1.8 GHz. The Mali-G710 GPU comes with ten cores. The APU consists of four performance cores and two flexible cores.

In order to further improve the functions of the chip the image signal processor is a 7th generation 18-bit Imagiq ISP. The latter can capture 320MP images and transmit data at a speed of 9 billion pixels per second. The onboard modem supports 5G networks. But it only supports a sub-6GHz standard not a millimeter-wave. This means that the chip is likely not to be used in the United States. As you should be aware the major US operators are very concerned about the millimeter-wave 5G standard. Anyway our protagonist also supports Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E.

How It Performs

Now when we know everything about this chip let’s see how it performs in the benchmark. MediaTek said that the Dimensity 9000’s multi-core score is roughly equivalent to Apple iPhone 13’s A15. In general it gets more than 4000 points. However MediaTek did not disclose the comparison with other aspects of Apple’s chips. Generally speaking Apple’s chips are often much more powerful than other mobile chips.

In terms of artificial intelligence MediaTek claims that the Dimensity 9000 chip beats the Google Tensor chip as well. The Tensor has shown that it has the strongest artificial intelligence performance on mobile chips. However MediaTek claims that Dimensity 9000 AI performance will exceed Tensor by approximately 16% and exceed Apple’s latest chip by as much as 66%."

Then came COVID state contracts — and a boost from Annie Lamont's firm,"The coronavirus was spreading rapidly workplaces were locked down and Connecticut could barely turn around a virus test result in less than two weeks.

It was April of 2020. The state was desperate for help from any laboratory that could process COVID tests quickly. Much of the laboratory space at Sema4 a Stamford-based healthcare technology startup was sitting idle its genomic data analysis business largely suspended by the pandemic. So Sema4 pivoted.

In less than three weeks as the virus continued to rampage across the state Sema4 obtained federal certification to do coronavirus antigen testing responded to the state’s Request for Proposals for COVID testing and signed its first of two state contracts that eventually paid more than $25 million.

But one of Sema4’s financial backers — Oak HC/FT a well-regarded healthcare venture capital firm that invested millions of dollars in the startup — has what some see as an uncomfortably close connection to the governor’s office: One of its founders and managing partners is Ned Lamont’s spouse Annie Lamont.

After a months-long investigation into the timeline of Oak HC/FT’s investments – including filing Freedom of Information requests with state agencies and reviewing testing contracts ethics rulings emails loans venture investment data Securities and Exchange Commission filings laboratory certificates and more – a story emerged of a state desperate for assistance amid a pandemic and a high-tech startup with the capacity to help.

The narrative has one constant: Annie Lamont has remained a managing partner at Oak HC/FT even while the state was awarding multimillion-dollar contracts to one of the companies in which Oak HC/FT had a significant investment Sema4. And even though Annie Lamont said she had no role in procuring Sema4’s contracts with the state and no formal ethical lines were breached her company expanded its investment in Sema4 as the startup’s COVID-testing work for the state of Connecticut grew.

In turn those state contracts boosted Sema4’s laboratory volume and high-profile investors supplied fresh funding steering the company toward a public offering — with a valuation of $3 billion — in the summer of 2021. Connecticut taxpayer money may have helped get Sema4 to that point.

The Mirror’s reporting shows that Oak HC/FT invested in Sema4 twice — first in August of 2019 after Gov. Dannel P. Malloy’s administration awarded the company two start-up loans and a second time in July 2020 two months after the Lamont administration signed the $17.2 million contract with Sema4 to do COVID testing. Later that year the state awarded Sema4 a second no-bid testing contract worth an additional $8.4 million.

The little that was known about Oak’s investments in Sema4 eventually created a political problem for Ned Lamont. The state Republican party sensing a vulnerability as Lamont inched closer to announcing his reelection plans began agitating on social media framing the issue as an ethics violation.

When Sema4 signed its first contract with the state to conduct COVID testing a lawyer with the governor’s office told state ethics officials in an email that the couple wished to donate “any benefit that they may derive from the contract” to charity.

The Mirror’s findings raises one key question about Annie Lamont’s company’s investments in Sema4: Was it improper for her firm to increase its stake in Sema4 after the state’s COVID testing contract lifted the company’s testing volume and boosted its revenue?

When Sema4 went public in July of this year Oak HC/FT’s stake was worth more than $66 million according to SEC filings.

Annie Lamont declined to be interviewed for this story. Instead of responding to specific questions submitted by the Mirror she provided an emailed statement via the governor’s spokesman.

“Ned and I had no involvement with the decision to enter into a contract with Sema4 or the terms of its contract with the State of Connecticut. Decisions involving Sema4 and the terms of the testing contract were negotiated by the Office of the Comptroller without any involvement from me or Ned” the statement reads. “Finally I have recused myself from all decisions relating to our investment in this company. To date I have not earned any profit from the investment in Sema4 and I will keep our promise and pledge to donate any and all proceeds to charity.”

Gov. Lamont issued a written statement through his spokesman: “The State of Connecticut had a choice in March and April of 2020: sit back and let the Trump administration — which at the time was describing this global pandemic as ‘the flu’ and was notoriously inept in its response — dictate the state’s future when it came to testing and understanding the spread of the virus. Or at a time of national crisis when states were competing against each other for tests masks and resources in order to contain COVID take our fate into our own hands by utilizing testing capacity within our state’s borders — all through an independent selection process and executed through an independent committee.”

While Annie Lamont’s venture capital firm may have benefited from Sema4’s COVID-testing contract with the state there is no evidence the governor violated any state ethics rules.

Based on written guidance provided to the Lamonts by the Office of State Ethics as well as an interview with the agency’s executive director the Sema4 contract posed no conflict of interest under state law on the part of the governor or first lady.

For some that raises questions about the rules themselves.

“Even if it isn’t nepotism it certainly looks like it to the public” said Craig Holman government affairs lobbyist for the watchdog group Public Citizen. “It causes damage to the public’s view of who government is serving.”

Peter Lewandowski the executive director of the Office of State Ethics said a 16-page advisory opinion produced in response to questions posed by the Lamonts two months after he took office gave clear guidance on how to comply with the law.

But Lewandowski speaking generally and not about the Lamonts said compliance with the law is not necessarily the standard that the public will apply.

“In some ways it’s left to the public officials discretion on how much tolerance they have for bad optics” Lewandowski said.

How Sema4 and Annie’s Oak came together

Annie Lamont is a managing partner of Oak HC/FT a venture investment fund targeting health care and financial tech startups that she and two co-founders Andrew Adams and Tricia Kemp spun out of Oak Investment Partners in 2014.

The firm is well-regarded in the healthcare venture capital world according to Matt McCooe chief executive of Connecticut’s own quasi-public venture capital arm Connecticut Innovations.

“She’s one of the top health care investors on the planet probably top five” McCooe said.

The state’s history with Sema4 dates back to 2015 when Gov. Malloy’s Department of Economic and Community Development agreed to loan $9.5 million to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York where Sema4 was created.

The first portion of that loan $9.5 million was released in two stages according to the DECD contracts: first $5 million to build a laboratory in Branford where most of the COVID-19 testing is now conducted; and second $4.5 million which was released when Sema4 established its headquarters in Stamford. Sema4 was approved for another $6 million loan in June 2018 to establish a second laboratory in Stamford.

But Lewandowski speaking generally and not about the Lamonts said compliance with the law is not necessarily the standard that the public will apply.

“In some ways it’s left to the public officials discretion on how much tolerance they have for bad optics” Lewandowski said.

Sema4 was approved for another $6 million loan in June 2018 to establish a second laboratory in Stamford.

State Comptroller Kevin Lembo said Geballe called the Comptroller’s office on May 3 to ask for help. Geballe asked Lembo to take on the responsibility of contracting and coordinating COVID testing Lembo recalled.

“I talked to my team because my first instinct was A this is big and B this isn’t really our thing” Lembo said. “But in light of the public health emergency and what was going on we decided to pursue it so I dedicated some resources in the office and we got to it.”

Geballe said the RFP was designed to get some of the local laboratories involved in COVID testing. At the time the only options were the state public health laboratory which was doing barely 100 tests a week in late April and Quest Diagnostics which was sending samples to its main laboratory in California and turnaround time was 10 days to two weeks.

“The strategy was we needed to take advantage of all the laboratories we had here in Connecticut to speed up the test results. Sema4 didn’t get any special treatment. They went through the same process as every other laboratory because we needed all hands on deck” Geballe said.

Several of the RFP respondents including Sema4 needed to update a federal laboratory certification known as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments in order to be able to conduct COVID antigen testing. “None of the labs were validated for COVID testing because it had never been done before” Geballe said. Sema4’s CLIA certificate shows an update on May 4 2020.

By May 8 the Department of Administrative Services had received at least 10 responses to the RFP from hospitals and laboratories. Sema4 was among them. (McCooe has taken credit for suggesting to Geballe that the state consider Sema4 as a testing partner.) DAS asked the Department of Public Health to vet the responses looking specifically at each applicant’s testing capabilities.

“Any laboratory that wanted to do COVID testing needed approval from DPH. Sema4 was treated no differently than any other lab whether it was Yale or Jackson or Genesys” Geballe said.

DPH spokesman Christopher Boyle said the hospitals and laboratories that submitted proposals “were evaluated by a state review team that included Dr. Jafar Razeq director of the laboratory for the Connecticut Department of Public Health as well as representatives from the State Comptroller’s Office and the Connecticut National Guard.”

Boyle said “a smaller group of proposals were selected based on their qualifications and were then forwarded over to the State Comptroller’s Office.” The Comptroller’s office then began negotiating contracts with each applicant.

The value of the COVID-testing agreements ultimately ranged from about $800000 to more than $84 million with Quest Diagnostics according to records reviewed by The Mirror. The Comptroller didn’t initially release the terms of that round of contracts claiming what the state was paying for each laboratory per test was a trade secret.

Sema4 signed its first contract – worth about $17.2 million – with the Comptroller on May 20 2020. Of all the laboratory partners who submitted responses to the RFP and who were quickly signed on as testing providers Sema4 would go on to earn the second-most in COVID testing dollars behind Quest.

On the same day the contract was signed the associate general counsel in the governor’s office notified the Office of State Ethics that Oak HC/FT is an investor in Sema4. The director of the office said “the Governor and First Lady are under no legal obligation to donate the financial benefits that they may derive from the contract.”

But state contracts weren’t Sema4’s only financial boost.

A lucrative investment

Sema4’s success amid the pandemic chaos quickly caught the attention of more private investors. Having risen to the occasion and proven how quickly it could pivot the company may have bolstered its prospects with the private investor community. Oak HC/FT was one of eight investors who clambered to raise an additional $121 million for Sema4 in July 2020. The round pumped Sema4’s valuation to over $1 billion officially making it a “unicorn” in VC parlance.

The Series C announced July 20 2020 was oversubscribed – meaning investors were competing with each other and offering more money than the company had set out to raise. That included funds managed by another behemoth in the investment world BlackRock as well as two other new investment funds. But those new players didn’t knock out any of the previous investors. Connecticut Innovations and Oak HC/FT both raised their stakes incrementally.

At the time no one appeared to have raised red flags about Annie Lamont’s firm’s second investment in a company that was in the process of contracting with the state to carry out COVID testing — or the potential for her to personally benefit albeit indirectly from taxpayer money.

It’s also unclear whether it would have been necessary under current state ethics laws for the governor to disclose such an investment. State ethics officials said the Lamonts’ initial disclosure at the time of the first contract had been voluntary.

What is clear is that state contracts helped Sema4 — and its investors.

COVID-19 contracts buoyed Sema4’s 2020 testing volume by 131% according to the company’s S-1 Registration Statement filed August 4 2021. And the company did more COVID testing this year. In Sema4’s most recent quarterly earningsfiling on Nov. 15 it reported it had conducted more than 270000 COVID tests in the first nine months of this year. Its total revenue from diagnostic testing rose 31% to $149 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period a year earlier. “The increase was primarily attributable to a 303% increase in COVID-19 test volumes and overall increase in volumes of 125% partially offset by the change in the mix of tests performed and reduced reimbursement rates” the report stated. The company projected COVID testing revenue would amount to an additional $3 million in the final three months of this year.

But Sema4 doesn’t expect the COVID testing revenue stream to last forever. In an emailed statement a spokesman for Sema4 said “our COVID-19 offering remains an ancillary non-core part of our business and is distinguished as such in our financial statements. As a health intelligence company our long-term focus continues to be using artificial intelligence to enable personalized medicine as the standard of care for all as well as delivering information-rich genomic solutions in areas such as reproductive health and oncology.”

In late July 2021 Sema4 began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange after going public via reverse merger with the special-purpose acquisition company CM Life Sciences Inc. which was launched with funds from Casdin Capital and Corvex Management. The deal reportedly valued the Mount Sinai spinoff at about $3 billion.

Oak HC/FT held 6302462 shares in Sema4 when the company went public according to SEC filings. At an opening price of $10.56 per share Oak HC/FT’s stake was worth more than $66 million at that time.

It’s unclear how much of a profit — if any — that could amount to for Oak HC/FT since neither Annie Lamont nor her venture fund disclosed the amount of its investment in Sema4 or whether Oak has cashed out any of its stake in the company.

In response to questions about the value of its investment in Sema4 and the role Annie Lamont played a spokeswoman for Oak HC/FT provided only the following emailed statement.

“We are proud to be investors in Sema4 an innovative Connecticut-based health care company that played a pivotal role in providing increased accessibility to COVID testing when the residents of the state needed it most. By doing so Sema4 helped to detect more cases flatten the curve and save lives.”

Was the process proper?

State Comptroller Lembo said Annie Lamont’s connection to Sema4 “had no impact on the agreement” state officials executed with Sema4 for COVID testing adding that his office only learned of the connection from news reports after the contracts were signed.

“Our office had no communication with Mrs. Lamont at any point leading up to or during the RFP process contract negotiations or after the contracts had been executed” Lembo wrote in an email. “Our office secured contracts acknowledging the responsibility to rapidly expand testing capacity but with no outside pressure to engage with one company specifically.”

As soon as Sema4 signed the testing contract with the Comptroller the associate general counsel in the office of the governor notified state ethics officials via email that legally Sema4 didn’t “meet the definition of an ‘associated business’ under the Ethics Code.” However the Lamonts had included Sema4 on a “recusal list” of companies in which Annie Lamont had invested wrote Walter Menjivar associate general counsel in the governor’s office.

That list had been provided to state agencies.

Lembo said his office was unaware that there was a “recusal list.” Nor was it filed with the Office of State Ethics according to Lewandowski.

“According to the advisory opinion that we issued back in 2019 the recusal list would be shared with all pertinent agencies … the ones that enter into state contracts OPM DHS those agencies. But not with us. There was the understanding there’s no need for us to see the recusal list because we do not monitor state contracts other than making sure that the requirement that these contracts are subject to open and public process.”

In the email to state ethics officials Menjivar said Lamont wasn’t involved in the contract-awarding process.

Under state law that email disclosure wasn’t required according to Nancy Nicolescu a director in the Office of State Ethics. In the governor’s case “contracts with the state entered into by a public official or state employee and/or his or her associated business have to be disclosed.” Sema4 doesn’t meet the definition of an “associated business.”

“The question is… did they have some kind of unlevel playing field or have a leg up on the competition because of her involvement?” said Scott Amey general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight.

The governor should always seek to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest Amey added. “They should be very transparent about his wife’s work the firm she works for and the opportunities they’re getting especially if they impact state taxpayers.”

Every one of the RFP respondents that DPH forwarded to the Comptroller’s office received contracts. And most of the originally approved contracting labs and hospitals went on to sign additional agreements with the state to provide further testing – none of which were bid via RFP.

Sema4 signed its second contract with the state Department of Public Health on Oct. 1 2020 to provide COVID testing in nursing homes. DPH eventually paid Sema4 about $8.4 million for services rendered under that contract according to a copy of the contract reviewed by the CT Mirror.

Boyle acknowledged that DPH didn’t put that testing contract out to bid and used many of the same laboratories and hospitals that the Comptroller’s office was already using.

“Given the urgency of the COVID pandemic—especially in the spring of 2020—Governor Lamont’s Executive Order allowed the Department of Public Health to procure vendors for nursing home testing without a competitive bidding process” Boyle said.

In his statement Sema4’s spokesman added that the company “answered the call to provide much needed COVID-19 testing when the State of Connecticut sought more capacity and a faster turnaround time for results particularly during the large spike in COVID-19 cases in the Fall and Winter of 2020. We invested heavily to quickly ramp up testing operations.”

Sema4 signed a third testing contract with DPH in July 2021. Information about how much Sema4 has earned from that contract is not yet available according to the Comptroller’s office. Sema4 is one of four laboratories that are handling testing at 16 sites around the state that were initially set up to handle an expected surge in testing when the delta variant hit.

Benefits derived

If Oak HC/FT makes any profit from its stake in Sema4 the Lamonts might be expected to donate some of that money — if any of it goes to Annie Lamont. She said she hasn’t profited from that investment.

Legally however the Lamonts don’t have to donate anything.

Lewandowski in an emailed response last May to Menijivar wrote: “Based on the facts presented and the recusal steps taken the Governor and First Lady are under no legal obligation to donate the financial benefits that they may derive from the contract.” He added “Certainly the decision to donate any derived benefits will address any appearance concerns which as you know are beyond the scope of the Code of Ethics for Public Officials.”

Given the appearance of conflicts of interest the state of Connecticut may not be inclined to enter future contracts with other companies Annie Lamont’s firm supports said McCooe of Connecticut Innovations. He sees that as a loss given her knowledge and prowess in the healthcare field – and Connecticut’s need to innovate to improve healthcare delivery.

“I would love to do more investing with Oak and I don’t think they’ll do another deal in Connecticut. Or if they do it’s going to be really complicated because the public doesn’t seem to like it” McCooe said.

“I’m very bummed out by the whole thing.”

USA TODAY

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be looking to end a two-game losing streak when they host the New York Giants in front of a national audience Monday night.

Here’s everything you need to know about this Week 11 matchup:

TOP STORYLINES

Bucs (still) beating Bucs

The defending Super Bowl champs have been their own worst enemy over the last two games as self-inflicted errors have been the key factor in back-to-back road losses to the New Orleans Saints and Washington Football Team.

Penalties turnovers and other mistakes have plagued the Bucs and the Week 9 bye didn’t seem to help.

Eliminating those slip-ups will be critical to ending the losing streak and sending the Raymond James Stadium crowd home happy.

Faster than a Waddle:Jaylen Waddle closing in on best rookie receiving performance in Dolphins history

Getting better:Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence has made steady progress as a rookie. Here's how he's done it

Honest criticism:Dolphins' Xavien Howard wins award but says season play 'not up to my standard'

Mike & Mike

Mike Evans already owns just about every receiving record in Bucs history but he’s about to add yet another impressive milestone to his list of accomplishments.

If he scores a touchdown Monday night Evans will eclipse Mike Alstott’s franchise record of 71 career touchdowns. It’s quite the feat for a wide receiver especially one that’s still just 28 years old.

The fact that Evans is facing the Giants might help too. In five career games against the G-Men Evans has racked up 32 receptions for 582 yards and six touchdowns.

Injury updates

The Bucs have been banged up all season long missing key players on both sides of the ball.

While there are likely to be some big names missing again Monday night (Vita Vea and Antonio Brown haven’t practiced all week) others might be inching closer to a return.

Rob Gronkowski was a full participant in Friday’s practice and cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting could be activated from injured reserve after being out since Week 1. Chris Godwin and Jason Pierre-Paul were among those who were limited Friday but they’re both expected to play.

MATCHUPS TO WATCH

Bucs WR Mike Evans vs. Giants CB James Bradberry

Evans and Bradberry had some entertaining battles when Bradberry was in Carolina and they’ll get a chance to renew that rivalry Monday night.

Both players have size length and athleticism along with a physical playing style that should lead to some contentious action when the ball comes Evans’ way.

Evans only saw three targets last week against Washington but he turned them into 62 yards and a touchdown so don’t be surprised if Tom Brady looks his way more often this time around.

Giants RB Saquon Barkley vs. Bucs’ front seven

Barkley appears primed for a return from injury Monday night which would be a huge boost to the Giants’ offense. He’ll be welcomed by one of the NFL’s most formidable defensive fronts though the Bucs are likely to be without Vea the league’s best nose tackle.

That will make it even more important for Devin White and Lavonte David to contain Barkley who might be the most complete running back in the NFL when healthy.

Bucs’ offensive line vs. Giants’ defensive line

Much like last week’s matchup against Washington the Tampa Bay offense will have a tough test in the trenches this week.

Leonard Williams and the rest of New York’s dominant defensive line will challenge a Bucs offensive line that’s coming off their worst performance of the season despite the fact that Washington was missing both of their edge rushers in Chase Young and Montez Sweat.

he Bucs’ blockers will be motivated to bounce back with a stellar showing this time around.

Prediction

On paper the Bucs are in a completely different universe than the Giants even with the injuries they’re still dealing with on both sides of the ball.

In practice they’ve struggled to live up to the high expectations over the past two weeks holding themselves back with costly errors and losing games that should have been comfortable victories.

This is Tampa Bay’s first home game in nearly a month and they’ll need to start fast to get the crowd involved.

The Giants played them close on Monday night last year in New York and until the Bucs prove they’ve fixed their turnover and penalty problems there’s no reason to believe they won’t be pushed to the brink again this time.

State Senators more likely to die in office than win election as governor,"New Jersey State Senators are more likely to die in office than to use the Senate as a springboard to another elected post. Under the current State Constitution passed in 1947 68 sitting state senators have asked voters to promote them to a new office but only fourteen have won according to an analysis conducted by the New Jersey Globe.

All 23 state senators who have run for governor lost: Malcolm Forbes (1957) Wayne Dumont (1965) Raymond Bateman (1977) James E. McGreevey (1997) and Barbara Buono (2013) won major party nominations but lost the general election — each time to an incumbent; William Schluter ran as an Independent in 2001; and Kenneth Hand (1953) Walter Jones (1961) Charles Sandman (1965) William Kelly (1969) Frank McDermott (1969) William Ozzard (1969) Harry Sears (1969) Ralph DeRose (1973) Raymond Garramone (1977) Frank Dodd (1981) William Hamilton (1981) Joseph Merlino (1981) James Wallwork (1981) John Russo (2005) Bill Gormley (1989) Gerald Cardinale (1989) and Raymond Lesniak (2017) lost primary elections. (Dumont lost Republican gubernatorial primaries in 1957 and 1961). The last time someone went directly from the New Jersey Senate to governor was in 1928.

Edward Crabiel gave up his Senate seat to run in 1973 but withdrew when some party leaders decided to back Brendan Byrne. In 2001 Donald DiFrancesco dropped his bid for the Republican gubernatorial nomination while serving as both Senate President and Governor (he had succeeded Christine Todd Whitman earlier that year). Loretta Weinberg was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Lt. Governor in 2009.

All eight state senators who have run for the United States Senate have lost: Frank Guarini in 1970 Democratic primary against Harrison Williams; Dick LaRossa (1996) Bill Gormley (2000) Diane Allen (2002) John Matheussen (2002) Thomas Kean Jr. (2006) Joseph Pennacchio (2008) and Joseph Kyrillos (2012). Only Kean and Kyrillos made it to a general election ballot. No sitting state senator had gone directly to the U.S. Senate since 1936.

Fourteen of the 20 sitting state senators who have run for the U.S. House of Representatives have won: Sandman (1966) John Hunt (1966) Edwin Forsythe (1970) Joseph Maraziti (1972) Matthew Rinaldo (1972) Bernard Dwyer (1980) James Saxton (1984) Frank Pallone (1988) Richard Zimmer (1990) Robert Menendez (1992) John Adler (2008) and Leonard Lance (2008) Donald Norcross (2012) and Jeff Van Drew (2018). Only Sandman defeated an incumbent. Nine have lost House bids: Richard Stout (1968) Joseph Kyrillos (1992) Joseph Bubba (1992) Gormley (1994) John Bennett (1996) Cardinale (2002) Nia Gill (2012) Linda Greenstein (2014) and Kean (2020).

Three incumbent state senators unsuccessfully sought office in Bergen County: Matthew Feldman (1986) and Hank McNamara (2002) ran for County Executive and Harold Hollenbeck (1973) ran for Freeholder. Three Senators lost bids for Mayor of Newark: Alexander Matturri (1970) Anthony Imperiale (1974) and Ronald Rice (1998); Byron Baer sought the Democratic nomination for mayor of Englewood in 2003. Frank Graves was elected mayor of Paterson in 1982 a post he had previously held from 1961 to 1966. In 1983 Frank E. Rodgers gave up his Senate seat to run for Hudson County Clerk.

Upon the resignation of McGreevey in 2004 Senate President Richard Codey was next in the line of succession and became the governor; he held the post for fourteen months but never ran for the office. Joseph Vitale was elected as the interim mayor of Woodbridge in 2006 and served for sixteen months until the election of his successor was certified. Paul Sarlo Brian Stack and Nicholas Sacco – were elected to the State Senate while serving as mayors.

Three senators – William Bate (1973) Kevin O’Toole (2001) and Sean Kean (2011) – went from the upper house to the Assembly after their Senate seats were eliminated in redistricting. Only O’Toole (2007) returned to the Senate; Bate sought a Senate seat in 1981 but lost to Bubba.

Fifteen Senators have died in office — one more than the number who have won higher office: Raymond Bowkley Cardinale John Caufield Robert Crane Glenn Cunningham John Dimon Walter Foran Garrett Hagedorn William Haines Joseph Hirkala Christopher Jackman Wynona Lipman Edward Sisco Howard Sharp and James Whelan. Two others Byron Baer and Wayne Dumont resigned for health reasons.

Another five Senators were terminated following their criminal convictions: Angelo Errichetti David Friedland John Gregorio William Vincent Musto and James Turner.

Editor’s Note: Gormley is counted once although he has sought higher office three times; Cardinale who ran twice is also counted once. Senators who sought re-election to posts they had held prior to running for the Senate are not counted at all. These numbers do not include higher offices sought be individuals prior to their election to the New Jersey Senate such as Bob Smith’s 1992 congressional campaign or Loretta Weinberg’s 1998 bid for Bergen County Executive. McGreevey and Robert Meyner had been former senators when they were elected governor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoamVyc2V5LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2JlcjEwMDcxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barbara Anne Cooper Obituary - The Record/Herald News,"Give to a forest in need in their memory

Glide Phase Interceptor will defend against advanced hypersonic threats.

Raytheon press release

The weapon called Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) will defeat a new generation of hypersonic missiles – weapons that travel more than five times the speed of sound and maneuver rapidly in flight.

Tay Fitzgerald vice president of Strategic Missile Defense said:

“Raytheon Technologies systems are the cornerstone of today’s ballistic missile defenses. We’re building on that knowledge to advance the missile defense system for future threats. GPI’s speed ability to withstand extreme heat and maneuverability will make it the first missile designed to engage this advanced threat.”

GPI will intercept hypersonic weapons in the glide phase of flight which occurs once a missile has re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and is maneuvering toward its target. The initial development phase will focus on reducing technical risk rapidly developing technology and demonstrating the ability to intercept a hypersonic threat.

Developed on behalf of the MDA GPI will be integrated into the U.S. Navy’s Aegis Weapon System a ship- and shore-based defense system.

Raytheon Technologies’ missile defense portfolio combines sensors interceptors and command and control networks to track and defeat a wide range of threats. Today the company is responsible for portions of nearly every air and missile defense system deployed by the U.S. and its allies. By evolving its missile interceptors directed energy and cyber technologies Raytheon Technologies is advancing counter-hypersonic solutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWxsLXhwcy1ydHgtMzA2MC1kZXNrdG9wLWRlYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grab an RTX 3060-Powered Dell XPS Desktop for Just $999,"If you really want an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card the good news is that you can find one right online at Amazon . . . for around $900.

But the good news is that if you buy a prebuilt desktop with an RTX 3060 inside you don't have to pay that kind of markup.

Right now Dell has an XPS Desktop with RTX 3060 inside on sale for just $999 when you use code DBXPS18AFF at checkout. When you get past the graphics card this desktop has modest specs including a Core i5-11400 CPU 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive. Most people would prefer an SSD for storage and at least 16GB of RAM but it should be inexpensive enough to add those pieces after purchase.

This desktop comes equipped with an RTX 3060 card a Core i5-11400 CPU 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive. Use coupon code DBXPS18AFF to get it at this price.

Another possibility: you could buy this desktop pull out the graphics card to use in another computer and then use the desktop which also has integrated graphics without it.

The Gigabyte Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Ti doesn't exhibit any significant differences with the other competing cards here and most results are within a few percentage points of each other.

1080p Benchmarks (Max Settings)

In real-world benchmarks however the Gigabyte card seemed to underperform in select titles. This was most pronounced in Shadow of the Tomb Raider where it was around 12% slower than the ASUS card.

1440p Benchmarks (Max Settings)

The Gigabyte card continued to trail slightly at 1440p as well although the differences were less pronounced. It also managed to edge ahead of the ASUS card in Watch Dogs: Legion.

4K Benchmarks (Max Settings)

Performance evens out at 4K with the Gigabyte card even taking the lead in most titles. In Watch Dogs: Legion it edged ahead to a 9% advantage.

Ray Tracing Benchmarks (4K Max Settings)

With ray tracing turned on at 4K all the cards were mostly neck-and-neck with each other. However the Gigabyte model managed to squeeze out the slimmest of leads in both titles.

Temperature and power

Temperature numbers were disappointing and despite the large and hefty cooler the Gigabyte card still ran hotter than the ASUS and MSI models. It's not a game-changing difference but when performance numbers are this close thermal performance matters a lot more.

Conclusion

The Gigabyte Aorus RTX 3080 Ti Xtreme is going up against some serious competition. While it flags at 1080p it regains its footing at 4K which is the resolution that anyone who is willing to pay for a card like this probably plays at. Unfortunately cooling performance is just about average running slightly hotter than even the Founders Edition model. At S$2730 it is a significant investment that you'll want to weigh carefully. It's a great card but the fact remains that the competition is simply putting out better numbers. For the price you might want to consider shelling out a little more for the ASUS model instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2dyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLzkwOTg2L3JlYWQtaXQtYW5kLXdlZXAtaGVyZXMtaG93LWJhZC1udmlkaWEtZ3B1LXByaWNlcy1nb3QtaW4tYS1zaW5nbGUteWVhctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Read It and Weep: Here's How Bad Nvidia GPU Prices Got in a Single Year,"If you somehow bought an Nvidia graphics card a year ago consider yourself lucky. Since then the market for desktop GPUs has become a depressing mess. Supplies remain thin scalping is rampant and price inflation is upon us.

Case in point: 12 months ago I scored a Gigabyte RTX 3070 card from Best Buy that cost me $569. Now that same card is listed at $749 due to rising costs and Trump-era tariffs on China kicking back into effect earlier this year.

But good luck finding the card for even that price. PC graphics cards continue to sell out in minutes making it incredibly hard to buy one at normal retail value. To obtain the Gigabyte RTX 3070 immediately you’ll have to try eBay a third-party dealer Amazon or Newegg where it can cost an eye-popping $1200 or more.

To put things in perspective we decided to chart out the price increases for various Nvidia RTX 3000 graphics cards from GPU vendors such as Asus EVGA Gigabyte and MSI. To do so we looked at the initial launch price at either Best Buy or Newegg by using tools such as the Internet Archive PCPartPicker and news articles from a year ago.

We then looked up the current retail pricing and compared it to the costs consumers can find on third-party dealers at Amazon and Newegg. Finally we included the recent average selling price for each card on eBay using the site’s Terapeak tool. The results are below—try not to cry.

Nvidia RTX 3070 Models

Remember when the RTX 3070 was announced with a $499 starting price? Those days are long gone unless you can snag a Founders Edition model.

As you can see it's best to avoid buying the cards from third-party dealers on Amazon where prices are worse than those charged by scalpers on eBay although pricing can quickly fluctuate. (Where it's noted the terms ""Rev 2.0"" and ""LHR"" mean the product listing indicated that the card contains Nvidia's Ethereum hash rate limiter.)

Nvidia RTX 3080 Models

Prices go up again for the more powerful RTX 3080 card which initially arrived closer to $699.

Nvidia RTX 3090 Models

Meanwhile the price increases for the RTX 3090 have skyrocketed by over $500 to more than a $1000 depending where you buy.

Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti Models

Sadly the midrange $399-and-up RTX 3060 Ti now costs closer to a high-end graphics card if you buy from a scalper or third-party dealer.

The one exception to the inflation has been the Nvidia-branded Founders Edition models sold through Best Buy. Pricing for these limited-editions cards has remained the same through the past year. But to buy one consumers have often had to wait hours in line or even camp out.

Nvidia's RTX 3060 RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards were not included because they launched earlier this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9iYXR0bGVmaWVsZC0yMDQyLXBjLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWJlbmNobWFya3Mtc2V0dGluZ3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battlefield 2042 PC Benchmarks Performance and Settings,"Battlefield 2042 brings near-future warfare to the series and you might just want a near-future GPU to run it at ultra settings. We'll get into the details in a moment but pushing everything to maximum quality can cause GPUs that don't have enough VRAM to take a dirt nap. But you don't actually need to max out the settings and unless you have one of the fastest options among the best graphics cards like the RTX 3090 RTX 3080 Ti or RX 6900 XT you'll probably want to skip 4K and ray tracing.



We've tested Battlefield 2042 performance on a collection of GPUs and ran some detailed settings benchmarks to see how each of the options affects performance and image quality. We'll start with the settings but first let's quickly run through our testing equipment and methodology.

(Image credit: DICE)

Our test equipment consists of a Core i9-9900K CPU with 32GB of DDR4-3600 CL16 memory a 2TB SSD and of course the various GPUs we've tested. Benchmarking Battlefield 2042 is frankly horrible—this is pretty much the opposite of most of the things we like to see as we discussed in how to make a good game benchmark. Of course there isn't a built-in benchmark which means we had to run every test manually—good for getting a true look at performance bad for repeatability. Weather effects can also impact performance and just the general mayhem of a 64-player or even 128-player match means there's far more variability between runs.



We've attempted to mitigate that variability by running each test multiple times and also tried to get a ""clear"" day for the battle on the Discarded map. That means that besides trying to avoid heavy clouds in the sky (which drops performance) or if a tornado shows up we exit and restart. We also ran the game in solo/co-op mode and played against bots because we didn't want other humans wondering why one player kept running in circles around one area of the map. Even so the margin of error is going to be slightly higher than the normal 1–2% range we'd get from a good built-in benchmark.

Battlefield 2042 Settings Analysis

Image 1 of 6 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: DICE) (Image credit: DICE) (Image credit: DICE) (Image credit: DICE)

Battlefield 2042 has all the usual settings you'd expect to be able to tweak in a modern PC game including ultrawide resolution support uncapped framerates high display refresh rates HDR four presets and about 18 (depending on how you want to count) individual advanced graphics settings that you can tweak to your liking. If you use the presets they'll lock in 11 of the settings but you're free to enable/disable motion blur chromatic aberration film grain vignette lens distortion DLSS ray traced ambient occlusion and a few other miscellaneous options.

You can see the performance charts for an RTX 3060 and RX 6700 XT running using a 1080p ultra baseline in the above gallery along with screenshots of the other display and graphics settings. In the next gallery we have individual screenshots of each of the presets along with a screenshot (see how to take screenshots in Windows) of each setting turned down from the ultra preset to its minimum value. If you compare the screenshots against the ultra version you'll note that most settings have very little discernable impact on the way the game looks or even the performance.

Note that the two GPUs were selected because they both had 12GB VRAM which is necessary to avoid other bottlenecks. For example suppose you have an AMD card with only 8GB or less or an Nvidia card with 6GB or less VRAM. In that case you'll want to drop the texture quality a notch or two and probably lower lighting quality as well to avoid potentially serious stuttering.

Image 1 of 16 (Image credit: DICE) Ultra preset (Image credit: DICE) High preset (Image credit: DICE) Medium preset (Image credit: DICE) Low preset (Image credit: DICE) Texture Quality Low (Image credit: DICE) Texture Filtering Low (Image credit: DICE) Lighting Quality Low (Image credit: DICE) Effects Quality Low (Image credit: DICE) Post Process Quality Low (Image credit: DICE) Mesh Quality Low (Image credit: DICE) Terrain Quality Low (Image credit: DICE) Undergrowth Quality Low (Image credit: DICE) Antialiasing Post-Processing TAA Low (Image credit: DICE) Ambient Occlusion Off (Image credit: DICE) High Fidelity Objects Amount Low (Image credit: DICE) Ray Traced Ambient Occlusion On

You can flip through the above images to make your own evaluation but the short summary of the biggest impact settings is that only lighting quality terrain quality and post-process quality change the visuals much. Oh and of course ray-traced ambient occlusion but that really does need a potent GPU and/or running at lower resolutions (perhaps with DLSS) to be viable. As far as performance goes it's again those same settings that have the greatest potential to improve framerates—or hurt them in the case of RTAO.



Lighting quality generally deals with the shadows you'll see in the game. At the low setting the resolution of the shadow maps drops and so shadows—like of the nearby ranger robot—become less distinct. Shadows on objects farther away may disappear entirely like on the semi-truck dumpster in the left of the image. Dropping this to low vs. ultra improved performance by just 5% on the AMD card and 11% on the Nvidia GPU. Part of that might be the CPU becoming a bottleneck with the faster RX 6700 XT however.



Terrain quality seems to alter both the resolution of the terrain textures as well as the amount of terrain geometry. Flipping between low and ultra there's less detail and deformation in the terrain on the low setting. However it's not a massive visual difference and outside of ray tracing this was the single most demanding setting. Dropping it to low boosted performance by about 10%.



Post-process quality didn't impact performance much at all but looking at the screenshots this appears to include effects like screen space reflections. Set this to low and the puddles don't have any approximated reflections. This could potentially impact performance and visuals more on some of the other levels but given we measured a 1–3% drop in performance you can probably leave it at ultra.



Ray traced ambient occlusion is the only other setting of note and it improves the quality of shadows on objects. It's particularly noticeable (in the screenshots) underneath the trailer on the left the platform in the middle and the underside of the crane on the right. So it does make a difference in image quality but the problem as usual is that the slight gains are offset by a rather steep drop in performance. We've benchmarked with and without RTAO on the various GPUs we tested and saw about a 30% drop in performance on the AMD GPUs and a smaller 15–20% drop on the Nvidia GPUs. But that's only if your GPU has enough VRAM as results on the RTX 3060 Ti at higher resolutions drop quite a bit more while the RTX 2060 basically shouldn't even think about enabling RTAO.

Battlefield 2042 Graphics Card Benchmarks

(Image credit: DICE)

Due to the difficulty in testing Battlefield 2042 I've elected to only include a handful of cards from the most recent GPU families. This is because it just takes so long to load the game and then start a match and over half the time the weather would interfere with the results and require me to exit and restart. Even with that effort there's probably a 5% margin of error on these results but it at least gives a decent idea of what to expect.



Most users will want to stick to the high or medium presets particularly if you don't have more than 8GB of VRAM. Drop a note in the comments with other GPUs you'd like to see tested and if there's enough demand (meaning more than one person saying ""please test XYZ!"") I'll revisit the subject with more testing. But this isn't going into my regular benchmark suite as it took probably four times longer to test each GPU than on most other games with a built-in benchmark.



I've included results with DLSS Quality mode enabled on the Nvidia RTX GPUs as well which some might say is unfair but honestly the difference between native and DLSS Quality is very difficult to spot particularly when you're just playing the game. You could even opt for Balanced or Performance modes especially at 1440p and 4K and likely not notice. I'll have more to say regarding DLSS below.

Again in the interest of time I stopped after testing performance at the ultra preset as well as using ultra plus enabling RTAO. Every GPU tested managed more than 60 fps at 1080p ultra though cards like the RTX 2060 and RX 6600 XT might exhibit more stuttering in lengthier sessions. If you want 144 fps for a high refresh rate display only the RTX 3090 (and RTX 3080 Ti should perform about the same) and RX 6700 XT and above will suffice. Even with DLSS Nvidia's top GPUs can't catch AMD's offerings.



Enabling ray traced AO changes things up a bit. The Nvidia GPUs now lead AMD's equivalent (more or less) offerings. Nothing can achieve a steady 120 fps though never mind 144 or 240 fps. As a twitch-heavy shooter I suspect most Battlefield 2042 players will be more interested in dropping settings to improve their fps rather than adding slightly better shadows.

The fastest cards still handle 1440p quite well but VRAM becomes a factor on AMD's 8GB RX 6600 XT as well as the RTX 2060. CPU limitations are no longer a factor (except on the 6900 XT and RTX 3090) so provided your GPU has sufficient memory you get about 25% lower performance at 1440p ultra than at 1080p ultra. The RTX 3060 and above all still break 60 fps with room to spare while the RTX 3090 just barely averages 144 fps and the RX 6900 XT still has a bit of gas in its tank.



If you don't have enough VRAM like on the RX 6600 XT or RTX 2060… well performance can drop 75% to 90%. Oops. Don't run out of VRAM.



Enabling ray tracing and getting 60 fps or more is still possible on the RTX 3060 and above though minimums on many of the cards may drop below that mark. The RTX 2060 couldn't even think about providing reasonable performance at 1440p ultra with DXR (DirectX Raytracing) enabled but we did toss in the RX 6600 XT just for giggles. Again don't run out of VRAM.



I'm not sure why AMD's GPUs often seem to need more memory for equivalent settings than Nvidia's GPUs but it's probably internal delta color compression among other things. In Battlefield 2042 at least with the game ready AMD 21.11.2 and Nvidia 496.76 drivers we used for testing it seems like AMD's 8GB cards behave like Nvidia's 6GB cards and its 12GB cards more or less match the behavior of Nvidia's 8GB cards. There's probably more room for driver optimizations in other words. That or AMD's Infinity Cache is playing a big role.

Given what we've seen so far you'd expect a rough go of things at 4K ultra and that's what we get. The RTX 3060 Ti with DLSS and RX 6700 XT can break 60 fps but otherwise you'd want an RX 6800 or RTX 3080 or above. Technically the RTX 3070 and 3070 Ti should be fine as well but the 8GB does cause more hitching from time to time. 8GB on AMD's RX 6600 XT meanwhile delivered sub-20 fps results.



What about 4K with maxed out settings plus ray tracing? The RX 6900 XT and RTX 3090 still averaged more than 60 fps and DLSS Quality mode now proves more beneficial boosting performance to 95 fps. With DLSS enabled we expect the RTX 3080 and 3080 Ti would also provide a good experience. AMD's RX 6800 XT should be okay as well since it's typically only about 5% slower than the 6900 XT. But this is mostly an academic question as I'm sure few Battlefield 2042 players will opt for lower fps just to get a few ray traced shadows.

Battlefield 2042 DLSS Analysis

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We included DLSS Quality mode on the RTX cards for the testing above but here we've tested with just the RTX 3060 at 1080p and 1440p and tried out all four DLSS modes. Quality uses 2x upscaling (approximately) Balanced uses 3x upscaling Performance is 4x upscaling and Ultra-Performance goes whole hog with 9x upscaling. That means at 1080p it's actually upscaling a 640x360 resolution frame while at 1440p it upscales an 853x480 frame. Considering the low resolution source frames it's pretty impressive that the resulting images don't look absolutely awful!



The performance benefits of DLSS aren't as high in Battlefield 2042 as we've seen in other games. Maybe they'd be greater at 4K but most gamers still aren't using 4K displays. As we've mentioned in our best gaming monitors guide high refresh rate 1440p displays are still our favorite option and you can get G-Sync of FreeSync on most of them without paying a massive price premium. High refresh rate 4K displays cost more several times more money.



At 1080p other factors (CPU and just the additional overhead of DLSS) come into play so while Quality mode boosts performance by 11% Balanced mode only gets you 15% more than native performance and Performance and Ultra-Performance deliver 21% and 23% more performance than native respectively. The scaling is a bit better with 1440p: 15% in Quality mode 23% Balanced 31% Performance and 37% Ultra-Performance.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: DICE) Native Resolution (Image credit: DICE) DLSS Quality (Image credit: DICE) DLSS Balanced (Image credit: DICE) DLSS Performance (Image credit: DICE) DLSS Ultra-Performance

But we have to put things in perspective. Sure using DLSS Quality it's hard to spot the differences versus native rendering. Performance and Ultra-Performance? Not so much. We'd reserve Performance mode for 4K gaming and Ultra-Performance is mostly just a gimmick that might enable 8K at acceptable framerates in some games (but probably not in Battlefield 2042).



You could also skip DLSS and just use the game's built-in upscaling. It doesn't look nearly as good but the overhead is a lot lower.

Battlefield 2042 Ray Tracing

Image 1 of 6 (Image credit: DICE) Ray Tracing Off (Image credit: DICE) Ray Tracing On (Image credit: DICE) Ray Tracing Off (Image credit: DICE) Ray Tracing On (Image credit: DICE) Ray Tracing Off (Image credit: DICE) Ray Tracing On

We've talked already about how enabling ray tracing still causes a pretty severe performance hit especially on GPUs that run out of VRAM. AMD's RX 6900 XT still managed just fine and the other Navi 21 GPUs should be okay as well but AMD cards with 12GB or less memory and Nvidia GPUs with 8GB or less VRAM will probably want to leave it off.



You can see the above images showing several different areas of the Discarded map and the impact RTAO has on the visuals. Or rather the lack of impact. There's no denying on the crane images that RTAO looks far more correct than having it off and if every part of every map showed that much of a visual change we could make a good argument for RTAO.



But then the outdoor view of the shipping crate and walls only shows slightly darker shadows on the walls to the right and underneath the walls and bushes (frankly perhaps a bit too dark under the shrubbery) and the interior shot with the ship on stilts shows similarly minor differences.



And what the visuals don't show is that with ray tracing enabled even on a fast GPU there tend to be more stutters and slowdowns. They become less frequent after you've been running around an area for a bit but die and respawn elsewhere and they can crop up again.



For the minor improvement in visuals we just don't feel RTAO can be justified in a modern shooter. But then we'd also say the same of the minor improvements you can see when going from high to ultra quality. Using high with terrain quality at medium can boost performance 15% which is what most people would likely prefer.

Battlefield 2042 Closing Thoughts

(Image credit: DICE)

It's interesting to see the change in approach to ray tracing with Battlefield 2042. The previous Battlefield V used ray tracing just for reflections and I and many other reviewers pointed out that doing this is kind of the worst way to add ray tracing. It's really only in games that use multiple ray tracing effects that we really start to see the benefits in terms of image quality. But ray traced reflections still tends to be more useful than ray traced shadows… and yet Battlefield 2042 opted to do ray traced ambient occlusion which is a subset of shadows. It makes me want to shout ""We're going the wrong way!""



Fundamentally the problem is that a game like Battlefield 2042 benefits far more from high framerates than from improved visuals. I'm sure there are some people that will love running at maxed out settings with ray tracing just because they have a sufficiently powerful PC. In a few more years maybe even midrange PCs will be able to handle BF2042 with all the bells and whistles. But by then we'll have the next Battlefield installment to occupy our time.



I suspect EA had some sort of a deal with Nvidia where it had to include at least one ray tracing effect. DLSS support is more welcome though sadly it's version 2.2.18.0 at launch rather than the most recent 2.3.2 that includes some enhancements that get rid of the ghosting effect—one of the only real drawbacks to DLSS. Interestingly swapping DLLs actually didn't work for Battlefield 2042 (you can't enable DLSS after swapping DLLs) so either 2.3 has some different hooks or this particular game uses DLSS in a way that required tighter integration. Probably it's just a version check but either way we'd love to see it updated.



As it sits right now Battlefield 2042 doesn't feel radically different from previous games in the series. That's either good or bad depending on what you think of those games. The new 128-player mode on PC can feel a bit too crowded on some maps but 64-player mode can conversely feel a bit too unpopulated. In my playing so far though rarely did I encounter much in the way of solitude—which is part of what made testing performance in Battlefield 2042 such a complete slog.



If you'd like to see more GPUs tested let us know in the comments. For now hopefully these initial testing results will be sufficient to get you started. Or you know just use the medium or high preset and call it a day. That's what console players get."

Has Luxembourg experienced a significant shift towards remote work since the beginning of the pandemic? Looking at the countries motorways temptation certainly arises to say no!

With the progression of the vaccination campaign certain businesses and companies have already decided to make a full return to the office although this may be short-lived considering the grim predictions of the Covid-19 Task Force.

Others have in the meantime fully embraced home office culture although there was not really a chose with two lockdown periods being imposed last year. As the most recent report from the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (STATEC) dates back to June this year it is difficult to assess where exactly the country is standing at the moment.

STATEC did however find that remote work slowed down during the second trimester of the year. Nevertheless it remains considerably elevated with 41% of employees affected although the highest point ever was even higher at 52% reached during the second trimester of 2020 at the height of the pandemic.



Home office culture prior to the pandemic

Home office culture was already on the rise before the pandemic began. According to a STATEC report the number of employees working from home almost tripled in less than a decade increasing from 7% in 2010 to 20% in 2019.

Bianchini noted that ""remote work has become a top priority for present-day employees."" Although the recruitment agency also lacks clear statistics on the phenomenon they see that an increasing number of businesses offer home office hours and flexibility to their employees: ""This is a good thing given that more and more people start expecting it from their employers.""

It is clear that remote work can only be done in certain sectors and jobs but it remains a beneficial offer for employees: a greater balance between private and work life less stress in exchange for more efficiency as well as a reduced carbon footprint due to fewer commuting hours.

Jean-Paul Olinger director of the Union of Luxembourg Enterprises (UEL) also commented on the trend: ""Home office culture will remain an essential part of work life even after the pandemic but certainly to a lesser extend. Despite the undeniable advantages for employees there are also certainly risks for companies like teams losing their harmony or new recruits failing to fully integrate.""





Future aspirations

Bianchini is convinced that home office will maintain or even increase in importance next year: ""There are numerous candidates and they deserve an interesting offer."" In our day and age the attractiveness of a position is just as much defined by flexibility as it is by salary.

For cross-border workers the maximum number of home office days per year has also increased over the course of the pandemic. Belgians gained ten days (from 24 to 34) while the French gained five (from 29 to 34).

While surpassing this limit means that salaries are taxed in an employees country of residence this has not stopped people from considering the pros and cons of the switch. Bianchini explained: ""Since the beginning of the pandemic many employees are willing to consider the advantages of remote work to increase their quality of life over higher salaries. By refusing this level of flexibility companies risk losing committed employees or talented recruits.""

Once-mighty conglomerates have been shrinking for decades and last week ""one of the biggest survivors waved the surrender flag"" said David Nicklaus at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. In spinning off its medical and energy businesses General Electric was dismantling an empire that had loomed over U.S. business since 1892. Shortly after Toshiba based in ""conglomerate-loving Japan"" and Johnson & Johnson said they were splitting up their sprawling entities too. These economies of scale make sense ""when buying office supplies or accounting services but their layers of bureaucracy"" come with a cost. Some companies still cling to this model like 3M which ""makes 60000 products ranging from Scotch tape to medical software."" Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been ""a longtime investor darling"" but its portfolio includes ""an electric utility a railroad insurance and chocolate."" The Buffett-GE model ""was all the rage in corporate boardrooms."" Now it's ancient history.

We hear conglomerates are dead every few years said Brooke Masters at the Financial Times. That's because the history of conglomerates is cyclical. First giants — ITT and Tyco are examples — grow by acquisition then they come apart. After it ""becomes conventional wisdom that conglomerates need to be broken up we end up with companies so specialized that somebody decides there is merit"" in being all-encompassing and the cycle starts again. Resist the temptation to make too much out of GE's demise said Brooke Sutherland at Bloomberg. That's ""a cautionary tale"" about how ""hodgepodge omnidirectional growth and size for size's sake"" can go terribly wrong. But a ""key tenet of the modern conglomerate is continuous reinvention and a willingness to pivot."" That philosophy has benefited other ""reimagined conglomerates"" such as Honeywell and Roper Technologies.

What kills conglomerates is ""the myth that great management can always work miracles"" said Jason Zweig at The Wall Street Journal. ITT first ""popularized the idea that hundreds of elite managers"" could provide expertise on a wide range of subjects. GE under iconic CEO Jack Welch elevated ""management to a kind of science"" with its ""leadership institute"" in New York's Hudson Valley. But ""by the early 2000s the company was spending $1 billion a year on training."" GE became complacent in the belief that ""management technology would always save"" it.

A new incarnation of the model seems alive and well said Matthew Boyle at Bloomberg. The giants of yesterday have been replaced by what University of Michigan business professor Jerry Davis calls ""neo-conglomerates"" such as Amazon which sells everything from groceries to corporate cloud-computing services. This ""new breed fueled by coders and cheap capital now command the same awe and respect in management and investor circles as Welch's GE did in the 1980s."" What they do better than GE is ""skate quickly to where the profit is whether that's automation social commerce sustainability or even the much-hyped metaverse.""

London CNN Business —

For months there have been warnings to shoppers: Get through your holiday to-do list early. Wait until Black Friday or later and you may not be able to find what you want.

But as stores prepare for the peak of the most important season for retailers bigger companies are starting to send a different message: You may not have to worry about empty shelves after all.

What’s happening: Anxious about huge shipping delays large chains have been stocking up on products for months. Some like Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST) have been chartering their own ships to travel from production hubs in Asia while others have been leveraging long-term relationships with suppliers to get what they need.

“The availability of inventory is going to be better at the large well-positioned retailers who either have more scale or flexibility to navigate through these challenges or they’ll be viewed as preferential partners for their vendors” UBS analyst Michael Lasser told me.

Walmart’s inventory levels rose 11.5% during its most recent quarter compared with a year ago the company said last week while Target’s inventory levels increased 18%. TJX (TJX) said its inventory has climbed a more modest 4%.

“Most of the inventory we need for the holiday season has already been delivered to us or is scheduled to arrive in stores and online in time for the holidays” TJX CEO Ernie Herrman told analysts last week.

These companies have faced higher costs to secure hot items. But unlike some competitors they can afford to pay more when needed.

Not everyone has gotten it right. Ross Stores (ROST) said that despite chartering an ocean vessel it had some concerns about getting merchandise in time for the holidays due to clogged ports.

Victoria’s Secret also said that nearly 50% of its holiday merchandise is stuck in transit as Black Friday approaches. The company is trying to rely on planes to deliver merchandise but it may be too late. Compared to this time last year the retailer has 30% less pajama sets a popular gift item.

Lasser said the US companies struggling the most are those that import a larger share of their products from overseas. Walmart he noted sources two-thirds of its goods domestically which helps insulate them from issues at ports.

Then there’s smaller retailers which can’t just throw money at the problem. They could fall even further behind the biggest players in the coming weeks.

The gap “has been widening for years” Lasser said. “I would expect that to continue to be the case this holiday season.”

Casting doubt on Covid’s ‘Great Migration’

The “Great Migration” may not be as pronounced as once thought.

The US Census Bureau recently released data showing that migration activity has fallen to its lowest rate in more than 70 years my CNN Business colleague Alicia Wallace reports. The findings toss some cold water on anecdotes that Americans were relocating more than ever during the pandemic.

From 2020 to 2021 nearly 27.1 million Americans or 8.4% of the US population reported living in a different residence than the year prior. That’s down from 9.3% the previous year. The migration rate has been falling steadily since 2014.

Rethinking the narrative: There might not have been a massive overall trend of people moving across the country. But net migration out of urban neighborhoods did climb during the early stages of the pandemic said Stephan D. Whitaker a policy economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland who has been closely studying migration patterns.

“Flows of migrants out of high-cost large metro areas did increase during the pandemic” Whitaker said. “However many other types of moves both long distance and local declined. Summing all these moves reveals that overall fewer people relocated during the first year of the pandemic.”

Whitaker has found that some outflows from high-cost metro areas continued through spring 2021 as people relocated to smaller cities nearby and fast-growing destinations like Las Vegas and Nashville.

At the same time people started returning to large cities — though not enough to replace those who had left.

The reopening of the border on Nov. 8 for fully vaccinated tourists came just in time for the beginning of the winter holidays one of the biggest shopping seasons of the year.

“We have been eagerly preparing for our Mexican customers to buy in our stores again because we have missed them so much” said Erica Contreras marketing director of The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo a shopping center next to one of the three international bridges that link this city with Nuevo Laredo on the Mexican side.

Just in this shopping center located a few meters from the international border Mexican shoppers who cross the border with a tourist visa represent 95% of its sales. People can cross on foot and bring their shopping bags back to Mexico walking too.

“It was hard to stay in business [during travel restrictions] but we hope to emerge stronger in the coming weeks as traffic normalizes” said Contreras. “We’re waiting for you with open arms.”

María Guadalupe López traveled from Monterrey Mexico to visit her family and shop in Laredo.

“Before the pandemic I used to come every month and now this is the first time that I cross since 2020” said López. “I think it’s great that they’ve opened the border again because coming here [to Laredo] is something natural for us we do it all the time.”

Mexico is Texas’ main economic partner not only because of its large exports but because of the hundreds of thousands of Mexicans who cross the border on foot with a car or by bus to shop in one of the cities along Interstate 35 like Laredo San Antonio San Marcos Austin or Dallas.

“Throughout the border between Texas and Mexico more than 230000 people cross the ports of entry into the United States every day to work go to school shop go on vacation or have dinner at local restaurants” said José Iván Rodríguez a researcher for Rice University’s Baker Institute Center for the United States and Mexico. “The majority of these people are Mexican. They represent an important source of business for counties in the Texas border.”

The economic losses during the almost 20 months of border restrictions represented billions of dollars for Texas.

Mexican shoppers travel to the United States to buy essential day-to-day items at stores like Walmart or Target and discount clothing at stores such as Ross or Burlington but also to shop for luxury items from brands like Michael Kors Prada or Gucci. They do it because prices are more affordable even in dollars and because the quality of the products is better they said.

A gradual return to normal

The cities of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo want to return to their usual binational dynamic that had a life of its own until March 2020 when restrictions were first set.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection had warned that the first few days of the reopening were going to be met with long wait times to cross the border but that did not happen last week.

Everything indicates that recovery will be gradual and will likely reach an important peak in the coming weeks with the holiday season approaching.

“What we are doing is making sure that Mexican shoppers come and spend their money” said U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar D-Laredo on the day of the reopening. “The U.S. has probably lost around $30 billion because Mexicans were not crossing.”

On the first weekend since the border reopened parking lots of shopping centers and restaurants were busier. Although not all of the customers were Mexican employees agreed that it was evident that a lot more tourists were visiting.

Downtown where many businesses are closed it seems like recovery will take more time.

“Many businesses were affected especially those that depended on Mexican shoppers in downtown Laredo” Pete Saenz mayor of the city said during a ceremony to welcome international travelers. “From a local perspective 30 or 40% of sales taxes come from Mexican shoppers who visit our community throughout the year.”

For Gerald Schwebel executive vice president of IBC Bank’s International Corporate Division the last 20 months have devastated entire areas of the border with Mexico so the United States must welcome those who come for nonessential purposes.

“The Mexican shopper has been an integral part of the economic vitality of border communities in Texas” said Schwebel. “Those who work and live on the border say that we are ‘one city in two countries’ because we share family culture and business bonds.”

For the first time in 20 months

Early in the morning María Dolores Alemán left her home in Nuevo Laredo to cross to Laredo with her four daughters and visit stores they used to frequent until before the pandemic.

“We want to go buy a lot of things. We got excited when the reopening was announced and we were thinking for many days where we were going to go” said Alemán. “Things are cheaper and better here they last longer like shoes for school or clothes.”

Mexican residents Rossy Perez (left) 51 Eva Contreras (center) 66 and Ceci Perez 52 took a self-portrait near the border crossing into Mexico after shopping in Laredo on Nov. 13. This was the first time that they crossed into the U.S. after the border opened for tourists traveling by land. It was closed for more than a year-and-a-half due to the pandemic.

Mexicans who cross the Rio Grande to shop in the U.S. pay an average of $20.20 pesos for every dollar which can become an expensive trip for families. However quality and cheaper products justify the expense for many.

“We’ve had more customers but not so many because there’s no money in Mexico” said Carmen Reyes a store manager at an accessory store in Laredo. “Even if people want to cross if they don’t have money to spend they can’t come there’s no way.”

In the streets of downtown Laredo closed businesses are a common sight. There are streets where it seems the city is a ghost town. Where there used to be dresses or electronics on display now there are only closed curtains or windows covered with boards.

“We’ve lived through everything here even [peso] devaluations but nothing has hit us like this” said Martha Castillo an employee at a store that is located just a few yards from the border. “I think that the situation is not yet solved we’re still in crisis but it will eventually get better.”

Stores big and small that stayed open had to come up with strategies to attract customers.

The outlet centers and other shopping centers are promoting music festivals and coupons are being given to Mexican shoppers who visit their stores something unusual in this type of establishment.

“There are a lot more people here now than in previous weeks. The difference is noticeable since the border was reopened” said María Olivares manager at a crafts store in The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo. “My sales have gone up it’s like people are very excited and they really wanted to come and buy and spend their money.”

Shopping for luxury brands

Travelers with the possibility to drive further north tend to shop at Tanger Outlets San Marcos and San Marcos Premium Outlets where they can shop luxury brands.

Traveling to these outlet stores is a sort of tradition among middle-class Mexican shoppers from the northern states of Mexico that border Texas.

Shoppers make the trip in their own vehicles or in tour company vehicles that organize trips from cities like Monterrey Monclova Torreón or Saltillo.

Traveling from Monterrey Ivette de la Fuente arrived to shop at outlet stores in San Marcos after a six-hour drive. She did it in hopes to resume the Christmas shopping ritual that she had for many years before the pandemic.

“This is the Christmas shopping trip we used to come very frequently and we had to stop because of the pandemic” De la Fuente said. “They just opened the border and we have to take advantage so we have already been to the stores and we’ve been staying here all weekend.”

With his travels Sergio Montañez said he noticed that the economy in Texas was still active while in Mexico it remained stagnant.

“You can see the difference more than other times in the economy of the two countries” Montañez said. “Here they are attracting consumers and you can even see it in the short wait times to cross because now they are much more accessible.”

In some brand stores such as Coach or Gucci some people waited in line for their turn to shop. In those lines Spanish was the predominant language spoken.

“You can’t find this in Mexico at this price” said Ramiro Cuéllar who traveled by car from Monterrey and was waiting in line for his turn to shop at Coach. “The truth is that we did need to come to buy clothes because in Mexico good things are very very expensive.”

The outlets in San Marcos were full on Nov. 14 but although thousands visited the stores a greater recovery is still expected once Mexican shoppers resume their frequent trips.

“I would dare to say that 98% of my clients are Mexican” said Daniel Soriano manager of Perfumes 4U at Tanger Outlets San Marcos. “It has been very difficult to stay afloat but we have succeeded and are very happy waiting for customers with open arms.”

Merchants in the area are also expecting a boom in sales to begin this week with Black Friday sales kicking off the 2021 holiday season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDIyNDMyMS9KaWdzYXdzLXN1cHBsaWVycy1maWxlLWNsYWltcy00N20tY2hhaW5zLXJlc3RydWN0dXJlLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9tYXJrZXRzL2FydGljbGUtMTAyMjQzMjEvYW1wL0ppZ3Nhd3Mtc3VwcGxpZXJzLWZpbGUtY2xhaW1zLTQ3bS1jaGFpbnMtcmVzdHJ1Y3R1cmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jigsaw's suppliers file claims for £47m after chain's restructure,"Short-changed: Jigsaw triggered an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement in summer 2020

Jigsaw's suppliers have filed claims for £47million after the fashion chain's restructure last year...more than £1million for each store it has in operation.

The company – owned by Carphone Warehouse tycoon David Ross and which once employed the Duchess of Cambridge – triggered an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement in summer 2020.

It closed stores after creditors agreed to the proposal in the heat of the pandemic. It now has 40 shops. But new documents lay bare the financial pain felt by suppliers.

They show that Jigsaw has agreed to set aside just £1.5million to pay creditors that were short-changed by the insolvency.

Another fund has been created to reimburse creditors further if the firm achieves profit of more than £6.5million by January 2025.

Ross 56 co-founded Carphone Warehouse with Charles Dunstone and is worth an estimated £676million.

He acquired Jigsaw in 2018 but has said little about his purchase since then. Last month Jigsaw said profit – before interest tax depreciation and amortisation – reached £1.8million in the six months since stores reopened in April this year.

That compared to a full-year loss of £21million in the financial year to January.

In a statement chief executive Beth Butterwick said: 'We are confident and optimistic about Jigsaw's future and are pleased to see Jigsaw's improved performance and profitability. We believe we are perfectly poised for future growth as an aspirational British premium brand accessible across multiple channels.'

There have been rumours the beleaguered chain has recently received approaches from potential buyers. Last night a spokesman said: 'As a much-loved British fashion brand and in the midst of a successful transformation Jigsaw will always have suitors.'",,,,,,

How the Tragedy Happened

Animal-protection activists said the animals' death is ""shocking and tragic"" calling on Spain's Wamos Air to stop transporting animals for tests.

This year the airline transported many shipments of monkeys from Asia to the United States for laboratory tests.

According to information sent to the Action for Primates (AfP) organization the tragedy occurred on Sunday as the holiday charter plane was transporting 720 long-tailed macaques as cargo on a trip from Cambodia to Houston.

Although the exact number of deaths is unknown it is believed that others suffered greatly as well.

As per the informant in Spain the monkeys were flown for a total of 24 hours including a six-hour halt in Tbilisi Georgia which included a three-hour delay. Additionally the primates were driven for hours between airports.

Long-tailed macaques are the most widely trafficked non-human primate species in testing with the United States being a major importers and users for study. US imports of them from Cambodia increased by 82.8 percent last year from 8571 in 2019 to 15664.

What Might Have Caused the Monkeys' Death?

Monkeys are transported on aircraft in tiny transit containers that are often too small for them to stand in and are regarded as cargo.

According to activists the animals are subjected to poor ventilation new and loud sounds and temperature and humidity fluctuations. Animals may get sick or die during transport which is exacerbated by route delays.

Sarah Kite the co-founder of Action for Primates said the tragedy reveals the horrific truth of the suffering inherent in the transportation of these intelligent and sensitive individuals.

It is just not feasible to keep nonhuman primates in tiny containers away from familiar environments and move them around the globe without inflicting significant anguish physical and psychological suffering.

It is high time for Wamos Air to join the growing number of airlines that have publicly declared their opposition to the worldwide trafficking of monkeys for research Kite said.

According to Ms Kite worry and stress in primates during flights may result in infections and the beginning of illness that may stay dormant until the animals get to their destination.

Guidelines of the International Primatological Society

According to Action for Primates the conditions violate the International Primatological Society's guidelines which state that animals' welfare physical behavioral and psychological needs should be met to the greatest extent possible while allowing them to express normal behavior patterns including foraging.

Ms Kite said that the artificial atmosphere was a stark contrast to their woodland habitats' luxuriant vegetation.

Wamos refused to comment on the fatalities directing The Independent to the laboratory that performed the tests.

The airline located in Madrid and a part of the Miami-based Royal Caribbean Group has faced repeated criticism from animal-welfare organizations this year for transporting macaques for laboratory testing.

Envigo which is believed to be the facility that imported the newest monkeys does toxicological testing but claims to employ animals only when no alternative is available or when study is required. The Independent reached out to Envigo for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.

According to the US NGO Rise for Animals the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that four monkeys died upon arrival and 75 others died under quarantine in the US last year.

He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

No tackle no foul no intervention whatsoever. He just fell over. He would not have his goal. He would not be the hero. But he had at least provided a pitch-perfect allegory: not only for the seven years that he has spent at his hometown club but also for the lavish transformative and deeply flawed project he has come to represent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtc3RhdGUtZmxhZy1kaXNwbGF5LzYwMDM2NTI3MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laser loon lives: The second life of Minnesota state flag(s),"Not everything Minnesotans ran up the flagpole on Statehood Day was the new state flag.

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

Minnesota hasn't quite realized Herold's dream of one flag we can all rally behind.

""Reminder"" Gov. Tim Walz posted on social media on Friday. ""Minnesota's new official state flag will be raised for the first time tomorrow.""

While participating in the on-field drills at the NFL Combine Oladapo suffered a broken toe. He had surgery on it a few weeks before the draft and the hope is that he will be good to go for training camp in August.

However in the meantime while Oladapo will still be involved in the team meetings he’s not going to have the opportunity to apply what he’s learning in the practice field.

An offer for Packers fans For the best local Wisconsin news sports entertainment and culture coverage subscribe to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. $1 for 6 months

“Just staying in the training room getting the swelling down getting my range of motion back” said Oladapo. “And then just staying locked in mental reps on the sideline and then meet with the coaches after make sure I get the game plan.”

Not that Oladapo will have the same fate as Grant DuBose – Oladapo’s path to contributing as a rookie is much more clear – but we saw just last offseason how an injury during this time of the year derailed any sort of roster push DuBose was hoping to make. He didn’t return to the practice field until mid-August and was playing catch up at that point.

At a minimum Oladapo figures to be a core special teams player for the Packers. Defensively while versatile like Javon Bullard and Evan Williams Oladapo fills more of the traditional safety role as GM Brian Gutekunst described it able to fill both the “free and strong safety role” who can also line up as the “big nickel Sam linebacker.”

“As we can move him around more” said defensive backs coach Ryan Downard “the walk throughs are going to become vital because these guys you teach them what you can but until you go out and do it and walk through it that’s to me where the real learning takes place.

“You can sit in a classroom and learn something but until you either have to teach it back or you take them out there physically let them walk through it that’s I think where the growth takes place.”

Downard added that Oladapo’s intelligence and football IQ will help him stay up to speed throughout this process. Downard liked what he saw from him during rookie minicamp and made sure to fire questions Oladapo’s way to keep him engaged.

The addition of Oladapo – along with Bullard and Williams – provides that interchangability that GM Brian Gutekunst was looking for at the position. Increased versatility at the position opens up the playbook for Jeff Hafley from a game-planning perspective and makes it more difficult for opposing offenses pre-snap not knowing who will have what responsibility.

Another element that these three players bring is speed and physicality. Along with finding the right players from a schematic standpoint there is a certain play-style that the Packers want to have under Hafley.

“I’m comfortable anywhere on the field” said Oladapo. “Whatever the team needs me to do: be in the box be in the post blitz guard tight ends guard slots. I can do it all. I feel comfortable just having my two feet on the grass.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovLzI0N3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vY29sbGVnZS9jb2xvcmFkby9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbG9yYWRvLWZvb3RiYWxsLXJlY3J1aXRpbmctZm9ybWVyLW1pYW1pLWFuZC1mb3JtZXItdmFuZGVyYmlsdC1zYWZldHktc2F2aW9uLXJpbGV5LWNvbW1pdHMtdG8tYnVmZmFsb2VzLTIzMTY3MTE0NS_SAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly8yNDdzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UvY29sb3JhZG8vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb2xvcmFkby1mb290YmFsbC1yZWNydWl0aW5nLWZvcm1lci1taWFtaS1hbmQtZm9ybWVyLXZhbmRlcmJpbHQtc2FmZXR5LXNhdmlvbi1yaWxleS1jb21taXRzLXRvLWJ1ZmZhbG9lcy0yMzE2NzExNDUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Miami and former Vanderbilt S Savion Riley goes Buff,"Former Miami and former Vanderbilt safety Savion Riley will add some much needed competition on the back end of Colorado's secondary.

The Gilman will apparently endure for a couple more years as the construction offices for the headquarters project after a construction management firm acquires it in the coming days (Pickard Chilton). CLICK IMAGES TO ENLARGE THEM

Gilman Building gets new use for next 2 years

With an anticipated sale of the Gilman Building closing this week Sherwin-Williams’ (SHW) global headquarters development team expects to gain its own HQ of sorts in the form of a construction office over the next two years. But the long-term future of this five-story modernist-clad Victorian-era building at 1350 W. 3rd St. in downtown Cleveland is uncertain.

Two sources close to the SHW HQ project informed NEOtrans of the impending sale of the Gilman Building and that the transaction would close Thanksgiving week. Representatives of the buyer Akron-based Welty Building Co. and the seller Cleveland-based Realife Real Estate Group did not deny the imminent transaction; but they would not comment on it either.

Welty in a joint venture with the Gilbane Building Co. is SHW’s global HQ’s construction manager. A groundbreaking ceremony for the $300-plus-million-dollar project was due to be held Nov. 16 but was pushed back about two months due to unspecified scheduling conflicts according to Julie Young SHW’s vice president of global corporate communications.

At 2 p.m. Nov. 30 the Cleveland City Planning Commission will hold a Special Joint Committee and Commission meeting to review final plans for SHW’s HQ project. This is the third in a series of three meetings with the Landmarks Commission Cleveland City Planning Commission Downtown Flats Design Review Committee and Historic Downtown Cleveland Design Review Committee to review the project.

Photographed in October the Gilman Building stands at 1350 W. 3rd St. in downtown Cleveland’s Warehouse District. Although designed with Victorian flair by noted architect John Edelman and built in 1882 the structure was modernized in the late 1960s and renovated again by Stark Enterprises in 2007 (KJP).

Terms of the Gilman Building’s pending sale are not yet known. However Welty and its law firm Brouse McDowell LPA created a new company in September called 1350 W III LLC to acquire and hold the 0.085-acre property the sources said. They also said the 18000-square-foot Gilman would serve as the construction management offices and document repository for SHW HQ project whose first phase is expected to continue for about two years.

The 1882-built Gilman Building was modernized in the late-1960s and again in the 2000s. It is also the only building still standing on the so-called Superblock bounded by Superior and St. Clair avenues plus West 3rd and West 6th streets. It is also the only Superblock property SHW has been unable to acquire for its proposed HQ complex and supportive developments.

The sources said SHW has tried in vain to acquire the Gilman so it could knock the structure down to create development-ready sites around the perimeter of its downtown HQ campus along St. Clair and West 6th. Sources said there have been debates about where and how to provide temporary construction offices in trailers and offer enough parking for construction workers. Using the Gilman addresses many of those issues the sources said.

Comparing the Sherwin-Williams HQ site plans from last summer (at left) to now reveals the most significant change — a reduction in the footprint size and increase in the height of the 920-space parking garage. A conceptual development is shown in the left image but omitted from the newer image to show only what SHW intends to build. The new parking garage design avails more space for perimeter development along St. Clair Avenue. The Gilman Building is visible in both images at St. Clair and West 3rd Street with parking and trash receptacle space provided for it (Pickard Chilton).

So does a design change to the HQ project’s parking facility. The SHW HQ’s development team redesigned a proposed four-level 920-space parking garage making it one level taller and shrinking its footprint while still offering the same number of parking spaces.

Not only did the garage’s redesign satisfy the City Planning Commission‘s request for a taller parking garage but it also allows for more surface parking prior to the garage’s availability. The commission sought a skinnier garage to open up more of the HQ site’s perimeter for spin-off development. It was not done in response to any prospective developers’ feedback as none have yet been engaged the sources added.

Although a sale amount wasn’t communicated recent transactions involving the Gilman may provide some insight. In 2007 Stark Enterprises acquired the property (then called the Titanic Building) for $1.3 million to be its new HQ. In late 2018 affiliates of Stark Enterprises and Realife entered into a mortgage in which Stark lent $1.65 million to Realife and awarded it a deed to the Gilman county records show.

Another notable change from SHW’s HQ design package it submitted to the city of Cleveland last summer (at left) versus the final version is how perceives the scale of perimeter development seen here from the northwest corner of St. Clair Avenue and West 6th Street in the Warehouse District. The parking garage was also redesigned SHW’s HQ tower was added and the Johnnie Walker billboard on the side of the Gilman Building was removed in the newer version (Pickard Chilton).

Realife had tried to sell the Gilman to SHW and reportedly wanted to be paid handsomely for it the sources said. SHW wanted the building but not for Realife’s asking price. So the Fortune 500 company apparently tried to play hardball with the small real estate firm.

In March the corporate giant sent a cease and desist letter to Realife telling it to stop using a tiny neighboring sliver of SHW’s property for a trash receptacle and a parking space. SHW soon placed concrete barriers and fencing to prevent Realife from using that small piece of land which is separated by a guardrail from the rest of SHW’s property. Realife filed a complaint in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court claiming it has a prescriptive easement to use the land through adverse possession — basically squatter’s rights.

To achieve squatter’s rights under Ohio law a property would need to be considered abandoned by the deed holder for an extended period of time and that the current user has been using it productively for at least 21 years.

Kohan Retail Investment Group of Great Neck New York has purchased the mall in a foreclosure sale for $55 million reports the Philadelphia Business Journal.

The sale brings to a close a saga overshadowing the regional mall.

Kohan Retail Investment Group of Great Neck New York has purchased Montgomery Mall in a foreclosure sale for $55 million reports the Philadelphia Business Journal.

The sale price is 95% of the property’s appraised value as of August of $57.5 million. In 2014 the mall had been appraised at $195 million or $176 a square foot.

A Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas judge signed an order approving the sale to Montgomery Mall Realty Holdings which is the entity Kohan used to to purchase the 1.1-million-square-foot property located in North Wales reports PBJ.com.

The property fits into Kohan's retail focus. In addition to two hotels in New York City Kohan owns a portfolio of 50 similar second-tier malls across the country including several in Pennsylvania such as Wyoming Valley Mall Washington Crown Center and Lycoming Mall.

The sale brings to a close a saga overshadowing the regional mall that began in August 2020 when a $100 million loan backed by the property was nearing default. By last November an entity affiliated with Simon Property Group which owned the mall notified the special servicer overseeing that loan that it was ""unwilling to inject additional funds into [the] loan but is willing to manage [the] property” according to a monthly report that tracks CMBS loans.

A bad snap on a punt led to prime real estate for the Illini. Illinois scored on a field goal extending its lead to 10-0 early in the first quarter.

On the ensuing kickoff however Iowa's special teams made history. Weaving through would-be tacklers Jones took the kickoff and returned it 100 yards for a touchdown — which tied for the longest kick return touchdown in Hawkeye history.

Jones' touchdown sparked 14 straight Hawkeye points as Arland Bruce IV scored on a run early in the second quarter giving Iowa a 14-10 lead.

Saturday marked Iowa's first kickoff return touchdown since Ihmir Smith-Marsette took one to the house against USC in the 2019 Holiday Bowl.

Jones' score marked the fourth 100-yard kickoff return in school history joining C.J. Jones (2003) Joe Williams (1961) and George Rice (1951).

Camilla made the comments on the flight home from the Middle East where she and Charles spent four days celebrating the culture heritage and achievements of Jordan and Egypt.

The duchess described this week's trip as ""quite tough"" with royal tours conducted on behalf of the government usually featuring busy schedules and covering thousands of miles.

She said the highlight of the pair's trip to the Middle East was their visit to the site near the River Jordan where John the Baptist was said to have baptised Jesus describing it as a ""spiritual"" moment.

Speaking on Voyager the ministerial jet before it landed on Friday she said of the Middle East tour: ""It was quite tough we were driving a lot and it was pretty bumpy.""

A remarking on her previous visit to Egypt with Charles soon after they married she added: ""But afterwards I think OK 16 years ago I'm a lot older now well into my 70s but to quote Richard Ingram 'we've still got a snap in our celery'.""

Following their 2005 marriage the duchess has travelled on trips to spots across the world including Colombia and the Galapagos Islands to Jamaica Mexico and New Zealand in support of the UK.

On Thursday she and Charles toured the pyramids at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo and also posed for pictures in front of the Sphinx.

She added: ""We are not on holiday we might be dressed up and photographed against the pyramids like tourists but we are not on holiday. We are working for the government and country and we are trying to make a difference.""

Prince Charles' life hasn't been the same since meeting Camilla Duchess of Cornwall but her life was never the same either. Camilla and the Prince of Wales had fallen in love meaning she would have to assume royal duties if she were to be given a royal title and act as a member of the British royal family opposite her now-husband. The two married in 2005 per Town & Country but now may be headed for more work than ever.

Since Queen Elizabeth II is 95 years old and Charles is the heir to the throne the two are already picking up slack in royal duties including their current royal tour. However some royal experts have speculated that Charles becoming king won't be easy for Camilla. Still Camilla continues to earn her place as a solid member of the royal family. The Duchess and Prince of Wales have even helped to fight climate change and part of their current tour has seen the royals using green fuel in their jets per Express.

Over the past eight years Ann has created an enterprise IT function that operates with agility using a product and portfolio model while also leveraging a partner network that allows Southern Glazer’s to expand to meet business needs while modernizing and integrating its infrastructure and legacy systems and growing the business through digital innovation.

The Professional Voyage

Ann’s career in technology began with companies like EDS and IBM which laid her technological foundation. She considers herself fortunate to work with great companies fantastic leaders and capable teams that presented her with opportunities for tremendous learning and growth.

Early in her career Ann moved into the consumer products industry with a focus on the beverage industry where she used transformational leadership expertise working with high growth companies during times of acquisitions where opportunities were abundant. She was often tapped for the roles that were integral to the business’s success with tight timelines to deliver.

Fast-paced environments allowed Ann to embrace new opportunities to learn and collaborate which is why she decided to join Southern (now Southern Glazer’s) in 2013. In addition to modernizing and integrating core business systems as part of the merger she has also enabled the digitization of the business and partner relationships while implementing a cyber program focused on managing risk—all key objectives of delivering business value for the company its supplier partners and customers.

Ann had great mentors and sponsors that helped her along the way. She now provides her team opportunities to learn and grow while mentoring future leaders including promoting diversity inclusion and belonging. She also spends time giving back to the communities with a focus on building a diverse talent pipeline for the future.

The Overview

Southern Glazer’s mission is to exceed the expectations of its supplier partners and customers with outstanding sales service and business results through innovative strategies unmatched relationships and cutting-edge technology through the industry’s best trained and most talented team.

Southern Glazer’s built its culture on FAMILY with a team that thinks and acts like owners reflecting core values of respect transparency excellence integrity inclusiveness and leadership in everything it does while recognizing that people are its greatest asset.

Ann states that technology is always changing and evolving so the opportunities are limitless. The key is to offer technology solutions that have a direct correlation to business value. She says “Knowing what you are trying to solve and applying new technologies to address what are often age-old problems can lead to great results. It’s important to constantly challenge the status quo not fearing failure and recognizing that often the greatest lessons come from turning failures into success.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTMwNjktNGItYWR2YW5jZWQtbnVjbGVhci1wb3dlci1wbGFudC1zZXQtZm9yLWZvcm1lci13eW8tY29hbC1zaXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$4B Advanced Nuclear Power Plant Set for Former Wyo. Coal Site,"TerraPower LLC the design startup backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates has chosen to build a demonstration of its 345-MW Natrium advanced nuclear reactor in Kemmerer Wyo. near the Naughton two-unit coal-fired plant that is set to close in 2025 the firm said Nov. 17 citing an estimated $4-billion project cost.

The firm and its partners had previously narrowed the project location to four set-to-retire coal plant sites in the state for what it said earlier this year would be a $1-billion demonstration project. Sites in Gillette Glenrock and Rock Springs also were considered.

TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque said that the first plant is always more expensive without offering further details behind the quadrupling cost. The company hopes to cut the price of future Natrium facilities at the other former coal plaint sites in Wyoming and elsewhere in the U.S. if built to $1 billion he said.

The U.S. Energy Dept. which has called the Natrium sodium-cooled reactors ""the future of advanced nuclear reactor technology” has a seven-year agreement to provide $2 billion in project development funding. The recently signed infrastructure bill contains a $2.5-billion funding allocation for all advanced reactor demonstrations some of which will be added to previous support.

TerraPower will match all federal funding for the demonstration. Bechtel is managing project design licensing procurement and construction. It built the Naughton coal-fired plant which opened in 1963. The nuclear plant is expected to create about 2000 construction jobs TerraPower said.

Wyoming produced about 39% of all coal mined in the U.S. in 2019 with coal-fired power plants making up about 80% of its electricity generation in 2020. However wind power made up 12% of state power generation last year with natural gas-fired power plants and hydroelectric facilities producing the rest.

Bechtel also leads a team that includes GE-Hitachi and TerraPower picked last year by Battelle Energy Alliance which operates DOE's Idaho National Laboratory to design and build at the Idaho Falls research site the first phase of the planned Versatile Test Reactor research facility that will develop advanced nuclear fuels materials instruments and sensors.

Site Choice Factors

The project team evaluated Wyoming site options using several factors including access to existing infrastructure the physical characteristics of the site community support and the ability to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The selection still is subject to completing definitive agreements and permitting and licensing support TerraPower said.

Natrium technology includes a 345-MW sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system the first advanced reactor to do so Levesque said. Energy storage can boost plant output to 500 MW for about five-and-a-half hours which allows it to follow daily load changes and helps with easier integration of renewable resources.

Natrium is a joint technology of GE Hitachi and TerraPower which Gates founded and serves as chairman.

With the site chosen advanced plant design will move ahead. A construction permit has been submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with work not expected to start until 2024.

The demonstration project when completed by 2028 will be a fully functioning commercial powerplant to be operated by Rocky Mountain Power which will use existing energy infrastructure including connections to the power grid said Gary Hoogeveen power company president and CEO in a press briefing.

It is one of two non-water-cooled small nuclear-reactor demonstrations supported by DOE. More than 20 companies are developing advanced reactors including Westinghouse Holtec International NuScale Power and X-energy.

TerraPower touts its molten chloride fast-reactor technology as applicable to industries with high energy consumption. It operates at higher temperatures than conventional reactors generates more electricity without emissions and can help industries reach decarbonization goals the company said.

Separately power company Southern Co. announced Nov. 18 that it signed an agreement with DOE to demonstrate what it said is the world's first fast-spectrum salt reactor in collaboration with TerraPower and Idaho National Laboratory. The facility would be built at that research site.

Project team member also include CORE POWER Orano Federal Services the Electric Power Research Institute and 3M Co. DOE will provide a grant to cover 80% of the $170-million project with the rest funded by Southern and the other partners.

The prototype which uses a different reactor design than TerrraPower's Wyoming plant could be adapted to support a 720-MW commercial scale reactor Southern Co. says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbXV0aWdlcnMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMS8yMC9mb290YmFsbC1wb3N0Z2FtZS1wcmVzcy1jb25mZXJlbmNlLW5vdi0yMC5hc3B40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Postgame Press Conference - Nov. 20 - University of Missouri Athletics,"Thanks for visiting !

Within an hour his phone rang.

“Someone from Hamas called and told me to erase everything” Sawaf said referring to the Islamist terror group that runs the blockaded coastal strip.

The caller said the border business was “a very sensitive subject for the Egyptians and that my article was going to harm Palestinians” said Sawaf a political analyst.

He quickly took down the social media post — but it had already earned dozens of supportive comments reflecting widespread frustration about Gaza’s main lifeline to the outside world.

The 380-kilometer (240-mile) road trip to Cairo passes through the sweltering deserts of the Sinai peninsula where the Egyptian army fights the Islamic State group and operates checkpoints and nighttime curfews. It also crosses the Suez Canal.

The common complaint in Gaza is that the journey often made on stuffy buses is made deliberately more arduous and uncertain so that travel operators can profit by offering hassle-free “VIP services” to those who can afford them.

“It’s a disaster for the Palestinians” said one industry source speaking on condition of anonymity who estimated the business is worth up to $175000 per day.

“On the Egyptian side they are applying more and more pressure to make the return to Gaza difficult trying to push people to pay for the VIP service the next time.”

Blockaded enclave

Gaza an impoverished territory of some two million people where Hamas fought its most recent war with Israel in May is a difficult place to enter or leave.

Israel and Egypt have maintained a strict land and sea blockade on the enclave since Hamas took it over in 2007. Israel says the blockade is necessary to contain the threat from Gaza’s Hamas rulers who have fought repeated wars with the Jewish state.

The Yasser Arafat International Airport was bombed by Israel at the start of the second Palestinian intifada the violent uprising of 2000 to 2005 and goats now graze on its defunct runway.

Passenger ferries are also not permitted to dock at Gaza’s Mediterranean ports.

This leaves only two ways out of the territory: tightly controlled land crossings through Israel and Egypt.

The Erez crossing to Israel is restricted to Palestinians with permits to work or trade inside Israel some serious medical cases and some people with onward transit permits to Jordan.

That means that for most of Gaza’s residents the Rafah crossing to Egypt offers the best route out.

But it is notorious for being all too often a costly bureaucratic nightmare.

‘VIP services’

Palestinians are forced to register their names on a waiting list weeks before they plan to travel and still transit is not guaranteed.

To be assured of travel Palestinians have in recent years resorted to paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars to private companies and middlemen offering the “VIP” services.

This has bred frustration toward Egyptians perceived to be profiting from the trade.

There was a brief period in the Hamas era when transit through Rafah was easier.

In 2013 when Egypt was ruled by late president Mohammed Morsi a Muslim Brotherhood member less hostile to Hamas a record half a million Palestinians crossed through Rafah. But numbers fell dramatically after Morsi’s ouster in July of that year.

Under current President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi Egypt periodically opens and closes Rafah a tactic allowing it to exercise leverage over Hamas.

380 kilometers in four days

Several Gazans who recently made the trip through Rafah detailed the arduous journey on condition they not be named for fear of being blacklisted by Egypt for future travel.

A man who asked to be called Ahmed said his return from Cairo earlier this year a road trip that should take about five hours stretched over four days.

First he hired a private taxi that left Cairo at 4 a.m. on a Wednesday with an agreement to drive him to Rafah for $130.

The journey was halted at the entrance to the Suez Canal zone where the vehicle crossing was closed and packed with taxis.

He left his cab shared the cost of another with five other passengers and slept in the car.

At the checkpoint he said “the Egyptians opened all my bags. They confiscated my cologne my cigarettes opened my Facebook and WhatsApp profiles and looked at my photos.”

After three security checks he was traveling smoothly through the Sinai until he reached another checkpoint 50 kilometers from Rafah late Thursday afternoon where the Egyptians announced the road’s closure.

He said he rented a “totally filthy” room in the nearby town of al-Arish and stayed for two days until the road reopened.

Ahmed and his companions rushed to Rafah but missed that day’s hour-long window to cross.

Devastated he slept on the street and crossed the next day.

‘I was scared’

For countless Palestinians the Rafah-Cairo round trip is complicated by security conditions in the Sinai an area where IS jihadists have clashed with Egyptian forces.

Fatima also not her real name said she broke out in a cold sweat while sleeping at a checkpoint last year while traveling with a group of women from Cairo to Gaza.

“I stretched out on a cardboard box and I made a blanket out of my abaya” robe she said. “I was scared we were in the desert there was no water no toilet.

“We could hear shelling in the distance. One of the women with us kept screaming: ‘I’m going to die I’m going to die'” Fatima recalled.

The next night at the Baluza checkpoint about 200 kilometers from Rafah she slept on a bus then under a bus in al-Arish the next night.

She said it was hot and children also trying to sleep under the vehicle cried through the night.

When she had to relieve herself she asked other women to stand around for privacy.

‘Killing me inside’

Ahmed said the compounding hardships of travel were devastating and humiliating for Palestinians.

“It’s killing me inside” he said. “The people of Gaza are treated really badly. It is as if we are all terrorists Hamas members but Hamas is not Gaza.”

His frustration mounted when after finally returning to Gaza he met others who had made the same journey in just a day.

The difference said Ahmed was that they paid the VIP fees.

“In the end counting the taxis the rotten hotel I almost paid the same amount and it took me almost five days” he lamented accusing Egyptian security officials of creating conditions aimed at forcing Palestinians to resort to VIP service.

Gaza-based companies charge $1000 to expedite the journey to Cairo including registration private taxis and other documentation.

The return costs $600 making the entire trip more expensive than most Gazans can afford.

Multiple sources — in the border industry and among officials — confirmed that these Gaza-based companies coordinate with an Egyptian company named Abnaa Sinai.

Abnaa Sinai declined to comment.

‘Big moneymaker’

A woman who asked to be identified as Hiba said that when she decided to visit Gaza earlier this year to see family after several years abroad she was chilled by her experience at Egyptian checkpoints.

The guards “look at us with eyes that say ‘I hate you'” Hiba said explaining that she has since decided to pay the VIP fees to make the process faster.

Palestinian officials have in recent months urged Egypt to make transit easier including Gaza Chamber of Commerce president Walid Al-Hosari.

Hosari said that Egypt has said it will increase the number of travelers allowed to pass through a new tunnel under the Suez Canal making the journey easier.

Palestinian economist Omar Shaban an expert on Gaza-Egypt trade said forcing Gazans to pay huge sums for transit is a poor strategy for Egypt if it hopes to keep participating in the reconstruction of war-battered Gaza.

The border business is a “big moneymaker” Shaban said but added that Egypt cannot seek to be a player in the reconstruction effort while obstructing Palestinian travel stressing that their policies need to be “harmonized.”

A senior Hamas official who requested anonymity given the “very sensitive” nature of the subject said that on the issue of making travel easier the Egyptians “promise and promise but you never know if it will materialize.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9ub3YvMjAvbGVlcy1kaXNjb3VudC1saXF1b3ItY2VvLWtlbm55LWxlZS1raWxsZWQtaW4tY2FyLWMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lee's Discount Liquor CEO Kenny Lee killed in car crash,"Lee’s Discount Liquor CEO Kenny Lee killed in car crash

Kenny Lee the CEO of Lee’s Discount Liquor was killed in a car crash Friday the company said in a statement this morning.

The crash happened just before 10:30 a.m. on U.S. 93 between Ely and West Wendover at mile marker 24 Nevada Highway Patrol public information officer Ashlee Wellman said. West Wendover is an eastern Nevada town near the Utah border and where the company has one of its 23 retail stores.

Impairment is not believed to be a factor at this time Wellman said.

Lee was driving south in a white van transporting alcohol when the van crossed the center line causing a partial head-on collision with a white truck heading north Wellman said.

The truck tried to swerve out of the way but Lee — who was not wearing a seat belt — was ejected from the vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene Wellman said. He was 53 the company said.

The other driver who was not yet identified sustained minor injuries.

Troopers with NHP Southern Command are conducting the investigation Wellman said. More information will likely be available early next week she said.

In a Twitter post Gov. Steve Sisolak wrote ""Our hearts ache again for the Lee family — Kathy and I are keeping the Lee family friends and loved ones in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.”

The death comes about three months after his father Hae Un Lee the company founder and noted Las Vegas philanthropist died of cancer.

“We just buried his father and I had the privilege of delivering one of the eulogies” said Larry Ruvo senior managing director of Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits of Nevada. “I watched Kenny throughout the services and he immediately evolved from the son to the new head of the family.

""He’s evolved. He stepped up. He’s been a leader."" Ruvo continued. ""He’s been creative and this unfortunate terrible accident. Our hearts go out to his family his mom. For Mrs. Lee to have to bury her husband and now her son is unthinkable.”

The company has contributed millions of dollars to the Las Vegas community over the years through Lee’s Helping Hand a nonprofit launched by Hae Un and Kenny 20 years ago. One of the four areas the foundation supports is education where it provides monies for early childhood reading international college students and to support teachers.

He was an avid golfer and passionate about the Vegas Golden Knights rarely missing a home game for his beloved team.

“The Vegas Golden Knights lost a friend and supporter from our beginnings with the tragic passing of Kenny Lee"" the franchise said in a statement to the Sun. ""Kenny was not just a team partner but also a generous philanthropic supporter of the Vegas Golden Knights Foundation. Through the years he and his wife Nami and their children were regulars at Golden Knights games and other events including our golf tournament and charity gala. Our thoughts are with his many other friends and family.”

Kenny Lee is survived by his wife Nami and three children the company said.

""Please keep the entire Lee Family in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time"" the company said in a statement."

View the current offers here.

There's a lot for families to love about Southwest Airlines. Free checked bags can be a lifesaver and knowing you're eligible for free changes and cancellations is also a customer-friendly policy for whenever ""life happens."" The open-seating policy though can be stressful if you're traveling with children since there's no guarantee about where you'll sit.

While some airlines make it challenging to get free seat assignments with your family Southwest's approach is quite different. In fact Southwest does not assign seats in advance at all. While Southwest's open-seating policy is unusual compared to other U.S. airlines it works to the advantage of some young families especially if you are hoping to score a free open seat for your lap baby.

How does Southwest boarding work?

Before we get into specific seating strategies here are some basics on how the Southwest boarding process works.

When you check in for your flight you are assigned a boarding pass number in one of three groups based on the time you check in: A B or C. The passes in each group are numbered from 1-60. Someone who checks in relatively early may be assigned A45 potentially the 45th person to board. Someone who doesn't check in until much later may end up with C15 or roughly the 135th person to board. However the numbers aren't exact because some people get a chance to board early in the process regardless of their assigned number.

If you have Southwest A-List status purchase a Business Select fare or buy EarlyBird Check-In you are automatically reserved a boarding slot before the 24-hour check-in mark. So you'll board early on in the process. Otherwise you are assigned your number based on when you check in for your flight. The highest available boarding slot at your time of check-in will go to you.

When it comes time to board you will line up in order at signs for your respective boarding groups. There will be an A1-A30 line and an A31-A60 line. Once the A group starts boarding the B group will begin lining up in the spots the A group previously occupied. You do need to (more or less) get in your actual numerical order. For example if you have B25 you need to be toward the back of the B1-B30 line. It isn't as hard as it sounds but it is a unique process. And yes you may feel a bit like cattle.

Southwest offers Family Boarding after the A group but before the B group for up to two adults traveling with children 6 and younger. This essentially allows families to ""skip the line"" if they were otherwise assigned a B or C boarding position.

Once you get on board you can choose any seats that are still unoccupied. The better your boarding group and number the more seats you will have to select from. This is relevant for everyone but especially relevant if you are trying to get multiple seats together for your family. However if the flight has through passengers from a previous flight some seats will be occupied even when A1 boards.

How to make sure your family sits together

Now let's discuss a few things you can do to ensure that your family gets seats together when flying Southwest.

Purchase EarlyBird Check-In

With EarlyBird Check-In you'll automatically get a spot in the boarding process 36 hours before the flight -- which is 12 hours before you'd otherwise be able to check in. Purchasing EarlyBird doesn't guarantee you'll get an A boarding spot but you have an excellent chance.

EarlyBird Check-In is the easiest way to secure a good boarding spot but it comes with an extra cost that ranges from $15-$25 per direction per person. This purchase is nonrefundable even if you later cancel your reservation. So you won't want to buy EarlyBird Check-In unless you're sure you'll take the trip.

However note that several Southwest credit cards including the Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus Credit Card and Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Credit Card reimburse you for up to two EarlyBird Check-Ins that you charge to your card each anniversary year.

Check in exactly 24 hours before departure

As we have noted Southwest starts handing out most spots in the boarding process exactly 24 hours before the flight. If your boarding number matters to you and you don't want to pay extra to secure a good spot then it is crucial that you are at a computer or in the Southwest app precisely 24 hours before departure to check in your whole party. This will be the difference between you getting in the A group or the C group.

Remember if you are using your Southwest Companion Pass to have a friend or family member fly with you for free (other than taxes) you'll have to check them in separately. Your companion will have a different confirmation number for their ticket so make sure to check that person in at the 24-hour mark as well.

Board during Family Boarding

If you have a child in your party who is 6 or under you can board during Family Boarding after the A group regardless of your boarding pass position. Your young children and up to two adults can board during this time.

In theory only 60 folks will have boarded ahead of you and about two-thirds of the plane should be empty if you board during Family Boarding. However passengers on the flight's previous segment will also occupy some seats unless you're on the first flight of the day. Even so you'll almost certainly find a few empty rows if you board during Family Boarding.

Have A-List status or fly on a Business Select fare

If someone on your reservation has A-List status Southwest will automatically reserve boarding positions for the entire group 36 hours before departure. Likewise you can purchase Business Select fares to guarantee A1-A15 boarding positions -- but these fares are often rather pricey.

As such neither of these solutions are practical for most families traveling on Southwest. However families that fly Southwest often should consider holding one or more Southwest credit cards to make earning status a little easier. For example with the Southwest Rapid Rewards Priority Credit Card you'll earn 1500 tier qualifying points toward A-List status for every $10000 spent. Plus those purchases count toward earning a Companion Pass too.

Pay for an Upgraded Boarding slot if available

If there are unsold A1-A15 boarding slots (ones that typically go to those who pay higher Business Select fares) Southwest may offer them as Upgraded Boarding slots for $30-$50 each before the boarding process gets underway. This is a last-ditch way to board early if all other methods have failed.

Paying for upgraded boarding is an expensive solution unless you have the Southwest Rapid Rewards Priority Credit Card or the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Credit Card. After all both of these cards will reimburse the cardholder for up to four Upgraded Boardings each card membership year. While I'd have to be pretty desperate to pay for this perk it's a nice bonus when it's available at no cost to the cardholder.

There's no way to buy Upgraded Boarding until you're at the airport so you'll need to inquire at the ticket counter or departure gate to see if there are options available. If you want to use one or more of your complimentary Upgraded Boardings from the Southwest Priority Card or Southwest Performance Business Card you'll need to have your card available for the transaction. The charge is processed normally and then later reimbursed on your credit card statement.

Book the first flight of the day

Southwest offers many continuation flights so passengers from the previous segment may already occupy some seats on board when boarding begins. However if you are on the first flight of the day for your aircraft there will be no through passengers already on board.

Bottom line

Some passengers love Southwest's open-seating policy while others strongly dislike it. But love it or hate it families can work around it. With young children Family Boarding is a great (free) option. And for families with kids older than 6 checking in exactly 24 hours before departure should be sufficient. But if you don't want to ""sweat the small stuff"" paying the extra $15-$25 per person per direction for EarlyBird Check-In is an excellent way to ensure your family will sit together.

Finally if you've had your eye on a new Southwest credit card now is an excellent time to apply. After all the following Southwest consumer cards are all offering a sign-up bonus of 50000 points after you spend $2000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening and an additional 50000 points after you spend $12000 on purchases in the first 12 months from account opening:

Southwest Rapid Rewards Priority Credit Card.

Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Credit Card.

Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus Credit Card.

Best of all these bonus points could help you earn the famous Southwest Companion Pass through the end of 2023 if you time your spending carefully. And with the Companion Pass you'd only need to pay the taxes and fees on your companion's ticket when you fly together on Southwest.

Police say they were dispatched to the airport Friday night on an aggravated robbery call and when officers arrived they found the body of the worker.

In a statement on Saturday Southwest Airlines said the unidentified employee who worked at the airport’s ground operations had been fatally shot while leaving work.

“This is a heartbreaking tragic loss for the Southwest Team and we extend deepest sympathies to our colleague’s family loved ones and their extended Southwest Family. Southwest Leadership is focused on supporting our employees while we offer our full support to the active investigation being conducted by local law enforcement” the airline said.

In a statement El Paso Aviation Director Sam Rodriguez offered his condolences to the worker’s family and said his agency was cooperating with police in its investigation.

“The airport remains open as we work with law enforcement to provide a safe flying experience” Rodriguez said.

Small cities are losing air service with some having just one option to connect to the country's national air network.

Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt says demand and profitability are the main factors driving the issue.

The Southwest Effect and rural depopulation also contributed according to industry expert Richard Aboulafia.

With United Airlines' planned exit from 11 airports across the US many small communities are at risk of losing air service to the rest of the country.

United Airlines announced on Tuesday that it is ending operations at 11 small markets indefinitely from its hubs in Chicago Denver and Houston. With United's departure most of the cities lost half of their options for air travel with American or Delta being the sole operator in some towns like Killeen Texas and Twin Falls Idaho.

According to Henry Harteveldt president and travel industry analyst of Atmosphere Research Group these small markets have low demand and are expensive to operate to meaning they are simply unsustainable.

""United has a unique situation going on because they said they are going to be cutting the number of 50-seater aircraft that they operate because they are less fuel-efficient less cost-efficient and passengers just don't like them"" he told Insider. ""It is those 50-seat airplanes that in many cases were being flown in and out of these smaller cities so you can draw a line from the cause of reducing the number of those aircraft in your fleet to the effect of how many small cities you serve as an airline.""

Harteveldt also explained that the pandemic only made it worse. He emphasized that when airlines are looking for routes they are analyzing what is best for their business and unfortunately small communities become a casualty.

""As hard as it is for the people that live in these small towns to lose airline service it is an unfortunate reality that airlines are not just going to serve a city out of civic responsibility"" he said. ""In the wake of the most financially brutal 18 months that the global airline industry has experienced due to the COVID pandemic airlines are going to seek out markets that they believe will give them an advantage but if a city isn't profitable they will cut it.""

Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group explained that the ""Southwest Effect"" also had an impact on the demand in these small cities. According to Travel Weekly the Department of Transport coined the term in 1993 to describe a drop in fares and increase in passenger volume when Southwest Airlines entered a market.

""You had all of these airports that were more suburban rather than urban that were suddenly much cheaper"" Aboulafia said. ""You look at a lot of these routes and they're within a two or three-hour drive of a Southwest airport so it would make sense to drive to that Southwest airport instead.""

Aboulafia also emphasized that the number of passengers flown is not enough to offset the high expense of flight crews airport fees and taxes spent by the carrier to operate the regional routes. Moreover he explained depopulation in rural areas like West Virginia and Montana is contributing to the low demand.

While many towns are getting left in the dust the government has set up a subsidy called the Essential Air Service program that can protect some of these communities. EAS was created after the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act and ensures small airports do not lose airline service to the national air network by paying carriers to operate the routes according to the DOT. Two cities dropped by United — Pierre and Watertown in South Dakota — are among the airports on the EAS list.

A New Jersey Starbucks employee who handled food and later tested positive for hepatitis A may have exposed thousands of customers to the virus.

The hepatitis A exposure encompasses anyone who visited the Starbucks at 1490 Blackwood Clementon Road on November 4 5 6 11 12 and 13 according to county spokesman Dan Keashen.

KYW

The Camden County Health Department was notified of the incident on Wednesday and immediately shut down the Gloucester Township Starbucks location Keashen told CNN.

People who frequented that Starbucks and aren’t vaccinated for the hepatitis A are advised to receive the vaccine “as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after contact” the health department said in a news release on Friday.

“The county health department has been working closely with the patient and the staff at the Starbucks to address the situation” Camden County Health Officer Paschal Nwako said in a news release.

“Our highest priority is ensuring everyone involved remains safe and healthy. The patient is not currently working and close contacts have been identified. We encourage anyone who may believe they were exposed to get vaccinated against hepatitis A by calling the county health department or your primary care physician.”

Public health employees provided 17 hepatitis A vaccines to Starbucks employees on Thursday and set up a nearby pop-up vaccine clinic Friday and Saturday Keashen said.

So far 800 vaccines have been administered marking the largest hepatitis A vaccine effort in the state’s history according to Keashen.

“Starbucks says that that location is busy as most are” Keashen said. “They’re saying they have an average of 600 patrons a day and some are return patrons maybe going multiple times a day … but the exposure is probably in the thousands.”

Visitors of the Starbucks ‘should absolutely get vaccinated’

The Starbucks employee who contracted the virus is in recovery. So far no one has tested positive for hepatitis A as a result of the exposure the spokesman said.

“I found out that my daughter and myself were both exposed possibly to hepatitis A. I was able to get my vaccination today and ultimately I feel good” Keashen told CNN affiliate WABC.

“If you came in contact with material that came out of the drive-thru or you went inside of the building itself you should absolutely get vaccinated.”

Due to the limited number of vaccines in the state gathering the appropriate amount of doses was no easy task.

“We had our public health department employees driving all over the state in some cases hundreds of miles picking up vaccines across the state” Keashen explained. “There’s not a lot of hepatitis A vaccine doses available in New Jersey.”

The county has successfully secured 500 doses for another pop-up clinic planned for Wednesday as demand for the vaccine continues to rise.

Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver that is very contagious and can be spread through close contact with an infected individual or through consumption of contaminated food or drink according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Symptoms include fever fatigue nausea vomiting abdominal discomfort and jaundice and usually appear two to six weeks after infection and last less than two months according to the CDC.

Hepatitis A rates in the United States declined by more than 95% since the vaccine first became available in 1995 according to the CDC. Neighboring Philadelphia declared a public health emergency due to a surge in hepatitis A in 2019 with a bulk of cases occurring among at-risk populations in Kensington.

REUTERS/Mike Blake

The inventory on Starbucks' app isn't always accurate current and former baristas say.

This means sometimes customers can order food or drinks that aren't in stock they said.

Baristas said that some customers got angry when they couldn't make their drinks.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

If you've ever ordered something on the Starbucks app only to be told by a barista when you go to collect your drink that they don't have the ingredients in stock then you're not alone.

Twenty-one current and former Starbucks baristas told Insider that the app sometimes doesn't update when ingredients run out meaning people can order food or drinks that can't be made.

This sometimes made customers angry and disrupted the workflow because they had to process refunds or find substitutes for the out-of-stock ingredients according to baristas.

Current and former baristas also said they couldn't communicate with customers through the app. This meant that they couldn't tell them that the ingredients were out of stock until they came to the store to collect their drinks.

""It was such a pain because people would order and there's literally nothing you can do about it until they get there and they're furious"" Nicholas Anderson a former barista in Atlanta said.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Insider: ""A visit to Starbucks is an important part of our customer's day and we apologize for any inconvenience when an item is unavailable. As our customers plan their visit we recommend they use the Starbucks app to check item availability.""

Glitches allow customers to order items that are out of stock workers say

The baristas attributed the inventory problems to three main glitches.

First the app was sometimes slow to update inventory or simply didn't update it at all they said.

Second some ingredients couldn't be turned off by staff.

And third customers could reorder favorites or recent orders on the app even when the ingredients were listed as out of stock they said.

Baristas said that to list a product as out of stock staff have to turn the product off in two places on the electronic register – both the main point-of-sales (POS) system and the backend inventory system.

Alexis Rivera a former shift manager in New Jersey said that customers could sometimes still order ingredients even if the baristas turned them off in both places.







""Sometimes turning an item off at POS turns it off for mobile. Sometimes it doesn't"" said a former barista in British Colombia who asked to remain anonymous because she may return to work at Starbucks again.

A former store manager in New York City who asked to remain anonymous because he had family working at Starbucks said the company had told him that stock could take between 30 and 60 minutes to update on the app. He added that customers could sometimes order items on Uber Eats even if they were out of stock too.

Baristas also said that some ingredients couldn't be listed as out of stock no matter what. ""There were certain products we couldn't even take off the app"" Gary Ladewig a former shift supervisor in Waukegan Illinois said.

""That was a big issue"" Kelly Preston a former barista in Atlanta said.

Among the products baristas said couldn't be ""turned off"" or listed as unavailable were espresso tea chai cinnamon powder caramel drizzle heavy cream sweet cream cold foam Splenda sweeteners and honey. Different baristas from different locations listed different ingredients.

The former British Colombia barista said staff could turn off drinks that contained these ingredients but not the ingredients themselves.

""You can go in manually and turn off caramel macchiatos with the item availability button. But you can't actually go into the main item availability and turn off caramel drizzle"" she said.

Rivera said that staff couldn't ""properly shut off"" cold brew and nitro cold brew on the app too.

The former British Colombia barista added that there were two ways to order blonde espresso in the app – either by ordering the designated blonde version of the drink or by ordering the regular and changing the espresso to blonde.

""The second option allows you to order blonde espresso even if it's turned off in the mobile ordering"" she said.

Some baristas said that Starbucks had fixed the problems with some of these ingredients meaning that baristas could list them as out of stock. Ladewig for example said that previously baristas hadn't been able to turn some syrups off but that Starbucks had changed this.

The third glitch allows customers to bypass item unavailability.

When customers have an item saved in their favorites or recent orders they can re-order the drink even if the ingredients are out of stock some of the baristas said. Jennifer Romero a former barista in Florida attributed this to a ""bug"" in the app.

And on top of the glitches some baristas said that staff at their stores didn't always update item inventory.

Eric Fellner a former barista in North Carolina said that sometimes when his store was really busy staff wouldn't have time to update the inventory when an item was out of stock. It was easier to just apologize and give out replacement drinks he said.

A current barista in Minneapolis who asked to stay anonymous to protect her employment said that staff would sometimes forget to turn products off if her store was busy too.

Baristas: customers get angry when we say we can't make their drinks

A current barista in Tennessee who asked to stay anonymous to protect his employment said that customers were sometimes confused about why they could order these ingredients on the app and that baristas didn't have answers.

A former barista in Indiana who asked to stay anonymous because she may return to work at Starbucks said customers asked questions like ""I paid for it where is it?"" and ""If it was out how was I able to order it?"".

Fellner said that this would lead to ""awkward conversations"" with customers. The former British Colombia barista said that customers would get ""really mad.""

Anderson said that staff would ""look like assholes"" and customers were ""exasperated annoyed and rude."" He said this added delays that interrupted ""the whole workflow.""

The baristas said that they apologized to customers who had ordered drinks with unavailable ingredients.

Fellner said that at his store baristas would offer customers any replacement drink regardless of price. He added that most mobile order customers were in a rush and wouldn't waste time arguing about their drink order.

But some customers wanted refunds instead. Nat El-Hai a former barista in Beverly Hills and Romero both said that mobile-order refunds could be slow because they required a different system to regular in-store refunds. ""People get really upset with you"" El-Hai said.

Starbucks baristas say that mobile ordering causes a range of complications beyond just the inventory problems.

""The whole mobile order system is really bad"" El-Hai told Insider.

The baristas said that in some cases the app caused in-store delays led to rudeness from customers and put them under pressure to make TikTok-inspired drinks.

Photos and story by: Mike Ratcliffe

TRENTON NJ (MERCER)–With the overnight temperature hovering at if not just below 30 degrees Trenton firefighters early today (Saturday Nov. 20) battled a three-alarm blaze that damaged five houses in the 800 block of East State Street. It was shortly before 2:10 a.m. when Trenton firefighters were dispatched to 868 East State Street between Chambers Street and Hampton Avenue for a report of smoke issuing from a structure. First-due firefighters arrived to find a working fire in the middle home of a row of three three-story dwellings (866-870 East State Street). The “All Hands” signal was transmitted and the balance of the first alarm was dispatched. Minutes later with fire raging on the second and third floors of the original fire building and extending via the cockloft into the attached exposures a second alarm was ordered. While multiple hoselines were stretched for an aggressive interior attack other firefighters climbed ladders to ventilate the roof. Not long after ventilation holes were cut and crews evacuated the roof heavy fire broke through. At one point Ladder 4’s master stream was charged to darken down the fire. Around 2:35 a.m. an additional engine company was called to the scene for manpower. Then at 3:27 a.m. Trenton’s last remaining on-duty company – Engine 9 – was called to the scene along with a mutual aid company (Engine 15) from Hamilton Township which had previously relocated into Trenton to stand by at Engine 3’s quarters. This elevated the incident to a third alarm. A mutual aid air cascade unit was also requested to the scene from Hamilton. Trenton’s volunteer Signal 22 canteen unit also respond to provide refreshments to the cold exhausted firefighters. The blaze – which badly damaged the three attached homes at 866 868 and 870 East State Street and also caused damage to the neighboring houses at 864 and 872 East State Street – was finally declared under control at 4:21 a.m. One person possibly a resident of one of the burned homes was reportedly transported to hospital by Trenton Emergency Medical Service personnel shortly after firefighters first arrived but the nature and extent of the injuries was not known.

But on Saturday she was fine with the idea.

Playing on the final day possible in the final match possible Dzwik and St. Philip saw its season come to an end just the way they dreamed it would — with a state championship.

St. Philip defeated Indian River Inland Lakes 3-0 in the Michigan High School Athletic Association Division 4 state volleyball championship at Kellogg Arena on Saturday.

It is a record 22nd state title for the Tigers in volleyball and second in a row.

And ever since Dzwik and her teammates won the state championship last year the goal was to come back and win another.

""It's emotional to see it end. I cried in the shower last night"" Dzwik said. ""I love these girls and it's sad that it's our last game together. But there is no better way to go out.""

St. Philip dominated play winning in straight sets 25-17 25-12 25-8.

The 22 state titles the most in the state in volleyball for any division surpasses the Tigers' own record a mark St. Philip has set and broken several times. Portage Northern has the next highest total with less than half at 10. And St. Philip's 31st appearance in the state final is also a record that will likely never be touched by another school with Leland second on that list with 13.

""Winning 22 is pretty darn amazing"" said longtime St. Philip coach Vicky Groat. ""It's not about coaching it's all about these ladies that have been through the program going back to 1979 who have bought into what we are trying to do. When you come to St. Philip and you play volleyball your goal is to win a state championship.

""I am competitive. I want to win. And I want to go for 23 next. And we are going to do whatever we need to do to keep this going.""

While Groat has been a part of a majority of those state titles as a player and a coach for the current Tigers it is two state titles for the seniors and a few other starters from last year's club. And this one feels just as good or better than last year's accomplishment.

""Most of us have grown up watching Coach Groat win state championships before"" St. Philip senior Rachel Myers said. ""So we all wanted a chance to get here and get a chance at a state title and to get here is amazing.""

The Tigers started slow with the 10 a.m. start and the two teams played even throughout the first part of the first set tied 16-16. St. Philip seemed to hit its stride from there outscoring Inland Lakes 9-1 the rest of the way to win 25-17.

That momentum carried over in the second game as St. Philip jumped out to a 12-4 lead during a stretch that included three aces two by Dzwik and one by Baily Fancher. St Philip rolled from there to win the second game 25-12.

A quick start to the third set for the Tigers had St. Philip looking over to the sidelines where the state championship trophy sat waiting for them.

""We struggled in Game 1 a lot of nerves on both sides. But I always say the team that settles down first and relaxes will win and we did that today"" Groat said. ""That's a good team and watching them on Thursday they were not intimidated to be here at all. So at this stage when you have a team down you have to keep the momentum and keep the pressure on until the very end.""

Dzwik had 14 kills and seven digs to lead the way for the Tigers with Maddie Hoelscher and Alexis Snyder each adding five kills. Kate Doyle had a team-high 12 digs and Myers added 28 assists.

It was a big-game performance for the Tigers' big-game players who have been coming up with important wins throughout the tournament as the No. 3 team in the state.

Special to Delaware News Journal

DOVER - The Caravel Buccaneers outlasted a tough test from St. Andrew’s on Saturday pulling away late to win the DIAA Division II Boys Soccer championship 4-0.

The first half saw Caravel dominate possession but a tough St. Andrew’s defense was able to prevent multiple scoring chances.

In the second half a St. Andrew’s foul led to the first goal as Caravel’s Zain Akhtar scored on a penalty kick in the 47th minute.

“We knew going into it was a going to be a tough battle and it definitely was” Bucs coach Lance Berry said. “We didn’t get that first goal until about the 50th 60th minute.”

Minutes later Mason Csapo found Zayd Akhtar for another Caravel goal extending the lead to 2-0.

Nikos Criniti and Samrath Singh both scored in the final minutes to ice the Buccaneers’ victory.

“We fought all year from Aug. 15 until now. This team deserves it more than anyone else in the state” Zain Akhtar said pointing to his teammates. “Because we went through ups and downs.”

The second-seeded Buccaneers finished 15-3 outscoring their three playoff opponents 13-2 en route to the school’s fourth D-II soccer title since the tournament was split into two divisions nine years ago.

A tough regular-season schedule paid off as Caravel’s losses came to Division I opponents Caesar Rodney Salesianum and Charter of Wilmington. The Bucs were also motivated by last year’s heartbreaking 3-2 overtime loss to Sussex Academy in the quarterfinals.

“They deserved it” Berry said. “We’ve been talking about it for almost 12 months now since we lost last year.

“We always talk about it doesn’t matter how you win some games you lose some games. The only thing that matters is that you win that last game of the year and finish as state champs.”

St. Andrew’s (11-6-2) squeaked into the tournament as the No. 12 seed in the 12-team field. The Saints defeated No. 5 Delaware Military Academy No. 4 Wilmington Friends and No. 9 Newark Charter to reach the school’s first state soccer final since 1984.

St. Andrew’s was shooting for its first soccer title since 1981 and were the first double-digit seed to reach the D-II final since No. 10 Tower Hill lost to Caravel on penalty kicks in 2014."

It’s definitely an act of kindness’

Seniors in Chilliwack got some fresh produce to eat this week thanks to a generous donation by a food delivery company and another organization that made it happen.

Earlier this week a Sysco truck full of produce was stuck in Chilliwack for days due to flooded roads.

They had already donated food to the new Chilliwack Community Food Hub located at the Salvation Army but there was still lots of produce left over. That’s when Sarah Emmerton of Sysco connected with Chilliwack’s Margaret Reid of United Way to get the food to those in need.

They called several seniors’ residences in Chilliwack and five took them up on the offer including Crystal Ridge Manor.

“She said ‘I heard that you guys were struggling too’” said Margaret Kostrzewa general manager of Crystal Ridge after speaking with Emmerton.

Kostrzewa and her husband had been running around Chilliwack to every grocery store looking for milk bread and produce to feed the 23 seniors at Crystal Ridge. They were able to find four jugs of milk but not much else.

Kostrzewa said she was “thrilled” by Sysco’s gesture.

“I’m just so grateful because we have no fresh fruit” she said on Thursday (Nov. 18) before picking up the food. “I’m so blessed that people think of our seniors. It’s definitely an act of kindness.”

When she went to pick up the produce there were representatives from Lynnwood and Norman Manor there as well.

Kostrzewa drove away with a van full of oranges cantaloupe blueberries lettuce celery carrots herbs and garlic for the seniors. She also got milk and eggs.

“This entire undertaking was a wonderful whirlwind and I am so happy we could facilitate this fantastic donation through Sysco” Reid said on Friday. “They are donating another truck full in Abbotsford that was caught in the flood waters at Whatcom as well.”

The produce was also being delivered to several Indigenous communities as well Reid added.

“This just made my day to be able to go over there and get stuff we can’t get. It’s a very heartwarming thing for them to do” Kostrzewa said Thursday afternoon. “I can actually go home and sleep tonight.”

The answer is complicated,"ThinkStock Photos If your slow device is getting you down the best option is to resist the urge to upgrade.

ROCKHAMPTON (AUSTRALIA): It's usually around this time of year you hear people complain about their phones slowing down. Apple and Google release new versions of their operating systems (OS) and suddenly there's a slew of people claiming their old devices have started to lag - conveniently just before Christmas.But do manufacturers really slow down our phones on purpose to nudge us towards shiny new ones as has been claimed?The answer to this as usual is complicated. Let's take a look at the evidence.Every year usually around May and June tech companies announce their new OS updates. The main news surrounding the releases is often new system features such as Facetime enhancements improvements to voice assistants or a fancier system design.But did you know these features are optimised for the new hardware traditionally released during the summer and the chips that come with it?As such system updates have to be programmed to work towards two goals. The first is to support the new hardware and chip which deliver the newest features.The second is to continue to work with existing hardware that won't support the new features. And this means coding the OS so it's not reliant on the new features having to work.This challenge exists for desktop OSs as well as evidenced by the recent removal of old systems from the Windows 11 compatibility list. Microsoft decided coding around new features was an insurmountable challenge in some instances.So your old smartphone won't support new features - fair enough. But why does it feel like the new OS update is making existing features slower? To understand this you need to first understand some of the mechanics of chip design.Apple used to use other manufacturers' chips for its devices but for the past few years has made its own custom silicon. This is referred to as a ""system on a chip (SoC) as the entire system exists on a single chip designed and manufactured by Apple.But even if manufacturers design their own chips it can be hard to predict what consumers will want in the future and thus which upgrades will come with future iterations of a device.Manufacturers have to write OS updates to suit the latest hardware so consumers who purchase it can take advantage of the latest features. In doing so they must work around the fact that older hardware doesn't have the same capacity.These workarounds mean older devices will run more slowly with the new OS installed even for tasks the system had done for years. The latest OS is not written to make your old device slower but because it's written for the latest device it can't help but run more slowly on old hardware.Examples of this abound in the industry with many articles written about a newly released OS version running slow on older devices until the manufacturer optimises it (if they ever do).You might be wondering: if a new OS will slow down old phones why install the update at all?Well it's because people don't like being told to stick with old features. Apple recently allowed users of its latest devices to keep the old system but this is unusual. There is usually a push for users to install new OS versions.The truth is device manufacturers are in the business to make money. And this means being able to sell new devices.While there is often an implied expectation from consumers that manufacturers will commit to maintaining old products at the same time they need to write updates that will work for their latest hardware.Meanwhile tech companies aren't doing enough to educate users on how to adjust their settings to get the best out of their phones or how to manage software bloat which might contribute to a phone slowing down.Compounding this are other factors such as network connection issues like when the 3G mobile network was stopped.There's something else to consider too. If an OS update was designed to intentionally slow down a phone over time this would be very difficult to prove.The system codes are ""closed source"" so experts can't look into them. The best we can do is run timers on different processes and see if they are slowing down over time.But even if they are is it because of a system update that can't be supported by old hardware or is it malicious conduct from the manufacturer? Could the code be written to force the device to sleep for half a second every ten seconds with a sleep command?It's hard to say for sure although our personal opinion is this is highly unlikely.Ultimately the issue comes down to how device manufacturers sell their products.The best option for their bottom line is to deliver OS updates and features that work with the latest hardware even if this leaves old devices behind. The evidence suggests manufacturers are not intentionally slowing phones down but are prioritising the latest release so you'll buy it.In the meantime if your slow device is getting you down the best option is to resist the urge to upgrade. You might get prompts directing you to install the latest OS version (and the frequency of these will depend on the company) but you can ignore them.There may be auto-updates which you can't avoid but in most cases these are for security purposes and don't include major changes or new features. It's only once these security updates stop coming that you should upgrade.Until then a phone running on its original OS should in theory run well for a long time.(This article is syndicated by PTI from The Conversation)"

Rockstar Games has issued a statement on the “unexpected technical issues” players have been experiencing in the remastered trilogy of Grand Theft Auto games released earlier this month.

Seemingly it was written in the stars that the upgraded versions of Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas would be welcomed with open arms. Fans had been banging on about a remaster for ages and ages and clever modders had taken the task upon themselves to give the games a bit of spit and polish.

Here's one of those modded projects in action - check it out!

For Take-Two Interactive (the parent company of Rockstar Games) to issue a copyright strike against these modders it insinuated that whatever was on the horizon for these classics it would be comparable to these creations. Oh my sweet summer child we were wrong.

Advert

On Metacritic the user score for the remasters tumbled to a pitiful 0.5 from nearly 5000 players. There are a number of issues from glitches that turn the NPC into noodles to bugs that freeze and crash the game and Rockstar Games was inundated with refund requests. It’s almost laughable how poorly things panned out for Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.

However Rockstar Games has now expressed its regret for the quality of the games and how it intends to cool off having found itself in hot water. Or should I say hot coffee?

“Firstly we want to sincerely apologize to everyone who has encountered issues playing these games” read the statement. “The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality or the standards our fans have come to expect.”

The developer continued to mention that an incoming update will be live in the next couple of days and this is only the first of a number of patches to bring the remasters to “the level of quality that they deserve to be.”

Advert

Of course the team is developing against the clock as modders have once again stepped in to save the day. The rain in the games — a migraine trigger if ever I saw one — obscures the screen with opaque streaks making it very difficult to see the surroundings. A handful of modders have offered fixes for that and restored the fog from the originals giving Los Santos that same sprawling feel from years ago.

One player is re-creating San Andreas “from scratch” to offer a rival experience.

After months of rumors and endless leaks Rockstar Games released GTA: The Trilogy Definitive Edition to the world on November 11.

While players were looking forward to exploring these revitalized iterations of these iconic games the experience has been ruined for many by glaring glitches and devastating performance issues.

Nonetheless this hasn’t stopped one avid map creator from delivering a true remaster experience for disappointed players.

The short clip has wowed plenty of players in just a short period of time. “Looks absolutely stunning. It’s a shame Rockstar doesn’t realize they have had one of the most brilliant modding communities that genuinely loves the game for over 20 years yet refuses to hire people like you or at least work alongside you” one player praised.

While the creator hasn’t mentioned was tools he used to make this re-creation players are convinced this could have been achieved through Far Cry 5’s map editor as one player said: “Now this is interesting… It’s likely OP made this using Far Cry 5 map editor.”

Rockstar Games and its parent Take-Two Interactive made waves in the modding community ahead of the definitive edition releases when they handed out a fair number of DMCA notices on fan-made content.

It's a decent-sized patch too and fixes multiple localization issues instances of missing or misaligned collision and more in all three games.

With GTA 3 issues with blurry camera cuts and transitions during cutscenes have been addressed some failing missions were fixed Claude will no longer float in the air because that's just not how things work and the game should no longer crash after getting in your car upon completing Triad War.

Plenty of fixes have also been applied to GTA: Vice City such as the inability to rotate the camera up or down while driving at high speeds and an issue with the GPS route display during the mission Autocide has been addressed.

You can also expect Pay ‘N’ Spray doors to no longer prevent you from entering the Hit Rate UI should now display correctly during a specific mission and language settings will now be retained after a reboot on Nintendo Switch.

The list of fixes for GTA: San Andreas is a bit longer. One of the main complaints with users was an issue with rain visual effects and this has been addressed. The camera spinning around quickly when finishing or failing Blood Bowl will no longer be of concern and the bridge in Flint County is no longer invisible.

Correct help text will now be displayed when swimming pedestrians will no longer appear gray or partially translucent in certain areas of the game the legal text will now be displayed correctly an issue with incorrect inverted controls when swimming underwater has been fixed you'll no longer get stuck behind the Cluckin’ Bell counter and Police Officers will no longer float before a police car spawns.

These are just some of the issues being addressed with the update which is the first of many in the works. You can look over the full patch notes below.

Yesterday Rockstar issues an apology for the state of the trilogy and promised it has ongoing plans to fix technical issues and improve each game.

Thats the correct app. It looks like you have not setup the app as a key to your car according to that screenshot as well.I googled ""Tesla app 4.0"" and here is a youtube that says it has a walkthrough. Note that I have not watched it but any walkthrough should include the same information.NOTE: I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY (highly) sugges you NOT use ANY other application than the regular TESLA app until you familiarize yourself with the official tesla app. Do NOT use anything on your computer (because the official tesla app does not have a computer version).You can not control the car itself from the tesla website. Other websites may interact with your car but it would not be a good idea to go logging into stuff that you dont know who controls it. Once you are familiar with the actual tesla application on your pixel phone if you then desire to branch out to other apps or websites feel free.The reason for the strong suggestion is the fact that you are having difficulty finding the official tesla app confusing websites for the app etc seems to indicate that you may not be super savvy when it comes to this stuff. Thats FINE! I am not trying to shame or otherwise make fun of that at all. I just am making a recommendation to ""start from the beginning"" and that would be the official tesla app itself and not anything else that is a third party connection that controls the car.(""Dashboard for tesla"" is not the official tesla app for example and says so in its description.

Elon Musk Tesla’s chief executive said on Friday that the company’s mobile application was coming back online after the app server outage. Musk was responding to a Tesla owner’s tweet who said that he was experiencing a “500 server error” to connect his Model 3 through the iOS app in Seoul South Korea.

Should be coming back online now. Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic.



Apologies we will take measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 20 2021

“Should be coming back online now. Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic” Musk said.

The outage was first reported by specialist electric vehicle website Electrek which started receiving reports from Tesla owners in the US and Canada then from Europe and Asia.

About 500 users reported they faced an error at about 4.40pm ET (9.40pm GMT) according to outage monitoring website Downdetector which tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. There were just over 60 reports by about 9.20pm ET.

“Apologies we will take measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again” Musk said on Twitter.

According to Electek Tesla’s systems rarely have outages though the website said that in September 2020 the company had experienced a complete outage of both its customer-facing servers and internal system for several hours.

Stuart Masson editor of the Car Expert website told the BBC that Tesla drivers were not entirely reliant on the app. “There will be a secondary mechanism to get in or out of the car beyond the app the difficulty will come for drivers if they are not carrying it” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTU5MzU3MzA20gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNTkzNTczMDYuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla drivers left unable to start their cars after outage,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzIxL3Rlc2xhX3NlcnZlcl9lcnJvcl81MDBfbG9ja291dC_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vQU1QLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEvdGVzbGFfc2VydmVyX2Vycm9yXzUwMF9sb2Nrb3V0Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Server errors plague app used by Tesla drivers to unlock their MuskMobiles,"Some Tesla owners who fancied going for a spin on Saturday or simply driving home may have been unable to do so after the cars' companion app reported server-side errors.

Teslas don't use conventional keys to unlock and get going. Instead they require the presence of a wireless fob or key card or an authenticated mobile phone app that talks to the electric vehicles over Bluetooth. This is apparently easier and/or more convenient than a key or something. Heck everything's better with radio waves right?

The app also provides some remote control over the vehicle's features. Drivers who tried to connect their app to their ride over the weekend to remotely unlock and start their cars reported that the software couldn't do the job and instead produced server error messages. That means they may have been locked out of their vehicle.

If the app was already connected to the vehicle or the driver had their fob or key card on them they could get in and start their vehicle as usual. If not then: sad times. Here's a complaint summing up the situation:

I’m experiencing 500 server error to connect my @tesla Model 3 on my iOS app in Seoul S.Korea. Seems like this is a worldwide issue. @elonmusk — Jaehwan Cho 조재환 (@hohocho) November 19 2021

Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk personally replied with the following information:

Should be coming back online now. Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic.



Apologies we will take measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 20 2021

Measures like maybe letting people open their cars with keys? Just a suggestion.

Tesla appears not to have made any other public statement about the incident and no longer has a PR department so we can't ask directly.

The automaker put its support forums behind a registration-wall earlier this year and owning a MuskMobile is a requirement for entry. Your correspondent is therefore unable to explore any official missives. Tesla's Twitter account is silent on the matter and the electric car biz doesn't bother with Facebook. The exact nature of the outage is therefore hard to divine.

Which leaves us trying to guess at what a combination of server error 500 and ""increased network verbosity"" might mean.

One clue us that The Tesla app was updated on November 18 to version 4.3.0 on iOS and 4.2.3-742 on Android.

Outage-tracking site downdetector.com observed the Tesla outage on Saturday – a couple of days after the app updates dropped – and The Register can find no reports of stuck MuskMobiles immediately following the app upgrade. It looks like the app is off the hook as the source of network verbosity.

Error 500 defined by the World Wide Web Consortium as an internal server error occurs when a service runs into ""an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.""

Might Musk's tweet therefore suggest that something related to Tesla's authentication of app users was tweaked to be more verbose and effectively DDoSed Tesla's own infrastructure? We can only speculate.

Whatever the cause it was swiftly fixed. Downdetector indicates the outage ended after around four hours leaving drivers back behind their electrified wheels and the rest of us wondering if CEOs responding to tweets is the new best practice for tech support. ®

Editor's note: This article was revised to make clear that if the app can't connect there are other means to unlock and start a Tesla.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvdGVzbGEtc2VydmVyLW91dGFnZS1uby1zdGFydC1jYXJzLWVsb24tbXVzay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla server outage allegedly leaves owners unable to drive their cars,"Update Nov. 20: On Friday night Elon Musk tweeted that the issue had been addressed. ""Should be coming back online now. Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic"" he wrote. DownDetector.com was also showing that outage reports had more or less stopped later in the evening. Here's our original story as posted earlier Friday:

Based on several posts on Twitter it seems that Tesla owners around the world are reporting not being able to connect their phone to their vehicle or in some cases not even being able to start the car.

The reports mention an unexplained ""500 Internal Server Error"" which is unfortunately a pretty generic error. The existence of the outage appears to be corroborated by the website DownDetector.com with 74% of reports of outages referring to the app. Tesla boss Elon Musk responded to one user that he was checking on the issue but no resolution has been announced as of the time of publication.

It's not entirely clear why a server error would prevent cars from starting though some Roadshow staffers posit that it could have something to do with the Tesla app pinging the company's servers if the owner is using their phone as a key which many Tesla owners do.

We've got a shiny blue long-term test Tesla Model Y  and we're currently not experiencing any issues with being able to start or drive the car so it's unclear what the actual issue may be.

We'd typically ask a car company for comment on a story like this but Tesla doesn't operate a public relations department to field such requests."

Eventually the MCX Spear will be fitted with a fire control group called the Vortex system.

The United States military is finally replacing the beloved M4 along with the M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW). This change is said to be coming in 2021. This will be the first major weapons platform change since 1994 when the M4 became the standard issue rifle for the United States military. Now it’s time for a change. Not only is the military swapping out platforms but it’s also changing calibers.

The military was seeking out something that had manageable recoil and high velocity like 5.56 but also wanted something with superior stopping power like 7.62. Despite having lethality on its side the U.S. wanted to avoid the heaviness and higher recoil of the 7.62 cartridge. This ended with the selection of 6.8 mm.

6.8 mm was specifically designed to address the long-distance ballistics issues of 5.56 NATO and serve as a way to close the gap between 5.56 and 7.62. It can’t match the stopping power of the 7.62 but it’s lighter faster and has less recoil. 6.8 is also more easily controlled in burst fire.

There are 3 contenders bidding to be the new platform for the new 6.8mm: Sig Sauer General Dynamics and Textron Systems.

Sig Sauer brings the MCX Spear to the table sporting a familiar design to the M4. Meaning little additional training will be necessary for soldiers to adapt to the new platform. Its weight is probably the same as the M4 as well but no specifics have been given except that it’s under 10 pounds. What’s interesting is that all Spear rifles come with a built-in suppressor to counter the muzzle blast (recoil) from the new cartridge. Eventually the MCX Spear will be fitted with a fire control group called the Vortex system. It’s a suite of optics rangefinders and even a ballistic computer. This technology could lead to the average soldier having superior shooting ability even without sharpshooter training. The computer determines the trajectory of the bullet before it’s fired making it almost trivial to land shots.

They also have the 6.8 LMG on the table but even fewer details have been given out about the MCX Spear’s sibling firearm. Sig Sauer claims that its new LMG platform weighs 40 percent less than its predecessors. Recoil is also said to be “dramatically” reduced in the new platform. The new LMG will also feature quick-detach magazines more M-LOK rail space the aforementioned suppressor and “vastly improves upon the operation and function of the legacy M249.”

The military will be selecting one of the three companies by October of 2021. After that the selected company will have a year to make rifles for the 2022 rollout. These rifles won’t be given out to all U.S. soldiers though. Special forces and recon are among the first to receive the rifles with the rest to receive them in the following years.

5 IoT Cloud Case Studies

1. Coca-Cola Içecek

One of the key bottlers in the Coca-Cola ecosystem Coca-Cola Içecek (CCI) services more than 400 million consumers in 10 countries across central Asia and the Middle East. CCI sought to improve the efficiency of their 26 bottling plants starting with input from their clean-in-place (CIP) equipment to model a digital twin bottling plant.

“Our CIP is an everyday production process and crucial for industry hygiene and quality requirements” says Burcu Hacioglu digital twin product owner at CCI. “We wanted to improve process efficiency by avoiding errors in time measurement which could lead to CCI plants overusing energy and water.”

CCI fed their industrial IoT information to the AWS cloud where it was used to create data models that could be manipulated to improve efficiency in the system. Early success with the CIP process motivated CCI to expand the model to include filler-mixer machines.

Industry: Beverage

IoT cloud provider: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Outcomes:

Over 30 improvement opportunities identified

20% savings in electricity and 9% savings in water

34 days of processing time saved per year

Read the full case study on CCI and AWS.

2. Deep Sky Vineyard

Family-owned Deep Sky Vineyard operates in Arizona and Argentina to grow grapes for wine. In one of their vineyards an unmonitored irrigation valve broke and flooded an entire zone which motivated Deep Sky to improve information over the entire crop management process using cloud-connected instrumentation.

“This year I already know several ways we’ll improve our grapes“ says Phil Asmundson owner of Deep Sky Vineyard. “Without this digital solution … we wouldn’t have the invaluable insights needed to make these decisions.”

Deep Sky installed connected hardware to monitor water flow soil moisture and other factors to automate and monitor the vineyard. The data flows wirelessly to the Google Cloud to be processed and analyzed.

Industry: Agriculture

IoT cloud provider: Google Cloud

Outcomes:

Saves 1.6 million gallons of water over 15 acres

Produces a 30% saving in labor

Reduces human error costs by as much as 75%

3. DHL Supply Chain

In more than 50 countries around the world DHL Supply Chain provides customers with highly automated logistics storage transportation and distribution services. Although operating in a labor-intensive industry DHL strives to reduce the most labor-intensive tasks by using robotics and automation.

“With the integration capabilities we’ve gained employees can now simplify or eliminate the most tedious parts of their jobs and contribute in more valuable ways” says Fekko Roelofs program manager of robotics hub and resource orchestration at DHL Supply Chain.

Integrating automation at each facility separately consumed a lot of time so DHL implemented a centralized hub on the cloud. Their new architecture feeds information from robotics wearable devices and other data sources to develop reporting and allow for rapid and simple integration of new equipment.

Industry: Supply chain

IoT cloud provider: Microsoft Azure

Outcomes:

Reduced robotics integration times by 60%

Enabled real-time data reporting from a centralized dashboard

Plug-and-play flexibility realized

4. Dow

The worldwide chemical manufacturer Dow strives for zero safety-related incidents. However vast factories and numerous production lines lead to huge numbers of points to monitor for their Digital Operations Center.

“In this situation we were looking at more than just the speed at which we could put together a solution for monitoring video at the edge — there are open-source tools we could have used to cobble something together” says Michael Dessauer senior solutions manager at the Dow Digital Operations Center. “But we need to scale our solution to thousands of deployments.”

Initially Dow selected to monitor for leaks using video. Video feeds need quick analysis to issue timely alerts but also need tight security. Dow opted to incorporate edge technology to generate alerts quickly and also use the traditional cloud applications for storage machine learning (ML) for video analysis process modeling and deeper analysis.

Industry: Chemicals

IoT cloud provider: Microsoft Azure

Outcomes:

Leak sensors now deployed to places difficult dangerous or costly to monitor with people

Human-trained AI continuously improving ability to identifying leaks

Success with leak detection spurring development of systems for PPE protection and security monitoring

Read the full Dow and Microsoft Azure case study.

5. Thermo Fisher

Thermo Fisher manufactures equipment used in laboratory research worldwide. Their equipment could sequence the 3.2 billion base pairs in DNA but the PCs that ran Thermo Fisher software were insufficient in capability for this information flow.

“We looked at trying to build our own cloud” says Mark Field CTO at Thermo Fisher Scientific. “Very quickly we said … this is not our core competency to run massive cloud infrastructure.”

Instead they partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a private cloud environment for Thermo Fisher. Equipment now forwards data directly to this cloud instead of to local PCs to harness scale and improve collaboration.

Industries: Biotechnology manufacturing

IoT cloud provider: AWS

Outcomes:

Over 1000 partner organizations now feed information into the Thermo Fisher cloud

Initially the cloud IoT data expands the reach of supercomputing to all researchers instead of a few

DNA sequencing will allow a future of more customized care for patients

GOP Senate candidate for Ohio Mark Pukita said last week he hasn't been vaccinated against COVID-19.

Pukita's Senate financial disclosure indicates he owns stock in Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer.

He has also criticized big tech but the disclosure shows he also has holdings in Apple and Facebook.

Republican US Senate candidate Mark Pukita of Ohio who bragged last week that he has not received the COVID-19 vaccine is making money from companies that produce the vaccine a new disclosure filed with the US Senate indicates.

Pukita an IT executive holds up to $50000 in Johnson & Johnson stock making up to $1000 in dividends in the past year according to a financial disclosure viewed by Insider.

The disclosure also indicates he owns up to $15000 in Pfizer stock making up to $1000 in dividends in the past year.

Pukita also has personal stock investments of up to $15000 each in Thermo Fisher Scientific and Abbott Laboratories. Both companies manufacture COVID-19 tests.

During a candidates' forum last week in Columbus Ohio Pukita stated he was the only candidate in the crowded GOP field who had not received the vaccine.

""It's one thing to talk it's another thing to act"" Pukita said claiming he was out protesting against vaccine mandates and masks. ""I'm also the only one up here… who's not vaxxed.""

He also challenged fellow US Senate candidate Josh Mandel to share whether or not he's vaccinated. Mandel who is considered the frontrunner in the race declined to do so.

Pukita previously made headlines for a campaign ad he issued about Mandel that was criticized as antisemitic. Pukita denied the ad was anti-Jewish.

His campaign website says he is ""not anti-vax but absolutely anti-force"" and that Pukita is the ""only Ohio US Senate candidate to state he has not vaxxed.""

The website also calls for an ""all-out attack on the SWAMP deep state and big tech"" and an end to the ""unholy alliance of the Deep State and Big-Tech"" but Pukita's Senate financial disclosure indicates he owns stock in several tech giants including up to $50000 each in Apple Amazon Comcast Facebook (now Meta) and Alphabet (Google) as well as up to $100000 in Microsoft.

Pukita did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Meginness will step into former City Auditor Robert Landon's position after he resigned in mid-October. She will take over on Nov. 29 and fulfil the seat for the remainder of the term with the option to run for election in 2023.

Additionally Meginness brings with her plenty of education for the position. She attended Indiana Wesleyan University from 2009 to 2010 and earned her Bachelors in accounting from Western Governors University after attending the school in 2015 and graduating in 2019.

Aside from her professional life Meginness is married to Mark Meginness for nearly 10 years and a mother of three daughters and one son.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbW1lcmNpYWxyZWFsZXN0YXRlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2luZHVzdHJpYWwtYm9vbS10by1jb250aW51ZS1mb3ItYXQtbGVhc3QtYW5vdGhlci10d28tdG8tdGhyZWUteWVhcnMtMTEwNjU1MS_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjaWFscmVhbGVzdGF0ZS5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWJvb20tdG8tY29udGludWUtZm9yLWF0LWxlYXN0LWFub3RoZXItdHdvLXRvLXRocmVlLXllYXJzLTExMDY1NTEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Industrial boom to continue for 'at least another two to three years',“People have also been exposed through the COVID period to disruptions in the supply chain so they’re needing to hold more inventory and for longer and need more space for that.

On Sunday BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport airport in Baltimore Maryland had a steady stream of people getting back to traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Many said this was their first time their families were doing large gatherings since the coronavirus pandemic started.

Skylar Jesse drove from York Pennsylvania to BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport to catch a plane to Dallas Texas to visit his family for the holiday.

“It’s been a year since I’ve seen people so I’m excited to get back down there” Jesse said.

He said he’s a little nervous about traveling still but that he feels more confident now that he has the COVID-19 vaccine.

“It’s great. I’m a little anxious because I haven’t traveled in so long and I have a little bit of anxiety but it feels good. It’s good to get some time off and get to see family and friends” Jesse said.

Zechariah Ramos and his wife are from Connecticut. They had a layover at BWI while on the way to the Bahamas to celebrate their anniversary with their first cruise since the beginning of the pandemic.

“Needed to get out of hibernation for a change and thought ‘no better time than now'” Ramos said.

Katy Halter came from Harrisburg Pennsylvania to catch a plane to Houston Texas to spend Thanksgiving with her family.

“It’s really the only time we’re getting all of the family together” Halter said.

She said last year they didn’t get to see family for the holidays because they were nervous about COVID-19.

“Because of COVID we were avoiding family at that time but everybody’s vaccinated now so we’re looking forward to getting together” Halter said.

Dave Leach was traveling close to Thanksgiving for a little different reason. He just finished the JFK 50-mile ultramarathon in western Maryland and was flying home to Jacksonville Florida.

“Last year racing was shut down and so it’s a great opportunity to come back and participate in an event like that” Leach said.

Linda Hodorff is transferring planes at BWI. She’s traveling from Wisconsin and going to Maine for Thanksgiving.

Hodorff said she is traveling now because the prices were good.

“I was surprised how easy it was this morning” Hodorff said. “I’m traveling early because I was able to get better rates flying early rather than late but so far it’s been good.”

Halter said the prices are what encouraged her to travel early for Thanksgiving as well. She said she booked her plane late and still got a good deal.

“I actually only booked my ticket on Tuesday of this week or Wednesday and it was still a reasonable rate” Halter said. “Thank you Southwest for giving me extra bags so I get to take some things home for the family.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlhdGEub3JnL2VuL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9ucy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy9pYXRhLWtub3dsZWRnZS1odWIvbGF0ZXN0LXRyYXZlbC1yZXN0cmljdGlvbnMtYW5kLWd1aWRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latest Travel Restrictions and Guidance,"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported that air travelers are increasingly frustrated with the COVID-19 travel restrictions. A survey commissioned by IATA of 4700 respondents in 11 markets in September demonstrated confidence that the risks of COVID-19 can be effectively managed and that the freedom to travel should be restored. With more markets starting to open to travel an area that needs to be addressed is the COVID-related travel rules and requirements.

73% of those who have traveled since June 2020 found it challenging to understand what rules applied for a trip (up from 70% in June)

73% felt the COVID-19 paperwork was challenging to arrange (also up from 70% in June)

At this point it’s becoming evident that COVID-19 is not going to disappear and that it will keep posing challenges for international air travel. As a result everyone in the air transport industry and from other industries that require international travel have been learning to operate with the new travel restrictions.

However it has been difficult for these companies or passengers to keep up with the constant changes in government travel document requirements. Non standardized documents different COVID-19 test requirements various timeframes for testing vaccinations etc. have created much confusion and incredible pressure on airlines travel agents airport staff corporate travel departments and leisure travelers to ensure that they have the correct documentation for their upcoming trip.

Where to find the accurate passenger travel document requirements?

A key solution to ensure compliance with COVID-19 travel rule changes is IATA Timatic. IATA Timatic is a one-stop shop for the air travel’s industry most reliable and up-to-date travel and health document rules information for anywhere in the world. It lets travelers and businesses know if a passenger’s documentation meets the requirements of their itinerary with certainty.



Where can individual travelers find travel and health document requirements?





Individuals and families planning a trip can use the IATA Travel Centre to get personalised passport visa and health requirements advice based on their personal details and itinerary. IATA has also made available a COVID-19 travel regulations map designed to guide individual travelers through the process of identifying requirements. The data is made available to the general public for information purposes only.



Where can companies find travel and health document requirements for their business needs?





For over 50 years the air travel industry has trusted IATA Timatic to provide accurate and reliable travel document information. USA Today named Timatic the most reliable non-government source of travel documents information. In 2019 alone Timatic helped airlines to ensure that the travel documentation of 700 million travelers met government entry requirements. Today it powers the entry requirements functions of IATA’s Travel Pass a key to re-opening borders and restarting aviation. No matter your business size you can also have access to this trusted source of information to advise passengers accurately and avoid fines.

Why do airlines check passengers’ travel documents?

Have you ever wondered why airlines check your passport? After all it is not as if they really mind what nationality you have. In short it is the airline’s responsibility to ensure that every passenger has the required travel documents for their destination and any transit points. Where airlines do not perform this task or mistakenly carry a passenger with insufficient travel documents they will normally be fined by the Immigration Department with such fines reaching into the thousands of dollars not to mention the customer inconvenience. And as you can imagine the new COVID-19 related restrictions have made this a very challenging task.





Why should travel agents and booking websites check passenger travel documents?



It’s also important for travel agencies and online booking sites to incorporate such checks when clients plan their trips. As a travel agent the last thing you want is to provide wrong travel regulation information to one of your clients and then have them get refused to board their flight. This could have severe consequences on your reputation and you could potentially lose repeat business.



What are the main reasons for a passenger to be rejected from boarding their flight?





The vast majority of rejections are for three reasons:

Passport validity

Each country demands that travelers' travel documents must be valid for a certain length of time and in many cases it will vary by the nationality of the passenger One-way tickets

Most countries have regulations that non-nationals must have a return or onward ticket showing that they do not intend to stay in the destination country; however few actually enforce this Visa

Passengers do not have a visa or it is invalid. This is becoming an increasingly complex area as many countries are starting to accept visas issued by other countries e.g. Mexico will accept US visas

In recent months you could add a fourth item to this list and it’s the COVID-19 related restrictions. Given the number of rule changes and confusing information available online many passengers arrive at the airport with insufficient or incorrect health document which forces airlines to refuse passengers.

Lastly airlines are also protecting their travelers from taking a flight where they will not be admitted to the destination country. Can you imagine a couple going on a long-awaited vacation and being refused entry to their holiday destination as their passports expire in five months whereas the destination country requires them to be valid for six months? Or traveling with a rapid antigen test when a PCR test is needed?

Where and how does IATA collect the travel regulations in Timatic?

Before the COVID-19 pandemic on average 72 immigration regulations updates were made to the Timatic database every day. At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic more than 200 updates were made per day. The reason why Timatic is the trusted solution in the air travel industry is the quality and reliability of its data. Should the immigration regulations contained within Timatic be incorrect this would lead to passengers not being informed of the correct travel documents necessary as well as airlines carrying improperly documented passengers and paying the resulting fines.

A good example of how Timatic is updated was the US Presidential Executive Order in 2017 which banned certain nationalities from entering the US. As the order was implemented the regulations were updated in the Timatic database and were instantly applied to passenger check-ins around the world. Similarly as the situation developed and the courts ruled the ban illegal the regulations changes were reversed in Timatic. The same applies to all the COVID-19 rule changes as soon as an update is made within seconds the database is updated and can be accessed by Timatic users around the globe. During the COVID crises we have seen a country change their regulations in a day as much as seven times. All of this is captured reviewed validated and updated by the Timatic team.

Another key feature of the data is that it represents the actual immigration regulations as they are enforced. In many cases there may be a difference between the regulations published by the immigration authorities and their interpretation or enforcement. While the Timatic team works very closely with the immigration and border control authorities in nearly all countries in the world their role is to represent the airline members and not just to be a publishing vehicle for immigration authorities. A good example of the divergence between regulations and actual enforcement is the rules surrounding one-way tickets. The majority of countries regulate that foreign passengers must hold a return or onward ticket; however in practice few countries actively enforce this regulation. Such regulations are typically only enforced where there are suspicions as to the passenger’s intentions. Should such regulations be enforced airlines would in practice not be able to carry passengers on one-way tickets. A differentiation is made in the Timatic rules engine so that the check-in is only stopped where the passenger has a one-way ticket and the regulation is being actively enforced.





Who provides the travel and health document requirements?





In order to collect and publish the immigration regulations and actual enforcement policies IATA relies on over 2000 information sources around the world. These sources can be divided between government sources and airline sources. Government sources can be categorized into several different types including border control immigration consular departments of foreign affairs and ministries of health. There is no more reliable source of worldwide up-to-date immigration rules in force than Timatic which contributes to the reliability and transparency of the Quality of Nationality Index which is based in large part on the Timatic data processed by IATA Timatic team members.





How are the travel and health document requirements collected?



The IATA Compliance Requirements Network is responsible for developing and maintaining relations with airlines as well as immigration authorities ministries of foreign affairs and other government departments to ensure the advice provided by Timatic to its users is accurate.

Keeping Timatic updated during the constantly changing crisis has not been easy however. The IATA Timatic team is in constant communication with governments and airlines around the world to ensure all travel documentation as well as health restriction checks requirements and rules are kept up to date on a real-time basis. At a recent set of webinars organized by the Timatic team many government authorities participated and openly shared their challenges and opportunities.

Martin Banz Head of Border Policy Unit in Switzerland says his government has been collaborating with IATA Timatic for over ten years. “The more complex the regulations the higher the risk that passengers will be refused entry on arrival” he says. “Rules can only be complied with if they are known. We need a dedicated communication channel to process our rules and make them available centrally available. And this is exactly what IATA Timatic does. We make sure every rule change is forwarded to IATA Timatic by default if possible before it comes into force.”

Help improve Timatic If you are a government official or an airline station manager please consider joining the IATA Compliance Network. Better information means a better travel experience.



Why are travel and health document requirements validated by the Timatic team?





Updates to Timatic are done in real-time and can be shared around the globe within seconds however all changes are validated by the Timatic Sourcing team and confirmed by local government officials before being updated in the system. As a result when you use Timatic you get information sourced from over 2000 government and airline officials from all over the world. And our team of experts verify conflicting reports and make updates only when we’re 100% sure they’re accurate.

“If IATA Timatic is not up to date it can have negative consequences” Lionel Mathias Global Airports Network and Cargo Operations Department Etihad Airways says. “I would request all government regulators and border authorities reach out to IATA Timatic and provide carriers notice [of regulation changes] well in time so we can prepare and inform our customers.”

American Airlines has used Timatic since 2013. The tool is integrated into their in-house systems at airports online and their reservation call center. And it has been crucial to the carrier maintaining its cost containment regime. “Our fines were approximately $1.3 million per year” says Alison Anderson Senior Analyst International Operations American Airlines. “We had them down approximately to $250000.” She also adds “We’re 100% confident in the data provided by Timatic”.

What type of documents and information is included in Timatic?





Since 1963 Timatic has been providing the latest travel document and regulation rules for over 220 countries collected from over 2000 sources and updated in real-time up to 200 times a day. The database covers the following areas:

The butterflies whose movements often dazzle the eyes form part of the anecdotes of travelers hiking through the forest to Afadzato Aflabo and Tagbo waterfalls.

The last time I wanted to visit these two villages Covid hit and had to suspend the entire trip. But last Saturday in the company of my partner Whitney Hammel I swapped life at the sandy beaches and instead joined eleven other travelers to sample life away from the cracking noise of the ocean.

The two villages are also renowned for their cocoa coffee and banana farms. The trip was therefore to sample everything on offer including fresh palmwine from one of the skilled tappers.

Our first stop was Leklebi Agbesia. We arrived in the morning. The town had long woken up to the day’s business- a woman running a corner shop was handing out a bar of soap to a customer. An elderly man shirtless with a chewing stick lodged between his teeth with a long wooden stick in his left hand drove away two goats milling around his cocoa beans dried in open. A motorbike rider with a female passenger pulled over next to the corner shop. The female passenger grabbed a plastic bag from the corner shop jumped back onto the bike and disappeared from my gaze.

We got off the bus to meet a group of coffee farmers waiting to take us to their farm for a coffee lecture and breakfast. Some of them took turns to give us insights into their operations and the support they receive from Kawa Moka the coffee company who organized the trip.

Leklebi traditional area has six towns namely Leklebi Agbesia Fiape Duga Dafor Kame and Kudzra. Residents in Agbesia proudly say they are the most hospitable among all the towns in Leklebi. They have a growing population of settler famers from Republic of Togo and Benin who are well integrated into the community.

Betty a mother of two smart articulate with a penetrative smile that exposes her smooth cheeks her baby face containing the smile braided hair in rolls gave us an insight into the day-to-day operations of a coffee farmer. She talked us through the planting and harvesting of the beans and how to spot a matured beans from one that is not ready to be harvested.

George Klu is another coffee farmer. Dressed in a white Lacoste t-shirt an iPad that kept ringing from time to time in his hands filled in the blanks from Betty’s narration. We finished our breakfast and headed into the thick forest to Aflabo waterfall. Our guide was Atsitsre Simon.

Wearing a baseball cap tennis shoes necklace and a nicely trimmed beard glued to his chin he led us through the lush green forest of cocoa coffee and banana farms to the falls. The path was never straight forward and at some point we lost our way and had to rely on the guidance of a teenage boy to help us through the rest of the journey. Sweaty tired and literally dragging our legs through the steep hill we made it to the top of the falls. Phew! We took a quick dive into the falls. It felt so good on our sweaty body and we did not want to leave. The source of river Aflabo with fall in Agbesia is Kpoeta and the area is noted for the growing of bananas which end up in some of Ghana’s popular markets.

We returned from the falls to meet a delicious meal of Kontomire stew with yam and plantain. The dish was prepared by Mr. Klu’s wife and we wasted no time in devouring almost everything in the silver pans.

Our next town was Liati Wote where the famous Afadzato (not mountain Afadzato) is located. We stayed at Tagbo Falls lodged an eco-friendly guesthouse. It is stashed in a thick forest overlooking the lush green mountains and the Tagbo waterfalls. We had an excellent service from the staff led by Philomena and Elvis. We later retired to our rooms after dinner and converged the following morning.

Our tour guide to both the Afadzato and Tagbo waterfalls was Coffie. A quiet man who climbs the mountain thrice in a day and has done it for the past Twenty -One years (21) led the climb to the top of the mountain.

Five of us did the mountain climb and the other group headed off to the falls. At the foot of the mountain where the journey starts my heart skipped a beat but I was determined never to let myself down. I was feeling the effect of the climb to Aflabo waterfalls but was not about to let this opportunity slip away. I adjusted my skirt tied the lace of my shoes and followed the guide into the thick woods.

The climb was steeped and at some point on the journey we had to rest and continue. One remarkable thing about the climb is the visible bins provided to help climbers drop their waste materials into them.

After a rather laboring walk through the rocks- we made it to the top of the mountain. It was like we had won a lottery. The view from the top was enchanting to the eyes. From the top one can see the Akuapim-Togo ranges and other mountains like Aduadu as well as the Tagbo waterfalls where we had our bath before heading back to the lodge.

Apart from the mountains and waterfalls Liati Wote is also known for beautiful butterflies. And we saw lots of them during our walk through the forest.

Sanitation is an integral part of the residents and on both sides of the dusty roads to the forest litter bins nicely marked have been provided to enable the collection of waste. Sanitation campaigns have also been engraved on several buildings.

Moving forward the state needs to pay attention to the roads in these communities and other tourism areas because the potential outcome of such tourist spots cannot be spoken about without the necessary financial investment.

Date: November 20 2021

Time: 1 p.m. EST

City/Venue: Greensboro N.C./Truist Stadium

Series: A&T leads 2-0

Radio: Donal Ware (pxp); Al Swann (analyst); Billy Covington (analyst)

NORTH CAROLINA A&T AGGIES: The Aggies will celebrate Senior Day as they welcome in the Gardner-Webb Bulldogs Saturday afternoon. The Aggies are still seeking their ninth straight season and will need to win on Saturday to make that happen. The Aggies have won their last two games to keep their hopes alive of a winning season. Last week the Aggies stepped outside the conference to defeat former Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) rival South Carolina State 27-17. It was the Aggies sixth straight win over their longtime rival. For the second straight week it was the Aggies defense and special teams led the way.

With the Aggies leading 20-17 in the fourth quarter the Aggies blew up a S.C. State fake field goal attempt to stay in the lead. Defensive end Devin Harrell (Gastonia N.C.) clinched the Aggies victory with a 10-yard interception return for a touchdown with 1:49 remaining in the game. Offensively running back Jah-Maine Martin (Conway S.C.) had a big second half rushing for 78 yards and a touchdown. As a team the Aggies ran for 99 yards in the second half after rushing for minus-13 yards in the first half. Quarterback Kingsley Ifedi (Charlotte N.C.) finished the game in relief for starter Jalen Fowler (Spartanburg S.C.).

Ifedi threw two touchdown passes in the game 23-yarder to tight end Nick Dobson (Teachey N.C.) and a 58-yarder to Taymon Cooke (Bluefield Va.). Ifedi will be one of 14 seniors the Aggies will bid farewell to Saturday at Truist Stadium. The Aggies have won three MEAC titles three Celebration Bowls and three HBCU national titles since 2017. A&T did not play football in 2020 because of the COVID pandemic.

A&T HEAD COACH SAM WASHINGTON: Sam Washington is a 1982 graduate of Mississippi Valley State. Washington is 24-10 (.706) as the Aggies head coach in his third season on the field and fourth overall. In his rookie season as a head coach Washington was named the 2018 MEAC coach of the year after leading the Aggies to a MEAC title and a Celebration Bowl victory. In year two the Aggies won the MEAC again under Washington and took home the Celebration Bowl. In addition he has two HBCU national titles and Washington is off to the best two-year start of any football coach in A&T history. He comes into Saturday's game 16-6 (.727) against conference opponents.

GARDNER-WEBB UNIVERSITY: The Runnin' Bulldogs are enduring a tough stretch of games right now. GWU has lost three-straight games by a combined 18 points with a 32-24 loss against Charleston Southern being the most recent of those. In addition GWU saw three players named to the preseason All-Big South teams. Sophomore defensive end Ty French garnered first-team honors. Junior running back Narii Gaither and sophomore right tackle Clayton Frady earned honorable mention honors.

Sophomore linebacker William McRainey is the defending Big South defensive player of the week the second time he has been named such this season. He's coming off a game in which he had a career-best 18 tackles including 1.5 tackles for loss and a sack as well as a forced fumble and a pass breakup. McRainey leads the Big South and is 12th nationally with 101 tackles.

Junior running back Narii Gaither is having a breakout season leading the league with his 885 rushing yards with seven touchdowns. He is also the Bulldogs third-best receiver with 271 yards and three scores on 32 receptions. His best game came in a near-upset of nationally-ranked Kennesaw State when he ran for 116 yards and two touchdowns with 91 receiving yards and another score.

The Bulldogs have the No. 2 scoring offense in the Big South at 28.2 points per game while allowing 27.5 points. In addition they have the third-best rushing attack averaging more than 162 yards per game. GWU also has 19 rushing touchdowns which is second in the league. They are however dead-last in time of possession holding onto the ball for just under 27 minutes per game.

GARDNER-WEBB HEAD COACH: Tre Lamb was named head coach at GWU on Dec. 14 2019. He is in his first full year in the position. Before becoming the leader of the Bulldogs Lamb was the offensive coordinator at Tennessee Tech. He comes from a long line of coaching in his family. Both his father Hal and grandfather Ray were title-winning high school coaches and his uncle Bobby accruing more than 100 wins and four national playoff appearances at Furman. Thus far Lamb has amassed a 5-9 (.357) overall record and a 1-7 (.125) mark within the Big South at GWU.

THE QUARTERBACKS: A&T's regular starter is Fowler but Ifedi replaced the redshirt junior last week at S.C. State. Before Ifedi entered the game in the second quarter Fowler was 1-for-6 with 10 yards and the Bulldogs sacked him twice. Ifedi played the rest of the way going 8-for-18 for 125 yards and two touchdowns. Ifedi has one other start this season which occurred at Duke on Sept. 10. Ifedi led the Aggies on touchdown drives of 20 plays 86 yards and 14 plays 59 yards.

Bailey Fisher leads the Bulldogs offense. Like many Big South quarterbacks Fisher has thrown for more than 2000 yards this season with 2073. He has completed nearly 60 percent of his passes and tossed 15 touchdowns against five interceptions. The junior can get loose for big runs as well. He has runs of 59 57 53 and two separate runs of 44 yards this season. He also has three 300-yard passing games this season the most recent against Charleston Southern. He has had 40 or more pass attempts three times this season.

GAME NOTES",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZW1vcnl3aGVlbC5jb20vZW1vcnktc3R1ZGVudHMtcmVhY3QtdG8tYnJhdmVzLXdvcmxkLXNlcmllcy12aWN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emory students react to Braves' World Series victory,"As Atlanta revels in the excitement of winning a World Series for the first time in 26 years Emory University students have mixed reactions to the Braves’ victory. Some students were thrilled to participate in the festivities donning jerseys in the days following Game 6 and making the trip to Truist Park for the victory parade and celebration.

Senior Chris Jernigan a Georgia native passionately followed the Braves throughout the playoffs. Jernigan even attended Game 3 to witness the Braves’ 2-0 shutout of the Houston Astros. His fandom throughout the playoffs couldn’t be interrupted.

“If I wasn’t watching the Braves it’s because I was either focused on an assignment or had some kind of emergency” Jernigan said.

Jernigan has been waiting for the Braves to win a World Series for over a decade. He started supporting the Braves in 2010 when they had a poor showing against the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series. To celebrate the Braves’ most recent championship Jernigan attended the Braves’ downtown victory parade.

“The parade was everything I was expecting it to be” Jernigan said. “People were throwing beers at players; it was really exciting.”

Atlanta citizens viewing the parade downtown complained that the buses drove too fast for fans to pay respects to Silver Slugger recipients Freddie Freeman and Max Fried or World Series MVP Jorge Soler. While Jernigan agreed that the buses moved quickly he still enjoyed getting the opportunity to view his favorite players even if it was for a quick second.

Non-Georgia natives also joined in for the fun. Freshman Jonathan Orelowitz is a fan of his hometown team the Boston Red Sox but he shifted his allegiance during the World Series to support the Braves. The sports enthusiast attended the victory parade at The Battery where Truist Park is located to watch the culmination of the parade. Orelowitz watched as the Braves mascot Blooper rode a firetruck to join the team and hilariously hype the crowd up. He said he was mere inches away from catching a pearl necklace thrown by Joc Pederson who became a sensation for wearing pearls in games late in the season and through the postseason.

Orelowitz watched the series closely worrying that the Astros would come back in the second half of the series like they did during the American League Championship Series (ALCS).

“I was nervous because the Astros are great offensively and can’t really be stopped when they get going” Orleowitz said. “I thought they’d be able to carry the momentum from Game 5 back home but the Braves’ pitching did a great job of shutting that down in Game 6.”

After watching the Astros beat the Red Sox in the ALCS Orelowitz was thrilled when the Astros were taken down by the Braves. He credits the Braves’ trades right before the trade deadline as a reason for winning the championship.

“I’m really happy for [the Braves]” Orleowitz said. “[Atlanta] went through a lot this season with injuries so to win it all with big contributions from players they got at the deadline is really great.”

While Jernigan and Orelowitz followed the Braves’ journey during the MLB postseason and celebrated when they won other students were less interested in Atlanta’s newest champions. Following Game 5 freshmen Maddie Clerici and Ada Demling (25C) both said that while they knew the Braves were playing they had not watched any of the postseason games. For Clerici the reasoning was simple.

“I don’t like baseball” Clerici said.

This sentiment is likely shared with a fair number of other Emory students given that the school is not centered around college athletics or sports in general. Demling did not watch the games but her fandom lied with the Braves as she is a Red Sox fan like Orelowitz.

Junior Liv Metzger knew that the Braves were playing in the World Series through a friend and saw plenty of enthusiastic social media posts about the Braves’ wins. Metzger is uninterested in baseball as she does not have a favorite team and was unsure about what sport the Braves played previous to the postseason. Yet she was still happy for her friend when the Braves won.

“I knew that [the Braves] won and I was glad that they won because [my friend] was very happy and I thought ‘Go Atlanta’” Metzger said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9sb2NrZWQtb24vbWxiLXBvZGNhc3QvYnJhdmVzLXNob3cvYnJhdmVzLWF1c3Rpbi1yaWxleS13aWZlLXByZWduYW50Lzg1LTllMWU3ZGI1LWJmMzktNGFhMi04Y2RmLTljNmEwNzNhMjMxYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braves Austin Riley wife pregnant,"The World Champion took to Instagram to tell the world he and his wife Anna are expecting a little bundle of joy.

ATLANTA — Just weeks after the Braves took home the World Series title for the first time in over two decades one Atlanta player has announced his family is celebrating a win of their own.

World Champion and third baseman Austin Riley took to Instagram to tell the world he and his wife Anna are expecting a little bundle of joy.

""Thrilled to announce that I will have a little hunting buddy come early May!"" Riley wrote. ""Anna and I are beyond blessed and excited.""

Anna also made a post on social media sharing the news. She even spilled that the couple is having a baby boy.

""As if this month hasn't been exciting enough"" Anna wrote on Instagram. ""We have some special news to share! Our biggest adventure & most answered prayer yet — Austin & I are overcome with joy & can not wait to welcome our baby boy.""

11Alive's Maria Martin spoke to Austin just moments after the team won the National League Championship Series back in October and discovered they'd be heading to the World Series for the first time since 1999.

At the time he gave no indication that the couple may have had another surprise in store.

""I'm really blessed to be along for the ride because I'm so young in my career"" Riley said. ""You know this doesn't happen every day.""

Now the 24-year-old and his wife are getting ready to be along the ride for the journey through parenthood.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8veWFua3Nnb3lhcmQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjEveWFua2Vlcy1jYXJsb3MtY29ycmVhLWRlcmVrLWpldGVyLWNvbW1lbnRzLWFmZmVjdGluZy1mcmVlLWFnZW5jeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Carlos Correa lose Yankees' bid with nonsensical Derek Jeter comments?,Agree with @KenDavidoff here.

This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Young people are often seen as having a bleak worldview plugged uncritically into social media and anxious about the climate crisis among other pressing issues.

But a global study commissioned by the UN’s children’s agency Unicef appears to turn that received wisdom on its head. It paints a picture of children believing that the world is improving with each generation even while they report anxiety and impatience for change on global heating.

The landmark intergenerational study conducted for Unicef by Gallup for World Children’s Day surveyed two age groups in 21 countries—aged 15-24 and 40-plus—sampled from different socioeconomic groups to compare attitudes.

The results suggest the younger generation are more positive and globally minded than their elders skeptical of what they read on social media (only 17 percent of young people said they trusted social media platforms “a lot” for information) and more invested in science and the possibility of global cooperation and international institutions.

“Young people see a world that is largely a better place for children than the one their parents grew up in—a safer and more abundant world.”

The young people surveyed were also more likely to believe childhood had improved voting healthcare education and physical safety as being better for them than it had been for their parents’ generation.

“Born into a more digital interconnected and diverse reality young people see a world that is largely a better place for children than the one their parents grew up in—a safer and more abundant world that offers children better education opportunities and hope for the future” the report concludes.

“At the same time young people are not complacent. They report greater struggles with mental health conditions. Amid a sea of mis- and disinformation they report low levels of trust in the information sources they use most.”

Unicef’s executive director Henrietta Fore said: “There is no shortage of reasons for pessimism in the world today: climate change the pandemic poverty and inequality rising distrust and growing nationalism. But here is a reason for optimism: children and young people refuse to see the world through the bleak lens of adults.”

Compared with older generations she said: “The world’s young people remain hopeful much more globally minded and determined to make the world a better place. Today’s young people have concerns for the future but see themselves as part of the solution.”

Overall the data suggests young people are products of globalisation—39 percent identified most with being part of the world rather than their own nation or region compared with 22 percent of the 40-plus group. With each additional year of age people were on average about 1 percent less likely to identify as a global citizen.

The survey—conducted during the pandemic—also found young people were generally more trusting of national governments scientists and international news media as sources of accurate information. Yet they were aware of the problems the world faced:

The majority of young people saw serious risks for children online such as seeing violent or sexually explicit content (78 percent) or being bullied (79 percent).

While 64 percent of those in low- and middle-income countries believed children would be better off economically than their parents young people in high-income countries had little faith in economic progress. There fewer than a third of young respondents believed children today would grow up to be better off economically than their parents.

More than a third of young people reported often feeling nervous or anxious and nearly one in five said they often felt depressed or had little interest in doing things.

On average 59 percent of young people said children today faced more pressure to succeed than their parents did.

Joe Daly senior partner at Gallup said: “We cannot know what is on the minds of young people if we do not ask them. Unicef’s survey reinforces the importance of hearing from the next generation and understanding their perspectives.”

The survey found some areas of multi-generational alignment—notably around climate the importance of education global collaboration and children’s agency. By contrast optimism global mindedness and recognition of historical progress reflected some of the deepest divides.

Fore said: “While this research paints a nuanced view of the generational divide a clear picture emerges: children and young people embody the spirit of the 21st century far more readily than their parents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzM0MTQ1LXBvcnQtY29uZ2VzdGlvbi1lYXNlcy1pbi1hc2lhLXdoaWxlLXVzLWJhdHRsZXMtaW1wb3J0LWRlbHVnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Port Congestion Eases in Asia While U.S. Battles Import Deluge,"Asia’s largest ports are showing signs that congestion is easing ahead of the holiday season a potentially positive step for key trade gateways in the U.S. that are still battling an influx of imports.

Total traffic in Shanghai-Ningbo declined by 0.2% last week from the previous week and Hong Kong-Shenzhen’s ship count dropped 10.4% according to an analysis of data by Bloomberg News. Singapore Asia’s third-largest trade hub saw a week-on-week drop of 14.7% as a backlog visible since early November looked to be largely cleared.

The same can’t be said yet across the Pacific as queues of vessels remained elevated in Los Angeles and Long Beach California. Congestion levels at those neighboring ports rose 6.7%.

As of Friday at least 75 container ships were waiting for berth space to offload after politicians toured the ports Wednesday touting a 32% drop in the number of containers sitting on the docks for more than nine days.

Traffic Handling

The handoff between land and sea remains an issue for America’s largest container hub as logistics operators on the ground are not picking up their containers quickly enough and a steady stream of ships arrives to drop off more.

The White House said in a blog post on Wednesday that the number of containers sitting at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports for more than nine days fell to 87000 in the week ended Nov. 15 compared with 127000 on Nov. 1.

Still analysts were reluctant to call the worst of the global supply snarls over.

“The odds remain stacked towards a worsening before it gets better” Lars Jensen CEO of Vespucci Maritime in Copenhagen said in an email Friday. “There is still significant risk of port impact from Covid outbreaks especially in China there is risk of more cargo surge putting pressure on the supply chain as shippers already now begin to push cargo through rather than wait for the traditional rush before Chinese New Year” in the first quarter he said.

Congestion wasn’t uniformly easing in Chinese ports. The congestion rate — the ratio of ships waiting to those in port — crept up 25% greater than the median in Tianjin while a COVID-19 outbreak in the smaller port of Dalian drove down container ship counts to an April-to-November low of five ships.

Manila continues to see high congestion rates with at least 15 container ships waiting to offload compared with eight in port. In the U.S. Savannah Georgia continues to log the worst congestion rate among larger container ports at 87.5%."

Global bank stocks are on track to record their best year since the wake of the financial crisis benefiting from expectations of higher borrowing costs as rate-setters battle widespread inflation.

An MSCI benchmark tracking global bank shares — measured in US dollars — has jumped by around 30 per cent so far in 2021 a stronger performance than the roughly 20 per cent rise for the index provider’s all-sector gauge.

Banks have not achieved such gains since 2009 when the same MSCI share index rose more than a third as lenders recovered from the depths of one of the worst crises to hit the financial industry.

US banks in particular have been buoyed by healthy volumes in their trading businesses in recent months along with “extraordinary” deal advisory activity and the release of reserves set aside to cover bad debts said Scott Ruesterholz a fund manager at Insight Investment. “It’s a phenomenal environment to be operating in.”

A KBW index focused on US banks has climbed more than two-fifths this year positioning it for its best ever annual performance. That improvement is in stark contrast to 2020 when the same index fell around 14 per cent as the pandemic prompted central banks to cut interest rates to record lows compressing the difference in interest rates banks charge their customers for loans and those they pay on client deposits.

The performance of banks around the world has diverged over a longer timeframe with the US far surpassing Europe. On a five-year basis an MSCI index focused on US banks has climbed more than 60 per cent while its European equivalent (priced in dollars) is down 2 per cent.

Banks tend to track the movements of US 10-year Treasury notes said Beata Manthey an equity strategist at Citigroup who expects yields on the benchmark government bonds to reach 2 per cent around the turn of the year — up from their current level of about 1.6 per cent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

Mark Haefele chief investment officer at UBS noted that along with energy stocks “financials do well from a recovery but if there is excess inflationary pressure they can also do well from that”.

The US consumer price index a key inflation indicator showed a 6.2 per cent increase in October from the same period a year earlier — marking its fastest ascent since 1990. UK inflation hit 4.1 per cent in the same month data showed last week.

In turn traders are now betting that the Bank of England will raise borrowing costs to 0.25 per cent in December from their current level of 0.1 per cent after the BoE’s surprise decision to hold rates steady this month.

Subsequently markets are factoring in “maybe [0.75 per cent] to 1 per cent interest rates” in the UK by the end of next year said Alex Wright fund manager at Fidelity. Such a scenario would boost British retail bank NatWest’s profits by 24 per cent he said while adding 12 per cent to Lloyds’ earnings and 8 per cent to Barclays’.

A rise of 1 percentage point [at the ECB and the Fed] would similarly send US banks’ earnings up 17 per cent and European earnings up by a quarter according to Stuart Graham analyst at Autonomous Research.

Those prospective increases have bolstered analysts’ bullishness. Half of investors surveyed by Bank of America this month said they were overweight European banks the highest proportion on record based on data going back to 2003.

Bill Nygren chief investment officer for US equities at Harris Associates is optimistic that bank shares will continue to climb albeit from a low base. “We’ve ridden down a long steep decline and now we’ve had this little rally up a bunny hill” he said. “But we think ‘normal’ could be quite a bit higher than today.”

Chargers running back Eli Gillman had scored a touchdown in the first half but hadn’t dominated the game like he had most opponents earlier in the season.

Then Gillman a University of Montana recruit broke free for a 44-yard touchdown and then had two more big runs to set up a fourth-and-goal play with less than 90 seconds left in the game.

Esko stacked the line of scrimmage but Gillman powered through for the game-winning score in a 21-14 Charger victory.

“We were trying to send the house on that one and they just based it up” Esko linebacker Cole Engen said. “They base blocked everyone and he slipped his way in because that’s the kind of player he is.”

Dassel-Cokato averaged more than 370 rushing yards a game this season but the Eskomos held them to 252 Saturday. Gillman finished with 140 yards on 23 carries and all three Charger scores.

“We certainly didn’t produce like we wanted to but I think it’s a credit to them” Dassel-Cokato coach Ryan Weinandt said. “They were physical they were very very good. They did some things up front that gave us trouble.”

Esko coach Scott Arntson gave credit for the defense’s performance to the game plan of defensive coordinator George Perich.

“If you looked at how many times they passed the ball this season it wasn’t a ton” Arntson said. “We knew we had to be able to stop their running backs. The defensive coordinator — fantastic coach — he does a great job getting the kids ready and he had a great game plan. I’m super proud of what he did and what our team did today.”

The teams traded possessions in the first quarter but the Chargers went on a long time-consuming drive that resulted in a 3-yard Gillman touchdown run with about 4:22 remaining in the half.

Esko responded by driving down to the Charger 27-yard line but turned the ball over on downs at the end of the half down 7-0.

The Eskomos received the second half kickoff and promptly drove 73 yards capped by a 12-yard scoring strike from Ty Christensen to Carter Zezulka to tie the game.

Early in the fourth quarter Christensen found Zezulka for a 21-yard gain to set up a 1-yard touchdown run from Nolan Witt giving Esko a 14-7 lead with 9:39 remaining.

Zezulka finished with three catches for 49 yards and a touchdown while Witt ran the ball 15 times for 78 yards and a score.

The Eskomos returned to some of their base plays to get the offense going in the second half after getting away from those plays in their quarterfinal win over New London-Spicer.

“We got back in the diamond and started running the option and that’s what we had done all year” Arntson said. “We got away from it last week in the second half because we had to. We came in with a game plan trying a lot of quick hitters and then just realized that we could just kind of do our thing.”

After the Witt score Gillman broke free for his long run and then pushed through on the fourth-down play to give the Chargers the win. He said he had “no doubt” he was going to score on the play.

“I knew we were going to stick to what we’re good at which is powers” Gillman said. “Our linemen I trust them and I knew they were going to get the ball in my hands.”

While the Eskomos (10-1) lost Arnston was thrilled with the way his team’s effort and tenacity against Dassel-Cokato.

“My goodness this probably sounds crazy but I couldn’t be more proud if they would have won” Arntson said. “This team has been such a blessing to me during the season and that’s what you get on the field that’s the kind of character that’s the kind of kids we have.”

This after enduring five straight losing seasons then getting a taste of winning football one year ago.

It must have tasted good because the Bulldogs are really feasting now having made it all the way to the Class AAA championship game.

P-E-M earned the right Saturday posting a determined rugged and offensively stylistic 28-6 win over Annandale in the Class AAA semifinals at U.S. Bank Stadium.

It moved the Bulldogs to 11-2 overall. They will take on No. 1-ranked Dassel-Cokato at 1 p.m. Nov. 27 for the state title. It marks their first appearance in the state title game since 2002 when they won it.

""It was an awesome game"" P-E-M coach Kevin Lamb said. ""Annandale played hard the whole time. But I am so proud of our guys with the way they hustled. Our guys played with a lot of heart and they flew around all game making awesome plays.""

P-E-M's defense has been on a complete roll all season. That's been especially true in the playoffs with the Bulldogs allowing an average of just nine points in five games. That includes holding offensive juggernauts Lake City and Cannon Falls to just seven and 18 points respectively in the power-packed Section 1AAA tournament.

Against Annandale a team averaging 35 points per game it was more of the same. The Cardinals managed six against P-E-M their only score coming with 25 seconds left in the first half.

The Bulldogs were outsized in the contest. But in terms of speed there was no contest. P-E-M won all of the foot races.

""They are a really athletic team"" said Annandale coach Matt Walter whose team was ranked 10th while P-E-M was ninth. ""They just have so much speed on the outside.""

It was a brilliant day for P-E-M overall. But two players particularly leaped out: Peyton Schumacher and Connor McGuire.

Schumacher a speedy wide receiver/defensive back finished with a career-high three interceptions including one he returned for a touchdown. He also kicked off P-E-M's scoring with a 72-yard TD catch from McGuire early in the second quarter.

Schumacher destroyed any chance Annandale might have had to have a big passing day. And it needed one as swarming and ultra-quick P-E-M allowed the Cardinals just 84 yards rushing on 29 carries.. He wasn't the only one wreaking havoc with the Annandale passing game. The Bulldogs picked off five Cardinals passes.

Traci Westcott / Post Bulletin Traci Westcott

But nobody did it better or more often than Schumacher who Lamb pointed out has shut down one elite receiver after another this season.

""I was just trying to bait their quarterback (Carson Gagnon) into throwing some of those balls and then I jumped their receivers"" Schumacher said. ""I've done that quite a few times this season and I've not been burned trying it yet.""

It was Schumacher who so quickly turned a scoreless game into a 14-0 one in his team's favor. First there was that long TD catch from McGuire then one minute later he picked off a Gagnon pass and took it 23 yards for a score.

As for McGuire he's been a revelation all season with his passing. He used Saturday's semifinal to be one again. And the Bulldogs needed him to do that as just like Annandale they had an impossible time running the football.

But the senior made things work with his right arm and also took advantage of his fleet receivers led by Schumacher and Jason Feils.

""We have weapons"" McGuire said. ""I just just chuck it to them and they make me look good.""

Certainly McGuire and those receivers ""looked good"" together. McGuire finished 11-for-19 for 191 yards and two touchdowns. There was the 72-yarder to Schumacher in a first half that ended with P-E-M leading 14-6 and then there was a game-sealing 48-yarder to Feils with 3:24 left in the first half.

“I’ve attended dozens of workshops on how to properly rehabilitate these animals after a spill but nothing could have prepared me for this” said cleanup volunteer Elizabeth Walston. “I’m stuck here caring for a Double-Crested Cormorant with beautifully coiffed feathers knowing full well that the oil will wear off in a few days and it will go back to being just another stupid fucking bird. There’s part of me that wants to give up and put these animals out of their misery once and for all so they don’t have to suffer anymore. How am I supposed to sleep at night knowing they won’t have continual access to this sort of sparkle?”

Ulta Beauty Inc an American chain specializing in beauty products has lost a considerable amount of its coconut oil supply as a result of the spill.

“Like everyone I’m completely outraged” said Ulta CEO David Kimbell. “That ship was carrying enough coconut oil to keep our customers looking fabulous until the end of Q1. Now I don’t know what the fuck is going to happen. We had an exclusive deal lined up with Machine Gun Kelly that’s basically flushed down the toilet now. I have half a mind to go down to that beach and scrape the oil off of them myself and maybe even charge all that freeloading wildlife market price. It’s not my fault these birds refuse to get jobs.”

Pillars of the fashion and beauty world including Jonathan Van Ness of “Queer Eye” voiced their support for these birds’ new “looks”.

“These animals are letting their inner beauty shine” said Van Ness from a nearby sand dune where he could be seen applauding every animal affected by the spill. “Who gave that Double-crested Cormorant permission to slay so hard? At first I thought it was Sarah Jessica Parker but no it’s just Phalacrocorax auritus serving us so much style I want to go back for seconds. The perfectly conditioned hair the shine on the feathers. Honey I’m literally obsessed. Go off queens!”

Environmentalists expressed concern that tornadoes could also have a positive impact on the hair quality of a number of species leaving blow dryer companies like Dyson at a loss of profit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXZlbnRpb24uY29tL2JlYXV0eS9za2luLWNhcmUvYTM4MzAxOTgxL3JlZXNlLXdpdGhlcnNwb29uLWh5ZHJhdGluZy1ldmlhbi1mYWNpYWwtc3ByYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reese Witherspoon's Favorite $13 Hydrating Face Mist,"We may earn commission from links on this page but we only recommend products we back. Why Trust Us?

Reese Witherspoon shared the $13 hydrating face mist she uses to soothe and hydrate her skin while on the set of The Morning Show.

It’s the and it’s crafted with only two ingredients: Evian Water and Nitrogen.



The face mist has a 4.7-star rating and hundreds of rave reviews on and .

Reese Witherspoon is a beloved actress relatable social media personality and skincare mogul. We love keeping up with the star’s beauty routines and her latest product reveal might be one of the best ones yet—it’s affordable versatile and available on .



In a recent video posted to her Instagram Witherspoon was spotted holding the . The video features a mashup of various behind-the-scenes footage of the 45-year-old while on the set of The Morning Show.

While she doesn’t show any footage of herself directly applying the facial mist she does use the can as a pretend microphone while recording her video. “Hi this is Bradley Jackson reporting live from the Morning Show makeup trailer” said Witherspoon in the video making it safe to assume that she has the spray readily available in her trailer for skincare prep at all times.

This top-rated daily facial mist is formulated with only two ingredients (mineral water and nitrogen) making it an ideal low-maintenance skincare must-have. Its key ingredient is natural mineral water which comes directly from the Evian-les-Bains springs in France. The water has a unique mineral composition and neutral ph thanks to its journey through the French Northern Alps.

Thanks to the spray’s easy-to-use design you’ll find an ultra-fine microdroplet mist made to target the upper layers of the skin. This ensures that the water gets absorbed fully and properly. This process also allows you to get an ‘unparalleled boost’ of natural hydration and it’s safe to use on all skin types according to the brand.

Experts recommend adding facial water sprays to your skincare routine to keep the skin hydrated. “They have mineral-heavy concentrations that have been shown to hydrate decrease irritation redness and support a healthy skin microbiome” said Melanie Palm M.D. a San Diego-based board-certified dermatologist in a previous interview for Prevention.com.

And each can is made from 100% recycled materials to help minimize the use of plastic and protect the environment.

The part we find most exciting about this product is that it's a multitasker just like you. Whenever you’re in need of some hydration you can spritz it all over your face to soothe and refresh your skin. And it doubles as a makeup setting spray. You can spritz your favorite beauty blender or brush with it before and after applying makeup to create a dewy-looking finish. The brand also notes that you can spray your mascara wand to get a more vibrant and smooth application. What can't this product do?

Witherspoon isn’t the only celeb who’s a fan of this facial mist. Drew Barrymore loves it so much that she dedicated a whole Instagram post to it sharing everything that she uses it for including her hair! “It literally has that perfect atomizer that distributes perfectly for waves and curls” wrote Barrymore in her caption.



With approval from Witherspoon Barrymore and thousands of customers we’re definitely planning on adding a few cans to our skincare cabinets.

Jennifer Aniston shared the affordable hairbrush she uses to detangle her tresses after showering.

For $15 you can buy her go-to on .

The Morning Show star uses it in conjunction with hair products from her own line LolaVie.

Ever since Jennifer Aniston launched her haircare line LolaVie the actress has become generously open about how she maintains her tresses—and we are listening! The latest update comes from an Instagram video in which she demonstrates her new release the Perfecting Leave-In Conditioner but what might be even more exciting is the brush she uses to detangle her hair: an oldie but a goodie the .

More specifically the Morning Show star uses the colorway. Upon washing her envious Rachel Green locks Aniston steps in front of the camera to spritz in LolaVie's Glossing Detangler. Then comes the Wet Brush to smooth her knots and tangles in a mere few front-to-back swoops.

Next up the leave-in conditioner (just two pumps!) which she combs through her hair with her fingers. Then thanks to the power of editing the 52-year-old appears in the next frame with model-esque feathery dry hair ready to be brushed again. For this pass she uses a different rose gold-colored brush.

The Wet Brush is made for use on wet hair hence the name and it's well-loved for color-treated hair and kids' knotty manes alike. Most people love that it's lightweight and doesn't tug at the roots or pull out excess hair. The Flex model is made to flex and bend to the contour of the scalp allowing for seamless brushing.

“I have really long thick hair and wanted a new brush that Did NOT rip thru my hair even when very conditioned and this one did it!!” One Ulta reviewer writes. “I am totally amazed at how easily it went thru my hair without any tugs or ripping my hair out!! Highly Recommend.”

Another raves: “I have lots of fine wavy hair and this is the best brush I've ever used on it! I feel like there are far fewer strands of hair ripped out each time. And I LOVE that you can use it with the blow dryer!”

If we know anything about Aniston she knows good products. And this one is no exception.",,,,,,

He is the Latino Chamber of Boulder County’s operations manager.

When Ciclaly Lopez and her mother Rosa Salas look around their store Salas Fashion at 2900 Valmont Road in Boulder they’re content.

Having come through a rough year the store that specializes in quinceañera dresses and accessories recently received a $5000 grant from United Parcel Service Inc. and soon will move to a bigger space nearby. And with Lopez doing well in college everything seems to be on a glidepath for success.

“I’ve worked at the store ever since I was a little girl. It’s just a little cramped in here now” she said looking around at the formal quinceñera dresses and other apparel spilling into the aisles. The new location — just two blocks away — will provide much more room for the 9-year-old retailer’s wares.

Salas Fashion caters to Boulder County’s growing Latino population which has increased from 14% of the total population in 2010 to 14.6% in 2020 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Statewide Colorado’s Latino population increased to 22% with the Fort Collins Colorado Springs and Greeley metro areas showing the biggest percentage gains.

Such population gains demonstrate economic opportunity — and clout. According to a report by The Latino Donor Collaborative prepared by California Lutheran University the total economic output of U.S. Latinos reached $2.7 trillion in 2019. If U.S. Latinos were an independent country that would tie it for the seventh-largest economy in the world matching France.

Latino-owned businesses often outperform non-Latino enterprises. According to the annual Biz2Credit Latino-Owned Business Study Latino business owners recorded revenue of $45435 more on average than non-Latino owned enterprises. The report also stated that annual earnings for Latino-based companies are $162725 which was better than non-Latino businesses which earned $132753.

Latino businesses also spent $95526 a 37% rate of their revenue on operating expenses which was less than non-Latino companies which spent 38% representing $80063 in expenditures.

But even with superior performance metrics the rate at which Latino businesses are funded stands at 4.5% which is lower than the rate for non-Latino companies which are funded at a rate of 36.6% according to the Biz2Credit report.

The disparity raises questions about how such a sturdy and robust economy keeps coming up short or at least shorter than their counterparts who are not in the same ethnic category for aid and yet consistently keep outpacing these other businesses.

Latino businesses in Boulder County face challenges common to Latino businesses nationwide. In spite of the numbers many businesses still find it hard to determine where to seek grants and loans.

Although Lopez 21 has a great deal of business acumen for her age she and her mother had no idea how to obtain help from banks or other private or governmental entities.

Enter Berenice Garcia-Tellez a board member and volunteer at the The Latino Chamber of Boulder County. While canvassing local businesses Garcia-Tellez came upon Salas Fashion and began to share strategies for surviving lackluster sales due to the pandemic.

“We really didn’t know about programs and help available” Lopez said. “Berenice and the chamber helped us a lot.”

The help proved to be invaluable. Garcia-Tellez’ advice culminated in the grant from UPS and a loan under the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program which Salas used to pay past-due bills and for rent to help make it through the tough times.

Challenges with traditional loans

The grant and PPP funds provided valuable financial resources even as Lopez and Salas were skeptical about a traditional loan. That skepticism reflected concerns about what is happening nationally to Latino businesses trying to obtain funding.

Minority-owned businesses often battle opposition to them receiving targeted help with lawsuits challenging programs that dedicate funds based on race.

For example multiple lawsuits were filed over the Restaurant Revitalization Fund part of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan with plaintiffs claiming that the SBA was discriminating by prioritizing early funding for minority business owners. In Colorado a barbershop owner sued over a $4 million state stimulus package for minority-owned businesses.

Supporters say such programs are intended to address the disparity in loans and other assistance received by Latino businesses compared with other races.

According to the Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative’s State of Latino Entrepreneurship 2020 report prepared by Stanford Business School Latino businesses were less likely to obtain loans from national banks than white applicants even when the Latino business reported strong metrics on key loan criteria.

“Sometimes applicants had challenges with citizenship or obtaining other financial documents needed for certain loans” Garcia-Tellez said.

The Latino Chamber works with local businesses to navigate the process for grants and loans helping about 100 businesses secure funds.

“A lot of people when applying for grants and loans don’t even know what due diligence is needed” she said referring to a variety of documents and filings that are required.

Latino Chamber Operations Manager Ricardo Cabrera adds “A real big one is if they have no Social Security number or a tax ID. That’s a real headache because they still are paying taxes and have no access to programs.”

The Stanford study notes that only one out of four Latino business owners knows their credit score.

Lack of knowledge may explain why some businesses in Boulder County have favored obtaining grants rather than pursuing the traditional loan options from local financial institutions.

“First there’s a wide range of Hispanic businesses out there“ Cabrera said. “There are highly sophisticated members of the business community and there are those who are part of the underrepresented part of the community which have other specific needs.”

Social services

While other chambers of commerce focus mostly on the business needs of their members the Latino Chamber goes several steps further helping members with a variety of business-consulting services as well as social programs.

Among members’ needs are finding documents that may be located in another country or interpretation services for legal documents. The chamber also helps with local permitting and zoning and filings with the Colorado Secretary of State.

On the social side the chamber organizes vaccination clinics and assists with issues that families might be having at their children’s schools.

Some of these concerns mirror factors that can be assets for Hispanic business owners. According to the Stanford report Hispanic businesses hold a wide array of traditional values (including family and a strong desire to keep current on outstanding bills) which translates to business stability.

However many Latino business owners still hope their children pursue a future rooted in education rather than entrepreneurship.

That also reflects a goal of the Latino Chamber. Although business is one of the fields the Chamber must prioritize Garcia-Tellez points to another target.

“We want to see Hispanics represented in more fields where we are underrepresented” she said.

Garcia-Tellez points to underrepresentation in medical fields and other professional fields as well as municipal jobs. She says she would like to see more fire personnel and police as two of the most in need of representation around the country.

Again Lopez and her mother reflect this trend.

“Right now I’m in college at CU Denver. I want to go into the medical field” Lopez said.

She splits her time at the store and at school while finding time to study whenever she can.

The Latino Chamber also is trying new and innovative ways to reach the Latino business community including having meetings and seminars over Facebook.

That’s how Salas Fashion first learned of the UPS grant.

“I remember we saw Berenice interviewing another business on Facebook so my mom asked for her number and that’s how we started to find what we needed to do for the UPS grant” Lopez said.

It’s precisely the type of relationship that the Latino Chamber is working to foster.

“We are looking to keep the relationships we’ve built with the business community and partner with them for many years. Hopefully to engage in all aspects of business and whatever help they may need” Garcia-Tellez said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS93b3JrZXJzLWxhYm9yLXN0cmlrZXMtcmFuay1hbmQtZmlsZS1zdHJhdGVneS1kc2EtZWxlY3Rpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Workplace Organizing Is Still Crucial for the Socialist Movement,"For several decades the state of working-class power in the United States has been bleak. Unions are weak and millions of workers including nearly half of union household voters voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. Seeing the weakened state of labor many liberals and leftists have turned to other social forces — nonprofits left politicians or even climate-friendly billionaires — to win health care environmental and other progressive legislation. In recent years inspired by the experience of Bernie Sanders’s and others’ campaigns the US left has recognized the strategic importance of political action: elections legislation and political parties. The need for political action has become common sense for today’s left: Neither mass protests nor workplace organizing alone are sufficient to build the power needed to defend workers’ interests and ultimately transform society. Some leftists take this argument even further. Pointing to the role of politicians and legislation in the New Deal labor upsurge and workers’ decreasing structural power under “post-industrial” capitalism Chris Maisano argues that elections may now be more important for “working-class reorganization” than workplace organizing. “The potential for making new advances today” he writes might be “relatively more dependent on political action than on leveraging workers’ location in the production process.” At its best left-wing political action can catalyze and reinforce workers’ movements while advancing legislation on their behalf as the Bernie campaigns showed. But the excitement of election campaigns and the need to build a new political party shouldn’t eclipse the central strategic importance of workers’ own activity and organization especially where they have the most potential power: at work. Workplace organizing is of course hard even more so given the defeats of the last four decades. But it’s both possible and indispensable. The Left needs to commit to rebuilding the labor movement from the bottom up without which our reform program — not to mention democratic socialism — will remain off the agenda indefinitely.

Which Came First? In two recent articles Maisano argues that workers will need an “assist from public policy” in the form of progressive labor law reform like the PRO Act to create a “more favorable environment” for class struggle. Only then he implies will workplace organizing bear fruit again. But this “legislate first organize later” sequence draws the wrong lessons from the 1930s the last time such ambitious labor law reform passed. The PRO Act is an excellent demand for labor and the Left to fight for right now and we should hope that it passes before Democrats lose the Senate. But if it doesn’t that would not be a surprise — major labor law reforms tend to follow upsurges in union organizing and strike activity not the other way around. Political scientist Michael Goldfield shows in a seminal study that massive unrest and then three major general strikes in 1934 — led in part by revolutionary socialist cadres — pushed political and economic elites to choose an ultimately successful strategy of concessions in order to placate contain and redirect worker rebellion into less disruptive channels. One pro-New Deal congressperson summarized the mood: “What we are trying to do . . . is save [big] corporations from communism and bloodshed.” Major labor law reforms tend to follow upsurges in union organizing and strike activity not the other way around. The 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) itself had limited impact on the upsurge as the labor board it established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accomplished little in its first two years. It was the 1936–37 Flint auto workers’ strike victory that sparked within only one month 247 other sit-down strikes involving over 200000 workers. The number of union members surged from 4 million to 7 million by year’s end leading Goldfield to write that “the dam had been broken with little help from the NLRB.” Maisano claims that earlier legislation the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) helped get the union organizing “genie out of the bottle” by giving workers a “license to organize.” But Maisano also admits the toothless NIRA “went unenforced.” It was at best merely a symbolic catalyst or proximate cause. The legislation doesn’t prove much about the special role of legislation vis-à-vis organizing as any number of things can provoke strikes from bad bosses to inspiring examples in other factories. And regardless mass disruption — including millions protesting for unemployment relief and successful auto strikes in Detroit — had already been underway for years before the NIRA’s passage. Finally Maisano talks about the central role played by “sympathetic politicians” in a few 1930s strikes. Labor activists surely benefited from this political support. But there were 4740 recorded work stoppages in 1937 alone. In only a few of these could workers rely on sympathetic politicians. The one thing common to all of them is the action organization and tenacity of countless workers in the face of powerful companies or even violent strikebreakers. Goldfield shows that mass disruptive action by the workers tended to push politicians to be more “sympathetic”: As workers became more confident of their power elites became increasingly hesitant to use violent repression which was only provoking more unrest and radicalization. Political action was of course necessary to winning New Deal legislation. But the crucial power to win those reforms was generated by workers themselves primarily at the point of production. To win major reforms in the twenty-first century from Medicare for All to the Green New Deal we need to build class struggle at the workplace and lots of it.

The Cause of Labor Is Still the Hope of the World How can workers’ own militancy and organization exert so much power? Because under capitalism the working class is as Vivek Chibber writes “the goose that lays the golden eggs.” Chibber explains: The reason labor is so central to socialist strategy is that it is the only social actor with both the power and the interest in taking on capital. It has an interest in doing so because it suffers systematically at the hands of capital. And it has the capacity to fight the power of capital because capital depends on labor to keep its wealth and profits flowing. Maisano argues that while this might have been true in earlier eras the nature of capitalism has changed. With a relative loss of manufacturing jobs and the geographic reorganization of cities the US proletariat has lost much of the “structural power” in the workplace that it once relied on to advance its interests. While historically “industrial workers have been the leading edge of democratic and socialist movements around the world” recent “labor-saving technical change outsourcing and other pressures” have “eroded” the proletariat’s potential power. Under “post-industrial capitalism” Maisano suggests elsewhere the hope of the working class might lie more in “political mobilization” (primarily through elections and lobbying) than in “leveraging the [structural] position of workers” through union organizing and direct action in the production process. The task of revitalizing the labor movement is certainly as daunting as ever. But it’s not true that it is structurally off the table. Kim Moody shows that “the popular tropes of a fragmented atomized casualized working class obscure the degree to which the last three decades have in fact created new zones of centralized production new vulnerabilities for capital and also underplay important elements of continuity in forms of employment.” As Jacobin’s Paul Prescod put it last month “The industrial working class hasn’t disappeared. It’s just been transformed.” The over 4 million workers involved in logistics (transporting goods) “are the new core of the US industrial working class.” The “logistics revolution” has created whole new industrial fortresses in major urban areas the last bastions of high union density. Moody explains that scores of “logistics clusters” in the United States some of which concentrate over 100000 workers are “at the center of today’s broader production processes much as the clusters of auto-assembly plants in Detroit or the steel mills in Gary of yesteryear.” Amazon alone now employs nearly 1 million people directly in the United States. As one United Parcel Service (UPS) driver wrote recently in Jacobin organizing Amazon is do-or-die for the labor movement since their prices wages and conditions are determinative for the rest of this key industry. But “conditions for organizing Amazon and achieving a revitalizing breakthrough for unionism” he writes “have never been better.” While US labor has been disorganized by a decline in traditional industrial employment since the mid-twentieth century there are important new openings for organizing today. The 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) has committed (under pressure from union reformers) to organizing Amazon. Especially because the more ambitious reformers supported by Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU) just won the elections for IBT leadership a Teamster-led national Amazon campaign could represent the most important new private sector organizing drive in a generation. IBT’s resources would supplement grassroots organizing being carried out already by scrappier but highly committed activists (for example Amazonians United). A potential contract fight or even strike by 300000 UPS Teamsters in 2023 under more militant IBT leadership could also help raise US labor’s expectations in general and Amazon workers’ interest in unionization in particular. Besides logistics two other sectors have been growing rapidly along with their centrality to US society: education and health care. There were 3.5 million full- and part-time public school teachers in the 2017–18 school year a nearly 20 percent increase since 2000. The vast majority of these teachers are already in unions. A wave of largely victorious teacher strikes across the United States in 2018–19 involving nearly 650000 workers reintroduced the idea of strikes to unions and unions to US society. Researchers at Columbia have shown that these strikes actually increased the appeal of unions to nonunion parents and other observers. Maisano suggests that “working-class reorganization today” will not primarily run through “workplace organizing or strikes” but rather through political action. But the Columbia researchers highlight “the importance of strikes as a political strategy for unions: not only can they build stronger public support for the striking workers but they can also inspire greater interest in further labor action among other workers.” The teachers’ strikes confirm that more than a conservative focus on electing and lobbying Democrats “strikes are workers’ most powerful weapon.” Rank-and-file reformers radicals and Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) members in the “militant minority” were essential to initiating and leading many of these strikes just like Communist and other radical militants were in the 1930s upsurge. Rank-and-file teachers in New York City had to merely threaten a wildcat strike last year despite New York’s ban on public sector strikes to force their union to call for school closures in the face of rising COVID-19 infections — a demand they won saving countless lives in a viral epicenter. Teachers’ power to force concessions at work and in the statehouse has been proven in practice. About 20 million people or one in seven workers now work in “healthcare and social assistance” in the United States the largest sector as tracked by the Census Bureau. Many of these workers are concentrated in huge hospitals and campuses. While a smaller share of workers are unionized in health care than in education militant worker-led action and progressive union leaderships show that health care workers can play an important role in revitalizing US labor. At the beginning of the pandemic last year workers in Cook County hospital in Chicago challenged mismanagement and understaffing — part of the “lean production” methods imported from auto manufacturing to the health care industry — with a series of successful shop floor actions. Since then thousands of Chicago-area healthcare workers participated in two major strikes. The first was in defiance of a court injunction and the second won unions’ demands for higher wages and safe staffing. In the Bay Area over three thousand county health care workers — led by Labor Notes–trained rank-and-file reformers — successfully struck last fall against austerity. Seven hundred nurses in Massachusetts have been on strike for six months for safe staffing and protective equipment. Thirty-five thousand workers at health care giant Kaiser authorized a strike earlier this month to fight among other issues against the introduction of a two-tier wage system. Traditional segments of the private sector like construction and manufacturing are still important battlegrounds too as shown by recent strikes by Washington carpenters and Nabisco workers. There are still about a million auto workers in the United States 50000 of whom struck against General Motors in 2019 while a national rank-and-file movement is fighting to democratize the United Auto Workers (UAW). Ten thousand UAW members at John Deere walked off the job last month along with 14000 Kellogg’s workers. Sixty thousand film and TV workers almost struck before a deal was narrowly reached recently. While US labor has been disorganized by a decline in traditional industrial employment since the mid-twentieth century there are important new openings for organizing today. Socialist advance in the twenty-first century will rest in part on our ability to make the most of these opportunities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25nbG9iZS9uYW1lL2Vkd2FyZC1tZXJyaWZpZWxkLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxNjA5ODU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EDWARD MERRIFIELD Obituary (1935 - 2021) - Cambridge MA - Boston Globe,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/bostonglobe/name/edward-merrifield-obituary?id=31609859 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25nbG9iZS9uYW1lL2Vkd2FyZC1tZXJyaWZpZWxkLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxNjA5ODU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Kansas News Service

In Oregon a city is hiding from a newspaper how much of the region’s precious water Google uses to cool its servers — claiming it’s a Google trade secret.

A Utah county refused to show a disability rights center its jail manuals for things such as hygiene and medical care — because the author had copyrighted them.

Virginia pre-emptively promised Amazon it would redact as much as it could get away with if any citizens asked for public records involving the company — to please the retail behemoth.

And in Kansas the state lets companies unhappy about public scrutiny simply black out documents themselves.

Now emails between Kansas and one of those private firms reveal just how little the state’s lawyers pushed back when asked to hide large swaths of an audit that cost taxpayers $100000.

The audit was meant to watchdog about $160 million in prescription drug spending on state employees though experts say it came nowhere near achieving that despite its hefty price tag.

Kansas bowed to the auditor’s wishes for secrecy even though an attorney for the state couldn’t find anything in the report that qualified for protection from public view.

“I have personally reviewed the original document” an open-records lawyer at the Kansas Department of Administration wrote in an email this summer “but was unable to find any information that appeared to fall under any statutory exception.”

Frank LoMonte director of the Brechner Center for Freedom of Information fears that governments increasingly let businesses rather than their own laws decide what the public can or cannot see.

“This is not a Kansas problem. It’s not an Oregon problem” he said. “It’s an everywhere problem.”

Governments regularly shirk transparency laws and point to the intellectual property rights of private vendors as the reason.

And in the case of Kansas it effectively outsources the redaction process to private companies that don’t work for the public that don’t have any legal obligation to follow open records law and that can’t be hauled before a judge for breaking it.

“That’s a really dangerous business” LoMonte said. “When you actually hand the document over and you invite people to use the black Magic Marker they have every incentive to overuse it.”

Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration has declined or ignored half a dozen Kansas News Service requests to interview either the lawyers involved in the redaction process Kelly herself or another person in her office who can speak to her administration’s approach to redacting public records.

State agencies sizing up risk

In recent months Kansas has allowed not just auditor PillarRx but also some of the nation’s wealthiest corporations — CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group — to redact various documents related to drug spending before handing them over to the Kansas News Service.

Kansas law tells state agencies to give reporters and other citizens the documents they seek within days. But in these cases the process took weeks or months.

Governments of course can get sued for overly redacting records — even if they acted at the behest of a private actor.

But governments see that risk as increasingly remote experts say.

Newsrooms and in particular newspapers have trimmed payrolls cut back on printing and even declared bankruptcy. So what are the chances that a media outlet will shell out thousands or tens of thousands of dollars on a court battle?

“If you’re sitting there in that legal counsel’s office or a state agency you’re sizing up your risks” LoMonte said. “You probably figure that ‘I’m much more likely to get sued by a giant multinational drug conglomerate than I am by a local radio station.’”

In the case of the PillarRx report — which is an audit of CVS’ pharmacy benefit work for the state of Kansas — the state allowed the auditor to black out whole paragraphs charts and even entire pages.

But the redactions were poorly done and many of the blacked-out portions remained accessible as a result.

That’s how the Kansas News Service was able to report on the content which one independent lawyer after another has concluded contains bread-and-butter public information.

Facts as simple as how many prescription drugs Kansas employees picked up in 2018 got the black-marker treatment. So did sample sizes and other audit details critical to understanding whether PillarRx did a good job policing CVS’ charges to the Kansas employee health plan.

Weirdly many of the blacked-out details — such as dispensing fees that Kansas pays to pharmacies — actually appear in other publicly released documents some even on the state’s own website.

Yet the state claimed the blacked-out details were privileged trade secrets.

“I’m confident” lawyer Bernie Rhodes said “that there are zero trade secrets in this report.”

Rhodes heads a national team of media lawyers for the law firm Lathrop GPM.

What the emails reveal

The Kelly administration won’t allow the Kansas News Service to interview its lawyers about the redactions. But state emails obtained through another open records request shed light on what happened.

On Aug. 11 the Kansas News Service asked for the audit.

That triggered concerns at the Department of Administration because PillarRx had written the words “confidential and proprietary” on its report.

The agency’s open records lawyer Tanner Asbury reached out to the contractor responsible for hiring subcontractor PillarRx. Asbury immediately suggested the option of blacking out content even though redaction should be a last resort under state law.

“If PillarRx does not wish to provide the record in its entirety” he wrote “is there a redacted version that could be provided instead?”

On Aug. 27 PillarRx provided such a version.

When Asbury opened the document he balked at what he saw: A sea of black.

“Could you please explain your reasoning?” he wrote back. “It appears as though all substantive portions of the document have been removed. The document we have received is essentially just the Table of Contents and Headings.”

“I have personally reviewed the original document but was unable to find any information that appeared to fall under any statutory exception” he added.

But the open records lawyer signaled that Kansas remained open to redacting.

“My fellow legal counsel and I feel that this record should be open to the public to some extent” Asbury wrote “but the redacted copy provided has too much information removed.”

PillarRx said that it needed to shield pharmaceutical pricing and audit methods from public view. It said it signed a nondisclosure agreement with pharmacy giant CVS — the very company it had been hired to watchdog.

So when it provided a second redacted version on Sept. 1 large swaths remained black though less than before.

“It’s true that we tend to error (sic) on the side of being ultraconservative” PillarRx wrote to Asbury. “The PillarRx team has taken the opportunity to review and ultimately revise the extent of the redaction in a manner that will hopefully be an acceptable compromise.”

Kansas approved the compromise.

Confidential vs. trade secret

Nowhere in the emails does PillarRx claim its report contains any trade secrets — only details that are proprietary and confidential.

“There’s a huge difference” said Rhodes at Lathrop GPM. “There is no exception in the Kansas Open Records Act for proprietary or confidential information … There’s no privilege for that.”

But Kansas had to “shoehorn” the redactions into some provision of law he said and so it told the Kansas News Service the redactions protected trade secrets which can enjoy a privilege that doesn’t apply to merely proprietary and confidential information.

What about the nondisclosure agreement PillarRx cited?

“So what?” Rhodes said. “It’s absurd to claim that a nondisclosure agreement prevents (Kansas) from complying with the Kansas Open Records Act.”

Governments that wrongly hide behind such agreements can face repercussions.

That happened in Missouri in 2015 when a local government near St. Louis refused to reveal how much it paid out for a personal injury settlement because the settlement included a nondisclosure clause. The courts forced the release and awarded the plaintiff a local resident attorney fees.

Rhodes considers the PillarRx situation even more baffling given public statements by the Kansas Department of Administration’s chief legal counsel John Yeary.

In October after the Kansas News Service published its story about the redacted audit Yeary faced questioning by Kansas Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt at a public meeting.

Schmidt is an independently elected official — not a part of the Department of Administration — but has oversight duties related to the state health plan. She sharply criticized the decision to black out public information.

“Do you stand by what was redacted?” she asked of Yeary.

“I won’t say I completely 100% agree with PillarRx on what they view as a trade secret or proprietary and confidential” Yeary replied. “I do feel like that our approach in responding as an agency where there are interests on both sides was appropriate.”

That floored Rhodes.

“I don’t understand how you can believe you did the right thing if you don’t share the view that it’s a trade secret” he said. “I don’t see how you can possibly agree with withholding it.”

The state’s duty to the public

The state has to carefully scrutinize any assertions by a private company that public records can’t be released said Lyndon Vix a Wichita media lawyer at law firm Fleeson Gooing.

Vix recently helped the Wichita Eagle get police body camera footage that the city of Wichita refused to hand over.

Even though Wichita’s violation of state law was so egregious that the court ultimately ordered the city to pay Vix’s fees the court battle took three years.

“We have case law in Kansas that specifically says that not all confidential information is a trade secret” he said.

“An audit takes information from sources and does an analysis and then reaches conclusions. And I have never heard of that type of process being classified as a trade secret.”

Trade secrets must be secret first of all. So blacked-out audit details that were easily available through other public documents don’t qualify. Trade secrets have to be economically valuable in and of themselves too. They need to be something vitally important to hide from competitors.

“It’s not like we’re dealing here with you know Pfizer’s formula for their vaccine or something” he said. “These are (audit) numbers. So to convert them into ‘trade secrets’ … is more of a process than just saying ‘This is confidential stuff.’”

Kansas should have insisted to PillarRx that its redactions must fit the Kansas definition of trade secrets Vix said and should have demanded to know whether and why PillarRx felt they did.

“It’s going to be very hard I’m sure for a lot of this information to fall within that definition” he said “because it is a fairly stringent definition.”

Yet the more Kansas and other governments help businesses dodge open records requests lawyers say the worse off the public will be.

“Government can’t just rubber-stamp a third-party’s request to label all its data a trade secret. That’s not how public records laws work” said Gunita Singh a lawyer for The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “If that were how it worked transparency would fly out the window.”

“The public would lose out on critical information about government spending” she said “and other insights into how government and business are prioritizing — or sabotaging — our well-being.”

The Liverpool charity was set up in memory of 12-year-old Oliver who suffered a sudden cardiac arrest while taking part in a swimming race at King David High School in 2011.

In September Oliver's parents accepted the Special Recognition Awards at the Echo Awards on behalf of the foundation which has worked tirelessly for the last decade to install defibrillators in schools across the country.

Oliver's dad Mark believes his son would still be alive had there been a defibrillator at the school and the foundation has lobbied government to pass legislation making it mandatory for every institution to have the life-saving equipment installed.

Mr King gave a powerful speech after receiving a £5000 cheque from sponsors Societe Generale.

Another local success story was Professor Frank Joseph - a world-leading physician in Endocrinology and Diabetes at the Countess of Chester Hospital - who was named Lifetime Achievement Award winner.

He has been leading the fighting against the Coronavirus pandemic for the NHS and private medical and diagnostics company DAM Health - based in Mossley Hill.

The awards in association with headline sponsor UnitedHealth Group celebrate leading diversity and inclusion champions while recognising achievements across race age sexual orientation disability gender identity and religious belief over the past year.

The ceremony took place on November 11 at the Landmark Hotel London and was hosted by actress and author Sophie Ward.

The star-studded event saw a host of celebrities turn out for the occasion with big names from the worlds of entertainment music and royalty showing their support.

Professor Frank Joseph who was bestowed with honour by the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson at the ceremony said: “It is a real honour to be named winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award. We have had a tough 18 months with a horrendous virus which has caused so much suffering for thousands of families across the country.

“I was among so many deserving recipients and fantastic companies who are all playing their part in fighting for a fairer diverse and more inclusive Britain.”

Linda Riley European Diversity Awards founder said: “When the country was experiencing a devastating surge in the number of Covid cases and catastrophic infection rates the assistance of Dam Health Group’s Professor Frank Joseph saved countless lives. We celebrated the brave and brilliant efforts he has made to provide the highest level of care for people both at home and abroad in this time of crisis.

“Every deserving winner has made real achievements in race age sexual orientation disability gender identity or religious belief over the past year. The corporations and business leaders who picked up awards are dynamic and reflect the huge efforts corporate organisations are now making to improve diversity and inclusion. We should never forget how far we've come but there is still so much more to do.”",,,,,,

Mental health is a disease that affects an estimated 792 million people worldwide. Yet when people live in poverty and lack the money to attain basic needs mental health often falls on the back burner. This is especially true in Norway. Though the country has a low poverty rate coupled with substantial efforts to improve access to and quality of mental health care about half of all people in Norway experience a mental health disorder at some point in their life and these numbers are rising in the wake of COVID-19.

Health Care in Norway

Norway offers universal health care coverage to all of its citizens and extends this service to all citizens from the European Union. It receives funding through general taxes and payroll contributions by employees and provides a variety of services with mental health being one of them. In 1956 this system called the National Insurance Scheme became a right for all Norway citizens. Though it ensures access to local municipalities and general practitioners patients that require long-term or outpatient care must pay a fraction of it making services unattainable for some poorer citizens.

How Does Economic Status Influence Mental Health?

Mental health problems can arise in anyone regardless of age socioeconomic status or demographic group. The ways these disorders affect the individual vary. However people in poverty are more susceptible as a large factor fueling these disorders is one’s life situation. In fact life factors like disability unemployment sicknesses and others drive common mental illnesses like depression and anxiety.

A study that the International Journal for Equity in Health published found “the prevalence of psychological distress increasing by decreasing social status” and noted economic problems as a major factor of it. Life factors like living in poverty have proven to increase levels of mental health disorders but so do perceived living situations. Another study published in Science Direct investigated Norwegian adolescents’ view of living status. It found that if people felt they were impoverished or living in a low-income household they had higher instances of mental health disorders. This perception it found might even be more influential than actual living conditions.

Impact of Mental Health Disorders on Norwegians

Estimates have determined that nearly 15% of children worldwide suffer from a mental health disorder. In 2018 16.5% of Norwegians 15 to 24 years old reported experiencing “severe psychological distress.” Typically mental disorders manifest as early as 14 years of age with personality and anxiety disorders developing as early as 11 years old. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said that “without early and effective treatment and inclusion in society young people with mental disorders risk becoming lifetime users of adult mental health services.” On top of this instances of mental illness in children and young adults are particularly concerning since they lead to poorer education and difficulty transitioning into the workplace. Consequently affected individuals earn lower incomes as adults if not treated properly at a young age.

Concerningly in the last decade Norway experienced an increase in permanent poverty among children a factor that directly relates to mental health. Oslo the country’s capital has notable disparities in income throughout the city’s districts. This impacts mental health in Norway since living in city districts with high-income inequality like in much of Oslo lowers the probability of accessing mental health services according to a study by Jon Finnvold of Oslo Metropolitan University. The study also highlighted that kids living in lower-income households experienced a higher risk of behavioral or mental problems.

What is Norway Doing to Improve Mental Health Services?

Notably in the past few decades there has been substantial investment in mental health services in Norway. Between 1999 and 2008 it invested NOK 6.3 billion ($735 739 200) into the Escalation Plan for Mental Health. This investment lowered suicide rates and helped improve services already provided by municipalities and increased access to children.

However there are still discrepancies in access to care for mental health in Norway largely based on socioeconomic status. Any problems Norway faced with its mental health care system only became more pronounced during the pandemic: like all countries it saw an increase in patients requesting mental health assistance especially in early 2020 the onset of the pandemic. A lot of these increases as scientists speculate in a study that VOX EU published come from the effects of lockdown and movement restrictions. Scientists are looking to policymakers as they enforced said lockdowns and draw on this evidence to show the harm isolation has on people’s overall mental health.

In no way do mental health problems only affect Norway; they also affect the entire world without discrimination planting its seeds in the minds of the richest and the poorest of citizens belonging to any race ethnicity or income level. Yet people with lower incomes and of a minority ethnicity are particularly vulnerable to feeling the weight of these illnesses as they have less access to services.

In Norway the government’s universal health care system calls for equal access to all health services including mental health but it is just not the case. Those needing more comprehensive care still must pay a portion out of pocket a bill that not everyone can afford to pay. Oslo specifically is home to unequal access a direct result of the stark income discrepancies throughout the city. Norway has made substantial progress through mental health investment but there is always a need to reach more people to focus on the vulnerable populations to ensure they have the same opportunity for care as everyone else. There are still people not receiving care as costs remain a barrier for those needing extensive treatment.

According to the World Health Organization’s ranking of the most efficient healthcare systems France delivers the highest quality of healthcare of any country. From its high ratio of doctors to patients to the length of wait times France consistently delivers strong results.

Expats love the system along with life in France in general. An impressive 78 percent report being satisfied with life in France. In fact 40 percent of them have no plans of ever leaving. Of course that doesn’t mean there isn’t a steep learning curve. If you hope to join this group of happy adventurers living overseas here are the basics that you need to know about navigating the French healthcare system.

1. France Has Universal Healthcare

The French healthcare system is premised on universal healthcare. The system is known as the Protection Maladie Universelle (PUMA) and it was recently revamped in 2016 to be more comprehensive and affordable. This overhaul brought some much-needed change.

The previous system known as Couverture Maladie Universelle (CMU) was also premised on universal healthcare but it was less all-encompassing. Patient access and costs were tied to employment status. Today a CMU-era program to provide free insurance to those with low income has been rolled into the PUMA system and other reforms have taken place so that an estimated 96 percent of all French residents are covered by the public healthcare system.

2. There’s A Focus On Preventative Care

Preventative healthcare is highly valued in France. All patients are entitled to a comprehensive preventative physical every five years. All hospitals are state-owned and regulated to be not-for-profit so there are few barriers if any to getting screening tests and seeing specialists.

Alternative healthcare methodologies are respected and if a patient wants to see an alternative practitioner for weight loss or smoking cessation help the healthcare system supports it.

3. Costs Are Extremely Low

The French healthcare system is funded through government sources and salary deductions. All employees pay into the system. A salary deduction of approximately 8 percent is designated to help pay for healthcare costs.

In general approximately 70 percent of healthcare costs including general practitioners hospitals dentists and pharmaceutical costs are covered by the government. Patients pay the remaining 30 percent. In practical terms patients can expect to pay about 10 euros for an emergency room visit and about 7 euros for a typical medical appointment. If you have to stay in the hospital for long-term treatment it costs about 18 Euros a day. The rates that doctors and hospitals can charge are regulated by the state. Senior citizens and those with chronic conditions have 100 percent of their medical costs covered.

4. Expats Are Included In Public Care

All legal residents in France are eligible for public healthcare coverage regardless of employment status. This is one of the biggest changes between the CMU system and the new PUMA system. Previously health coverage was tied to certain employment conditions — and a five-year residency period.

So what exactly is legal residency? First you must be living in France — legally — for three months. You must be living in France in a “stable and regular” manner. You must also be living in France for more than six months of the year. This means that short-term tourists aren’t eligible. Nor are people who spend the winter months in France but live elsewhere for the rest of the year. And as for “stable and regular” well that’s open to interpretation but you should be able to point to evidence that you intend to make your life in France. Having a job or volunteer program points to living in the country in a stable and regular manner as does renting an apartment and taking care of all other logistics that come with moving to a new country.

5. Signing Up For Healthcare Coverage Is A Bureaucratic Adventure

If there’s one thing that every country shares it’s a love of bureaucracy. France is no exception! As such you can expect a fair bit of paperwork on your journey to join the French healthcare system.

The first step for people born outside France is to register for a social security number at the local CPAM (Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie). To do so you will have to bring your passport visa (if applicable) birth certificate lease or rental agreement and proof of income. If you’re retired and no longer have employment income you’ll have to demonstrate that you have your own source of income (for example a pension or other savings). You’ll also have to prove that you’ve been in France and living as an expat for at least three months. Copies of utility bills and other pieces of mail like credit card statements are considered acceptable documentation.

If your documentation isn’t written in French you’ll need to get a notarized translation. If you’re not fluent in French it’s a good idea to have a bilingual friend to help you out.

Once you’re at the CPAM office you can also register for your national health card known as the Carte Vitale. You can also receive advice on how to register for a local doctor in your neighborhood. Carrying your Carte Vitale with you to any French healthcare appointment is essential. This little card allows you to be reimbursed directly from the health insurance fund for the consultation or treatment within a week meaning you don’t need to pay upfront aside from your small copay.

6. You Can’t Just Visit Any Doctor

Visiting a GP — with your Carte Vitale in Hand — is your first step when you need help. You are free to choose any doctor you prefer but you must register with them and declare them your primary physician in order to claim full coverage for your visits.

You can transfer to another doctor if you’re unhappy but — surprise! — there’s paperwork involved to do that. Checking in with other expats be it in person or via an online group is a good way to get a lead on local doctors who speak English and are familiar with the expat community.

7. You Also Can’t Just Visit Any Specialist

In some countries if you feel you need a dermatologist or cardiologist you can just call up the office and make an appointment. This isn’t the case in France. You need a physician’s referral to see a specialist. Otherwise you have to pay a larger copay (and specialists might refuse to see you altogether without a GP’s referral.) This system does come with benefits. Your GP can make an initial assessment and provide some treatment options or preliminary testing while you’re awaiting the specialist. They can also make sure you’re on the right track. Not all patients can easily distinguish whether they need to see a sports doctor or an orthopedic surgeon for instance.

However there are some exceptions to this rule. Patients don’t need a referral to see a gynecologist a pediatrician or an ophthalmologist. And those under 26 don’t need a referral to see a psychiatrist.

8. You Can Mix Public And Private Care

France may have an excellent healthcare system but it’s not without its challenges. Wait times for specialist referrals and hospital services are among the common complaints. As such many patients carry private health insurance to augment their public care.

In general patients in a public clinic or hospital can expect quicker services a greater degree of privacy and more comfortable surroundings. Private health insurance can also cover the cost of services not included in the public system. These include consultations with chiropractors physiotherapists and massage therapists. Private insurance also reimburses patients for the 30 percent copay that they typically pay at the hospital and medical appointments. While these out-of-pocket costs are quite small it’s nice to get them reimbursed if you can.

How can the care divide be bridged?,"Blacks and Hispanics in New Jersey fare worse than whites and Asians when it comes to overall health and access to care according to a national analysis by the Commonwealth Fund a New York-based nonprofit research group.

The analysis — which examined state-by-state data to assess health care access quality and outcomes for Blacks whites Hispanics Asian Americans Native Hawaiians Pacific Islanders and Native Americans — found that health systems generally are failing underserved groups in the Garden State and across the nation.

For instance whites and Asians in New Jersey fared in the 90th and 94th percentile respectively in the Commonwealth Fund’s overall health scoring system — well above the median — while Hispanics were at 47% and Blacks at 42%.

The score takes into account health outcomes access to care and the quality and use of care services.

Many factors contributing to the grave disparities are social determinants — such as nutrition housing and transportation — and need to be addressed experts say.

One of the most stark gulfs was found in frequency of death before the age of 75 from preventable and treatable conditions.

Blacks had the highest rate of such deaths — 141 per 100000. Whites were at 67 Hispanics at 55 and Asians at 37.

“It’s a common story” said David Radley a scientist and lead author of the study “Achieving Racial and Ethnic Equity in U.S. Health Care.” “New Jersey is similar to what we see in other parts of the country. We see overall better health performance for whites in New Jersey but for Latinos and Blacks we see below average [experiences].”

While New Jersey did not have as wide a racial or ethnic disparity as most other states Radley said the significance is that health and access to care is different for Blacks and Hispanics than it is for whites and Asians in the state.

“The important message is that even though New Jersey is doing better than say North Carolina or Mississippi there’s still a long way to go in New Jersey” Radley said. “Our findings point out that race is a big factor. [Health inequity] is rooted in long-standing structural racism in our country. Blacks have had the cards stacked against them not only in health care but other aspects of life.”

Blacks and Hispanics accounted for the highest percentage of uninsured adults and children in New Jersey and those most likely not to seek medical care because of the cost.

Asians fared best — and equal to whites — in many categories.

Radley said socioeconomics likely played a factor though he cautioned that there is wide diversity within Asian communities and Hispanic communities.

“It’s tough to know exactly” why Asians who also experience discrimination fared well in many categories he said. “It probably has something to do with higher income levels probably more on par with income levels for white people.”

The report noted that Hispanics have lower preventable mortality rates than whites and Blacks despite “their comparatively poor access to health care.”

“These lower rates could be related to immigration factors to a younger average age or to lower rates of risky health behaviors like smoking” the report said.

Nicole Harris-Hollingsworth the vice president of Social Determinants of Health at Hackensack Meridian Health said many factors in disparity of care can be easily addressed.

“Diabetes cancer access and insurance [are] all things that tend to be easily managed” Harris-Hollingsworth said. “This is a problem we can address and change. It’s not so entrenched that there’s no way to get rid of it.”

Hackensack Meridian Health is making an effort to address the social determinants that contribute to health by using a digital platform NowPow to connect patients to food banks rental and transportation assistance and other resources Harris-Hollingworth said.

They’ve made about 50000 referrals for assistance since this summer.

“One of every four patients we encounter has a need” Harris-Hollingworth added.

The Commonwealth Fund analysis showed some promising gains for underserved communities in New Jersey. Black women for instance had the highest rate of having mammograms among all groups. But at the same time they had the highest incidence of breast cancer deaths — 28 per 100000. That was higher than white women who were at 22 per 100000 and more than double that of Hispanics (12) and Asians (11).

“This is not the first time we’re seeing that” Radley said.

He speculated that while Black women are getting screened perhaps breast cancer is not being detected in them until it’s advanced. He said they did not have data that could provide context — such as what kind of treatment Black women diagnosed with cancer are getting compared to other women — for the discrepancy.

Dr. Richard Marlink the founding director of Rutgers Global Health Institute said it’s important to invest in “improving the social condition” of all groups which “then will improve health.”

“We’re still a country that doesn’t have universal health care” said Marlink who is a professor at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. “We’re a country with 30 million people who are uninsured and those are disproportionately people of color.”

Shereef Elnahal the CEO and president of University Hospital in Newark the state’s only public acute-care facility said it’s time to take the well-established fact that there are glaring racial and ethnic disparities in U.S. health care and start working on solutions.

“The Commonwealth Fund’s report is a well-done study that gives us an updated picture of disparities in health throughout the country and the bottom line is sobering” Elnahal said. “Race ethnicity and zip code should not be the primary determinants of health outcomes. But studies like this do not surprise people from our community.

“Many have told me that they are sick of simply hearing further characterizations of disparities in communities like theirs — they already know that there are disparities because they live through them. Instead we need the gears of policy to focus on executing against the societal root causes that lead to the disparities described in this report.”

El Parlamento de Francia aprobó el jueves pasado un proyecto de ley contra el maltrato animal que prohíbe la venta de perros y gatos en tiendas de mascotas de todo el país.

La normativa endurece también las penas impuestas por maltrato o abandono y limita el uso de animales salvajes en circos y delfinarios.

El ministro de Agricultura Julien Denormandie dijo que los animales de compañía no son “ni juguetes ni bienes de consumo” alegrándose porque de paso porque esta iniciativa es un “gran avance en la lucha contra el abandono de mascotas”.

Los números son alarmantes: cada año 100 mil mascotas son abandonadas. Para evitar esto el gobierno emitirá un “certificado de compromiso y conocimiento” antes de que las personas hagan cualquier adquisición.

A partir del 1 de enero del 2024 la venta de perros y gatos estará prohibida en todas las tiendas de mascotas además su venta estará mejor regulada en línea.

Francia también calificará de delito el asesinato deliberado de un animal de compañía por lo que ya no será solo una multa. Aquellos condenados por malos tratos deberán tomar un curso de sensibilización y se les prohibirá tener una mascota.

En el caso de los circos los animales salvajes ya no deberán presentarse en ellos en un plazo de dos años. Los dueños podrán conservarlos por un plazo de hasta siete años. Sobre los delfines y orcas estos podrán quedarse en los delfinarios hasta cinco años luego estarán prohibidos.

(CNN Business) -- Los precios de la gasolina se disparan y los estadounidenses quieren ahorrar en el surtidor. Eso juega directamente a favor de Costco BJ's Wholesale Club y Sam's Club.

El precio promedio de la gasolina a nivel nacional subió a US$ 341 el galón el viernes según AAA un 61% más alto que el promedio de la misma época del año pasado. El gobiern de Joe Biden ha pedido una investigación sobre si las compañías de petróleo y gas actuaron ilegalmente para hacer subir los precios.

El aumento ha empujado a más compradores a confiar en estas cadenas para llenar sus tanques dicen las empresas los analistas minoristas y los expertos en combustible. Los precios de la gasolina en los clubes de almacenes pueden ser hasta 30 centavos más bajos que en las estaciones de servicio tradicionales y las cadenas ofrecen a los miembros cupones para usar en sus tiendas cuando llenan sus tanques. Las ventas de gasolina en los clubes de almacenes son una parte importante de su negocio y atraen a los clientes.

""La gente busca los clubes debido a la gasolina"" dijo Michael Baker analista minorista de D.A. Davidson. ""Es natural de los consumidores estadounidenses hacer todo lo posible por bajar los precios de la gasolina"".

Costco por ejemplo suele estar 20 centavos el galón por debajo del promedio del mercado según Tom Kloza jefe global de análisis de energía del Servicio de Información de Precios del Petróleo de IHS Markit. BJ dice que está 10 centavos por debajo del promedio.

Estas empresas son ""ganadoras cuando los precios de la gasolina se disparan"" dijo Kloza.

La inflación en EE.UU. se dispara y los precios suben al 62% 0:56

Costco Sam's Club y BJ's quieren que llenes tu tanque en sus estacionamientos y luego te abastezcas con jarrones gigantes de salsa de tomate cajas de bocadillos y ropa. (¿Y por qué no comprar un televisor de pantalla plana o un sofá nuevo mientras lo haces?). Sus estaciones de servicio le dan a estos almacenes una ventaja que muchos competidores minoristas no pueden igualar.

La gasolina representa alrededor del 10% US$ 20.000 millones anuales de las ventas totales de Costco y el 9% de las BJ. Walmart propietaria de Sam's Club no revela qué parte de sus ventas provienen de la venta de gasolina.

La gasolina es un negocio notoriamente de bajo margen pero los minoristas pueden ganar dinero vendiendo grandes volúmenes de gas incluso mientras cobran mucho menos que las estaciones de servicio independientes dijo Kloza y agregó que no es inusual que las ventas en una ubicación de Costco alcancen hasta 1 millón de galones al mes en comparación con un promedio de 80.000 galones al mes en las estaciones de servicio típicas.

A pesar de sus grandes marcas la gran mayoría de las gasolineras de Exxon Chevron BP y Shell son de propiedad independiente por lo que no pueden jugar con el volumen como lo hacen los mayoristas. Si bien los mayoristas pueden obtener ganancias con el gas no obtienen mucho: Costco por ejemplo informó que la gasolina tiene un margen de ganancia menor que el resto de su negocio. El aumento de los precios de la gasolina suele ayudar a las ventas de Costco pero perjudica sus ganancias.

""Cuando hay presiones inflacionarias y los precios suben la gente busca ahorrar en gasolina"" dijo Richard Galanti director financiero de Costco. Por cada 100 personas que vienen a Costco para cargar gasolina más de la mitad van a comprar después dijo.

Las ventas de gasolina en BJ's Wholesale Club aumentaron un 20% durante su trimestre más reciente que finalizó el 30 de octubre en comparación con el mismo período del año anterior.

BJ's aumenta su participación en el mercado de la gasolina ""a pasos agigantados"" dijo el jueves el presidente ejecutivo Robert Eddy en una llamada con analistas. Cuando los precios de la gasolina superan los US$ 3 el galón ""los miembros nos aman"" y trasladan su gasto de gasolina al club.

Los descuentos en gasolina son una herramienta que usa Walmart para alentar a los clientes a inscribirse en las membresías de Walmart+ que también ofrece envío gratuito y descuentos en recetas.

Walmart dijo el martes que está tratando activamente de mantener bajos los precios de la gasolina para atraer a los clientes que están preocupados por cuánto están pagando especialmente a medida que disminuyen los beneficios del estímulo federal.

""Los precios de la gasolina son una preocupación... Han subido drásticamente en comparación con hace un año"" dijo el director ejecutivo de Walmart Doug McMillon en una conferencia telefónica sobre ganancias. ""Los clientes tenían dinero [entonces]. Y en algún momento eso va a llegar a su fin"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saWJyZW1lcmNhZG8uY29tLzIwMjEtMTEtMjAvZXN0b3Mtc29uLWxvcy1naWdhbnRlcy1tdW5kaWFsZXMtZGUtbG9zLW1pY3JvY2hpcHMtcXVlLWhhY2VuLXRhbWJhbGVhci1hbC1tdW5kby02ODM2ODAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Estos son los gigantes mundiales de los microchips que hacen tambalear al mundo,"Los microchips son en esencia pequeñas piezas planas de un material semiconductor (comúnmente silicio) sobre las que se montan un conjunto de circuitos electrónicos. Estos circuitos están compuestos principalmente por diminutos transistores y están muy solicitados ya sea para un fabricar un ordenador un teléfono móvil o una videoconsola.

Actualmente la mayor concentración de empresas especializadas en la fabricación de microchips se encuentra en el continente asiático. Samsung y TSMC son de las más potentes.

Samsung

Samsung es una empresa surcoreana fundada en 1938 y especializada en teléfonos móviles y televisiones. Según IC Insights en 2020 fue la segunda compañía con más ventas de chips en el mundo.

Por tanto Samsung vive actualmente un buen momento. Según la BBC el gigante tecnológico espera que su beneficio trimestral aumente un 53% en medio de la escasez mundial de chips. De hecho la fuerte demanda de chips de memoria ha compensado el debilitamiento de las ventas de sus dispositivos debido a la escasez de componentes.

Para el tercer trimestre del año la compañía prevé un beneficio operativo de 158 billones de wones (11.470 millones de euros) lo que supone un incremento del 279% en comparación con su resultado del mismo periodo de 2020.

En cuanto al beneficio operativo de la división de chips de Samsung en el trimestre de julio a septiembre las ganancias aumentaron un 82% con respecto al año anterior hasta los 1006 billones de wones (7.414.600 millones de euros) mientras que los ingresos crecieron un 40%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing

Por otro lado TSMC es una empresa taiwanesa que se fundó en 1987. Desde entonces ha sido la principal fundición de semiconductores del mundo. En 2020 TSMC desplegó 281 tecnologías de proceso distintas y fabricó 11.617 productos para 510 clientes. Según IC Insights en 2020 fue la tercera compañía con más ventas de chips en el mundo

Solo TSMC fue responsable del 24% de la producción mundial de semiconductores en 2020 frente al 21% de 2019 según Semi Conductor Association. TSMC es responsable del 92% de la producción de los chips más avanzados en superordenadores iPhones y la IA de los automóviles según Capital Economics.

Los resultados del tercer trimestre así lo corroboran. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing incrementó un 138% su beneficio neto en el tercer trimestre hasta 156.259 millones de dólares taiwaneses (4.806 millones de euros) según informó la compañía. Entre julio y septiembre las ventas netas de TSMC aumentaron un 163% interanual hasta un récord de 414.671 millones de dólares taiwaneses (12.755 millones de euros).

Además TSMC es la primera fundición que ofrece capacidades de producción de 5 nanómetros la tecnología de proceso de semiconductores más avanzada disponible en el mundo. Según The Wall Street Journal actualmente es es una de las 10 empresas más valiosas del mundo con un valor de mercado de más de 550.000 millones de dólares (unos 480.64318 millones de euros).

TSMC fabrica componentes clave para todo tipo de productos desde teléfonos móviles hasta aviones de combate F-35 o la misión Perseverance Rover de la NASA a Marte. En 2024 TSMC empezará a fabricar chips de 5 nanómetros en Phoenix Arizona planta de fabricación de 12.000 millones de dólares (unos 10.484 millones de euros) según indica REUTERS.

Intel

Intel es una empresa estadounidense fundada en 1968 por Robert Noyce Andy Grove y Gordon Moore. Su nombre se deriva del acrónimo de Integrated Electronics Corporation (Intel). Es la compañía que inventó y desarrolló la arquitectura x86. Esta arquitectura es la que se usa actualmente tanto para los procesadores de portátiles como para los ordenadores de sobremesa.

Según IC Insights en 2020 fue la compañía con más ventas de chips en el mundo. Siguiendo con el informe Intel también lidera la lista de los mayores fabricantes de chips de mundo con un total de 18.076 millones de dólares (16.01346 millones de euros) facturados.

El fabricante estadounidense de procesadores Intel obtuvo un beneficio neto de 6.823 millones de dólares (5.860 millones de euros) en el tercer trimestre de 2021 lo que representa un incremento del 596% en comparación con sus cuentas del mismo periodo del año anterior. ""El tercer trimestre destacó aún más la demanda mundial de semiconductores donde Intel tiene la amplitud y escala únicas para liderar"" declaró Pat Gelsinger consejero delegado de Intel.

Intel está construyendo en su campus de Ocotillo en Chandler (Arizona) dos plantas de semiconductores que se espera que entren en funcionamiento en 2024. Con esto pretenden ayudar a paliar la escasez de microchips en Estados Unidos como indicó Engineering News-Records. Además la multinacional estadounidense está considerando ""varios países"" para ubicar las fábricas de microchips que anunció que instalaría en Europa donde avanzó inversiones por valor de unos 80.000 millones de euros durante la próxima década sin que de momento haya tomado una decisión al respecto. Actualmente ya tienen una fábrica en Irlanda donde ya operan y producen microchips.

Las instalaciones de Intel en Europa contribuirían a que las cadenas de suministro sean más resistentes y al objetivo de la Unión Europea (UE) de duplicar su participación en la fabricación mundial de chips del 9% al 20% para 2030.

Empresas que quieren salir de la dependencia

Sony es una de las grandes perjudicadas por la escasez de microchips y ya tiene un plan para solucionar su problema. Según ha avanzado el diario económico Nikkei Sony y TSMC estudiar levantar una planta en Kumamoto (Japón) para fabricar sus propias piezas. La planta estaría lista para 2024 y fabricaría microprocesadores para varios productos que han sufrido por la escasez como las consolas de videojuegos.

La inversión total del proyecto se estima en 800.000 millones de yenes (6.16034 millones de euros) y se espera que el gobierno japonés aporte hasta la mitad de la cantidad. Aunque tanto Sony como TSMC han decidido no hacer comentarios al respecto del informe de Nikkei.

La gran multinacional japonesa es uno de los fabricantes más importantes a nivel mundial en electrónica de consumo: computación videojuegos audio y vídeo fotografía telefonía móvil productos profesionales... Play Station es uno de sus grandes éxitos pero actualmente es casi imposible comprar la Play Station 5 por la falta de oferta y stock ya que necesitan muchos microchips para poder fabricarlas.

Apple es otra de las empresas a la que le está afectando la escasez de microchips. Tanto es así que la firma dejará de fabricar hasta 10 millones de unidades del nuevo iPhone 13 por este problema.

En junio la multinacional anunciaba que comenzaría a equipar los ordenadores Mac con sus propios chips y completar una transición en aproximadamente dos años. ""A partir de esta arquitectura Apple está diseñando una familia de chips para el Mac"" explicaba la compañía.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyZW5hcHVibGljYS5jb20vcG9saXRpY2FzLXB1YmxpY2FzL21leGljby1sZWpvcy1kZS1sYS10ZW5kZW5jaWEtZ2xvYmFsLWRlLW1hc2lmaWNhci1sYS12ZW50YS1kZS1hdXRvcy1lbGVjdHJpY29z0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyZW5hcHVibGljYS5jb20vcG9saXRpY2FzLXB1YmxpY2FzL21leGljby1sZWpvcy1kZS1sYS10ZW5kZW5jaWEtZ2xvYmFsLWRlLW1hc2lmaWNhci1sYS12ZW50YS1kZS1hdXRvcy1lbGVjdHJpY29zP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,México lejos de la tendencia global de masificar la venta de autos eléctricos,"El desconocimiento del público y la falta de incentivos (fiscales y no fiscales) impedirían vender solo autos eléctricos en México para 2040 al que se comprometió el gobierno en la COP26.

En agosto pasado se vendieron poco menos de cuatro mil unidades eléctricas (EV's) e híbridas en todo el país según datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (Inegi). Con respecto a las ventas totales al público de vehículos ligeros durante ese mismo mes estos modelos más amigables con el medio ambiente representan apenas el 5.09% de las ventas locales. Si se consideran solo las ventas de EVs los únicos realmente cero emisiones la participación de autos verdes en el mercado mexicano fue de solo 2.67% en el mes.

No se espera que el rol de los vehículos “verdes” sea mucho más protagónico en el mediano plazo. En septiembre Francisco Garza presidente de General Motors México -la empresa con mayores ventas en el país- advirtió que la adopción tecnológica de México tardaría más respecto a lo observado en mercados líderes como Estados Unidos.

Lo anterior significaría que para 2030 dijo Garza “la venta de los vehículos eléctricos en México será aproximadamente el 15% del total para ese año calendario”. Es decir para el cierre de la década solamente se habrá logrado triplicar la participación de los autos eléctricos en el mercado mexicano según GM México.

Estas estimaciones muestran que el objetivo al que se suscribió la Secretaría de Economía (SE) durante la más reciente Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático 2021 (COP26) de vender únicamente coches cero emisiones para 2040 está fuera del alcance si se mantiene el ritmo actual.

Detrás de éstos pobres pronósticos están barreras para el crecimiento de la industria automotriz eléctrica en el país como la reticencia de los gobiernos locales y federal para impulsar este mercado. Según Claudia Rodríguez directora de Proyectos Estratégicos Electrificación y Experiencia al Cliente de Nissan Mexicana “aún hay una gran oportunidad en implementar incentivos fiscales y no fiscales para promover el uso y adquisición de estas tecnologías”.

Sin embargo la directiva también señala que “uno de los grandes desafíos al que nos enfrentamos hoy en día es que el consumidor no distingue claramente entre todas las tecnologías alternativas que existen en el mercado”. Para Rodríguez ""es necesario que los compradores de México conozcan “qué opciones tienen y qué beneficios le otorgan cada una para que pueda tomar una decisión mucho más informada”.

Autos eléctricos mexicanos sin apoyos claros

En el discurso las autoridades mexicanas han mostrado interés en la oportunidad que representa un sector automotriz eléctrico a mediano plazo. La titular de la Unidad de Inteligencia Económica Global de la SE Mónica Duhem Delgado dijo en un foro reciente que en México “tenemos todos los insumos y la capacidad técnica para ser un líder en este mercado” tanto para la exportación de modelos como para el consumo local de este tipo de autos.

Pero las pocas iniciativas de “fomento” a los autos eléctricos han sido muy modestas. Por ejemplo la Secretaría del Medio Ambiente (Sedema) de la Ciudad de México (CDMX) se sumó en 2017 a una iniciativa para impulsar la compra de vehículos de bajas emisiones. Sin embargo el proyecto se limitó a calificar los autos que fueran vendidos en la capital según su impacto en la calidad del aire confiando que así los consumidores podrían “tomar decisiones mejor informadas sobre los contaminantes que emiten las diferentes marcas y submarcas de automóviles”.

Pero la muestra más clara de esta falta de interés en los hechos ha sido el acuerdo al que se suscribió el gobierno federal en la COP26. En ese acuerdo la SE se listó entre gobiernos emergentes y economías en desarrollo junto a Ghana India Kenia Marruecos Ruanda Turquía y otros países similares.

Pero pudo haberse anotado en el grupo de “mercados líderes” (como sí lo hicieron otras naciones y ciudades latinoamericanas entre ellas Chile El Salvador Uruguay Buenos Aires Río de Janeiro y Sao Paulo) para quienes el compromiso de vender solo autos cero-emisiones debe cumplirse a más tardar en 2035.

No solo eso sino que en el comunicado de la SE anunciando su participación en este acuerdo reafirmó desde las primeras líneas del documento que se trata de “una declaración de carácter no vinculante”. Más como aspiración que como obligación.

Esta falta de proactividad de las autoridades públicas podría estar retrasando los planes de las principales empresas automotrices globales asentadas en el país. De acuerdo con Claudia Rodríguez en México “se tiene el potencial para producir vehículos con esta tecnología” pero deja saber que Nissan aún estudia “si es la opción más acorde a las necesidades del negocio y a la demanda del mercado”.

Y más allá de incentivos financieros la directiva afirma que hay varios fomentos no-fiscales particularmente en el entorno de infraestructura que podrían crearse para mejorar las ventas de autos eléctricos en México como “estacionamientos preferenciales descuentos en parquímetros autopistas y carriles preferenciales entre muchos otros que ya existen en el resto del mundo”.

Desconocimiento del consumidor

A pesar de la falta de apoyos directos desde la esfera pública la misma inercia de la industria automotriz mexicana ha permitido que nazcan proyectos para la manufactura de autos eléctricos en México. Y algunos de ellos incluso contemplan vender a consumidores locales.

Tanto Ford como General Motors confirmaron este mismo año que empezarían a producir ciertos autos eléctricos en la frontera norte de México trayendo inversiones valuadas en miles de millones de dólares (MMD) y hasta dejando de lado planes de manufacturar modelos en fábricas estadounidenses. Incluso productoras más pequeñas como la alemana Next.e.GO Mobile y la mexicana Zacua confirmaron también hace poco su intención de escalar operaciones locales.

Para estos proyectos el reto a superar es el relativo desinterés y desconocimiento de los consumidores mexicanos en los modelos cero-emisiones. De acuerdo con un censo realizado por Morning Consult en julio México fue el país donde se registró el menor interés en comprar autos eléctricos de las nueve naciones analizadas.

Y aunque los modelos eléctricos tienen rangos cada vez más extensos tiempos de carga más reducidos y los problemas con sus baterías se han ido superando un estudio de Deloitte señala que en pleno 2021 aún para el 58% de los compradores mexicanos alguno de estos temas es la principal preocupación a la hora de comprar un EV.

Claudia Rodríguez apunta que desde Nissan han tratado de combatir estas percepciones y falta de disposición destacando las ventajas de los autos eléctricos como “el ahorro en el costo de mantenimiento menor comparado con un vehículo convencional [poder] circular 24/7 los 365 días del año sin importar contingencias estar exento de tenencia y del pago del Impuesto Sobre Autos Nuevos (ISAN)”.

Pero también admite que solo es posible “alcanzar las metas propuestas a través del trabajo conjunto y la participación de los tres niveles de la sociedad. El gobierno por medio de la creación de oportunidades para desarrollar infraestructura; el compromiso del sector empresarial para contar con portafolios que incluyan alternativas de conducción; y el voto de confianza de la sociedad para confiar en la labor que hacemos para llevar a un mundo mejor a través de más autonomía más electrificación y más conectividad”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ0dmUuZXMvcnR2ZS8yMDIxMTEyMS9sb3RlcmlhLW5hdmlkYWQtYW5hcGFsLWF1bWVudG8tdmVudGFzLWxvdGVyb3MtZGVjaW1vcy8yMjIzNTYwLnNodG1s0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAucnR2ZS5lcy9ydHZlLzIwMjExMTIxL2xvdGVyaWEtbmF2aWRhZC1hbmFwYWwtYXVtZW50by12ZW50YXMtbG90ZXJvcy1kZWNpbW9zLzIyMjM1NjAuc2h0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lotería de Navidad 2021: ANAPAL predice un aumento de ventas,"Cada año una ilusión: jugar en el Sorteo Extraordinario de la Lotería de Navidad el 22 de diciembre.

Austin-based construction technology company ICON said they are working with Miami-based home builder Lennar to build 100 homes in the Austin area.

The project scheduled to break ground in 2022 will feature single-story homes with varying floor plans designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group.

According to Melodie Yashar Director of Design and Building Performance at ICON the wall system in each home will be built using the company’s proprietary cementitious-based material called ""Lavacrete."" The material is stronger and longer-lasting than traditional building materials and it allows the homes to withstand extreme weather.

Once the first floor walls are printed using ICON’s Vulcan construction system roofs are added and Lennar builders finish out the homes using traditional construction methods. The roof of each home will feature solar panels.

The construction system can create homes and structures up to 3000 square feet that are built to the International Building Code structural code standard and expected to last as long or longer than standard Concrete Masonry Unit built homes ICON representatives said.

“Additive manufacturing has the potential to revolutionize the built environment as it gets adopted by the industry at scale” Martin Voelkle Partner at the Bjarke Ingels Group said. “By partnering with ICON and Lennar we are able to see this new technology roll out to the widest possible audience. The 3D-printed architecture and the photovoltaic roofs are innovations that are significant steps towards reducing waste in the construction process as well as towards making our homes more resilient sustainable and energy self-sufficient.”

Construction using the Vulcan system is estimated to take about a week to 3D print the walls of each home and ICON plans to have a fleet of five printers delivering the 100-home community starting in 2022 Yashar said.

According to ICON representatives the 3D printing technology produces energy-efficient homes faster than conventional construction methods with less waste and more design freedom allowing the projects to stay on schedule and on budget.

ICON

LENx an arm of Lennar working to disrupt the homebuilding industry through innovation designed and engineered for the fast and precise 3D printing of numerous homes.

“Labor and material shortages are two of the biggest factors pushing the dream of home ownership out of reach for many American families” Eric Feder President of LENx said. “Lennar has always expanded the boundaries of technological innovation to keep quality homes affordable and 3D printing is an immensely encouraging approach. We are excited to collaborate with ICON to develop solutions to emerging challenges in the coming years.”

According to ICON representatives the neighborhood will be the largest of its kind in the world.

“ICON exists as a response to the global housing crisis and to put our technology in service to the world” ICON co-founder and CEO Jason Ballard said. “Construction-scale 3D printing not only delivers higher-quality homes faster and more affordably but fleets of printers can change the way that entire communities are built for the better. The United States faces a deficit of approximately 5 million new homes so there is a profound need to swiftly increase supply without compromising quality beauty or sustainability and that is exactly the strength of our technology.""

Pricing and move-in dates will be made available in 2022.

This isn't the first time 3D-printed buildings made headlines in Texas. Earlier this year the Texas Military Department unveiled a similar 3D-printed structure in Bastrop.

Icon

The military barracks at the Camp Swift Training Center are more than 3800-square-feet and is used to train up to 72 soldiers and airmen.

""Texas has become a technological center of gravity within the nation"" Maj. Gen. Tracy Norris Adjutant General of Texas said. ""TMD is proud to be a conduit for introducing these innovative solutions into the military community.""

The Texas Military Department partnered with ICON and Logan Architecture to 3D print the barracks.

Icon

ICON also built a multi-home project in East Austin with developer 3Strands marking the first 3D-printed homes for sale in America.

The company has prototyped structures with the Defense Innovation Unit and United States Marine Corps 3D-printed a community of 500 square foot homes in Tabasco Mexico for local families experiencing extreme poverty and built the Chicon House the first permitted 3D-printed home in the United States.

Other developers across the country are working on similar projects. Several such 3D-printed zero-net energy neighborhoods are being built in Southern California by Palari Group a sustainable real estate developer based in Beverly Hills.

Palari Group is building 15 eco-friendly 3D-printed homes on a five-acre parcel of land in Rancho Mirage an upscale community in the Coachella Valley. The developer is also building 77 eco-friendly homes on a 23-acre parcel of land in Desert Hot Springs near Palm Springs.

According to the Palari Group website the California developer also has plans to build 3D-printed neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley Central Coast and Napa Valley.

As for ICON the construction company has its sights set on using its 3D printing technology far beyond the state of Texas.

The company has already begun what it calls ""off-world construction."" ICON has 3D-printed a prototype rocket landing pad for NASA as well as a surface habitat at NASA's Johnson Space Center to prepare for long-duration missions to Mars.

The company's current program with the Bjarke Ingels Group and NASA called Project Olympus aims to develop an autonomous additive construction system for further exploration of the Moon and imagine humanity's first home on another world ICON said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you were a fan of ""Saved by the Bell"" in the early 1990s you may recall being discombobulated by the sudden disappearance of two of the show's major stars — Tiffani Amber Thiessen as Kelly Kapowski and Elizabeth Berkley as Jessie Spano — in the sixth and final season of the series. Instead the fourth episode of that season titled ""The New Girl"" introduced a new female lead: a biker chick clearly not cowed by Zack's (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) status at the school. Smart and savvy Tori Scott played by Leanna Creel gets introduced to the gang when she puts her motorcycle in Zack's parking spot. She is quickly integrated into Bayside High life when she inadvertently walks into Principal Belding's office during a dance committee meeting and makes a well-received suggestion for its theme. She then gets roped into helping Lisa (Lark Voorhies) work on the event which almost messes up her school project with Zack.

Over the course of 10 episodes which were aired out of order between 1992 and 1993 not to mention interspersed with Kelly and Jesse episodes (many of which are not available on streaming services like Netflix right now) Tori functioned as part of the main cast. She dated Zack and she fully participated in the group's teen-oriented sitcom-friendly adventures. Her last episode was ""School Song"" in which the graduating seniors try to make their mark by revamping Bayside's anthem.

However she was nowhere to be seen when the cast graduated ending the series. So what happened to Creel anyway?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcGF1bGlja3JlcG9ydC5jb20vbmV3cy90aG9yb3VnaGJyZWQtcmFjaW5nL3JhZ2VyLXBvc3RzLXVwc2V0LWluLW9ha2xhbmQtc3Rha2VzLWF0LWdvbGRlbi1nYXRlLWZpZWxkc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rager Posts Upset In Oakland Stakes At Golden Gate Fields,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://paulickreport.com/news/thoroughbred-racing/rager-posts-upset-in-oakland-stakes-at-golden-gate-fields on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcGF1bGlja3JlcG9ydC5jb20vbmV3cy90aG9yb3VnaGJyZWQtcmFjaW5nL3JhZ2VyLXBvc3RzLXVwc2V0LWluLW9ha2xhbmQtc3Rha2VzLWF0LWdvbGRlbi1nYXRlLWZpZWxkc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

by DRONELIFE Staff Writer Ian M. Crosby

Today Walmart and Zipline announced the launch of their new instant delivery service in Pea Ridge Arkansas where the service will make on-demand deliveries of select health and wellness and consumable items from the Walmart Neighborhood Market.

“Zipline’s autonomous aircraft present an incredible opportunity to offer customers an on-demand delivery option for the items they need now such as a thermometer non-prescription medication or an emergency pack of diapers” said Tom Ward senior vice president Last Mile Delivery Walmart U.S. “Even more Zipline’s aircraft can help provide immediate access to needed items for both hard-to-reach and at-risk populations such as rural communities and elderly customers. By bringing this game-changing technology to the rural community of Pea Ridge Arkansas we’re continuing to look for ways to make shopping with Walmart convenient and easy – for everyone.”

Zipline Delivers for Walmart

Following the service’s initial announcement last fall Walmart and Zipline have been collaborating on the construction of a first-of-its kind 25-foot platform which serves as the infrastructure for take-off and landing. Located directly behind the Neighborhood Market the platform houses several of Zipline’s autonomous aircraft as well as its flight operations crew. Zipline’s aircraft are capable of servicing a 50-mile radius at full capacity.

Starting today eligible customers can begin placing orders by ordering through the Zipline app.

A Walmart associate will then hand the packaged product off to Zipline staff who prepare the aircraft for launch. The aircraft then departs to the customer’s home where it drops off the package and returns to the platform. The delivery status can be tracked through the Zipline app.

“We’ve seen firsthand the impact that instant logistics can have in making important even life saving products available on a moment’s notice” said Zipline co-founder and CEO Keller Rinaudo. “At the same time the past two years have proven the need to bring health products closer to home where they are more accessible. Working with Walmart we’re able to bring this type of service to Northwest Arkansas showcasing what the future of health access looks like.”

“Only two weeks after Walmart launched its autonomous truck delivery system in Northwest Arkansas the company is launching its autonomous aircraft service” said Governor Asa Hutchinson. “Walmart and its partners such as Zipline are harnessing customer-friendly technology with such lightning speed that the future is becoming a reality far sooner than many Arkansans thought possible.”

Zipline first started operating in 2016. Since then the company has carried out more than 200000 commercial deliveries of over 4.5 million units of medical supplies serving more than 20 million people across multiple countries.

Gas prices are skyrocketing and Americans want to save at the pump. That plays right into the hands of Costco BJ’s Wholesale Club and Sam’s Club.

The national gas price average jumped to $3.41 a gallon Friday according to AAA 61% higher than the average at the same time last year. The Biden administration has called for an investigation into whether oil and gas companies acted illegally to push up prices.

The spike has pushed more shoppers to rely on these chains to fill up their tanks say the companies retail analysts and fuel experts. Gas prices at warehouse clubs can be as much as 30 cents lower than traditional gas stations and the chains offer members coupons to use in their stores when they fill up. Gasoline sales at the warehouse clubs are an important part of their business and draw customers inside.

“People are seeking out the clubs because of the gas” said Michael Baker a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson. “It’s US consumers’ nature to go out of their way for lower gas prices.”

Costco for example is typically 20 cents a gallon below the market average according to Tom Kloza the global head of energy analysis at IHS Markit’s Oil Price Information Service. BJ’s says it’s 10 cents below average.

These companies are “winners when gasoline prices go skyward” said Kloza.

Costco (COST) Sam’s Club and BJ’s (BJ) want you to fill up your tank in their parking lots and then go stock up on giant jugs of ketchup boxes of snacks and clothing. (And why not buy a flat-screen TV or a new couch while you’re at it?) Their gas stations give these warehouse stores an advantage that many retail competitors can’t match.

Gas makes up around 10% $20 billion annually of Costco’s overall sales and 9% of BJ’s. Walmart (WMT) which owns Sam’s Club does not disclose what portion of its sales come from gas.

Gas is a notoriously low-margin business but retailers can make money from selling huge volumes of gas – even while charging much less than independent gas stations said Kloza adding that it’s not unusual for sales at a Costco location to reach up to 1 million gallons a month compared to an average of 80000 gallons a month at typical gas stations.

Despite their big-brand names the vast majority of Exxon Chevron BP and Shell gas statons are independently owned so they aren’t able to make a volume play like wholesalers do. Although wholesalers are able to make a profit on gas they’re not making much: Costco for example reported that gasoline has a lower profit margin than the rest of its business. Rising gas prices typically help Costco’s sales but hurt its profits.

“When there are inflationary pressures and prices are going up people look to save on gas” said Richard Galanti Costco’s chief financial officer. For every 100 people who come to Costco to fill up on gas more than half go shop inside afterwards he said.

Gas sales at BJ’s Wholesale Club jumped 20% during its most recent quarter ending October 30 compared with the same time a year ago.

BJ’s is growing market share in gasoline “in leaps and bounds” CEO Robert Eddy said on a call with analysts Thursday. When gas prices hit over $3 a gallon “members love us” and shift their gas spending to the club.

Gas discounts are a tool Walmart uses to encourage customers to sign up for Walmart+ memberships which also offer free shipping and discounts on prescriptions.

Walmart said on Tuesday that it’s actively trying to keep gas prices down to attract customers worried about how much they’re paying at the pump especially as federal stimulus benefits wane.

“Gas prices are a concern….They’re up dramatically versus a year ago” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on an earnings call. “The customers had money [then]. And at some point that’s going to come to an end.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5va2xhaG9tYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMTEvMjAvd2FsbWFydC10aGFua3NnaXZpbmctaG91cnMtYmxhY2stZnJpZGF5LWRlYWxzLTIwMjEtaG9saWRheS1zaG9wcGluZy84NTg3NTY2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart to close Thanksgiving Day.

In past years it was customary for the Walmart Supercenters and Walmart Neighborhood Markets to shut down for a few hours in the evening giving employees some time to enjoy Thanksgiving before re-opening shortly before midnight for Black Friday sales.

But 2020 brought many changes. Most Walmarts are no longer open 24/7 due to pandemic concerns and restrictions and instead of closing at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Thursday the stores will close at 11 p.m. on Wednesday Nov. 24 and will not reopen until 5 a.m. on Friday Nov. 26.

Tom Ward senior vice president of customer product for Walmart said the new practice is a “thank you” to employees for their hard work.

“Pickup and delivery from stores will operate as normal the day before Thanksgiving and will resume at 12 p.m. local time the day after” Ward said in a statement.

General merchandise coach Kayla Fremin who works for a Walmart Supercenter near Norman and Noble welcomes the day-off becoming permanent.

“It was actually one of our associates from Texas who sent that in to Dacona Smith who is one of our vice presidents” Fremin said. “They really liked the idea so that we could relax and recover with our families for the holiday so they started it in motion last year and I don’t know if it will ever stop. We definitely appreciate it.”

Walmart shifts from Black Friday to 'Deals for Days' offer over full week

As part of its expanded online shopping efforts Walmart has offered discount deals for two Fridays in advance of Black Friday.

The ""Deals for Days"" events were offered Nov. 5 12 and then after skipping a Friday will be offered again on the 26th.

Its Black Friday pricing on certain products will be applied as early as Monday Nov. 22.

“This is so that customers have the freedom to do online shopping if they want to or if they want to come in but either way it’s not so packed” Fremin said. “So they have more freedom despite COVID and it’s also a little bit easier on customers to spread out their money while shopping for Christmas.”

For the store on Cedar Lane in Norman these Friday events have been sparsely attended. But Fremin said it was simply suggestive of the shift nationwide toward online shopping and delivery.

“Honestly I don’t know if it will affect our Black Friday sales at all” Fremin said. “And everything that we’re going to be offering in-store for Black Friday will start that Monday at 7 p.m.”

Electronics and toys have been popular and are expected to remain popular items throughout the shopping season.

“So far we’ve had a lot of laptops tablets a whole lot of TVs selling and I can only imagine that it’s going to be a lot of toys and electronics for the actual Friday” Fremin said.

About the supply chain:If you start holiday shopping on Black Friday you might already be too late. Here's why

Christmas shopping from your couch: Walmart extends delivery options

Walmart also announced three new delivery updates for November and December.

The company is expanding store delivery nationwide by two hours until 10 p.m. local time. This allows customers to place orders up to 6 p.m. for same- or next-day delivery and additional time for amending orders if needed.

Stores are also adding more delivery windows through service providers on Spark Driver Walmart’s delivery app.

These delivery services aren't free. There are one-time delivery fees and additional expenses for deliveries completed in under two hours.

Walmart+ members have some of those services included in their membership fees. This membership was viewed as an attempt to win back shoppers from Amazon when it launched in September 2020 as its annual fee is cheaper than Amazon's Prime membership program.

In addition Walmart is allowing delivery of oversized items like bicycles 70-inch TVs and manufactured Christmas trees as well as alcohol.

Tips:How to avoid taking COVID-19 home on Thanksgiving",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vY29uc3VtZXItdGVjaC9kZWxpdmVyeS1kcm9uZXPSAT1odHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVldGhpbmsuY29tL2NvbnN1bWVyLXRlY2gvZGVsaXZlcnktZHJvbmVzP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delivery drones are now dropping off packages for Walmart,"Walmart is now using delivery drones to get products to customers in Arkansas — and if this project goes well we could one day see drones rapidly delivering packages across the U.S.

Why it matters: When the pandemic hit people started buying more of their food and goods online rather than venturing into stores for them.

That led to a more than 30% increase in ecommerce sales between 2019 and 2020 and there’s little to suggest we’ll see a major decline anytime soon.

The challenge: The most complicated part of the online fulfillment process is the leg of a product’s journey that brings it directly to a customer’s doorstep.

That “last mile” typically requires a driver in a fossil fuel-powered vehicle to hand deliver a package and if a customer lives in a rural or remote area their delivery can take significantly longer (or cost more) than in more populated areas.

The idea: Delivery drones sound a little scifi but in some ways they may be a better solution for last-mile logistics. Electric drones are faster and don’t produce carbon emissions so they’re less polluting than gas-powered delivery trucks (although many delivery companies are starting to transition to electric vehicles).

Because they aren’t beholden to roads delivery drones don’t contribute to or get stuck in traffic congestion and they can fly directly to customers in rural or remote areas cutting down delivery times.

The drone will then drop the package with a parachute to slow its descent at the customers’ home within 30 minutes of Zipline receiving an order.

What’s new: Despite being hyped for years delivery drones have yet to really take off in the U.S. — they’ve delivered a burrito here a Slurpee there and the occasional organ but we haven’t seen anyone demonstrate that they could be a legitimate part of the future of deliveries.

This Walmart project could change that as it combines the world’s biggest retailer with a proven drone delivery company — Zipline delivery drones have made more than 200000 commercial drops.

How it works: Walmart’s new delivery service will focus on the area around its ​​Neighborhood Market in Pea Ridge Arkansas. Initially only “eligible customers” will be able to use the service (Walmart doesn’t explain who qualifies) and only for certain wellness and food items.

After a customer places an order and chooses a delivery time via the Zipline app a Walmart employee will pack up the items and hand them over to a Zipline staff member. They’ll load the package into a delivery drone and launch it on a platform behind the store.

The drone will then drop the package with a parachute to slow its descent at the customers’ home within 30 minutes of Zipline receiving an order before returning to the Walmart.

The big picture: Zipline’s drones are accurate enough to land a package within an area about the size of two parking spots company officials told Axios. Zipline is able to launch a drone every 90 seconds and each is capable of carrying a 4-pound package (hence the item restrictions) up to 50 miles away.

Right now though Walmart’s delivery service will be in a more limited range and the delivery drones will only be able to fly during daylight hours — that’s the deal the company was able to work out with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Truly we might be headed toward a future in which fleets of delivery drones are criss-crossing the skies at all hours of the day and night.

Eventually the FAA might give Walmart permission to fly farther and at more times depending on how this trial goes. Truly we might be headed toward a future in which fleets of delivery drones are criss-crossing the skies at all hours of the day and night — but first officials need to work out all the regulatory kinks.

“The bottleneck is the regulatory framework” Milind Dawande a professor of operations management at the University of Texas told TIME. “There are federal laws there are going to be state laws there are going to be city laws.”

“Of course technology is improving every day but the regulatory framework how quickly it reaches maturity will certainly determine how widespread and how fast [drone delivery] will be adopted” he added.

Pointe Parkway will remain closed until 6 a.m. Sunday for cleaning and sanitizing of the building. It closed at 2 p.m. Friday to get started.

""As you know several areas across the country have seen a renewed increase in positive COVID-19 cases and we want to assist health officials working against the pandemic"" according to a company statement released Friday.

The temporary closure will allow extra time for a third-party specialist ""to further sanitize the store and will also give our associates additional time to restock shelves and prepare the store to once again serve the community.""

Walmart closed its Spokane Valley store in August for the same length of time and the same reasons. It has also temporarily closed stories around the country for cleaning and sanitizing.

""Everything we’re doing is for the well-being of our associates and the thousands of customers we serve daily and in consideration of guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and health experts"" the company statement said.

Walmart said in addition to offering COVID-19 vaccines to customers through walk-in or online appointments it also offers easy access to vaccines for associates.

Associates receive two hours of paid leave to receive their vaccination and up to three days paid leave should they experience an adverse reaction.

""These protocols and convenient access to vaccinations are in addition to the extensive measures we’ve put in place during the pandemic to help protect our associates and customers"" the statement said."

Prior to becoming CEO Chapek was the Chairman of Parks and Resorts for Disney.

Chapek has been CEO during the ongoing pandemic and has made difficult decisions throughout this last year and a half including budget cuts and layoffs. Some of the decisions that the Walt Disney Company has made with Chapek in the CEO role include the layoffs of thousands of Cast Members after the Parks shutdown due to the ongoing pandemic and the launch of Disney Genie including the new paid FastPass system Lightning Lane.

Many feel as though Bob Chapek is not taking the company in the appropriate direction. This has even lead to a petition being created (by an anonymous user) gaining the attention of many Disney fans worldwide.

Now a short film has been created showing Imagineers “unfreezing Walt Disney’s head” and Bob Chapek meeting with Walt to discuss some of the new ideas Chapek has implemented since becoming CEO.

In the short film created by Small World Moving Pictures Walt Disney asks to meet with CEO Bob Chapek to discuss what the Parks look like today. Walt Disney tells Bob Chapek that he loves Disneyland and he made sacrifices in order to make that dream come true including refinancing his home and selling his life insurance. But it was all worth it because as Walt says in the short film he knew he had something special.

To which Bob Chapek says “a real cash cow!”

“I wanted to build a place where families could go and have fun together” Walt immediately responds. “And not just rich families but all families” he continues which then leads into the discussion of Lightning Lane.

The short film continues as Walt expresses his disappointment in CEO Bob Chapek which is something that many fans have also expressed over these last year.

From new technologies to new creative pursuits there have been some drastic switch-ups. Disney certainly doesn’t look like it did half a decade ago!

Here are 9 drastic ways Disney has changed in the last five years!

Disney Genie

First of all we have to address Disney Genie. This is the newest of Disney’s major changes and has marked a change in the way guests access data and the way guests skip the line.

Of course for the first time in Disney World Disney guests now pay to skip the line with Genie+ instead of the previously free Fastpass+ system. That’s a pretty big change and one that has been met with differing opinions.

But Genie has also provided some game-changing free offerings. The personalized itineraries and predictive wait time could mark a major shift in how guests use their phones in the parks!

Responding to the Global Health Crisis

Not all of the major changes over the last five years have been expected. For instance the Walt Disney Company was forced to change in response to the Global Health Crisis.

This was perhaps most apparent in the changes to staffing with the discontinuation of programs like the Disney College Program widespread furloughs and tens of thousands of lay-offs for Cast Members across the country.

The internal business models had to change as well with Disney losing a lot of money while the international theme parks remained closed.

And we’ve seen these changes in the park. Social distancing and masks remain a big piece of a Disney trip and we still can’t see characters like we used to. Plus much of the entertainment hasn’t returned either. These changes may not be permanent but that doesn’t make them any less drastic.

Security Changes

A pretty major change occurred in the parks in the last few years with changes to security when entering. Previously guests would go through metal detectors and those with bags would have to wait in a line for bag check.

Now all guests walk through newer detectors and only those who trigger the machines need to go to the physical bag check. Otherwise you can carry your bag right through. This has certainly sped up the security process.

Disney World Skyliner

The addition of the Skyliner in Disney World massively changed the way transportation works across the resort. Previously the only options were the monorail buses and boats.

Now EPCOT Disney’s Hollywood Studios Disney’s Riviera Resort Disney’s Art of Animation Resort Disney’s Pop Century Resort and Disney’s Caribbean Beach are all connected via the Skyliner. It’s a lot easier to get around these areas!

Mobile Ordering

The last five years has also brought us a massive expansion in Mobile Ordering in both Disney World and Disneyland. Pretty much gone are the days of ordering with a Cast Member at the cash register. Many quick-service locations now offer Mobile Order and heavily encourage its use.

Especially with the global health crisis Disney parks ramped up Mobile Order to reduce touchpoints. Now many locations primarily use Mobile Order and keep just one register open for non-mobile orders.

Virtual Queues

Rise of the Resistance introduced the Virtual Queue model to both Disney World and Disneyland and it has continued to expand since then. We’ve seen it used on WEB SLINGERS: A Spider-Man Adventure in Disneyland and Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure in Disney World.

Plus Virtual Queues have even gone into use on busier days (like the 50th) for merchandise stores and for more high-demand snack locations like Gideon’s Bakehouse.

Disney Park Pass Reservations

This next one came as a result of the global health crisis but does not have any sort of specified end date at this time. Disney Park Passes have marked a major change to how Disney manages capacity in the parks and how you need to plan your trip.

Now all Disney World and Disneyland guests need valid park admission and a Disney Park Pass theme park reservation to be admitted into the theme parks. This helps Disney manage capacity but it also means that guests aren’t guaranteed admission if park passes are all booked up.

Immersive Experiences

Disney has made a move over the last five years to go past interactive experiences and into immersive ones. This is a new sector of theme park offerings and has been received with a lot of positivity and some criticism.

Think about the immersion of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge or the upcoming Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser not to mention Rise of the Resistance. These immersive experiences are new and will continue to be a big part of Disney parks in the coming years.

Disney+

The Walt Disney Company made a major priority shift in business operations to focus on direct-to-consumer offerings such as Disney+. This marks a major restructure for the company.

The biggest example of this is the launch of Disney+ and the massive amount of content that has been created for the offering. This major restructure is a staple of Bob Chapek’s term as CEO so far and certainly marks one of the most drastic changes of the last five years.

Speaking with a reporter from Variety at the Los Angeles premiere of House of Gucci Leto argued that the modern realities of film distribution should make releasing the Ayer Cut in some capacity a no-brainer for Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Entertainment.

“Why wouldn’t they? Why wouldn’t they? I mean that’s what streaming’s for right?” he asked.

Why wouldn’t they indeed seconded Ayer himself in a tweet. The chance to release a second cut of a movie is “exactly what streaming is for” Ayer said trying to appeal to the business sense of any executives reading. If you own IP and you have a mandate to monetize it from your shareholders that’s exactly what you do” tagging Warner Bros.’ parent company AT&T. (Though AT&T recently sold WarnerMedia to Discovery and the combined companies will exist as “Warner Bros. Discovery” in the near future.)

Both Leto and Ayer have said there is more to the 2016 than has been publicly seen for years. In 2017 Leto told IGN that “There were so many scenes that got cut from the movie I couldn’t even start. I think that the Joker … we did a lot of experimentation on the set we explored a lot. There’s so much that we shot that’s not in the film.”

Just as he did in 2021 Ayer followed up Leto’s quotes with affirmation posting a letter to Twitter saying he wished he had a “time machine” to create a “more grounded story.” However he noted that “no there isn’t a secret edit of the film with a bunch of Joker scenes hidden in a salt mine somewhere.”

A lot has changed in the superhero game since 2017. Specifically one very big change: this year’s fan-demanded release of Zack Snyder’s Justice League. The long march from hashtags to the actual release of a second four-hour version of Justice League more in line with Snyder’s original vision than the revisions Joss Whedon made on set surely captured the imaginations of Ayer and Leto not to mention fans with dreams similar to the Snyder die-hards. An added moment in the re-edit involving Leto’s Joker only fanned the fire.

Related Everything Zack Snyder has said about the story for his Justice League 2 and 3 29

Curiosity about the Zack Snyder’s Justice League which Warner Bros. reportedly invested $70 million into completing made the movie a PR success. Although official numbers are hard to come by in May 2021 a WarnerMedia press release called the movie a “hit [HBO]Max Original.” That said it was not a runaway success or the second coming of the DC Snyderverse; third-party streaming analytics company Samba TV reported that the movie trailed other major releases that also opened in theaters which may have led to decreased viewing on the platform. Three weekends after release Zack Snyder’s Justice League was viewed by a reported 3.2 million households falling behind Mortal Kombat (5.5 million viewers) Godzilla vs. Kong (5.1 million) The Suicide Squad (4.7 million Wonder Woman 1984 (3.9 million) in the same window.

But the social media success of the #SnyderCut has clearly inspired Ayer who used the release of James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad to post another letter saying that he had put his “life into Suicide Squad” and that the released 2016 movie “is not my movie. Read that again. And my cut is not the 10 week director’s cut — It’s a fully mature edit.” Ayer went on to praise Gunn’s reboot which itself suffered from paltry numbers at the box office.

Those numbers might make WarnerMedia executives wonder if there truly is enough hype around an #AyerCut to bring a new un-rebooted version of the Suicide Squad into existence. The original Justice League while a critical flop was technically a financial success earning $656 million worldwide giving the studio a reason to continue with plans for standalone Aquaman and Flash movies and Wonder Woman’s standalone franchise. Suicide Squad did even better earning $745 million worldwide but attempts to steer the franchise to critical acclaim backfired between The Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey. Ayer seems to think going back to where it all started is the solution.

The 20000 or so followers at @CutAyer and the near-25000 followers at @RTAyerCutSS have jumped on Leto’s comments but based on the many attempts to do something with the series the general public has so far been tepid on the idea of a gang of villains getting tiny bombs implanted into their heads so they are forced to become unlikely heroes.

So far stars affiliated with both Suicide Squad and The Suicide Squad have been generally supportive. Margot Robbie Joel Kinnaman and John Cena have all expressed varying levels of enthusiasm for the #AyerCut project with Robbie calling a second release a “very complicated situation” that she would “want to see” and Kinnaman saying that “you always want to see the director’s vision.”

What most saw as yet another shameless cash grab tie-in the red-pilled fans who survived getting blue-balled by the last two Matrix films (until The Matrix Resurrections drops) saw as the needed excuse to believe that the franchise didn't die. And boy they were actually right. The only difference is that instead of running on people this new Matrix ran on pure madness. Let's now look at the behind-the-scenes of it all and try to deal with the discovery that Morpheus getting murdered by magic bullets was far from its weirdest part.

Turns out that for the final few months of the game's life everything was written ran and maintained by one single dude.

Warner Brothers Ergo simulation imitates life.

Ben Chamberlain is the name of the dev who would regularly have to write new storylines then implement them by playing the characters some of which were already known like Morpheus some others not so much like the definitely not fanfic-y super-assassin with the ability of insta-killing everyone via code-bombs and super kill codes.

And even the weirdest aspect of the game's life bows before the weirdness of the game's demise. As soon as Chamberlain became the only full-time dev working on the project it was clear the writing was on the wall. When the inevitable server shutdown was announced sad fans gathered in the game to be together for the last time. And instead of bittersweet it was bitterhellish as players witnessed their characters getting hit by lightning and then getting crushed to death while screaming.

(Note that this was the canon ending of The Matrix for a long while.)

All they had to do was well nothing. They just had to shut down the server and everybody would simply freeze making for a neat little screenshot. Still despite having no money or devs they just made it so that players died in the most messed-up of ways. The ending of the game's Beta was even worse. In it instead of just watching your characters curl into a ball while screaming players saw that but under a blood-red sky filled with gigantic creepy eyes witnessing your pain.

Play

Well the architect from the films really did state that the previous versions of The Matrix were worse. Now that's worldbuilding.

The site previously banned Rittenhouse legal defense fundraisers because he was accused of a violent crime. His exoneration in his trial on Friday cleared that hurdle.

“If someone is acquitted of those charges as Rittenhouse was today a fundraiser started subsequently for their legal defense and other expenses would not violate this policy” the statement read. “A fundraiser to pay lawyers cover legal expenses or to help with ongoing living expenses for a person acquitted of those charges could remain active as long as we determine it is not in violation of any of our other terms and for example the purpose is clearly stated and the correct beneficiary is added to the fundraiser.”

However reports indicate GoFundMe has waivered on a blanket ban in such cases.

“We are monitoring our site for related fundraisers to try to verify as we do for all events that have widespread attention that the funds are going to the intended recipient and that the fundraiser is within our Terms of Service” the GoFundMe statement on lifting Rittenhouse’s ban said. “This process takes time and may slow down the withdrawal process. If the fundraiser does violate our Terms of Service or does not directly benefit the intended beneficiary we will remove it from the platform.”

Although cleared of criminal charges Rittenhouse could potentially face civil or federal civil rights lawsuits related to his shooting incident.

A really good fighter. To his credit he’s been willing to do what few others have. Step up and fight the best. Challenge himself. Win lose or draw.

While Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez is unquestionably the money man in all of combat sports there may be no one more skilled between the ropes than Terence ‘Bud’ Crawford.

Arguably the best fighter in the glittering welterweight division and a consensus pound-for-pound pick by many pundits the Omaha native (37-0) combines a razor-sharp offensive skills with elite defensive nous.

Add to his incredible in-ring IQ and a mean streak that puts one in mind of greats like Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran and what you have in the words of no less than Floyd Mayweather is “one helluva fighter”.

Did I mention that Crawford is the best switch-hitter in all of combat sports? And arguably the best ever to do it.

There’s only one problem. The competition he’s faced thus far is well less than stellar. The two biggest names on his resume are a faded Kell Brook – who’s never been the same since 2016 after he moved up to challenge Kazakh terror Gennady Golovkin at middleweight in a bout of bravado or foolishness and was rewarded with a broken orbital bone – and Amir Khan whose best years have long since passed.

And the others? Certainly solid B+ fighters (with all due respect) but far from top dogs and a galaxy away from being household names.

Don’t get me wrong. Crawford who clearly passes the eye-test to even the most casual fans of the sport isn’t exactly to blame.

Much like Golovkin in his prime the 34-year-old Omaha native has struggled to find high-profile opponents willing to step between the ropes and test their mettle against him.

Sure some of that can be chalked up to his beef with promoter Bob Arum – whose job it is to you know promote the fighter – as well as boxing power-broker Al Haymon locking down the big names at welterweight (Errol Spence Keith Thurman etc etc.) across the street at PBC boxing. Or his seeming comfort with simply beating who they put in front of him and cashing big cheques while doing it.

Regardless Crawford for a myriad of reasons hasn’t exactly had a trying time in the ring. Until now.

Enter Shawn ‘Showtime’ Porter (35-1-3). Calling him the gatekeeper of the welterweight division might be excessively harsh. While he’s not exactly a glittering talent he’s certainly proved himself a good and game fighter (as evinced by the big names on his resume such as Spence Thurman Danny Garcia and Andre Berto).

Porter’s nickname might as be the pitbull. That’s for his take-no-prisoners boxing style dogged determination coupled with unstoppable cardio and an iron chin (he’s been dropped twice in his career). When in doubt Porter charges ahead. On the attack. Always. It’s never a pleasant night for his opponents. Never a soft touch.

So what can we expect on Sunday?

Like many others in this sport Shawn Porter is a good fighter. A really good fighter. To his credit he’s been willing to do what few others have. Step up and fight the best. Challenge himself. Win lose or draw. For the fans Porter fights are guaranteed to be all action encounters. Boxing needs more fighters like Porter.

But Crawford is an elite talent. And an absolute killer in the ring.

Crawford as usual starts slow. Takes the first few rounds to size Porter up.

Porter ever the pitbull will keep charging. And Crawford will keep catching him coming in. Keep cracking him with his lightning quick hands and incredible reflexes.

By round 7 Crawford will really begin to turn it on. Crawford has been riding a series of TKOs of late. And I suspect he’ll want to close the show in the same manner. Expect him to do what Errol Spence and no other welterweight has yet: actually stop Porter late in the fight.

Took Erik Killmonger From A Seemingly Sympathetic Antagonist To A True Villain How WHAT IF ...,"Black Panther arrived in 2018 to great critical acclaim. The film was particularly praised for its main villain Erik Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan. Audiences connected with the baddie's duality as he committed terrible acts for a seemingly noble cause. A side effect of his popularity arose however when many started interpreting Killmonger as a misunderstood hero as opposed to a complex villain.

That interpretation became so popular that some even suggested he could be redeemed to become the new Black Panther in Wakanda Forever. It's been a few years since Black Panther came out but a new twist on Killmonger's relationship with audiences recently presented itself as Marvel Studios' first animated series What If...? provided a new perception on him with its sixth and ninth episodes firmly establishing him as a villain.

Killmonger's Ruthlessness

Before delving into how the Disney+ series accomplished that let's look back at Killmonger's backstory for those unfamiliar with his MCU journey. Black Panther introduced Erik Killmonger as the son of Prince N'Jobu brother of Wakanda's former king (and T'Challa's father) T'Chaka. N'Jobu was killed by his brother after T'Chaka discovered he was responsible for an attack on their country. T'Chaka then abandoned Erik in the U.S. which led the boy to grow up hating Wakanda eventually plotting a scheme to rule the country and give its weapons to oppressed people around the world.

Such a scheme took him down a dark path turning him into a cold-blooded murderer that carved each one of his kills onto his body. In the film he murdered an innocent museum expert and a group of guards to steal a piece of vibranium. He then murdered his own girlfriend just so villain Ulysses Klaw couldn't use her as leverage against him in a standoff. After that he killed T'Challa's advisor Zuri and even used his newly found super strength (courtesy of the Heart-Shaped Herb) to choke a Wakandan woman when she refused to do his bidding.

Simply put Killmonger was a psychopath. One could argue that his intentions to help people in need were somewhat admirable (albeit misguided). But any well-meaning intentions he may have had were offset by his extremely violent nature and his apparent desire to perpetuate the circle of violence he had put himself in from a young age.

How What If...? Established Him as a True Villain

What If... Killmonger Rescued Tony Stark? Find out in the sixth episode of Marvel Studios' #WhatIf streaming tomorrow on @DisneyPlus. pic.twitter.com/YB5JIFhP9r — What If...? (@whatifofficial) September 14 2021

Killmonger returned in animated form for two episodes of Disney+'s What If...? The first one ""What If... Killmonger Rescued Tony Stark?"" saw Erik saving Stark and becoming his friend. Secretly though the villain was plotting a version of the plan he executed in Black Panther which led him to kill T'Challa James Rhodes and Tony himself. He then brought a massive war to Wakanda to make himself look like a hero which ultimately allowed him to become the new Black Panther. These acts were depicted in an unmistakably villainous light planting the seeds to (perhaps inadvertently) course-correct people's perception of the baddie.

Killmonger then returned in Episode 9 ""What If... The Watcher Broke His Oath?"" He was chosen by Uatu to help stop Ultron from destroying the multiverse. He did his part to take the robot down but ended up double-crossing his team to take possession of the Infinity Stones. Through that Marvel Studios firmly established Killmonger as a man with ill intentions as opposed to the misguided antihero that many had seen him as. Granted this was an alternate version of Killmonger but one that shared the same backstory and goals as the one featured in Black Panther.

The Complexity of Killmonger

Keep in mind this is not to say that Killmonger was just your average bad guy. Ryan Coogler Michael B. Jordan and co. created a layered individual whose cruel actions were motivated by a traumatic past and a deep-rooted desire for revenge. It was a smart exploration of how differently tragedy can shape people. Most superheroes are born out of pain and so are villains but it's how they choose their experiences to shape them that sets them apart from one another. As a juxtaposition to T'Challa Killmonger was a standout depiction of that contrast.

Of course this isn't to fault people who saw Killmonger as some sort of antihero. That simply speaks to the incredible character work done by the people behind Black Panther. Given his terrible actions cruelty and backstabbing nature though it's for the best that What If...? cleared any doubt about Killmonger's true nature."

That’s not unusual. On average building a single lane of road costs about A$5 million per kilometre.

What is unusual about this stretch of extra freeway is not the money but the materials beneath the bitumen: two stabilising layers comprised of 25000 tonnes of crushed recycled concrete about 90% of which came from the demolition of Subiaco Oval (once Perth’s premier football ground).

Recycling building and construction materials remains the exception to the rule in Australia. The National Waste Policy agreed to by federal state and territory governments has a target of 80% resource recovery by 2030. It’s currently about 40%.

Of the 74 million tonnes of waste generated in Australia in 2020 masonry materials comprised about 22.9 million tonnes. Plastics by comparison comprised about 2.5 million tonnes. Of the 61.5 million tonnes of “core waste” managed by the waste and resource recovery sector 44% (27 million tonnes) came from the construction and demolition sector compared with 20% (12.6 million tonnes) from households and local government activities.

Most of this waste – concrete brick steel timber asphalt and plasterboard or cement sheeting – could be reused or recycled. It ends up in landfill due to simple economics. It’s cheaper to buy new materials and throw them away rather than reuse and recycle.

Changing this equation and moving to a circular economy in which materials are reused and recycled rather than discarded in landfill is a key goal to reduce the impact of building and construction on the environment including its contribution to climate change.

The economics of ‘externalities’

The fact it is more “economic” to throw materials away than reuse them is what economists call a market failure driven by the problem of “externalities”. That is the social and environmental costs of producing consuming and throwing away materials is not reflected in the prices charged. Those costs are instead externalised – borne by others.

In such cases there is a legitimate – and necessary – role for governments to intervene and correct the market failure. For an externality such as carbon emissions (imposing costs on future generations) the market-based solution favoured by most economists is a carbon price.

For construction material waste governments have a few more policy levers to help create a viable market for more recycling.

Using procurement policies

One way to make recycling more attractive to businesses would be to increase the cost of sending waste materials to landfill. But this would likely have unintended consequences such as illegal dumping.

The more obvious and effective approach is to help create more demand for recycled materials through government procurement adopting policies that require suppliers to for example use a minimum amount of recycled materials.

With enough demand recyclers will invest in further waste recovery reducing the costs. Lower costs in turn create the possibility of greater demand creating a virtuous circle that leads to a circular economy.

Australia’s federal state and territory governments all have sustainable procurement policies. The federal Sustainable Procurement Guide states the Australian government “is committed to transforming Australia’s waste into a resource where most goods and services can be continually used reused recycled and reprocessed as part of a circular economy”.

But these policies lack some basic elements.

Three key market-making reforms

Our research suggests three important reforms could make a big difference to waste market operations. This is based on interviewing 27 stakeholders from the private sector and government about how to improve sustainable procurement.

First government waste policies that set aspirational goals are not supported by procurement policies setting mandatory minimum recycled content targets. All contractors on government-funded construction projects should be required to use a percentage of recycled waste materials.

Second the nature of salvaging construction materials means quality can vary significantly. Cement recycled from a demolition site for example could contain contaminants that reduce its durability.

Read more: Australia needs construction waste recycling plants — but locals first need to be won over

Governments can help the market through regularly auditing the quality of recycler’s processes to increase buyer confidence and motivate suppliers to invest in production technologies.

Third in some states (such as Western Australia) the testing regimes for recycled construction products are more complex than that what applies to raw materials. More reasonable specifications would reduce compliance costs and thereby the cost of using recycled materials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbW9hb2JzZXJ2ZXIud3MvY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2Ftb2EvOTQ5NDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Inga the winger' advocates waste management,"Samoan rugby star Fesola'i Vaaiga Tuigamala has emphasised the importance of Pacific nations to confront and combat the waste crisis currently affecting the Pacific region.

In a statement issued by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (S.P.R.E.P) on 16 November the former All Black and Manu Samoa player nicknamed ""Inga the winger"" talked about his improving health and compared it to the environment.

“I was very very obese my health statistics were very poor and I was looking at an early grave if I hadn’t I changed my attitude and changed my behaviour” Fesola'i said during the Third Clean Pacific Roundtable.

""I didn’t take care of myself physically I didn’t look after my health and I suffered the consequences. It wasn’t just me who suffered those who were close to me suffered my wife children friends and my family suffered.”

Fesola'i made reference to his own experience to raise the alarm about the consequences of negligence in the face of crisis.

He said he then transformed his personal nutritional and exercise habits a comparison he says that could be drawn with the current waste crisis facing the Pacific.

""I liken what happened to my body to the earth. When we don’t look after our environment when we don’t take care of our own backyard then we will suffer the consequences. I had to learn to get my health back physically mentally and spiritually. We need to do the same for our environment"" he said.

Studies have shown that 40 per cent of all the marine plastics that end up in the Pacific comes from Asia the statement said.

A different study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicted that on current trends there would be more microplastics in the ocean by 2050 than fish.

""The reality is that waste in our community is a major problem and we need to take action today. We need to pay attention to the impact waste and pollution have on our health is huge"" he said.

Fesola'i said that the reality is that Pacific Islands cannot make any more land but he had encouraged people to change their mindsets.

""It's the small things such as encouraging people to take pride in themselves and their homes” he said.

“As a sportsman I was brought up with these two words team and pride.”

""Team stood for Together Everyone Achieves More. Pride stands for Personal Responsibility In Delivering Excellence and that’s the message I want to get people to take pride in their homes that’s where we can start that’s where we can make a big difference.""

Fesola'i said it was essential that people must confront and deal with the issues that they can control to do their part to make the world more environmentally friendly.

""I was fortunate to play rugby and got to travel the world. As Pacific Islanders we are privileged to live in this part of the world the Pacific Ocean” he said.

“We have a duty to protect it.”

The inaugural Clean Pacific Roundtable was held in Suva Fiji in July 2016.

Its successful continuation has led to this year’s virtual conference which is being held until 25 November. The festival is funded by the European Union and its event partners include Australia’s University of Newcastle.

Iran's state-run Fars News Agency said neither the ship's nation of origin nor crew member nationalities were immediately clear but that the tanker was smuggling diesel when seized by a naval unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) inside Iranian territorial waters.

The IRGC which U.S. officials declared a terrorist organization in April of 2019 is a special branch of the Iranian armed forces answerable directly to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Fars broadcast footage of an Iranian gunboat carrying soldiers that accosted and boarded the ship. The video appeared to indicate the name of the ship was ""Mariners"" but it was not clear in which country the ship was registered. The video also showed a box of tissues on the bridge of the ship with Arabic or Persian script on it.

Commander of the IRGC's Naval Type 412 Zulfaqar Col. Ahmed Hajian who personally boarded the vessel told Iranian TV that ""over 150000 liters of smuggled diesel fuel [were] on the ship."" A video clip showed what appeared to be diesel in the tanks of the vessel. Hajian claimed the ship was in Iranian waters when it was seized and that all crew members are undergoing interrogation.

In the news reports Col. Hajian says that IRGC intelligence has been working to combat fuel smuggling at sea and has been monitoring the movements of foreign vessels in the Persian Gulf. He also says the vessel had entered Iranian waters illegally after turning off its electronic and navigation systems.

Mehrdad Khonsari a former Iranian diplomat based in London told VOA that much of what we know so far is ""speculation"" but noted it would seem rather implausible that regional countries would be trying to smuggle diesel fuel into Iran as the IRGC is claiming.

""It is usually Iran that wants to offload diesel to gain some money and things like that and it is very unlikely for other local countries to be smuggling diesel or products like that"" said Khonsari.

Iranian ships have been known to smuggle diesel and other fuel oil products to countries like Syria and Yemen.

WFC,Wells Fargo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9ub3J0aC1kYWtvdGFzLWxhcmdlc3QtYmFuay1pcy1mdWVsZWQtYnktZ3Jvd3RoLWluLXR3aW4tY2l0aWVzLzYwMDExOTM0MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Dakota's largest bank is fueled by growth in Twin Cities,"North Dakota-based Bell Bank inspired by a decade of success in the Twin Cities has opened a flagship downtown office in City Center in Minneapolis and added a retail-commercial facility to complement its big mortgage office at ""Bell Plaza"" off Interstate 494 in Bloomington.

The expansion comes amid a slowly reviving downtown.

""If we want to be 'the bank' in the Twin Cities we need a downtown office"" said Bell Bank CEO Michael Solberg. ""It still is the beating heart of commerce in the Twin Cities.""

The Bell office commands a spacious well-appointed space as well as a patio that overlooks the corner of Seventh Street and Nicollet Mall.

The Fargo-based financier founded in the 1960s entered the Twin Cities through the 2012 acquisition of Bell Mortgage which punched above its weight againstlarger Wells Fargo U.S. Bank Mortgage and the former TCF.

After acquiring the mortgage company State Bank changed its name to the catchier Bell.

Since 2012 Bell's profitability doubled to $10 billion in assets surpassing the state-owned Bank of North Dakota as North Dakota's biggest banker.

Twin Cities assets have grown from $90 million to $2.6 billion and is now the 10th-largest bank in the Twin Cities area according to the company and regulatory records. Bell has profitably grown assets by 15% annually taking market share. Twin Cities employment has grown from 200 to about 550 since 2012.

""We never would have dreamed that we would be where are in the Twin Cities"" said Solberg 49 a veteran banker and in the second generation of one of two families that control the bank.

Bell is one of the largest family-owned banks in the country and expects record operating earnings of about $125 million this year. The company's equity capital which tops $1 billion has been bolstered by several hundred million dollars in one-time gains since 2019 from asset sales including a software company it incubated and the sale of deposits from its ""health account"" business for employers.

Bell executives believe that they can double the bank's size within seven years.

""Their secret sauce is that they've never forgotten their roots"" said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum who opened an account at Bell while a student at North Dakota State University in the 1970s. ""Banking is not just finance. It's about relationships. It starts for them with treating their employees right. And they treat customers right.""

He applauded the bank's growth in the Twin Cities.

Burgum 65 was a founder and CEO of Great Plains Software a major Fargo-based business that was sold to Microsoft in 2000. He also was a Fargo downtown redevelopment entrepreneur and venture capitalist before he was elected governor in 2016.

In an interview last week Solberg 49 and Todd Lee 50 the company's executive vice president who heads banking and lending said their No. 1 constituent is employees.

""We focus on happy employees and that results in happy customers"" said Lee an accountant and lawyer who Solberg hired away from a successful banking practice in 2010. ""The numbers take care of themselves. The employees are the reason we are successful.""

Richard Solberg Michael's father who retired as CEO in 2015 was the driver behind Bell's employee-driven culture. Bell pays competitively promotes internally and provides bountiful career opportunities multiplied by its growth. It also launched an employee-stock plan in recent years.

Bell which has also invested in Denver and Arizona has hired many employees out of the consolidation and turbulence in the local banking trade including at Wells Fargo and the former TCF.

Paul Bees a 30-year veteran recruiter most recently at Versique Search & Consulting said Bell Bank is a quality employer and operator.

""They just want to do good business and serve the community"" Bees said. ""They do the things that make sense and a good profit. They hire excellent people and they keep them happy. For the most part they empower employees to move up. When we go in the marketplace for them it's an attractive sell for us.""

Solberg said in addition to competitive compensation and fair treatment the best investment the bank makes is giving everyone $1000 a year for a charity of their choice. And when the bank crossed $5 billion in assets in 2018 it gave its 1800 employees $5000 in appreciation and asked them to share half of it with those in need. The company has invested about $20 million in the ""pay it forward"" initiative.

Bell's board and shareholders are publicly committed to an independent future. And the $1 billion-plus Bell has amassed in equity provides ample capital for Bell to economically expand in the Twin Cities and elsewhere Solberg said. It doesn't need a bigger partner.

Solberg said family-owned Bell focuses on what's best for stakeholders five-to-10 years ahead. Not quarterly earnings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9kZXMtbW9pbmVzLzIwMjEvMTEvMjAvZG93bnRvd24tZGVzLW1vaW5lcy1zdHJlZXRzLWdyYW5kLWZpZnRoLWF2ZW51ZS10d28td2F5LXJvYWRzLzg2NTUyNTIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Portions of downtown Des Moines' Grand and 5th Avenue to be converted to two-way streets,"Portions of downtown's most traveled one-way streets will be converted into two-way streets according to construction plans approved by Des Moines City Council Monday night.

The two-way conversion which includes portions of 5th Avenue and Grand Avenue will cost an estimated $1.6 million with construction to begin this spring and be completed by the end of 2022.

The conversion will take place along Grand Avenue between 2nd and 5th Avenue then along 5th Avenue between Court Avenue and Grand Avenue. City officials say the update should improve safety reduce speeding and reckless driving.

""The ultimate goal... is to make our streets safer for all users. That's motorists pedestrians bicyclists and transit users"" said Steve Naber city engineer for the city of Des Moines.

Construction along Grand includes repurposing the three west-bound lanes into one east-bound lane two west-bound lanes and two buffered bike lanes going in both sides of the roadway.

The project also includes eliminating street parking on Grand but there is a large parking garage located along the street's southside.

The changes along 5th Avenue will include one north and south bound lane as well as two buffered bike lanes on each side.

The project also includes improvements to bus stops and will increase the walkability of the area just in time for the 2023 NCAA men's basketball tournament which is to be hosted at Wells Fargo Arena. The changes will make it easier for fans to walk from Wells Fargo Arena to areas along Court Avenue Naber said.

Jeremy Lewis executive director of Street Collective a Des Moines-based nonprofit that advocates for accessible and safe transportation and rideability believes the changes will lead to more people walking and biking through downtown.

""I believe one of the ways we've been most safe is when drivers are actually expecting to see people that are walking biking more frequently"" Lewis said.

The next step would be for the city to eventually add protected bike lanes Lewis proposed. The lanes could be added unto the newly created buffered lanes and include a pavement barrier along the buffered lane to increase safety for bikers.

The changes the council approved aren't unique to Des Moines. Cities large and small across the state have already begun similar changes to adapt to growth and development.

Since 2015 Cedar Rapids has been converting portions of its downtown district to two-way streets to support the ""district's ongoing economic development."" Earlier this year the city of Indianola approved $10 million streetscape project which will convert the city's main downtown square from one-way to two-way traffic.

Looking into the future the city's goal is to covert all of Grand Avenue and Locust Street into two-way roads which is mentioned in the Connect Downtown and Move DSM long term plans.

According to Naber these changes would most likely be brought to City Council within the next five to 10 years.

Lewis said he's hopeful that could happen sooner.

But in my opinion St. Louis’ AHL affiliate should be closer to them like say Kansas City Missouri. Here’s why.



Let’s face it travel doesn’t need to be longer on purpose — especially when it comes to traveling to and from St. Louis Mo. and Springfield Mass. I understand travel is a part of the game but when the Blues need a player or two to fill in for injured and/or absent players they’d have to wait half a day at the earliest.



Aside from sports I have a passion for aviation. I learned that the average nonstop flight from St. Louis to Springfield Mass. is two and a half hours. For a flight with a layover it’ll be at least four hours and 25 minutes. I’m not sure if the NHL players suffer from jet lag but I’m pretty sure some AHL players’ sleep schedules will be shifted. Though each player’s situation is different. If they’re accustomed to traveling then they likely won’t have trouble sleeping.



I went to the Iowa Wild vs. Tucson Roadrunners game at the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines this past Friday. I noticed two things: 1) The Wild’s offense propelled them to a 5-0 shutout victory and 2) The Wild’s setup was so great and seamless.





Like Minnesota St. Louis could benefit from having a team closer to them. It’s virtually impossible but let’s say Blues’ AHL affiliate was based in Des Moines Iowa the nonstop flights to and from St. Louis and Des Moines will be around one hour and five minutes. For flights with layovers they’ll be at least three hours and 30 minutes. That’s a shorter flight which will lead to faster flight times and player recalls.



Minnesota and Iowa share the same ownership group of Minnesota Sports and Entertainment. Minnesota benefited from having an AHL affiliate Iowa who was closer to them. Iowa was originally the Houston Aeros in Houston Texas from 1994 to 2013.



Springfield plays in the Atlantic Division while Kansas City would play in the Central Division. It’d make more sense if a Kansas City Mo.-based team was the Blues’ AHL affiliate geography- and travel-wise.



Since the Blues don’t own the Thunderbirds they can’t move them but they can acquire a new team in a new location. But it won’t be in Chicago because they’ve tried that once with the Chicago Wolves and they failed following a three-year affiliation agreement from 2013 to 2016.



When the Blues’ affiliation agreement with the Thunderbirds ends in 2025 they’re free to stay or go in Springfield Mass. If they select Kansas City they’d have to come up with a team name like maybe the Kansas City Kings...the Kansas City All-Stars...or the Missouri Masters? I don’t know but I thought I’d throw some names out there that aren’t the Chiefs Royals or Mavericks.

We examine the findings and recommendations of the CCI’s market study in the pharmaceutical sector in India.

What was the Baroda Dynamite Case in which George Fernandes was sent to Tihar jail?

Do marriages need to be registered? What happens if they are not?

What are the key findings of the CCI?

The CCI found that the market for generic drugs is driven by brand competition instead of price competition despite such drugs being functionally and chemically identical. Generic drugs are chemically identical to drugs that once had patent protection.

Pharmaceuticals including generic drugs account for about 43.2 per cent of out of pocket healthcare expenditure in India according to the CCI study and about 62.7 per cent of the total health spending in the country.

Why does brand competition override price competition in the market for generic drugs?

The study concluded that brand differentiation in terms of a perception of different levels of quality and trade margins offered to incentivise chemists were key drivers of brand competition in India’s markets for generics.

The report found that manufacturers that concentrate their efforts on the creation of brand image and brand loyalty have been able to command a price premium on chemically identical drugs by striving “for the patronage of prescribing physicians” adding that patients who are unaware of the attributes and substitutes for drugs simply purchase medications prescribed by physicians and dispensed by chemists.

The CCI also highlighted that the perception of difference in the quality of drugs by different manufacturers also feeds into brand differentiation

“ As evidenced by the formulation-level data on prices and market shares market leadership position is often enjoyed by brands that command the highest or relatively higher prices” the competition regulator observed. The study cited the example of the highest selling anti-diabetic drug which costs Rs 9.97 per tablet over six times the price of the chemically identical drug with the least market share which costs Rs 1.53 per tablet.

The report noted that other manufacturers focus on increasing sales volume bidding up trade margins for retailers thereby incentivising them to push for the sale of their brands.

What has the CCI recommended?

The report stated that effective price competition in generics can benefit consumers and improve access to affordable healthcare.

The CCI noted that the enforcement and interpretation of quality regulations was not uniform across states and different regulatory and testing capacities had led to different quality standards being followed.

“A mechanism may be devised under the aegis of the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation) to create awareness on quality issues build capacity and harmonise training and practices across the country with a view to ensure uniform and consistent application of quality standards“ the CCI recommended. The CCI also recommended and increase in the frequency of testing of drugs and in the capacity of drug testing labs.

The regulator also recommended that a National Digital Drugs Databank be created and made available to regulators industry physicians and consumers to address information asymmetry in the sector.

The commission also took note of the rising market share of online pharmacies and concerns around the concentration of patient data raised by brick and mortar pharmacies. The CCI noted while the share of online pharmacies stood at 2.8 per cent in 2018 the online pharmacy sector’s reach has expanded during the pandemic to 8.8 million households from 3.5 million households prior to the pandemic.

“The online pharmacies should adopt self-regulatory measures in the areas of collection use sharing of data and privacy. However for safeguarding patient privacy and protecting sensitive personal medical data necessary regulations need to be enforced until the country legislates its data protection law” the report said.",,,,,,,,,

Text Dazed Digital

Kanye West and Drake have been locked in a drawn-out feud for years culminating in a series of diss tracks leaks and album delay controversies with the release of Donda and Certified Lover Boy earlier this year. Now though the pair are set to put their differences aside to perform at an upcoming benefit concert for convicted gang leader Larry Hoover. Teasing the reunion the two rappers shared a photo with Rap-A-Lot CEO J Prince on Wednesday this week (November 17). Captioning the post with a dove they appeared to officially squash their long-running beef in preparation for the Los Angeles concert. Earlier in the month Ye and J Prince also publicly invited Drake to join the benefit concert in a video statement on J Prince’s Instagram. “It’s time to put it to rest” Kanye said of the back and forth with Drake “with the ultimate purpose being to free Larry Hoover.”

Of course this isn’t the first time that Kanye’s campaigned for the release of the Gangster Disciples co-founder who is serving six life sentences after being convicted of murder conspiracy and various other charges in 1997. In 2018 Kanye appeared on SNL in a MAGA hat and “Free Hoover” shirt and made an unsuccessful appeal for Hoover’s release in a meeting with then-President Donald Trump. More recently he featured Hoover’s son Larry Hoover Jr on the Donda track “Jesus Lord”. The song features an audio recording of Hoover Jr thanking the rapper for his involvement in his father’s case. Despite Kanye and Drake putting aside their drama for the benefit concert both artists remain in the middle of their own controversies. As well as surrounding himself with a host of ill-advised collaborators in recent months (see: his Sunday Service with Marilyn Manson) Kanye recently appeared on the podcast Drink Champs where he criticised many of his musical peers and dismissed #MeToo as “Nineteen Eighty-Four mind control”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbm9pc3lwaXhlbC5uZXQvbm8tZ2FtZS1uby1saWZlLWVuZ2xpc2gtY2hhcHRlcnMtc2ltdWx0YW5lb3VzbHktamFwYW5lc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Chapters Of No Game No Life Available To Western Readers Simultaneously With Japanese Release Of Vol. 11,"Yen On announced that the No Game No Life long-running light novel series will be available to western readers sooner than it ever has been before.

The project celebrates the talent and resilience of the front and back stage crew of London’s theatres and sees Rankin join forces with the Mayor of London’s #LetsDoLondon campaign and the Society of London Theatre (SoLT) as part of its #BackOnStage campaign.

Over five full shooting days the leading photographer invited 150 individuals from almost 60 of London’s top shows and venues to sit for him in a pop-up studio at the House of Photography – and Digital Camera World sat in on one of the sessions.

We were kindly given access on the penultimate day of shooting arriving just before David Harewood – one of the stars of the hit TV series ‘Homeland‘ and currently playing the lead role in Best of Enemies at the Old Vic – walked in to pose for Rankin.

While David Harewood was the most recognisable face during Digital Camera World’s visit other well-known sitters we spotted on the gallery walls included actors Rory Kinnear and Paul Whitehouse impresarios Cameron Mackintosh Sonia Friedman and Andrew Lloyd Webber – and many more.

Shooting up to 30 portraits in one day is a challenge to say the least but as we‘ll find out later Rankin is no stranger to working at such high intensity.

The setup for ‘Performance by Rankin’ saw the photographer and his creative team take over the first-floor gallery space for one day a week over five weeks. We spotted Chelsea Nawanga assisting Rankin as well as Manny – both would be familiar to viewers of BBC4’s The Great British Photography Challenge.

The studio they erected comprised three grey backdrop boards arranged in a U-shape; lighting was provided by a Profoto B10 studio flash and diffused by a Profoto beauty dish softbox.

Rankin shot the portraits on a Fujifilm GFX 100 with lenses including a GF63mm F2.8 R WR and GF30mm F3.5 R WR tethered to Capture One 21 Pro software.

Being able to view the images on a big screen instantaneously would have been a boon for any sitters who weren’t used to being professionally photographed – for example theatre backstage crew admin staff and management.

West End theatre stars are more used to being performative of course but Rankin didn't want to photograph them strictly in character from their shows; he wanted them to express how they felt to be back at work after their long lay-offs.

But whoever was sitting for him Rankin put them at ease beforehand with a quick chat and a brief explanation of the equipment he was using for their portrait.

During and after their shoots all sitters were invited to choose their ’keeper’ image from the two or three variations that Rankin had shot – this is a departure from the way he normally works but Rankin wanted his models to be involved in the selection process.

The chosen pictures were printed on Fujifilm photographic paper and mounted on the walls of the gallery gradually filling up the available space.

On the day of our visit one remaining wall was waiting to take the next series of pictures; pasted with placeholder printouts from the ‘Performance by Rankin’ book that carried quotes from the models it would be filled with photo prints by the end of the following day.

With 30 portraits shot per session the walls at The House of Photography soon filled up with ‘Performance by Rankin’ images (Image credit: Future)

It’s where the print of David Harewood and many more would have gone; with the actor and photographer having worked together before there was a genuine rapport and it didn’t take Rankin long to capture the sort of shots he wanted from David’s enthusiastic poses.

Following a quick check of the images on the screen David chose his favourite frame… and with that the day’s shooting was in the can.

It’s a great portrait with bags of character and playfulness. Is it one of the best from the whole project though?

No – as viewers of the exhibition will see the quality of the images across ‘Performance by Rankin’ is consistently excellent.

Another great body of Rankin work and all for such a good cause too.

We caught up with Rankin after shooting was completed and asked him how it all went…

Congratulations on producing such a fantastic set of images. Do you often have 30 sitters a day and how did you manage to do it all – was it exhausting being a photographer to so many people in such a short time?

“In 2009 I worked on a project called ‘Rankin Live‘ where I shot up to 50 people a day. That experience prepared me for ‘Performance’.

“It was and is exhausting but it also sharpens your skill set. You get to know what you want so quickly because you have to and the energy just pushes you to perform.

“I wouldn’t like to do it every day but once in a while is okay because it does keep me on my toes.”

A limited edition 120-page ‘Performance by Rankin’ hardback book of the portraits goes on sale on 25 November to accompany the exhibition and all proceeds will go to the project’s chosen charities.

What does live theatre mean to you and how hard did you feel its loss during lockdown?

“It’s so invigorating. I thrive on meeting people and spending time face-to-face. If we don’t have real-life experiences I think it diminishes our ability to be inspired or understand people.”

Where does this project rate in your body of work? Was it emotional for you?

“This project has been one of the most positive ones I’ve ever done. It was emotional as every single person involved has come to it with enthusiasm humility and a genuine belief in it being something good.

“Doing any project normally involves egos and some form of competitiveness. Everybody left those at the door this time – including me.

“Because of that and because of the subject matter it really is a celebration of things coming back to life. After the last two years I think we all needed that!”

Entry is free but visitors are encouraged to make a donation on site to the Theatre Artists Fund which provides emergency aid to struggling theatre freelancers as well as to four London youth homelessness charities selected by the Mayor of London: Depaul  akt  Centrepoint and New Horizons Youth Centre .

Located next to the fencing of the Indo-Bangla border the village of Bhimpur has 150 Muslim families out of the total 450 residing in the area . Hindu villagers use vacant land beside the border road for Kali Puja but every year they need to seek permission from BSF.



This year BSF was not initially ready to give permission and that is when Hannan Mondal decided to solve the issue permanently. The small farmer donated a part of his land to construct a permanent Kali temple.



Ahead of the high-octane Assembly polls Nadia district was in the list of BJP's bigwigs as it is dominated by Matuas a Hindu religious sect that migrated from Bangladesh. During the election campaign BJP leaders tried to woo the Hindu refugee electorate by discussing alleged atrocities by Muslims in Bangladesh and explaining why Matuas had to migrate from there during Partition.



""This is the real India. Bengal has always been known for its communal harmony and communal divide has no place here. We all are thankful to Hannan for setting up an example of brotherhood"" Bimal Sarkar president of the Kali Puja committee told The New Indian Express.



The farmer donated a portion of land measuring up to around 460 square feet to the committee. ""Every year residents used to be worried about BSF's green signal to organise the Kali Puja. I never had an idea that the Puja would not be held due to this land issue. So I decided to donate the part of my plot so that a permanent Kali temple can be constructed there"" said Hannan.

Villagers Laud The Decision

Welcoming the step Hindu villagers of Bhimpur said that the political parties who tried to play the religious card to get votes during the polls should take a lesson from this gesture of a poor farmer.



""We witnessed a never-seen-before attempt to polarise the voters on religious lines ahead of the Assembly elections. But Hannan's sacrifice makes it clear that such line of politics will not work in the state"" said a villager.



Before Assembly elections in West Bengal earlier this year there were attempts to divide voters along religious lines. Bhimpur residents where the Muslim farmer has donated a portion of his land for the temple say that this incident shows such tactics will not work in Bengal.

When Taranvir Johal and his friends launched their dining-made-easy app Tavolo in late 2019 Twin Cities restaurant owners and managers were hesitant to use it.

The app streamlines the dining process Johal said allowing people to make dinner reservations look through menus order food for pick-up or dining in and pay all in the same platform.

""You don't have to wait to sit down you don't have to wait to look at the menu and you don't have to wait for a check"" he said. ""You have control of everything at your fingertips at the restaurant.""

But when restaurants transitioned back to in-person dining after pandemic restrictions loosened they were looking for resources to help get customers back through the door Johal said.

Now over 50 restaurants in Minnesota and Wisconsin are on the app including Tandoor Indian Cuisine in Maple Grove.

""The restaurant industry had been historically pretty generic when it comes to talking to customers especially small business owners"" Johal said. ""Leveraging technology to improve the experience has been a slow aspect of the evolution of the restaurant industry as a whole.""

The restaurants are among a growing number of small businesses learning that technology can be crucial to meeting business goals especially now that there is a worker shortage.

Shari L. Gross Star Tribune

Brian McDonald district director of the Small Business Administration's Minnesota office said small business owners across Minnesota have adopted tech more widely during the pandemic. The apps and software help with operations online sales digital marketing communicating with clients and more.

Business increased over the last 18 months for Denamico which helps companies customize their websites and revenue operations on management software Hubspot said Kristin Dennewill co-founder and president. The consulting firm helps about 50 companies a year mostly in Minnesota in various industries including manufacturing and health care.

Facing labor shortages clients also needed assistance implementing automation technology to maintain production she said.

""There's a growing realization that revenue operations can be your competitive advantage but to do that you need to have [online] systems that are integrated"" she said. ""You have to be able to get the data you need for better decision making ultimately creating a better employee experience and customer experience. It's hard to be competitive in today's world if you're not doing these things well.""

The SBA's McDonald has particularly seen spiking interest in business owners learning how to use applications to improve their financial management. According to a study by U.S. Bank at least 82% of small businesses fail because of poor cash management.

Dionne Gumbs a former financial adviser is the creator of GenEqty a financial management web application for small business owners. Knowing most small business owners can't afford to hire a full-time chief financial officer or accountant she created the app to show small business owners in real time their inventory cash flow invoicing and supplier payment tracking to help them make better financial decisions.

By aggregating data from sales and bank accounts GenEqty produces a health score like a credit score but for a business Gumbs said.

The plan is to license the software to banks which would then offer it to their customers Gumbs said. She is building a pipeline of national and local financial partners that would use the software which will be launched first in the Twin Cities.

""We're not trying to replace accountants"" Gumbs said.

He died on Friday evening at the Bayview Hospital with his wife Mary-Ann Lady Williams and brother Ralph Bizzy Williams at his side according to relatives.

From humble origins as a plantation manager’s son and with a single earth-mover Sir Charles rose to become the nation’s largest private owner of land and the founder of C. O. Williams Construction.

Along the way COW Williams became a household name noted for his colourful personality plain speaking and often controversial opinions.

Educated at The Lodge School Cow Williams built the Williams Group of Companies with his younger brother Bizzy pioneering construction mining dairy farming horticulture agriculture housing electrical contracting and more.

His land developments mining and construction projects spread as far north as Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica. He also contributed heavily to road building and construction in St Lucia.

Among his premier developments are firsts in Barbadian real estate including the Millennium Heights gated community in St Thomas and the Port St Charles Marina in St Peter.

Many plantation acquisitions were diverted from sugar production to dairy farming and real estate development. His last major project was the Apes Hill Golf Club which included polo field and one-acre-size exclusive residential properties.

A major owner and champion racehorse breeder he also led the growth of organised polo in Barbados earning a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s oldest active polo player.

In an immediate response Prime Minister Mia Mottley declared it would be a gross understatement to say that Barbados has lost an entrepreneur extraordinaire with a hand in almost every facet of the country’s development and economic life who had an undying devotion to and love of country.

She said: “Sir Charles was passionate about Barbados C.O. Williams Construction the company he built from the ground up with his sweat and tears as well as the fact that in several islands of the region his motto ‘We move the earth to please’ is as familiar as it is in Barbados.

“But above all he was a unique man small in stature with a huge personality and presence that filled any room he entered. Barbados will certainly miss his vision his spirit his generosity and the very down-to-earth way he defended his country.”

The Barbadian leader suggested that whether or not one knew him personally or agreed with his stance on any particular topic there was no denying that Sir Charles did things his way.

Mottley continued: “Known across the region simply as “COW” he moved the earth to please with airports in the Bahamas and Bequia an oil terminal and highways in St. Lucia and a hydroelectric dam in Dominica. At home some of the most recognised development projects included Port St. Charles Marina Millennium Heights and Apes Hill golf and polo developments.”

The Prime Minister pointed out that while Sir Charles blazed a trail in construction property development and just about every aspect of farming at the same time building a formidable record of success in manufacturing the son of St. John was never afraid to speak his mind.

“When he felt it necessary he did not hesitate to take to the radio call-in programmes even when his intervention attracted strong criticism” Mottley recalled. “Never deterred until the very end he would lend his voice to the issue of the day — a feature that characterised his approach to his businesses as he only retired as Chairman of the C.O. Williams Group of Companies in December last year at the age of 88.”

Opposition Leader Bishop Joseph Atherley acknowledged Sir Charles as more than a builder of structures but also a significant contributor to the exercise of nation-building.

He said: “A landowner of some prominence he clearly understood the value of land as it relates to the matter of wealth creation. Clearly not only in the area of infrastructural development but in the vitally important business of agricultural production. Barbados stands indebted to him for providing for many families over many years by the creation of employment opportunities.

“Sir Charles Williams obviously was possessed of a sufficient confidence in our enterprise of nation-building as to invest significantly in our economy. His contribution to regional development in this regard is also to be hailed.”

He also commended the business icon for his “fair and frank” expression of opinion in matters under public debate.

The Peoples Party for Democracy and Development leader said: “There are some whose image of themselves is large and their presence loud in letting that be known. My impression of him was that on the spectrum of such things he was much closer to the point of humility and earthiness than haughtiness. His was a contribution to this country and its people worthy of our most generous salute.”

In his tribute prominent supermarket entrepreneur Andrew Bynoe said Sir Charles inspired him as a businessman.

Bynoe a 40-year veteran in the corporate community described the construction icon as a “worker and no-nonsense fellow”.

“He applauded those who themselves put in hard work. He was the first to say that he was not born with a gold spoon in his mouth. He did not hide his origins; and that was something that obviously inspired many other persons including business persons like myself” the Carlton and A1 Supermarkets managing director told Barbados TODAY.

Bynoe said it was with deep sadness that he joined with others to mourn Sir Charles’s death recognising what he stood for and what he achieved through hard work.

He also expressed condolences to his family.

Waste hauler and recycling entrepreneur Anderson “Fat Child” Cherry in extending “deepest” condolences to the Williams family in their moment of grief categorized Sir Charles as an asset to the development of Barbados and its well-being.

Cherry told Barbados TODAY: “I first met Sir Charles when I was 16 years old and now starting out in business. I remember going to his office seeking advice about the business world and being changed forever. The wisdom and mentorship he provided to me throughout my career has shaped me to be the man I am today.

“He was a mentor an icon and a visionary. A man with a heart of gold and a personality that loved life. He will be truly missed.”

Charles Othneil Williams was born on November 24 1932 at Ashford Plantation St John where his father worked as estate manager.

An early life-changing experience was witnessing his family’s eviction from the manager’s quarters when his father was dismissed.

In subsequent interviews he credited his life-long thirst for land ownership to his mother declaring that since acquiring a taste for land ownership he could not stop.

In 2020 he led the celebrations of his C.O. Williams Construction Company’s 60th anniversary. Beginning in 1960 with a single bulldozer he later credited early work from then Premier Errol Barrow for the awarding of contracts as the company moved from earthmover to building contractor to road builder.

Sir Charles was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2000 for his contribution to agriculture construction tourism and sports.

He is survived by his wife Mary-Anne Lady Williams sons Teddy and Stephen daughter Linda and younger brother Ralph Bizzy Williams himself a leading industrialist and entrepreneur.

DUBAI United Arab Emirates — Pop star Justin Bieber is facing growing calls to cancel his concert in Saudi Arabia next month as the fiancee of slain Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi joined a chorus of voices on Sunday urging him not to perform at the kingdom's Formula One race.

In an open letter published by The Washington Post Hatice Cengiz urged the Canadian megastar to cancel his Dec. 5 performance in the Red Sea city of Jiddah to ""send a powerful message to the world that your name and talent will not be used to restore the reputation of a regime that kills its critics.”

Bieber's concert is the most headline-grabbing performance scheduled for the race in Jiddah though other F1 concert performers include rapper A$AP Rocky DJs David Guetta and Tiesto and singer Jason Derulo.

It is not the first time a pop star has faced pressure to pull out of a concert in Saudi Arabia. Mariah Carey was the biggest-name performer to hit the stage in Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi's killing by Saudi agents in Turkey in October 2018. She brushed off calls to boycott the show.

Public pressure however prompted Nicki Minaj in 2019 to cancel her appearance on stage at a concert in Jiddah telling The Associated Press at the time she wanted to show support for women’s rights gay rights and freedom of expression.

Khashoggi's stunning killing in 2018 was carried out by members of a team of 15 Saudi government agents who'd been sent to Istanbul where the writer and former government spokesman had an appointment at the Saudi consulate for documents needed to marry Cengiz. She waited from him outside the consulate but he never walked out. His body was never found.

The killing by agents who worked for the crown prince drew international gasps and cast a shadow over Prince Mohammed whose reputation never fully recovered. Prince Mohammed has maintained he had no prior knowledge of the operation that killed Khashoggi. A U.S. intelligence assessment made public under President Joe Biden however determined the crown prince approved the operation.

""Please know that your invitation to participate in a concert in Jiddah comes directly from MBS as the crown prince is known"" Cengiz wrote in her open letter to Bieber. “Nothing of significance happens in Saudi Arabia without his consent and certainly not an event as important and flashy as this.""

Bieber's concert in Saudi Arabia comes shortly before he opens a world tour in February that was rescheduled from 2020 due to the pandemic.

In the time since Saudi Arabia's state-owned sovereign wealth fund — steered by Prince Mohammed — scooped up shares in Live Nation the company that owns Ticketmaster and promotes concerts for Bieber and other major stars. As Live Nation's shares plummeted last year during COVID-19 lockdowns and the cancellation of thousands of shows the Public Investment Fund bought $500 million worth of shares in the battered company.

Public filings show the Saudi wealth fund is now the second largest institutional holder in Live Nation with a stake worth some $1.4 billion.

Human Rights Watch has also called on Bieber and the other performers to pull out of the F1 concerts in Saudi Arabia saying these events are aimed at “sportwashing” by diverting attention and deflecting scrutiny from Saudi Arabia's human rights record.

Saudi youth are the main attendees of these concerts enjoying the country's newfound social changes that allow for music and gender mixing. The kingdom's General Sports Authority argues that sports is a tool for social change within the kingdom.

Next month's F1 race will be the first time Saudi Arabia hosts the premier sporting event though the kingdom has hosted the lesser known Formula-E race in past years in an effort to raise the country's profile as a tourist destination.

At the time of Khashoggi's killing the crown prince was being lauded for ushering in social reforms transforming life for many inside the country. Khashoggi had been writing columns for The Washington Post criticizing the crown prince’s brash foreign policy moves and simultaneous crackdown on activists and perceived critics including women’s rights activists writers clerics and economists.

Saudi Arabia held a trial for some of those involved in his killing sentencing five to death before sparing them of execution.

The pop star is due to perform at the iconic F1 race on December 5th in the Saudi city of Jeddah.

In an article at the Washington Post Hatice Cengiz penned a letter to Bieber saying his invitation to Jeddah “comes directly from [Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman – MBS]”.

She continued: “Do not sing for the murderers of my beloved Jamal. Please speak out and condemn his killer Mohammed bin Salman. Your voice will be heard by millions.”

“If you refuse to be a pawn of MBS your message will be loud and clear: I do not perform for dictators. I choose justice and freedom over money.”

She went on to cite Bieber’s recent message to his followers where he said: “I want to use the platform I have to remind people that racism is evil and it is ingrained in our culture” and said he should use his platform to support the cause of human rights in Saudi.

“All forms of oppression are evil no matter where they occur” she said.

Khashoggi was murdered on October 2 2019. He entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and never emerged.

It has been alleged by multiple sources including a CIA report that MBS personally ordered the execution of Khashoggi for his vocal opposition to the regime.

His body has never been recovered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvaGF3YWlpYW4tY29sdW1uaXN0LXNheXMtaXRzLW5vLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1pcy1raWNraW5nLW91ci1va29sZS0yNDgzMjI0L9IBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvaGF3YWlpYW4tY29sdW1uaXN0LXNheXMtaXRzLW5vLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1pcy1raWNraW5nLW91ci1va29sZS0yNDgzMjI0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaiian columnist says it’s no competition: ‘Las Vegas is kicking our okole’,"The Honolulu Star-Advertiser’s Stephen Tsai says “McCarran International Airport makes ours look like the airport on ‘Wings.’”

Whenever Las Vegans start feeling sorry for themselves over blown tourism opportunities they should take a look at a column from a Hawaii-based journalist who thinks our city lapped the island paradise long ago.

“Las Vegas is kicking our okole.”

You don’t have to know any Polynesian dialects to guess what that means.

Honolulu Star-Advertiser sportswriter Stephen Tsai was in town this month to cover UNLV’s surprising 27-13 football win over the University of Hawaii at Allegiant Stadium. After wrapping up his sports coverage Tsai wrote a column on what Las Vegas has that Hawaii doesn’t and why Southern Nevada is a tourism destination that’ll never be caught by rival destinations.

Locals do their fair share of whining about what could be better here. I hear the rants all the time.

Our mask mandates are killing off tourism. No they’re making the fun safer for visitors and workers during a killer pandemic.

The casinos are too tight. Nevada’s gaming industry is setting revenue records every month and customers — tourists and locals — don’t seem to be shying away from trying their luck at our games of chance.

Resort hotel rooms cost too much. Las Vegas’ room rates rise and fall just like they do in Hawaii based on supply and demand. People come to get away and often want to splurge on vacation. Las Vegas offers plenty of ways to do that but has value options and is often much cheaper than other locations including Hawaii.

The public was hornswoggled into paying $750 million in room-tax money to help build $2 billion Allegiant Stadium. This investment is starting to pay dividends with full crowds for major events that bring thousands of people to Las Vegas to see everything from Raiders games to Garth Brooks and Rolling Stones concerts.

The city’s tourism picture will only get better as international flights and conventions come back. The reality is our island in the desert is much more suited to visitors than those islands in the Pacific Ocean.

Check out some of these snippets about Las Vegas from Tsai’s writing:

■ “Everything is bigger and way better in the desert. McCarran International Airport makes ours look like the airport on ‘Wings.’ McCarran has video poker and slot machines; HNL does not sell gum.”

— “Vegas has the Raiders Golden Knights Max Holloway fights and your high school class reunion and birth-year celebration. It is a city that is fun welcoming and inclusive. My father-in-law is crabbier than Tamatoa. He refers to me as TJ (‘that jackass’). But mention ‘Vegas’ and he salivates like Pavlov’s dog.”

— “Vegas has even made the most of what used to be a Hawaii staple. Tickets go on sale to the general public today for the 2022 Pro Bowl. Prices range from $66 to $435 before taxes and fees. There is a deluxe package beginning at $1995 a person that includes stays at Resorts World pregame hospitality a behind-the-scenes experience and a meet-and-greet with an ‘NFL legend.’ Maybe Kenny Mayne will be there too.”

It’s true that Las Vegas successfully took the Pro Bowl away from Aloha Stadium a move that could rejuvenate a meaningless underattended game because it’s being played here and not there. Even the players like the change of venue.

Tsai suggested that maybe Hawaii should legalize gambling as a start to becoming a more appealing destination. Hey why not? Forty-seven other states have tried that and it only seems to make Las Vegas stronger.

Last week more than 100 readers had weighed in on Tsai’s column with comments ranging from agreement to not wanting Hawaii to become the next Las Vegas.

Our city’s tourism infrastructure continues to grow and be reinvented and expanded for the next generation of tourists.

It shouldn’t be lost that some of Las Vegas’ best customers come from Hawaii. They don’t call Las Vegas the ninth island for nothing. Boyd Gaming Corp. has been dialed into that for years drawing thousands of Hawaiians to the resorts it operates in downtown Las Vegas.

And what did the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority think about Tsai’s musings?

“We are completely flattered” said Lori Nelson-Kraft senior vice president of communications for the LVCVA.

“Mr. Tsai’s comparison of our two destinations truly underscores what we’ve long believed makes us one of the world’s most desirable travel destinations” she said. “Only in Vegas can you enjoy nonstop action live entertainment innovative experiences attractions and some of the world’s premier and most fascinating resorts and casinos.”

Efforts to reach tourism leaders in Hawaii last week were unsuccessful.

In a Washington Post op-ed article the fiancée of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi called on Justin Bieber to cancel his scheduled concert in Saudi Arabia.

""This is a unique opportunity to send a powerful message to the world that your name and talent will not be used to restore the reputation of a regime that kills its critics"" Hatice Cengiz wrote.

Bieber is scheduled to perform at the Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix 2021 on December 5.

In February of this year the Biden administration released declassified documents that implicated Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Khashoggi's killing.

In her letter Cengiz told Bieber his invitation came directly from the crown prince.

""Nothing of significance happens in Saudi Arabia without his consent and certainly not an event as important and flashy as this"" she wrote. ""Your face is even featured on the event's website with his — the executioner of my fiance Jamal.""

Bieber's manager Scooter Braun did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.

XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vbWlubmVzb3RhaG9ja2V5bWFnLmNvbS93aWxkLXBsYXlpbmctdGhlLXJpZ2h0LXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild playing the ‘right way’,"Playing hockey “the right way.” That’s what Minnesota Wild coach Dean Evason talked about after his team’s 7-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Nov. 18 at Xcel Energy Center. On the scoresheet and visually on the ice it looked like a much better effort than the Wild offered in a 4-1 loss to San Jose two nights earlier on home ice.

“We loved how we responded” Evason said Thursday. “It’s great to get seven goals but we did it the right way. We played team-first. We weren’t extending our shifts. We weren’t individually trying to score. We were scoring the right way.”

Sixteen games into the season the Wild (11-5-0) have played the right way more often than not. They’ve been in first place or close to it consistently in the Central Division. They’ve won 11 games starting the year with a four-game winning streak before adding another four-gamer to start the month of November.

Seven of their first eight victories were considered comebacks with thrilling sequences of last-minute last-second goals in regulation to help the Wild to a perfect 4-0 overtime/shootout record. The Wild’s longest losing streak so far sits at two games both 4-1 margins coming in their inaugural visit to Seattle and then in Colorado.

A lot of things have gone the Wild’s way so far this year. What’s really noticeable is the overall depth of the team. Perhaps no game was better evidence than the win over the Stars (6-7-2) which is also not too surprising in a game with seven goals for one team.

But it wasn’t like the Wild got a hat trick from Kirill Kaprizov two goals from Kevin Fiala or even the majority of points from a dominant top line. No the Wild celebrated seven different goal scorers on the ice from rookies to veterans. All four lines produced scoring. Marcus Foligno was the only forward who didn’t register a point.

“We’re a great team all over” said forward Mats Zuccarello. “Any line can score any game.”

Rem Pitlick fresh off his natural hat trick Nov. 13 in Seattle opened the scoring midway through the first period as he skated around the zone before elevating his shot from the top of the circles. Then Kaprizov made it 2-0 by the end of the first period with an easy open-net shot on the backdoor with a slick pass from Zuccarello.

That goal started a career-high four-point night for Kaprizov who added three assists by the time the night was over. None was more exciting to watch than his pass to Frederick Gaudreau who waited out in front of the net as Kaprizov was behind the net facing the glass and spun a behind-the-back pass to his teammate for the 5-1 lead in the third period.

“You have to know that even though it doesn’t seem like he sees you there’s good chances that he knows where you are” Gaudreau said. “I just was ready on that (goal). … I was pretty sure he knew where I was.”

Kaprizov is the fourth Wild played in the past 15 years to record a four-point game at age 24 or younger according to NHL Public Relations. Matt Dumba Guillaume Latendresse and Pierre-Marc Bouchard were the others.

Evason shook up the lines for Thursday putting Kaprizov on the third line with Gaudreau and reunited him with center Victor Rask. Kaprizov has been a target of some criticism from fans early this season for his lack of production in the goals column. He went goalless for the first eight games though he still contributed assists.

But after waiting all summer before signing his five-year $45 million contract it seemed to come with some superstar-like expectations from a fanbase that was dazzled by his play in his first (partial) NHL season last winter. He’s had a few rough games this season sometimes not even being that noticeable. Tuesday against the Sharks he had no points and was a minus-2. He still leads the team in points (15) and assists (11) after Thursday.

When he’s on his game however he’s one of the best and most fun players to watch.

“I just try to play hockey just try to play my game and do the best I could every single night” said Kaprizov through an interpreter.

Kaprizov and Zuccarello were split up on the lines for the most part against the Stars. But they were reunited briefly following penalty kills and it worked out. Zuccarello praised Kaprizov’s overall effort and play despite criticism that he’s not scoring enough.

“I think sometimes you have to see beyond the goals and assists and see what he creates and how hard he works for our team” Zuccarello said.

Only a minute and 1 second into the second period the Wild took a 3-0 lead on Ryan Hartman’s team-leading eighth goal of the season when he jammed home a rebound on Goligoski’s wrap-around attempt. Goligoski had quite the night facing his former team. When the Stars made it a 3-1 game in the third period Goligoski responded a few minutes later with his first goal in a Wild sweater a shot from the point through traffic.

Goligoski had a three-point night with his pair of assists. He’s feeling more comfortable with his new team this season.

“It can take a little while” Goligoski said. “New team. You play for the same coach for the past four years so it’s a little different system and just chemistry with guys where to put pucks. Everyone’s different.

“I felt good.”

Zuccarello made it 6-2 only 29 seconds after a Jamie Benn goal cut into the deficit again. Then 45 seconds later Rask back in action after being scratched for four games found a bouncing puck in front for the Wild’s seventh goal of the game a season-high.

Getting him back in the lineup Evason was pleased with Rask’s effort and urgency.

“It’s great to get points obviously” Evason said. “And it’s great that we scored some goals. But we saw a lot of people play the right way. Rasky played with urgency got up and down the ice checked very well.”

What’s so encouraging about the good position the Wild have put themselves in and the depth they possess is that there’s still plenty of potential for more production and more improvement. There’ll be room for that as the team heads out for a three-game road trip ahead of Thanksgiving that unofficial benchmark where NHL teams inside the playoff picture at Turkey Day often make the postseason in the spring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vZHJ5ZGVud2lyZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYXZpZC1tZXJ0ei_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Mertz | Obituaries,"David (Dave) Wayne Mertz 69 of Deer Park Wisconsin passed away from his battle with cancer on Sunday November 14 2021 at Westfields Hospital in New Richmond Wisconsin.

The Granby Zoo east of Montreal says it is hoping in the coming weeks or months to vaccinate against COVID-19 about 90 animals including gorillas big cats and other creatures deemed susceptible to the disease. The vaccines are in the United States awaiting clearance to Canada.

""Hopefully we can start at least a few species by Christmas. I'm crossing my fingers for that"" Émilie Couture a veterinarian with the zoo said in a recent interview.

She said the zoo is planning to vaccinate the species that appear to be the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Primates and big cats such as tigers jaguars and leopards top the list she said adding that the zoo is also including some other mammals such as red pandas.

There has been a ""worrying"" rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in North American zoos especially among large felines such as lions and leopards Couture said. Last week three snow leopards died at the Lincoln Children's Zoo in Nebraska of complications from COVID-19 — an event that she said shocked the North American zoo community.

""Contrary to the first reports of disease early in the pandemic with the large felids where they seem to have some respiratory signs but eventually recovered without significant disease there is actually more severe diseases leading to death even if institutions housing and caring for these animals already had biosecurity measures in place"" Couture said.

Many scientists believe that like in humans the more contagious Delta variant is to blame for the rise in cases and severe disease she added.

The vaccines are manufactured by U.S. veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis which began offering them to American zoos this summer. The company has offered to donate approximately 900 doses — enough for 450 animals — to six Canadian zoos.

In a statement Zoetis said its vaccines were specifically developed and formulated for animals and that like those destined for humans they are meant to be given in two doses several weeks apart.

The next step is getting the vaccines across the border which could still take weeks or months. Because the vaccine is not commercially available Zoetis said it's applying for experimental use authorization with the Canadian Centre for Veterinary Biologics and with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Couture said none of the animals at the Granby Zoo have developed symptoms of COVID-19 that would necessitate a test. Nevertheless she said the zoo has taken steps throughout the pandemic to protect the animals including increased cleaning cutting out backstage visits reducing hands-on interactions and requiring handlers to wash their hands and wear masks.

Couture said humans appear to pose the biggest threat to animals when it comes to spreading COVID-19. So far there isn't direct evidence of zoo animals infecting their handlers she said.

""The only source of infection for [the animals] would be if an asymptomatic human would be taking care of them"" she said.

The Toronto and Calgary zoos both said they would also be vaccinating their animals once a shot becomes available. Toronto added that about 140 of its animals would be eligible including primates big cats and swine.

Both like Granby are waiting for the Zoetis vaccine since no Canadian companies are offering a shot designed for animals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9mYXJtaW5nL3Rha2luZy1jYXJlLW9mLXVkZGVyLWhlYWx0aC1pbi1jb3dzLTM2MjQ3OTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taking care of udder health in cows,"Scientists agree that a dairy cow without a healthy udder will give a farmer less milk. This is simply because the objective of the farmer keeping a cow is to get milk and the part of the cow that gives them milk is the udder.

According to Dr Brian Arinaitwe of Zoetis an animal health company that develops and manufactures veterinary vaccines and medicines diagnostic products genetic tests and bio devices among others farmers need to be cautious of the cow udder health.

“Farmers need to ensure that the cow’s udder is healthy. A sick udder is what we call mastitis” he says.

But he is concerned that most farmers are not aware since they do not screen their cows. But he says that out of the 10 cows they have screened six come out positive.

Mastitis according to Dr Arinaitwe can be avoided by keeping the environment clean hygienic milking conditions and constantly screening for mastitis. They can screen by observing the udder blood clots in the milk. This in most cases is clinical mastitis. But there are other forms that cannot be observed physically.

Significance

Mastitis is one of the most significant diseases of dairy cattle according to Dr Brian Arinaitwe of Zoetis.

He says that most cow herds are faced with a challenge of mastitis which can affect farm earnings. He says mastitis reduces milk production and milk quality. Dr Arinaitwe says that mastitis causes farmers substantial economic losses. He says an average clinical case of mastitis costs the dairy producer approximately Shs700000 in management explaining that this is among the top three reasons why farmers cull dairy cows.

In addition mastitis adversely affects reproductive performance of dairy cows. On average he says it takes 40 days longer to get cows pregnant that have had a case of mastitis compared to herd mates. He says that treatment of clinical cases not only costs the producer it also increases the risk of antibiotic residue.

“The milk may be rejected by buyers as it does not have a good taste” Dr Arinaitwe says.

Mastitis is an infectious disease condition resulting in an inflammatory reaction in the mammary gland of the cow.

On average he says if a cow is giving you 20 litres in a year you can lose up to Shs600000 in mastitis.

He says that it is the most common disease in dairy cattle ranging from mild conditions to severe conditions due to increased inflammatory cells (somatic cells) in the milk which affects gross changes in the milk. Mastitis may be accompanied by signs of inflammation in the mammary gland including swelling redness and painfulness. In severe cases he says signs including fever depression and “off-feed” and even death may occur.



Mastitis-causing pathogens include bacteria and Mycoplasmas. According to Arinaitwe there is contagious mastitis which is transmitted from cow to cow during the milking process; and environmental infections which are acquired from bacteria in the environment of the cow.

Symptoms

In subclinical mastitis Dr Arinaitwe says the milk appears normal and there is no visible sign of inflammation of the mammary gland. Diagnosis of subclinical mastitis will be made on the basis on an increase in somatic cell counts in the milk. In clinical mastitis depending on the type of pathogens involved fever and depression could be associated with the disease. By observation there is evidence of mammary gland inflammation such as redness heat swelling and pain. He adds that there are physical changes in the milk with a few milk clots.

In the case of acute mastitis clinical signs include fever depression and loss of appetite. The udder is swollen hard and painful while the milk may contain clots and can be watery.

Early in the disease the gland is red swollen and warm but within a few hours the teat becomes cold. In severe cases it can lead to death.

Prevention and treatment

Dr Arinaitwe says that control of mastitis is based on prevention of infections. The recommended practices include proper use of milking machines pre- and post-milking teat disinfection dry cow therapy at the end of lactation use of teat sealants culling of cows with chronic mastitis and vaccination to prevent infections.

For mild to moderate cases of mastitis the preferred route of treatment is with an intra-mammary mastitis tube. He says that the antibiotics in mastitis tubes kill the bacteria that are exposed to adequate concentrations of antibiotic.



For cows with severe clinical mastitis an appropriate antibiotic should be part of the therapy. But the starting point is the CMT test a screening test before milking which enables farmers to identify the cows that are at risk. The CMT bottle can be bought at Shs100000 and can be used for more than six months on 20 cows.

“This helps you to avoid mixing milk from infected cows before you take it to the dairy because first of all this milk will be rejected. Even when they make products such as cheese or yoghurt they will not be nice products. It also helps you to intervene early enough before it can lead to further losses” he says. Dr Arinaitwe explains that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to mastitis treatment.

“Explore options for flexible mastitis treatment that not only knock out physical mastitis symptoms but also eliminate mastitis-causing bacteria to achieve a bacteriological cure. When you achieve a bacteriological cure the first time you limit the need for re-treatment and using additional antibiotics. This is important for the health of your cows as well as critical for your dairy’s bottom line” he says.",,,,,,,,,
